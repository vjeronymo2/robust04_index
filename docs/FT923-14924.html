			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Books: Marathon life of a defiant exile - The career of the Bloomsburyite who got away THE INTERIOR CASTLE: A LIFE OF GERALD BRENAN by Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 25, 660 pages THE STORY so far, just in case you have forgotten the details: Carrington loved Lytton. Lytton, while tolerating Carrington, loved Ralph. Ralph loved Carrington. In order to remain close to Lytton, Carrington agreed to marry Ralph without being in love with him. Gerald was Ralph's greatest friend after Lytton and like Ralph had fought bravely at the Front in the world war. Ralph, Gerald and Carrington were in a situation similar to that of Jules et Jim and Jeanne Moreau in the film. Their triangle exploded and all but ended the friendship between the two men when Ralph discovered Gerald had been making love to Carrington. Then Lytton died aged 52 in 1932. Carrington, inconsolable, committed suicide as she had threatened. Ralph married Frances, and Gerald went to Yegen in Spain, in the remote then almost inaccessible Alpujarra. He fathered a child, Miranda, by a 15-year-old Spanish peasant-girl, Juanita. Then Gerald married Gamel Woolsey, a southern belle with poetic ambitions, who had settled in England and had become the mistress of Llewelyn Powys. She now went to Spain with Gerald. Gamel and Gerald brought up Miranda as their daughter, sent her to boarding school, and then . . . But hold on. I am starting to anticipate Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy's highly readable, splendidly complete, marathon life of Gerald Brenan in which these entanglements, some much written about already, starting with Michael Holroyd's life of Lytton Strachey, are seen from a fresh, revealing angle - that of Gerald. From the earlier biographies you might have concluded that Gerald had played only a minor role in the Lytton/Carrington story, but it now becomes clearer than ever before just how crucial his part was. Gerald was formidably equipped with literary gifts that were slow to mature alongside a combative nature. Throughout his long life he had close friendships with, and influenced, many clever people of later generations as well as making, through his books, a significant contribution to British understanding of Spain. In all Gerald presents a testing challenge to a biographer, and it is one to which Gathorne-Hardy has risen energetically. The contrast with Lytton, with whom Gerald is sometimes compared on the ground that he did for Spanish literature what Lytton had done in England for French, is extreme. To begin, Gerald lived 40 years longer than Lytton. He died in 1987, just short of his 93rd birthday. Again, Lytton, a homosexual Bloomsbury guru, was by temperament a Cambridge intellectual, an Apostle, a stay-at-home with a Gallic vision - the one occasion when he was persuaded to venture abroad to visit Gerald, described in Gerald's masterpiece, South From Granada, was a near-disaster. By contrast, Gerald managed to combine the life of the mind with a life of adventure and travel. His military father insisted he took the Sandhurst entrance examination after Radley. But Gerald avoided going there by making his first and greatest escape. He left home abruptly one morning aged 18 and set off on a walk across Europe with a friend, Hope-Johnstone, his earliest mentor. It was a crazy thing to do, but it set the pattern of his life, one of defiant exile. Then and later, it was, financially, a precarious existence subsidised by borrowing and spongeing. Gerald persuaded a rich aunt to make him a regular allowance on which he lived for many years. In 1914 he joined the army he had so recently avoided. He became an infantry officer, an observer on the Somme, and was awarded the Military Cross. It was the only time Gerald had a regular job. After the first war Gerald's life divides into long periods of residence in Spain broken by short periods of return to rural England. Gerald spent most of his life pursuing women while simultaneously educating himself by reading voraciously in various literatures. He always wanted to be a poet and continued to write poetry into old age. He was at the same time full of plans for prose-books, novels, biographies and cultural histories, some of which took years to mature, others were half-written and jettisoned. The fact that he did not publish much till late in life - his reputation as a writer was only really secure in 1951 after the appearance of The Literature of the Spanish People - means that Gathorne-Hardy is able to concentrate on the inner man for long stretches. As his title, The Interior Castle, implies, Gerald pulled up the drawbridge on his true self even more firmly than most writers, and Gathorne-Hardy ruthlessly prises it open. The attachment to women began early in classic public school style with an infant pass at his Nanny. Gathorne-Hardy published an authoritative history of the Nanny in 1972 and therefore deserves to be heeded when he claims it may have been a voyage of discovery in bed with his Nanny that started Gerald off on a long series of attachments to women of the lower classes. At any rate, childhood left Gerald with a strong voyeur instinct that he went to excessive lengths to satisfy in later life, taking a powerful telescope with him on his country rambles. Confession of sexual longings as well as of impotence are a feature of the innumerable letters he wrote to friends like Ralph and Frances Partridge, David Garnett, Sir Victor Pritchett. Gathorne-Hardy suggests that it may ultimately be as a letter-writer that Gerald will be best remembered. Fortunately the marriage to Gamel, both of them writing and translating in their Spanish home near Malaga, worked well for many years. They were there when the Civil War started. In an effort to understand what was happening Gerald then began work on one of his finest books, The Spanish Labyrinth. Gerald's sexual drive lasted well into old age. He developed a brief - unfulfilled - incestuous passion for his daughter Miranda. After she was whisked away and safely married to a French doctor, Gerald suffered another seismic sexual upheaval through the appearance of a new-generation Carrington, Joanna, daughter of Carrington's brother Noel. After she had left, he installed other girl-friends to help him with his work, to the chagrin of Gamel. Shortly after her horrific death from cancer we find Gerald, now a chirpy 74, setting up house with Lynda, a pretty woman in her late twenties, with whom he is writing a biography of St John of the Cross. She continues to be his companion and minder for the next 16 years, even after her own marriage. We have here an account of a household consisting of her, her Swedish artist-husband Lars, her two children and Gerald, a menage as extraordinary in its way as anything chez Lytton and Carrington. We also have some pleasant close-ups during this period of Gerald delighting his friends in bookish talk, vying with the likes of Cyril Connolly. Gathorne-Hardy himself enters the picture at this point as a welcome guest of Gerald and Lynda's. But these occasional personal memories, often confined to footnotes of which Gathorne-Hardy is obsessionally fond, do not impair the writer's detachment in this rich portrait of a maddeningly devious, brilliantly courageous, literary man.</p>

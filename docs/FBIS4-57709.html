			<p>BFN     [Text] In the final stretch of the election for a new  president, the opinion polls are at their highest. The most  likely candidates go up and down in the polls these days. The  differences between them are minimal. Technically, there is a  tie between Ernesto Samper and Andres Pastrana.    This station's opinion poll caused a surprise because it is  the only one of five in which Pastrana is ahead of Samper.  According to the poll, the conservative candidate has 47 percent  of the vote while the liberal candidate has 42 percent. Today's  poll is to be added to those of a few days ago, which report  more and more contradictory results. On Thursday the National  Consultation Center reported that Samper led Pastrana with 47  percent of the vote and that Pastrana had 40 percent of the vote.    EL TIEMPO yesterday reported to the National Consultation  Center another poll, according to which Samper leads Pastrana by  five points. EL ESPECTADOR, based on a Napoleon Franco poll,  today put Pastrana at 38 percent and Samper at 43 percent. EL  ESPECTADOR also reports that Antonio Navarro has progressed to 8  percent and Miguel Maza to 4 percent.    During this up and down movement in the polls, which had not  occurred in previous campaigns, the only truly clear fact is  that no one has 50 percent of the vote. In other words, the only  clear fact so far is that there will be a runoff election.</p>

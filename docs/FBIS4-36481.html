			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by On Levi] </F>   [Text] Without an additional allocation of 300 million  shekels, it will be impossible to complete the Gaza Strip  fencing work. Senior defense establishment officials said this  yesterday in a special meeting held in the defense minister's  bureau attended by the prime minister and finance minister.  According to the security officials, the lack of funds prevents  progress in the work and approval for the additional funds is  essential now. The discussion was not completed yesterday;  treasury officials are slated to give their reply early next  week.    In a special session convened in Rabin's bureau in Tel Aviv,  the heads of the defense establishment -- Chief of Staff Baraq,  Defense Ministry Director General David 'Ivri, and Brigadier  General Mikha'el Navon, the chief of staff's financial adviser  -- presented their additional budgetary requests to Finance  Minister Shohat, Budget Department head David Brodet, and  Accountant-General Re'uven Kokolevich. Senior defense  establishment sources say the sum required is approximately 300  million shekels, stemming from the high costs of Operation  Rainbow -- the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] redeployment plan in  Gaza and Jericho. So far, the defense establishment has  received an additional allocation of 200 million shekels, based  on the understanding that there will be no more financial  requests for the redeployment. The costs of Operation Rainbow,  however, have grown immensely, and now an additional 300 million  shekels are necessary for financing additional portions of the  fence surrounding the Qatif Bloc settlements and the fence  surrounding the Gaza Strip.    The participants did not enter details concerning the  additional budget required, but rather presented it in general  terms. Rabin and Shohat agreed that joint Defense Ministry and  Finance Ministry teams review the defense establishment's  request over the next few days and will submit their conclusions  early next week.</p>

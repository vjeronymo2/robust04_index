			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Close seeks funds for purchase CLOSE BROTHERS yesterday embarked on its first cash call as it sought funds for the Pounds 19m acquisition of Winterflood Securities, the small companies marketmaker. The merchant bank announced a placing and a 1-for-7 open offer of 5.5m shares at 315p. This will raise Pounds 17.3m towards the acquisition of Union Discount's 90.5 per cent stake in Winterflood and Pounds 3m in debt. Close shares rose 4p to 344p. Winterflood's management, led by Mr Brian Winterflood who set up the business in 1988, will be granted incentives as part of the purchase agreement. These include options over 15 per cent of the marketmaker - which could bring management's stake to almost 25 per cent - and 5 per cent of Winterflood's profits up to Pounds 5m. Mr Winterflood said the firm would be run as it always had been - 'with no interference from big brother'. He has plans to expand the business organically and through expansion in the jobbing sector. Mr Peter Winkworth, an executive director of Close, said Winterflood would be a 'very good strategic fit'. Close also reported a 6.7 per cent advance in pre-tax profits to Pounds 6.8m for the six months to end-January. The interim dividend is increased in line with profits from 3p to 3.2p. Earnings per share rose from 11.56p to 11.91p. The loan book was ahead 3 per cent at Pounds 285m.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Helio Contreras: "PT Promises To Modernize Armed </F> Forces"; introductory paragraphs in italics as published]    [Text] The PT [Workers Party] has a plan for the  Armed Forces that provides a budget capable of preventing  obsolescence in the military institutions and advocates the  establishment of a Ministry of Defense following studies  involving the participation of admirals and Army and Air Force  generals. The plan's author, Colonel Geraldo Cavagnari, told  CORREIO BRAZILIENSE yesterday that the Calha Norte program for  occupying the Amazon border region and strengthening activities  in that area by the government's civilian authorities would  continue if the PT's candidate, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, was  elected president of the republic in the elections on 3 October.    The plan for the defense sector was requested of  Cavagnari by the PT's Office for Coordination of the Program. It  has already been submitted to Lula and will be approved at the  party's next national meeting, which will be held in Brasilia in  April. The director of the Strategic Studies Group at Unicamp  [Campinas State University] says that the portion of the  military budget earmarked for modernizing the military  institutions will have to total at least 2 percent of GDP [gross  domestic product]. Currently, it is 0.6 percent. But he admitted  that "everything will depend on the needs of other sectors."  <H5>  Navy To Defend Entire Coast </H5>   The author of the PT's plan for the Armed Forces, Col.  Geraldo Cavagnari, calls for modernizing the Navy "to ensure  that the Navy has what it needs to operate in defense of the  coast." According to Cavagnari, "that modernization process  may--eventually--make the Navy really capable of operating in  blue water to defend a number of national interests in the South  Atlantic."    In Cavagnari's view, "there must be continuity in the Navy's  nuclear program so that in the 21st century, it will have  nuclear-powered submarines giving it a greater range along the  Brazilian coast." The colonel said that "nuclear-powered  submarines will be vital if the Navy is to make it difficult for  the sea to be used by any country acting contrary to national  interests in the vicinity of the Brazilian coast."    In Cavagnari's estimation, nuclear-powered submarines "must  be seen as a defense weapon, which is how the Brazilian Navy  itself views them, and not as an attack weapon."    The author of the PT's defense proposal also emphasized  another submarine-related matter: the submarines must not be  armed with ballistic missiles (strategic missiles with a range  exceeding 500 kilometers) carrying either conventional or  nuclear warheads (payloads), another point on which the Navy  agrees.  <H5>  Army Must Improve Strategy </H5>   The essential thing for the Army, according to Col.  Cavagnari's evaluation, is "to increase its tactical and  strategic mobility." He explained that tactics "involve the  speed of movement in a theater of operations and require  equipping the Army with armor and helicopters so that it can  move faster."    Strategy will enable the Army to reach the area where a  defense problem exists in the shortest time possible. To do  that, it will have to have the means required for that mobility.  Those means can be aircraft as well as transport ships.    Since the financial limitations will probably persist for  the  next four years, the director of the Strategic Studies Group at  Unicamp said that "the ground forces will therefore have to be  organized in such a way that they will be located near strategic  areas."    Col. Cavagnari said that "although there are no external  threats to Brazilian sovereignty in the Amazon Region, military  presence in the area is necessary because it constitutes 60  percent of the national territory and is practically unexplored,  besides which it has several problems requiring a solution."    The former instructor at the Army Command and Staff School  (ECEME), who was also an officer in the Army General Staff's  Department of Strategy, said that there must be continuity in  reequipping Army units.  <H5>  Air Force To Get More Aircraft </H5>   In Col. Cavagnari's opinion, the Air Force "will have to be  in a position to monitor and defend the airspace." Interception  capability will continue to be located in the most sensitive  areas of the national territory: population centers, industrial  centers, and so on. The FAB [Brazilian Air Force] is to receive  the entire quota of AMX aircraft called for in the  Italian-Brazilian agreement. That number is 54, but the FAB has  received only 20 aircraft.    During the four years of the next administration, new  aircraft may be acquired to improve the FAB's ability to defend  the airspace, a mission it currently performs with Mirages and  F-5's acquired in the 1970's. Those two aircraft are no longer  produced by France and the United States.    Cavagnari supports continuity in the Brazilian Space  Program,  which will guarantee "mastery of the technology for strategic  medium-range ballistic missiles, among other technological  advances." According to the Unicamp strategist, that missile  will probably not have a range of more than 1,500 km.    He mentioned the Complete Space Mission, which has already  made it possible to launch a satellite, designed by the National  Space Research Institute (INPE), for collecting earth data (of  ecological interest). Brazil may soon be able to launch  satellites using its own Satellite Launch Vehicle (VLS). The  INPE satellite was placed in orbit using an American rocket.</p>

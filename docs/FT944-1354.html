			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Kuwait is offered Pounds 1.5bn for property company A Pounds 1.5bn offer to buy the St Martins Property group, the leading property business owned by the Kuwaiti government, has been made by Barings, the London merchant bank, on behalf of an investment consortium. St Martins owns some of London's most valuable property, including the strip on the south bank of the Thames known as London Bridge City. Only half of that site has been developed. It also owns other prime developments, such as the City headquarters of the Kuwait Investment Organisation, the Kuwaiti government's international investment arm, and offices, retail developments and industrial units in the UK and on the Continent. The bid is the most dramatic indication to date that investor confidence in the property sector may be returning. Although property prices have recovered from their lows of two years ago, the share prices of leading property companies have performed much worse than the market average this year. Barings has yet to receive an official response from the Kuwaiti government but a senior official last night appeared hostile to the proposed sale. Dr Yousef Al-Awadi, general manager of the KIO, said the government was not soliciting offers: 'As far as we are concerned, it is not for sale,' he added. The offer was made late last month at a meeting in Kuwait between Barings, accompanied by the London arm of French bank Credit Lyonnais, and Mr Ali Rashid Al-Badr, who is in charge of the Kuwaiti government's investments. It was repeated in a fax sent just over a week ago. The value of St Martins' assets is uncertain because most are held directly by the Kuwaiti government through a nominee company, St Martins Property Investments, and their value is not disclosed in accounts filed at Companies House. Under this arrangement Kuwait benefits from a convention that assets owned directly by a sovereign or government are immune from taxes. A former Kuwaiti government official said yesterday that the properties were valued at Pounds 1.9bn at their peak in the late 1980s, before the property recession. Last year the St Martins group paid an estimated dividend of Pounds 60m to Kuwait. This year's payment is expected to be lower. A financier associated with St Martins said the group's development was being held back by a shortage of capital. The Kuwaiti government bought St Martins in 1974, in a bidding contest with property group Commercial Union. Since the 1991 Gulf war, Kuwait has been selling some of its more liquid investments, although it has retained the majority of assets, such as St Martins, which are not quoted on the stock market.</p>

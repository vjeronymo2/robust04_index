			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by U.S. President Bill Clinton at news conference </F> in Moscow -- live in English with simultaneous translation into  Russian; processed from the Russian]    [Text] Thank you very much. Nine months ago, President  Yeltsin and I met in Vancouver and there we laid the foundation  for the new partnership of the United States and Russia, a  partnership based on mutual respect. We have just concluded an  excellent and productive summit in which we took important steps  to strengthen this partnership. I thank President Yeltsin and  all his team for hosting us and for making these days so  productive. Throughout our discussions I reaffirmed U.S. firm  support of Russia's commitment to democracy and transition to  market economy. I informed President Yeltsin that the United  States has prepared specific projects worth $1.6 billion of aid,  and I announced in Vancouver that we had already expended 70  percent of that sum. The president and I also discussed an  additional $2.5 billion in aid for Russia and for other  independent states that my administration offered in Tokyo in  April, and that the Congress fully funded in September. The  president gave me strong assurances of his intention to continue  the reform process, and we discussed a number of ways in which  the United States and the international community can help in  promoting the reforms, and at the same time to assist Russia in  cushioning the social hardships which the reform has brought to  many people in Russia.    Concrete expression of the assistance of the United States  to  the reforms is that the United States is opening the doors this  year to the Russian small enterprise fund. It has established a  fund supporting large enterprises entering the private sector.  This fund will be chaired by the former secretary of treasury  Michael Blumenthal. We also signed a contract to purchase $12  billion worth of enriched uranium within the next 20 years, and  I have asked the Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown to lead a  very high-level trade mission to Russia in March, including  presidents of major companies who will be in position to promote  trade and investment in Russia.    We issued today also a joint statement on human rights, in  which we express our common goal to combat discrimination and  all forms of racial intolerance, including anti-Semitism.    Today I also had an opportunity to describe further the  results of the successful NATO summit this week, and President  Yeltsin assured me that Russia will be a full participant in  Partnership for Peace.    We took several historic steps to make sure that the fear of  nuclear confrontation be in the realm of the past. Presidents  Yeltsin and Kravchuk and I signed an agreement which commits  Ukraine to scrap approximately 1,500 nuclear warheads, all the  most modern and dangerous missiles in Ukraine, the SS-24. The  warheads will be removed from those over a period of 10 months.    President Yeltsin and I agreed that as of 30 May, the  nuclear  missiles of Russia and the United States would not be targetted  against any country.    Third we signed an agreement to work closely in those areas  where the danger of nuclear weapons proliferation is the  greatest, including the Middle East.    We also agreed that the sovereignty and the independence of  Russia's neighbors must be respected. I expressed my hope that  Russia's talks with Estonia and Latvia would lead to the  withdrawal of troops in 1994. As President Yeltsin has said, I  agreed that it should be stressed that the rights of the  Russian-speaking population should be respected in all areas.    Let me close by reminding you that President Yeltsin and I  agreed to meet at the NATO summit in Naples in July, and I am  pleased that he accepted my invitation to make a state visit to  the United States this fall. I'm looking forward to the  meetings.    I came to Europe with the hope of starting to build a new  security founded upon a common commitment to democracy, free  economics and mutual respect for security and territorial  borders. I came with a dream that with the end of the cold war  we might all be able to work together to make a Europe that  would be integrated politically, economically and in terms of  security. A Europe that for the first time since the  establishment of nation states would not be divided by the  present conflicts or lingering animosities. I now believe we  have a better chance to create that kind of security, a security  in which great nations would be able to treat each other as  genuine partners, and chart their own futures, without being  dictated to by others. A future in which, I believe, greatness  would be defined fundamentally by our capacity to enable the  men, women and children who live within our borders to live up  to the full extent of their capacities.    I thank President Yeltsin for his partnership and endeavor,  and I assure you that we will continue to work as hard as we can  towards this vision.</p>

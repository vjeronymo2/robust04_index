			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Conflict in Kosovo Would Be 10 </F> Times the Size"]    [Text] "The situation with human rights in Croatia is very  worrying because of the war being misused not only for  liberating the Croatian territories under occupation, but also  for settling differences with what I often call statistical and  mathematical minorities, that is, with the people who think  differently. This is, above all, the opposition involving a  group of people who think differently. Finally, there are  different national minorities," Ivan Zvonimir Cicak, chairman of  the Croatia Helsinki human rights committee, says in an  interview to KOHA, a newspaper in Albanian.    "The Serbian ethnic minority is usually the one accused --  at  the level of collective hatred due to the frustration caused by  the war and the Serbian aggression on Croatia -- for the war  with Croatia," Cicak went on to say. "I think that this is not  good because it means accepting the model of generalizing  collective guilt that now justifies Serbs' claims that the whole  of the Croatian people is responsible for the war that was waged  in the World War II when, in the name of Croathood, certain  idiots committed massacres. The Serbs are now doing similar  things in the name of Serbianhood. In this respect, I think  that it is important to individualize guilt, ranging from the  ideological level -- such as the ideological level of guilt in  Serbia that above all lies on the group of people around the  Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, which produced the  "Memorandum," in fact the MEIN KAMPF of the second half of the  20th century.    [KOHA] What does the new Croatian democracy under Tudjman  look like?    [Cicak] As a man of modest intellectual capabilities, I  jokingly "punished" myself by wishing to live in an ordinary  democratic state. During communism, we lived in a state that  proclaimed itself to be the most democratic state in the world.  I would not like to live in the most democratic state in the  world. I would like to live in an ordinary democratic country  and nothing else. This is neither too much nor too little.  However, this is the most difficult thing -- to find a  democracy in which communist ways of thinking prevail is very  difficult.    At the moment, a restriction of, above all, freedom of the  media is featuring on the political scene in Croatia, for there  is no legal possibility in Croatia for free radio or television  stations. Moreover, a great pressure is exerted recently toward  taking away frequencies from local radio stations where  opposition parties are in power. Therefore, room for democracy  is being narrowed down in connection with the most recent  events, a new strike against Manolic and, in my opinion, against  Mesic as well. I think that the Croatian authorities will use  the Washington agreement above all for a showdown with the  internal opposition. Mesic and Manolic are only a beginning,  and I think that the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the kind  of agreements that are on now topical in fact mean rewarding the  people who are, objectively speaking, to be blamed for the war.  This means opening the door for them to turn the Balkans into  South America to an even greater extent, that is, to create  small puppet South American-type states for whom decrees of the  Croatian authorities will more and more boil down to telephone  messages from Washington. Of course, this increases  Washington's responsibility for the policy here and I think that  they should be told this clearly.    [KOHA] What is the fate of the Muslim-Croatian federation?  Could something else perhaps be done?    [Cicak] We have again been brought into the situation of  guinea pigs in an experimental laboratory of the U.S. politics  that has been producing catastrophic results from Somalia to  Iran. I do not believe in such things, above all because I  think that the people who led to the war cannot lead to peace.  Causes of war have not been removed. I was in Sweden when I  received the new Bosnian Constitution. One of the new things  that are being envisaged is the "ombudsman" and the human-rights  tribunal. When it was recognized, Croatia signed a document  obliging itself to form a human rights tribunal, but it has not  done so to date. How can we have any right to ask another  country to establish a human-rights tribunal and "ombudsman" and  we are not complying with international obligations within our  own country.    [KOHA] What is the political influence, above all of the  Albanians, on the solving of the crisis in the former  Yugoslavia, including Kosovo?    [Cicak] When I am thinking about events in the Balkans, I  often remember Tolstoy's "War and Peace" that I read in prison  three times. He had excellent thoughts about politicians being  only labels on wine bottles with the and wines inside being  good, bad, overfermented, or underfermented. Therefore, I think  that the names of the people on the Kosovo political scene at  the moment are simply names that represent the situation at the  moment. I think that the new times and new events will make new  people surface. Just as is the case in Croatia. Many people  were wiped out by political events in 1971. Likewise many names  on the Kosovo political scene of today will simply be wiped out  by new events and I think that these events will bring in some  far more radical people. Unfortunately, Albanians cannot avoid  the process of radicalization that, in my opinion, will be  brought from outside. The moment the Serbs need it, they will  set off on a showdown with Kosovo, as this is simply the only  way they can function. They need war primarily to strengthen  the system and not only to create a greater Serbia.    In this respect, I think that the most horrible events will  take place in Kosovo, because the amount of hatred between  Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo is 10 times as great as that in  Croatia and Bosnia. And I think that the number of conflicts  and events in Kosovo will also be 10 times greater. I do not  want to play a prophet, but I have, so far, correctly predicted  a lot of what has, unfortunately, happened in Kosovo. The  conflict in Kosovo will provoke a global conflict in Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] that will  cause 1 million deaths in a short time. This is my own opinion  and I have also spoken with a Swedish strategist. The amount of  hatred and brutality, particularly on the Serbian side, is such  that it is awful.    If there is such an explosion in Kosovo, people will start  fleeing down toward Tetovo en masse, because all this is a  valley and that would simply be the most natural thing to do.  The demographic situation in Macedonia will thereby change and  that will cause a chain reaction. Albania, as well as Bulgaria  and Greece will not watch from the sidelines. What the world is  afraid of is the greatest cynicism of the West. In fact they  are not bothered much by the conflict taking place in the  Balkans between us: the Croats, Serbs, Muslims, Albanians, and  others. They are afraid of the NATO breakdown that has begun  with the conflict between Greece and Turkey and this is why they  are acting at the level of prevention. However, I do not think  that their prevention will work. To quote [Serbian writer]  Filip David, one should strike and thereby prevent that budding  neo-nazism in Europe, which is blend of bolshevism and an  extreme chauvinistic nationalism, something that can best be  seen in Russia. I think that the only way this process can be  stopped is by demystifying those people who have begun their  nazi projects, projects summed up in the following sentence:  "One blood, one soil, one leader, one people." I do not like  to lecture anybody, any peoples or groups, but the message I  would send to the Albanians is that everything should be done to  avoid deaths. Because, there has been only one case of  resurrection in history.    [KOHA] What do you think about the Kosovo setup,  "reflecting" the present attempts in Bosnia, that is, about the  Kosovo setup in the present Yugoslavia?    [Cicak] This will be the worst catastrophe. The Albanians  are going to swallow the idea, reckoning that it is important to  acquire the status of federal units in Serbia or Macedonia and  afterwards join Albania. I would call that a mistake in the  long run and I will tell you why. What is involved is the  project of first having a federation of Croats and Muslims in  Bosnia, then confederal links with Croatia. Following this is  the federalization of Croats and Muslims with the Serbs and then  confederalization between that confederation and Serbia. After  that, the Americans will try to apply that model to the  federalization of Kosovo and linking that into a confederation  with Albania. This would be one more reason for even greater  war clashes in a certain number of years. Therefore, this does  not solve the essential question again. And the essential  question is how to stop the way of thinking that is 140 years  old and that assumes the existence of a greater Serbia, a  greater Croatia, and a greater Albania.    [KOHA] What can the international community gain for Kosovo?    [Cicak] The first step that the international community  should gain for Kosovo is the degree of autonomy that it had on  the basis of the 1974 [SFRY] Constitution, which was abolished  against the will of the Albanian population. A great dilemma  that the Albanians will certainly then face is how to preserve  the ethnic rights of the Serbian ethnic minority, because the  Serbs who are a constitutive nation would thereby turn into an  ethnic minority. This is not because a constitution would have  it that way, but it is from a mathematical point of view. They  will simply be a minority from a statistical point of view and  regardless of any constitutional provisions. A climate of  intolerance and hatred between Albanians and Serbs cannot be  avoided. It will not be possible to avoid revanchism.    The problem is how long that would be possible to endure.    How can this Balkan knot be later untangled is a question.  According to what I have learned, Albania itself is hardly  delighted with joining Kosovo soon. Kosovo is at the higher  level of development in all social spheres, ranging from the  cultural sphere to the economic basis. In this respect, after  the reports and talks I had, I was very surprised when, in talks  with people from Albania, I realized that they are not  particularly delighted with that idea, fearing an overall  domination of Kosovo Albanians in a future Albanian state. This  fear of the Albanians is a fact. I think that Kosovo Albanians  also know this very well. Terrible problems ensued with the  union of East and West Germany because, in 45 years of living  separately they became two separate bodies.</p>

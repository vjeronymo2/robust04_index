			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Rank, Coles withdraw bid for Foodland Coles Myer, one of Australia's largest retailers, and Rank Commercial, the New Zealand-based company owned by Mr Graeme Hart, yesterday withdrew from their ADollars 501m (USDollars 372m) takeover assault on Foodland Associated, the Western Australian grocery business. Had the offer, to be made by a subsidiary of Rank and funded by borrowed money, gone ahead, Rank planned to sell on Foodland's Australian assets to Coles for around ADollars 250m. Foodland's New Zealand interests would have been sold on to Whitcoulls, a stationery and book retailer. The decision to ditch the bid came after the Australian Federal Court yesterday dismissed the two companies' appeal against a temporary injunction which prevented Coles/Rank from pursuing the offer until mid-September at the very earliest. This had been successfully obtained by the Trade Practices Commission, Australia's competition watchdog, after it expressed concerns at the potential hold which Coles could obtain over the Western Australian grocery market, and at the lessening of competition generally in the food and liquor retailing sectors. The Federal Court decision was warmly welcomed by Professor Allan Fels, chairman of the TPC. He declared it to be 'a win for consumers and competition policy in the grocery industry'. 'The Australian grocery industry is extremely volatile at the moment,' he added. 'The Commission expects it will continue to be involved to ensure that competition is maintained and the consumer protected.' The Rank/Coles withdrawal leaves Rank holding a 14.9 per cent in Foodland.</p>

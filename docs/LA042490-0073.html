			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> COUNSELOR PLEADS INNOCENT IN BATTERY  </P> <P> A former Oxnard high school counselor who is accused of spanking female  students had his attorney enter a not guilty plea for him Monday to four counts  of battery in Ventura County Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Stephen L. Mitnick entered the plea on behalf of Robert  Bradley, 36, of Camarillo, a former counselor at Santa Clara High School in  Oxnard, who did not appear at his own arraignment.  </P> <P> Bradley was fired in January from the private Catholic school because of  allegations that he had spanked students and shown "inappropriate physical  affection," according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley. Frawley would  not elaborate.  </P> <P> Bradley had worked at the school for 13 years as a counselor, teacher and coach  for the girls' sports teams.  </P> <P> Bradley could not be reached for comment at his home Monday, and a woman who  identified herself as his wife said, "We have no comment."  </P> <P> Several months ago, school administrators sent letters to the parents of each  of the more than 300 girls who attend Santa Clara High. The letter said if  Bradley "engaged in any acts of physical discipline, including spanking or  inappropriate displays of physical affection with you or someone you know  about, it is important that you contact the District Attorney's Office  immediately."  </P> <P> Each count of misdemeanor battery carries a maximum penalty of six months in  prison and a $2,000 fine. Bradley's jury trial in Municipal Court is set for  May 15. MACK REED  </P></p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / US to cut military facilities in Europe The US will end or reduce operations at 27 more military facilities in Europe, most in Germany, the Defence Department said yesterday. The latest defence cuts come after the end of the Cold War and bring to 895 the total number of overseas military installations closed, reduced or put on stand-by since 1990. The new step will affect 5,655 personnel including 3,226 US troops, 506 US civilians and 1,923 local civilians. Some 21 facilities, including Neureut Barracks and Rhein Ordnance Barracks, are in Germany and the other six are in Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands or Britain. The US has cut its presence around the world by some 174,000 troops in the past three years. In Europe it is set to shrink to a maximum of 100,000 troops by the end of next year.</p>

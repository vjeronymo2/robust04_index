			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Borland revenue warning as finance chief resigns Borland International, the US personal computer software company which is selling its spreadsheet product Quattro Pro to Novell for Dollars 145m, yesterday announced the resignation of its finance chief and warned that it will report significantly lower revenues and a 'substantial' operating loss in the quarter ended March 31. Borland also said it will incur a charge in the next quarter to cover the corporate restructuring that followed the Quattro Pro sale and its poor recent earnings performance. It said it had not yet determined the extent of the charge. These latest developments follow last week's appointment of Mr Keith Maib as Borland's first chief operating officer. Mr Maib, a former partner at the accountancy firm Price Waterhouse who had spent the weeks prior to his appointment conducting a detailed examination of the Borland's business, is now running the day-to-day management of the company. The arrival of Mr Maib followed a period of turmoil among the company's senior management. Yesterday's resignation of Mr Alan Henricks, who stepped down as chief financial officer 'to pursue other interests', was only the latest in a line of recent departures by senior executives. Last Wednesday, the head of the company's product division resigned. The sale of Quattro Pro, the arrival of Mr Maib, and the planned restructuring, are all part of an attempt by Mr Philip Kahn, Borland's chief executive, to ensure the company survives a price war in the increasingly competitive software market. Borland incurred a loss of Dollars 49m for its 1993 fiscal year, and in the latest quarter reported only modest profits. Shares in Borland rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 14 1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday before they were suspended pending the announcement of the deal with Novell.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Chinese factories to set wages CHINA has given loss-making state factories the power to set their own wages in another blow to the 'iron rice bowl' system that guarantees millions of workers a lifetime of employment, Reuter reports from Beijing. Economic reformers led by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping have set their faces against the system that saddles state industry with huge, unnecessary costs. The China Daily said yesterday that the central government had recently issued a directive giving factory managers, instead of distant bureaucrats, control over wages and bonuses. The immediate aim is to create pay scales that reward individual effort and skill - instead of length of service and political performance  - and thus boost productivity. Eventually, economic reformers want a free market in labour as part of wider market-oriented changes that will give enterprises autonomy over prices and production, and make them responsible for their own profits and losses. Foreign investment in China is booming with the value of approved projects in the first quarter more than doubling over the same period a year ago, the China Daily said yesterday.</p>

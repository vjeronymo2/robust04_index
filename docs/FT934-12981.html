			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Building societies record net inflow of funds - At a Glance Building societies recorded a net inflow of funds in September, for the first time since May. The societies cited an absence of negative factors, rather than any positive news, for the turnround. Summer outflows had been caused by the holiday season, August spending on L-registration cars and the BT3 share issue. As the graph shows, the Pounds 124m inflow in September was still well below the figures being recorded in the first five months of the year. The societies said that competition from other savings media, such as unit trusts, was still tough.</p>

However, he would also like to see the  list of criteria needed for passing into the third stage of  Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) completed and its timetable of  application reviewed. Finally he pleads for a peaceful solution  to be found in the former Yugoslavia, for an accelerated peace  process in the Middle East, and for increased cooperation with  South Africa.    [Graviere] You are faced with a Europe in crisis. What will  be the Greek presidency's priorities for meeting this challenge?    [Pangalos] Our priority is obviously the White Paper on  Growth, Competition, and Employment adopted in December by the  European Council in Brussels. The peoples of Europe are  primarily concerned with unemployment. However, it is only if  we can convince them that we are doing something about the  economy and unemployment that we will persuade them that a  united Europe is a good thing. Our aim is that the major  projects outlined in this document should start to contribute to  the recovery of the European economy from the start of next  year. A set of specified projects must be decided on in June at  the Corfu meeting of the European Council.    We have set in place a working timetable. The so-called  Christophersen group which will work on the transport networks  has already met once. The so-called Bangeman group on  telecommunications is to start work next week. The white paper  is on the agenda at all our Council meetings.    [Graviere] What are the projects you want to see completed?  The TGV-East [high-speed train]?    [Pangalos] We will have to examine the costs and the  financial resources available. It seems to me that the TGV-East  is well placed. However, we will have to make other decisions.    [Graviere] What is the second priority, after the white  paper?    [Pangalos] Expansion. Four candidate countries could become  members in 1995. We will push for their fate to be decided at  the end of our six-month term of presidency. This would let  them attend the Corfu summit, at least as associate members. We  have a deadline for the end of negotiations -- 1 March. I have  scheduled an extraordinary Council meeting for 21 and 22  February plus a jumbo Council session on 25 to 28 February.  Moreover, the question must be asked if we will succeed with  all of them, or just some of them. It is a difficult challenge,  but it is not impossible. We need the cooperation of the member  states (it is important that no country raises new problems as  some may be tempted to do). Also, the candidate countries must  accept all Community accession negotiations, including the  agricultural provisions. The Community cannot have a system  where prices differ from one country to the next -- that would  be stepping back 10 years. On the contrary, the candidate  countries can increase their support for their farmers, for  example by taxing those citizens who would benefit considerably  from a sharp drop in farm prices caused by the introduction of  the CAP [common agricultural policy] in these countries.    [Graviere] Are starting the second phase of the EMU and  improving convergence of Community economies also challenges  that the Greek presidency hopes to meet?    [Pangalos] Most countries currently do not conform to the  Maastricht criteria. Not only are we not converging at the  European level, we are increasingly diverging, as is shown in  the worsening German budget deficit. We have to revise, if not  these criteria then at least the timetable for passing to the  third stage of EMU. This is all the more true since it is almost  impossible to reconcile a policy of budget constraint that we  would need to reach these criteria with the current economic  situation. Therefore we are asking for the introduction of  supplementary criteria that cater more to the real economic  situation and, in particular, criteria relative to the increase  in national income, the rate of investment, and employment. The  monetarist approach has shown its limitations, and this is  proved by the crisis of the last few years.    [Graviere] You also have to manage the crisis in Yugoslavia  and the evolution of the peace process in the Middle East. What  are you doing?    [Pangalos] Where Yugoslavia is concerned, we have a peace  plan and we still think it is the only valid one. In Greece,  even if we did not want to veto the decision made by NATO last  week concerning a possible intervention, we think it is  dangerous to exercise military force in this region.    In the Middle East, we have promised $600 million. However,  before we "sign the check" there must be an agreement, and it  must be clear who the authority is who will be controlling the  occupied territories. We are also busy in South Africa. We  have set up an office with regard to the elections and to  prepare our future cooperation with the new government.    [Graviere] Finally, what do you want to achieve to call the  Greek presidency a success at the June Corfu summit?    [Pangalos] If we arrive at a sufficiently precise program  outlining measures to implement the proposals of the white  paper, if the Community is enlarged even partially, and if a  peaceful solution is found to the problems in Yugoslavia, then  the Greek term of office will have been a good presidency...and  I will be a happy man.</p>

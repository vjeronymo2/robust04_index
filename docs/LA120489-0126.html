			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AUBURN'S WIN REDUCES FIELD OF CONTENDERS FOR NATIONAL CHAMP TITLE  </P> <P> And then there were four.  </P> <P> Auburn's 30-20 victory over previously unbeaten Alabama dropped the Crimson  Tide from No. 2 to No. 7 in the rankings and left only four teams in contention  for college football's national championship: Colorado, Miami, Michigan and  Notre Dame.  </P> <P> Colorado remained on top for the second straight week in today's Associated  Press poll, and Miami rose two spots to second. Michigan remained No. 3 and  Notre Dame moved up one notch to No. 4.  </P> <P> Miami, Michigan and Notre Dame each finished the regular season with one loss;  Colorado is the only undefeated team in Division I-A.  </P> <P> Because of the New Year's bowl match-ups, those are the only teams with a  realistic chance to win the national title. Colorado plays Notre Dame in the  Orange, Alabama meets Miami in the Sugar and Michigan faces 12th-ranked USC in  the Rose.  </P> <P> Colorado can claim the championship by beating Notre Dame. If Notre Dame wins  and Miami and Michigan lose, however, the Fighting Irish would almost certainly  be voted No. 1.  </P> <P> Miami, which snapped Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak two weeks ago, needs a  win over Alabama and a Colorado loss to capture its third national championship  of the decade.  </P> <P> Although Michigan is ranked third, it will be very difficult for the Wolverines  to finish on top. They need an impressive win over USC, a Miami loss in the  Sugar Bowl and a close Notre Dame victory in the Orange Bowl to have any  chance. Even then, the Irish would probably get the nod because they would have  beaten the No. 1 team and because they defeated Michigan 24-19 at the start of  the season.  </P> <P> Colorado received 55 first-place votes and 1,492 of a possible 1,500 points  from a nationwide panel of sportswriters and broadcasters. Miami got four  first-place votes and 1,407 points, and Michigan received the other first-place  vote and 1,374 points. Notre Dame's point total was 1,323.  </P> <P> Rounding out the Top 10 are Florida State, Nebraska, Alabama, Tennessee, Auburn  and Arkansas.  </P> <P> Florida State, which has won nine straight since opening the season with two  losses, moved up one place to fifth after beating Florida 24-17 Saturday.  Nebraska, which was idle, went from No. 7 to No. 6, Tennessee stayed No. 8  after defeating Vanderbilt 17-10, Auburn jumped two places to No. 9 after its  victory over Alabama, and Arkansas fell one spot to No. 10 after a 38-24 win  over Southern Methodist.  </P> <P> Illinois is 11th, followed by USC, Houston, Clemson, Virginia, Texas A&amp;M,  West Virginia, Penn State, Brigham Young, Duke, Ohio State, Michigan State,  Hawaii, Pittsburgh and Texas Tech.  </P> <P> Other than Illinois, which dropped one spot, all of those teams held the same  position as the previous week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE TOP 25  </P> <P> The top 25 teams in the AP college football poll, with first-place votes in  parentheses.  </P> <P> 1. Colorado (55) 11-0-0  </P> <P> 2. Miami (Fla.) (4) 10-1-0  </P> <P> 3. Michigan (1) 10-1-0  </P> <P> 4. Notre Dame 11-1-0  </P> <P> 5. Florida St. 9-2-0  </P> <P> 6. Nebraska 10-1-0  </P> <P> 7.

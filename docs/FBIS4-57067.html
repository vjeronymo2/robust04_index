			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oscar Navarro from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] Jose Angel Pescador Osuna was sworn-in only 10  minutes ago as new education secretary. He promised to continue  the education programs, but said something important and  something that attracted much attention. He said that he would  Mexicanize education. This happened a few minutes ago in the  Pan-American Room at the Education Secretariat. Here Government  Secretary Jorge Carpizo, representing the president, swore in  Pescador Osuna, and highlighted the work of Fernando Solana  Morales as education secretary. By the way, I do not wish  Solana any luck in his new political life and we shall hear why.    [Begin Carpizo recording, in progress] ...leaves the post of  education secretary to become a senate candidate for the federal  district. We all know the very long list of public posts that  Solana has filled ranging from National Company for Basic  Commodities to several state secretariats. In a few more  minutes, Solana will become a senate candidate for a political  party in accordance with the new electoral laws. To avoid  committing any electoral crime, I will simply say thank you  without any praise. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

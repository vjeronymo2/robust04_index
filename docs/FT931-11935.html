			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Russia to build new gas pipes for German market GAZPROM, Russia's state gas production company, is building two new gas pipelines to Germany in an effort to avoid disruption of gas supplies running through Ukraine, Mr Rem Vyakhirev, the company's chairman, said. There was an outcry in Germany in October when the pressure in the gas pipeline, which supplies 31 per cent of German demand, dropped for days as supplies through Ukraine were disrupted. Mr Vyakhirev said the interruption in supplies in October was caused by a technical problem that could 'easily be corrected'. 'Of course, consumers must be guaranteed a stable supply of gas, but we have taken a lot of steps to avoid any repetition of the disruption.' The pipeline is due to be finished within two to three years. However, it is widely believed that the gas supply problem in October was caused by Ukraine stealing gas from the export pipeline after its own supplies were interrupted. German diplomats are believed to have stressed the seriousness of the situation to the governments of Ukraine and Russia. Mr Vyakhirev said gas flowing through the existing pipeline had a time lag of five to seven days, so it could take a week to sort out any problems. The new pipelines will have a three-day time lag so disruptions could be corrected much quickly, he said. He would not disclose the cost of the pipelines, but it is believed to represent an investment of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m). Construction of the new pipelines has already begun in Russia with completion of the first pipeline to Germany due in 1997. The company is expected to run one line through the Baltic states and Poland, entering Germany at Frankfurt an der Oder. Mr Vyakhirev said a final decision on the pipelines' routes will be taken later this year. Gazprom is expecting to sell around 8bn cubic metres a year to Poland en route, which will leave an additional 32bn cubic metres a year for Germany. Mr Vyakhirev would not disclose the cost of the lines. Gazprom has agreed a Dollars 50m contract with Compressor Controls, the US gas supplies company, for the supply of control equipment that will improve the efficiency of the company's pipelines and gas processing stations. The contract runs over seven years and the company estimates it will save 10bn to 15bn cubic metres of gas a year that would have been lost by inefficient processing.</p>

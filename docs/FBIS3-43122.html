			<p>Recent     articles from PRC, Hong Kong, and Taiwan media have  reported on corrupt practices in China's flourishing publishing  industry that have facilitated a proliferation of vulgar and  pornographic publications as well as the publication of politically  sensitive materials.  Some entrepreneurs have legitimized their  publishing activities by purchasing "book numbers" from publishing  houses, while others simply publish illegally.  Industry spokesmen  warn that the phenomenon threatens the continued publication of  high-quality literature.      An article in the 6 November issue of the Chinese Writers'  Association weekly WENYI BAO reported that the number of new books  and periodicals published in China is growing at an annual rate of  20 percent but that an increasing number of them are "vulgar" and  "garbage" materials.  Moreover, the article notes, over 95 percent  of the "questionable" items have been published through the sale of  "book numbers," or publishing permits.  Xu Weicheng, executive  deputy chief of the CPC Propaganda Department, says in the same  article that a "small number of unlawful persons" have through  buying book numbers published books that "are seriously wrong  politically, leak state secrets, damage nationality unity, violate  foreign policy, and promote feudalistic superstition or  pornography."      Dissident writers have also used this channel to reach readers.  Ma Shaohua's "Eastern Europe: 1989-93" was published through "buying  a book number," according to an article in the 29 November Hong Kong  MING PAO.  A 1 November Hong Kong LIEN-HO PAO article reports that  Ma's book, which analyzes the failure of communist rule in Eastern  Europe, was banned in September for "creating chaos among the  masses."      According to an article in the 20 October issue of the Beijing  daily GUANGMING RIBAO, the State Press and Publication  Administration's Books Administrative Department director, Yang  Muzhi, says that purchasing book numbers is "tantamount to  purchasing publishing rights" granted by the state.  By selling a  unit or individual outside the publishing industry a book number, he  notes, publishing houses are enabling the unit or individual to  print a book for profit.  This is an example of "exchanging power  for money," Yang continues.  An article in the 2 November Taipei  LIEN-HO PAO reports that PRC publishing houses receive 2,000 to  20,000 yuan for a book number.      In addition to purchasing book numbers from legitimate publishing  houses, many entrepreneurs have simply printed books under fake  publishing house names, according to an article in the 5 November  issue of the Hong Kong monthly TZU-CHING (BAUHINIA MAGAZINE).  China's annual publication volume now accounts for one-ninth of the  total world book production, but "crude and obscene" materials have  flooded the market.  According to the article, the government  confiscated 10 million illegal books in 1992, of which 160,000 were  pornographic.      Two major publishers have recently issued warnings on the harmful  effects of this corruption.  People's Publishing House Director Xue  Dezhen notes in the 4 November JINRONG SHIBAO that buying and  selling book numbers enables poor-quality books to be published,  disturbs publication management, facilitates large-scale tax evasion  by book sellers, and hinders the publication of good books and  academic works.  In the same article, Beijing Publishing House  Director Zhu Shuxin called buying and selling book numbers "suicide  behavior"; large quantities of low-grade, low-priced books are being  dumped on the market, he said, while the production of high-quality  books and books "with vitality" is being "strangled."

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (14): Inflated ideas on safety - John Griffiths assesses the proliferation of airbags and air-conditioning Cars are becoming ever more complex and sophisticated as a result of stricter safety and environmental laws and consumers becoming more demanding. The trend is summed up in the motor industry buzz phrase 'more car per car'. As more high-tech component systems are added, so their suppliers can earn significantly more per vehicle produced. It is not often that two high-value components systems emerge together to provide suppliers with the potential for a leap in earnings. But such is the case with airbags - being adopted at a rate much faster than expected two years ago - and with air-conditioning. Airbags, which inflate by explosive charge from the dashboard to prevent injury in a frontal collision, are a relatively new technology. Air-conditioning is far older but traditionally has been very expensive in Europe - typically at least Pounds 1,000 per car as an option. However, new capacity to produce air-conditioning is coming on stream in several European centres. Air-conditioning now appears poised to spread through a far larger section of the European car market as manufacturers perceive that it could prove a valuable volume car market sales tool. Peugeot, for example, has disconcerted fleet market rivals in the UK by deciding to fit 'a/c' as standard in all 405s sold in in the UK. Its potential growth in Europe was underlined last month when Australia's Air International Group and the UK's Unipart components group launched a new 50-50 joint venture, Automotive Climate Systems, to design, develop and manufacture air-conditioning, heating and ventilation systems for the European vehicle industry. The venture is being set up on the basis of forecasts that European demand for a/c systems will triple to 6m units a year by 2000 - business worth about Pounds 5bn annually. In 1990, European sales of a/c systems totalled 940,000 units, although production was higher at 1.6m because of the high level of exports by European car makers to countries such as the US, where air-conditioning is virtually standard. The largest new venture into a/c, however, has been made by Nippondenso, Japan's largest vehicle components maker, which has invested Pounds 65m with Fiat components subsidiary Magneti Marelli in a plant at Telford in the UK with a capacity of 500,000 units a year. TRW, the US components multinational which, like rival AlliedSignal, is establishing airbag production capacity in Europe, forecasts that the world demand for airbags will grow from about 17m this year to some 60m in 1998. TRW is investing Pounds 8m in a facility at Houghton-le-Spring, Wearside, to produce electronic trigger mechanisms for the bags. AlliedSignal has signed a three-way venture with two Italian groups, Gilardini and Sequa, to supply advanced airbag inflators to European manufacturers. The venture will be based in Colleferro, Italy. One of the most intractable car safety problems arises from side collisions, where only the thickness of the car door protects against injury. With question marks increasingly being raised over the efficacy of anti-intrusion bars within the doors an increasing amount of research is going on into side airbags. Mercedes-Benz, which invented the original steering wheel airbag and is now developing side airbags, stresses the technological difficulties involved. At 30mph, say its engineers, it can take just 15 milliseconds for an occupant to come into contact with the inside of the door. So, to offer maximum protection the airbag may have to inflate even before impact - thus requiring proximity sensors. Quite how they are to differentiate between a harmlessly passing bicycle and a potential car-to-car impact has yet to be fully worked out.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo alert Shares in Lasmo, the oil exploration and production group, staged a strong revival yesterday as the market responded to recent talk that that a predator may be stalking the company. The shares jumped 5 1/2 to 136 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 11m shares. Lasmo has been viewed as a potential bid target by market analysts following its bitter experience in absorbing Ultramar, its fellow oil group. A deterioration in Lasmo's performance following this acquisition was seen as the trigger for the departure of Mr Chris Greentree, former chief executive, earlier this year. Lasmo shares began to stir earlier this week with rumours that British Gas - following the MMC report which recommended that Gas lose its monopoly in the UK gas supply business - might be interested in bidding for Lasmo. The Gas bid stories have died down but the market was alive yesterday with talk that a reshaping of the UK exploration and production sector may be in the offing. Sector analysts were shocked recently by news that Mr John Walmsley, Enterprise Oil's finance director, has resigned. 'It's all highly speculative at the moment, but the feeling is that something might be afoot,' said one analyst. Food retailers were one of the day's best performing sectors as speculation that SG Warburg was about to create a covered warrant on the sector did the rounds. No one at the securities house was available to comment but there was good demand for several food retailing stocks. The day's strong performers included Argyll Group - in which sentiment was said to have also been boosted by a UBS recommendation - which gained 6 1/2 to 353 1/2 p, and Kwik Save, a strong performer earlier in the week following broker's recommendations. The shares appreciated another 5 to 738p. J Sainsbury gained 6 to 522p, in trade of 2.4m. Shares in Cadbury-Schweppes fell 8 to 493p, after it announced it was increasing its stake in US drinks company Dr Pepper/Seven-UP to around 26 per cent, having picked up a 20.2 per cent stake for Dollars 231.3m. There were fears in the market that Cadbury may decide to launch a full bid for Dr Pepper and UK analysts doubt whether Cadbury should move into the competitive mass US soft drinks market, a move they feel would necessitate a cash raising effort. Cadbury's purchase appeared to dash recent market speculation that it may bid for United Biscuits. Shares in UB eased 10 to 381p, on the fading bid hopes. Shares in Allied-Lyons closed 7 ahead at 615p, after Smith New Court reiterated its buy recommendation. The broker believes the stock to be cheap on 'yield and PE considerations', and that the market has not yet given the management credit for changes made. Guinness, in which Smith New Court turned a buyer earlier this week, was in demand and the shares firmed 10 to 503p, on volume of 3.6m.</p>

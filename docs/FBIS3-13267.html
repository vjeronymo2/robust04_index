'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, head of the Palestinian  delegation, said the Musawi community in Syria is part of the  Syrian people. He said they met with them to clarify some  Israeli political and public opinion issues, and to bring back a  message of the true image of their life in Syria.    Darawshah said the delegation will visit a synagogue and a  Musawi community school today to prove to all who seek to  distort the truth that Syria does not discriminate against the  Musawi community.    Yusuf Jajati, deputy head of the Musawi community in Syria,  denounced the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. He said: In the  name of the Musawi community, we strongly denounce these  actions. Jajati stressed that the Musawi community is living in  Syria in peace. He expressed hope that a just and comprehensive  peace will be achieved in the region.</p>

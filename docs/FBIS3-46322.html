After the  devaluation, the official exchange rate would drop to the same  level as the market rate used in commercial transactions. Thus,  a single exchange rate would be established. This would also  help promote Chinese participation in free trade, as well as  considerably pave the way toward its membership in GATT next  year.    Currently, there are three different exchange rates being  used in China. The first is the official exchange rate ($1 =  about 5.8 yuan); the second is the exchange rate used in  commercial transactions that is determined by the Foreign  Currency Exchange Center ($1 = about 8.7 yuan); and the third is  the exchange rate used in the black market ($1 = about 8.9  yuan). According to the same financial source, the Chinese  Government predicts that the market rate would be about $1 =  8.8-8.9 yuan next year. By reducing the official exchange rate  by about 3 yuan (51 percent), the government intends to  establish a single exchange rate.    Originally, the government had tentatively decided to put  the  plan into effect on 1 January 1994, but the plan was postponed  since financial institutions would require more time for  preparations. However, the government reportedly plans to put  the plan into effect by late March.    The yuan devaluation is expected to cause a rise in prices  of  imported and other items, with merchants taking advantage of  the situation. However, the government plans to keep confusion  in the market to a minimum by reinforcing price-monitoring  operations.    So far, the PRC has issued two types of currency: the  foreign  exchange certificate (FEC), which can be exchanged for foreign  currency at the official exchange rate; and the renminbi (RMB),  which cannot be exchanged for foreign currency. With the  establishment of a single foreign exchange rate, however, it has  become meaningless to issue FEC's. Thus, FEC's, which account  for about 20 percent of the total currency in circulation, will  eventually be abolished. On the other hand, it will become  possible to exchange RMB's for foreign currency.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- A senior government  official said Thursday [31 March] the yen's recent spurt against  the U.S. dollar does not reflect the economic fundamentals of  Japan. Hideaki Kumano, vice minister for administrative affairs  at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), also  said the yen's advance will have a negative impact on both the  Japanese and global economies.    The Japanese currency has steadily gained ground in recent  sessions on speculation that Washington may talk up the yen to  extract further concessions from Japan on stalled bilateral  trade talks.</p>

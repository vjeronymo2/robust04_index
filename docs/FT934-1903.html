			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Bristol Water shows 20% rise to Pounds 4.12m Bristol Water Holdings continued to make progress both in its regulated water business and in the development of non-regulated activities. Pre-tax profits advanced by 20 per cent, from Pounds 3.43m to Pounds 4.12m, in the six months to September 30. Sales for the regulated business expanded 7.5 per cent, which combined with external turnover of Pounds 2.3m from non-regulated businesses led to group turnover rising by 16 per cent to Pounds 30.2m (Pounds 26.1m). Operating profits rose 13 per cent to Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 5.65m) despite big increases in the depreciation charge arising from the continuing capital programme. Capital expenditure, which grew from Pounds 8m to Pounds 11m, was funded using the proceeds of the 8.75 per cent irredeemable preference shares issued last November. Fully diluted earnings per share, after minorities, edged ahead to 39.9p (39.7p). The interim dividend is stepped up to 11.1p (10.3p).</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Minding Your Own Business: From rags to riches - Nick Garnett visits a boutique which found success when it moved upmarket TOM Chapman punches a few keys on a computer in one of his four clothes shops and on the screen appears itemised listings of what his well-heeled customers have been purchasing. Rolling through the customer base, a long entry suddenly flashes up. Earlier this year one man strolled into Chapman's tiny retail empire and spent Pounds 13,500 on himself in one go. The screen tells the tale. Rows of Cerruti suits at Pounds 500, several Armani trousers at Pounds 230 each, blocks of Missoni ties starting at Pounds 50, Pounds 300 crocodile belts by J M Davidson, Gianni Versace shoes from Pounds 225 a pair. 'The largest single purchase we've had like this is probably Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 25,000,' Chapman says. Recession always leaves some people unscathed. Chapman is only 29 years old. He started his first clothing shop in Wimbledon 10 years ago and made a Pounds 6,000 loss in the first 12 months. Last year, his company, Matches generated sales of Pounds 3.1m, on which it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 245,000. Apart from a nice salary the business provides Chapman with a Mercedes sports car and a house in one of the smarter parts of this village suburb in south-west London where he has all his retail outlets, virtually next to each other. Chapman started Matches as a teenager with no knowledge of retailing or clothing. He studied hotel management at college. His wife, Ruth, had done a management trainee course with Jaeger, the clothing retailer. Although Matches is successful, the first four years were bit of a disaster. 'We started too far down market. It was only in 1987 that we began to get it right so we really only got one year of the 1980s retail boom.' Chapman began with Pounds 6,000 of his own money and a Pounds 5,000 overdraft facility from Barclays. He took a lease on a small shop for Pounds 4,000 a year. 'Rents were much lower then. On that unit it is now Pounds 21,500.' This was the time of Next and Benetton and Chapman chose to sell relatively inexpensive clothing but a little more exclusive than those offered by the chains. He pored over trade magazines and bought in London's fashion district around Great Portland Street - 'that's the cash and carry for the trade'. He also visited Paris and Milan, using addresses of suppliers there provided by the French and Italian trade centres in London. 'It was a lot easier then than now. You could get three months' credit but no wholesaler will accept that now. It's too risky.' The shop though was not a raging success. After a first-year loss it broke even in its second year and made a paltry Pounds 9,000 profit in its third. Then Chapman's luck turned. He found himself lumbered with nine women's sweaters retailing at a hefty Pounds 270 and was astonished to sell them all within a week. It was the end of 1986. 'That made us think we were working too low down the market. We needed to sell an image, and promote a more glamorous feeling within the shop.' The unit was refurbished, more expensive designer-labels introduced and profits soared in the year to April 1988 to Pounds 90,000 on a turnover of Pounds 320,000. A menswear shop was opened virtually next door in 1988. Matches' four shops are made up of two menswear units, one dedicated to more casual clothing, and two for women's wear with one unit given over entirely to the Italian brand Max Mara. All shops are small, about 600 sq ft each. Matches raised turnover last year by a quarter and is aiming to increase it 15 per cent this year. This growth is based on strict guidelines Chapman adheres to on buying policy, pricing, shop design, staff training and target marketing. Chapman sells clothes from about 75 so-called 'collections', most of them from top designer labels including Byblos and Umberto Ginocchietti, Moschino, Ralph Lauren and Montana. Almost all are French and Italian, together with the occasional American and Spanish brand. Matches sells a few British labels, including Joseph Conran and Rifat Ozbeck but fewer than it used to. 'We had too many problems with quality and they are also very small with generally a small-minded attitude to business. You would get them saying to you: 'would you mind paying 10 days early because I've got the bank on my back' or 'we can't deliver on time because we can't get the cloth.' Joseph Conran now produces in Italy.' Matches sells almost no clothing from Germany. 'German lines have never worked for us. They do not have the cut or style or feeling we are trying to promote. Hugo Boss is the only German line we carry. It has its devotees.' Chapman has exclusivity agreements with most suppliers, usually stipulating that they cannot supply to other retailers within a four mile radius from Wimbledon. Chapman says he sticks rigidly to recommended retail prices which are used by 70 per cent of his suppliers. He complains to them if he discovers any shop selling below. He says that some West End department stores sell above. One top label stipulates that retailers must sell at a mark up of 300 per cent - to protect sales at its own shops. Chapman says this is unusually high. Matches operates on a gross margin of 38 per cent. Some people able to pay say Pounds 1,365 for a Versace jacket might not care much perhaps about who is making what margin. The shops are done out with stone flooring and low level lighting. Refurbishment costs up to Pounds 70,000 a unit. Customers are offered coffee, and beer and wine is also available. Sales staff are on a basic salary of Pounds 11,000 a year but get bonuses on each individual sale of more than Pounds 600. This reflects the company's aim of selling a complete 'look' to a buyer: men's suits are displayed with matching shirts and ties. Each shop has a manager and the tiny group has a relatively high staff level of 24. Sales staff are required to be friendly and non-pushy and saying 'Can I help you?' is banned. Staff costs last year were Pounds 380,000. Attention to detail is encapsulated in the use of the company's Pounds 45,000 computer system designed specifically for retailers. Chapman uses the information this churns out to target catalogues to those on the 9,000-strong mailing list depending on what they have already purchased. Individual customers' sizes and preferences in colour and style are tabulated making it easier for spouses and other relatives to purchase gifts. Customers can buy at one-sixth the price, paying the rest over six months, a method used for Pounds 400,000 of sales last year. The computer system has been stolen once and Matches suffered one ram raid. A quarter of the company's turnover is made in its annual reduced-price sales. Chapman's next project is a retail outlet in the US where he is looking for a site. 'I have this idea of a shop where you can buy clothes, have something nice to eat, may be have pottery or antique pens or whatever for sale in the same area making it a unique experience for the customer.'

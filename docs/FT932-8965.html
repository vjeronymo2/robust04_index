			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Books: My awful wedded wife - A new life of Robert Louis Stevenson ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON: A BIOGRAPHY by Frank McLynn Hutchinson Pounds 20, 568 pages FRANK McLYNN is an extremely prolific author of second-rate biographies. Here he does it again and takes 500 pages to tell a familiar story to which he adds a particular spin. Robert Louis Stevenson has always attracted hordes of biographers, no doubt because his short life is a wonderful romance. But do we really need another version so soon after Ian Bell's useful effort a few months ago? Jenni Calder and James Pope-Hennessy are still available and - oh Lord - there are probably more in the pipeline for next year's centenary. The answer depends, of course, on what the biographer has to offer. McLynn is a practitioner of the dreaded new genre of the 'psycho-biography', although his qualifications are by no means clear. For those still ignorant of this fashion, one quotation serves to illustrate the quality of his (psycho)analysis - and also his prose: 'Proper 'socialisation' into normal attraction to the female was further vitiated by the stern Victorian moral code and if Thomas Stevenson was indeed instrumental in ending an early relationship with a prostitute . . . this would both have increased oedipal antagonism between father and son - since Louis would, at least unconsciously, have seen Thomas as a dog in the manger - and left him in a sexual cul-de-sac.' Note that this appalling farrago is dependent on a speculative 'if'. The main point about this book is that McLynn has decided that the wife, Fanny Osbourne, is the villain of the piece and has turned a conventional biography into a polemic of abuse against the wretched woman. Fanny has for long had her critics, who many years ago began to question the portrait of the dedicated wife nursing her consumptive husband. It can be agreed that she was often absent, often ill herself, selfishly extravagant, over-indulgent of her children, 'insanely jealous' of his friends. But in McLynn's portrait she becomes a monster; RLS became 'a martyr to the greedy grasping Osbourne family'; he died at 44 of 'cerebral haemorrhage brought on by overwork and anxiety caused by the Osbourne clan.' This older divorcee from Indianapolis was, from the beginning, 'a very rum creature indeed'. Perhaps she was. But we soon start to wonder whether she can have been devoid of virtue. The vilification of Fanny, and also her children - notably the 'treacherous ingrate' Lloyd - is so obsessive, so constant and unrelieved, that the reader begins to object and say, well, Louis must have liked her, and she did nurse him often, and yes, her illnesses may have been psychosomatic, but that does not mean they were not illnesses. Then there are the poems: 'Dark as a wayside gypsy,/Lithe as a hedgewood hare,/She moves a glowing shadow/Through the sunshine of the fair;/ And golden hue and orange,/Bosom and hand and head/She blooms a tiger lily,/In the snowdrifts of the bed . . .' Biographers are required to be very convincing. For example, it has always been known that RLS dreamed the story of Jekyll and Hyde, and told it to his wife. His first draft of the dream, she convinced him, was not right, and as a result he burned it and started again - to finish with a masterpiece. McLynn sees it otherwise. The diabolical Fanny, concerned principally for a best-seller and alarmed by the 'adult view of sexuality' in the first version, made such a stink that he threw it in the fire. There is no proof for this version of events. It is at least possible that Fanny, as she and Lloyd later reported, realised that the first attempt to communicate the dream which she had already been told about somehow missed the point. No-one can be sure; it does not really matter. Fanny apart, McLynn is good when he writes about sailing in the South Seas (which sounds terrifying), about RLS's ambivalence about the Pacific-as-Paradise, about his constant money worries, about his problems with the Grundyism of the 1990s. McLynn is far too long. He surely overdoes the tension between father and son. He is numbingly boring about Samoan politics. He cannot resist fisticuffs with earlier biographers. More happily, he esteems, in particular, Kidnapped, The Master of Ballantrae, The Beach of Falesa and The Ebb-Tide - with which we can all agree. And RLS survives yet again - the Scottish genius who combined the awkward strands of Calvinism and Jacobitism, the lover who pursued his woman from France to America, the sickly boy who escaped to the South Seas, the lifelong consumptive who recovered his health in the tropics to die there of a stroke. Leave him with this exchange with Henry James, his friend and admirer: of Treasure Island, James had pronounced, 'I have been a child but have never been on a quest for buried treasure.' To which RLS replied in an essay: 'Here indeed is a wilful paradox, for if he has never been on a quest for buried treasure, it can be demonstrated that he has never been a child.'</p>

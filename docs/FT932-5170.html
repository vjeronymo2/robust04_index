			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Pension fund move to limit directors' contracts POSTEL, the UK's biggest pension fund, has warned UK companies that it intends to vote against the re-election of any company director who is on a rolling contract of more than 12 months, a move designed to reduce the size of corporate pay-offs. In a powerfully worded letter to the chairmen of all the FT-SE 100 companies, Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel, which controls Pounds 20bn and has a stake in each of the companies, says: 'Too often recently we have read of senior executives who have been deemed to have failed in their role but, as a consequence of their contract, have been paid off with substantial sums.' He continues: 'I have been given to understand that several other large investment institutions will support this initiative.' Mr Ross Goobey, a former adviser to Mr Norman Lamont, says he is not taking a position on the 'absolute level of executive salaries', which he says is a matter for companies' remuneration committees. He adds: 'A fixed (and renewable) contract of up to three years gives us no qualms'. But says that, with rolling contracts, there is no point at which an executive's employment can be terminated at 'anything other than a high cost to the employer'. Company law allows directors to be appointed for up to five years and longer if shareholders agree. The Cadbury Committee on corporate governance urged last year that contracts be cut to three years. Mr Ross Goobey said that Cadbury had 'fudged' this issue. Mr Ross Goobey's campaign received support from Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive of Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, who said: 'Directors should deliver or get out. They should be on one year contracts as is the practice at Hanson.' But the chairman of another company complained: 'Fund managers are becoming more pompous all the time. They are out of touch with the real world of business'. Mr Ross Goobey says: 'It is up to representatives of the owners to change a situation which is coming a burden on companies.'</p>

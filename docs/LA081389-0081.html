			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PATRIOTS' ROCK-HARD UNDERTAKER HAS SOFT SIDE  </P> <P> As Vincent Brown ponders the question, he folds his arms across his chest and  takes a deep breath. As he does, his shoulder muscles rise like a great  drawbridge, his chest grows wider than an eight-lane highway and his arms,  which seem to house most of the world's surplus steel cable, ripple in ungodly  fashion.  </P> <P> But the easygoing smile on his face shows that Vincent is not even trying to do  anything ungodly. He isn't straining or showing off. He's thinking. Imagine how  he looks when he's flexing.  </P> <P> During the New England Patriots' second-year linebacker's college days at  Mississippi Valley State, a sports announcer dubbed him "The Undertaker,"  because he didn't so much tackle opponents, he buried them.  </P> <P> The Patriots' publicist has already warned you that Brown doesn't like being  called "The Undertaker," and so you ask him about it and he folds his arms and  his already huge muscles swell and you wonder if this is where your life will  end, here in a deserted hallway in the Bryant College gym on a beautiful summer  afternoon.  </P> <P> Then you see the smile.  </P> <P> "The nickname's been blown out of proportion," Brown said. "But it doesn't  bother me that much. I don't care what you call me."  </P> <P> Call him Vincent. Talking to him, you can quickly see he's definitely not a  Vince. "Vince" suggests a wiseacre, a cutup. "Vincent" suggests a  contemplative, serious person. That's Brown. Despite -- or is it because of? --  his forbidding physique, he's probably one of the sweetest guys on the  Patriots, a soft-poken Atlanta native who speaks in carefully crafted sentences  and reads and writes poetry in his spare time.  </P> <P> Poetry is as much an outlet for Brown's frustration as lifting weights is. When  he missed the first four days of training camp last season while his agent and  the Patriots were haggling over salary, Brown wrote a poem about his contract  negotiations.  </P> <P> Writers love the poetry angle, but Brown is reluctant to discuss his poetry or  show it around, out of concern, he says, that people might view him as a  self-promoter, or as someone who doesn't have his priorities straight.  </P> <P> Brown's priorities are to not make waves and to make the Patriots' starting  lineup this season. Both seem like good bets.  </P> <P> "I was taught that if you work hard and treat people kindly," Brown said, "good  things will happen to you."  </P> <P> Brown's beliefs were borne out when the Patriots selected him on the second  round of the 1988 draft, the 44th player chosen overall. He played on special  teams, started three games at linebacker and saw considerable action in a  fourth game against the Cincinnati Bengals when Ed Reynolds injured an ankle.  </P> <P> What slowed Brown's progress is what slows that of so many rookie linebackers,  especially those from smaller schools: reading coverages, being able to go to  the right spot without having to waste a precious split second thinking about  where to go.  </P> <P> "I expected it (the NFL) to be much more physical than it was," Brown said. "I  didn't expect it to be as tough mentally as it was."  </P> <P> To hasten his adjustment, Brown, a criminal justice major in college who hopes  to attend law school some day, hung around New England for part of the  off-season and studied game films two days a week. Still, physically gifted as  he is, he knows that experience is the only real teacher he needs.  </P> <P> "Once the coaching staff feels confident with me (in the game), they'll be  pleased with what I'm able to do," Brown said. "It takes time to develop the  savvy and know-how the other guys (veterans) have. I'm expecting big things out  of myself."  </P> <P> Brown is definitely Coach Raymond -- never "Ray" -- Berry's kind of guy. Berry  calls Brown "one of the finest young men to ever come to this team."  </P> <P> Which is all well and good, but Brown wouldn't have been chosen on the second  round if that's all he was. What he is is a 6-foot-2, 245-pound sinewy mass who  could shame most statues into putting on clothes. He has a 20-inch neck and  wears a custom-made size 54 sports jacket. He can half-squat 800 pounds and  bench-press 490 pounds.  </P> <P> Guys who can bench-press double their weight are almost as hard to find as  7-footers who can bring the ball upcourt. At minicamp, Brown benched 250 pounds  26 times. His body fat was measured at 7.8 percent. Leading one to conclude  that rocks must also have 7.8 percent body fat.  </P> <P> When it comes to pumping iron, as with penning poetry, Brown is reluctant to  extol his feats. He admits to having won a poetry-writing contest in high  school and being able to heft a lot of weight in the gym, but he does not  intend to be anyone's sideshow. He intends to be a football player. A good  one."  </P></p>

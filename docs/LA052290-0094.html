			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: NO. 1 GROSSMONT TO MEET LA JOLLA  </P> <P> No. 1 Grossmont, which received the top seed in the 2-A division for the San  Diego Section baseball playoffs, will be host to La Jolla today. La Jolla  (13-12, 5-7) finished third in the City Western League.  </P> <P> Grossmont (25-2, 8-0) is led by Todd Cady, who broke the San Diego Section  record for runs batted in in a season two weeks ago. Cady, Grossmont's catcher,  has a .441 average, 57 RBIs and eight home runs.  </P> <P> No. 2 USDHS (24-4) will play Clairemont (16-12) at USDHS.  </P> <P> In the 3-A division, top-seeded Poway (19-6-1) will play Southwest (13-13) at  Poway. No. 2 Helix (18-8-1) will be host to Mira Mesa (18-7).  </P> <P> Rancho Buena Vista (21-5), which received the top-seed in the 3-A division  softball tournament, will be host to Granite Hills (13-9) in the 3-A  quarterfinals of the Section playoffs today.  </P> <P> In the 2-A, top-seeded Madison (25-3) will play Carlsbad (12-11) at Madison.  </P> <P> Julian's Travis Denmark, the county's leading hitter was intentionally walked  three times against Mountain Empire last Wednesday. In the third inning, he hit  a two-run homer to give Julian a 4-3 lead. Julian (16-5, 9-2), winner of the  Coastal League championship, won the game, 5-3.  </P> <P> Denmark, who has hit 13 home runs, stuck out nine, giving him 130 strikeouts  for the season.  </P> <P> With a bye this week, Patrick Henry baseball Coach Bob Imlay was free to travel  to Chino for the qualifying tournament of the California Amateur Golf  Tournament, which will be held this summer.  </P> <P> Imlay had a two-day total of 142 to finish tied for fourth, which easily  qualified him.  </P> <P> Harry Rudolph III, a former section champion from La Jolla High, won the  tournament with a 132.  </P> <P> Vista Coach Butch Smith must be resigned to having already played his team's  playoff game.  </P> <P> "Our game against Mt. Carmel was our CIF championship," Smith said. "We thought  if we won that, we would automatically get a berth into the playoffs."  </P> <P> Although Vista won, 6-3, the Panthers did not receive a playoff bid.  </P> <P> Vista finished fifth in the Palomar League with a 6-7-1 record, 12-16-1  overall.  </P> <P> "We have a tough league," Smith said. "Look at Torrey Pines."  </P> <P> Torrey Pines finished 12-16, 3-11, but won the Lions 2-A Tournament in the  middle of the season.  </P> <P> Rancho Buena Vista Coach Steve Hargrave is breathing a sigh of relief. One of  his better hitters, Chris Gorr, was hit on the top of the hand by Poway pitcher  Danny Miller last week. Miller's pitches had been clocked in the mid-80s during  the game.  </P> <P> X-rays showed that Gorr suffered just a bruise.  </P> <P> "That's good news. It would have been tough going into the playoffs without our  No. 5 hitter who's hitting around .400," Hargrave said. "I thought it was  broke. I heard that sound."  </P> <P> Staff writers Martin Henderson and Jim Lindgren contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: FLC problems weigh on New Zealand sentiment - The forestry heavyweight, with other blue chips, has led the market down Fletcher Challenge (FLC), the New Zealand forestry-based conglomerate suffering from a wave of negative sentiment, hit a six-year low yesterday. Other leaders, including Lion Nathan, Brierley Investments and Carter Holt Harvey, also dragged equities back, masking the fact that prices of many second line stocks have remained buoyant. The NZSE-40 index closed 12.82 down at 1,459.96 yesterday, against a high this year of 1,597.45 on July 17. FLC has been the main factor in the fall, declining to NZDollars 2.22 yesterday, down from a mid-June peak of NZDollars 3.80. The latest bout of pressure dates from the annual profits announcement three weeks ago, although trading volume has been low. The fall below NZDollars 2.30 raises concern over the future of the FLC employee trust, which holds around 21 per cent of the capital. At prices below NZDollars 2.30, FLC becomes liable to repay some of the debt incurred from borrowing to buy shares in the market on behalf of staff who pay for them on easy terms. These shares were bought at up to NZDollars 4, although the average is nearer NZDollars 3.50. A total of USDollars 230m is involved at yesterday's prices. A spokesman said that the formula for repaying debt did not start as soon as the price fell below NZDollars 2.30, adding that FLC's exposure, at worst, was only 2 per cent of total debt of NZDollars 8.4bn (USDollars 4.5bn). The group's current difficulties began with a wave of selling from Australia in late July, as rumours spread about the problems involving Jennings, its property associate. FLC had announced in late June that it would be writing off some NZDollars 400m of debt, mainly because of difficulties with Jennings, and that a change in accounting policies to conform with the US practice would produce a loss of around NZDollars 150m after extraordinary items for the year to June 30. In spite of its frankness - FLC confirmed in mid-August a loss of NZDollars 157m on a trading profit of NZDollars 305m - the rumours in Australia intensified. Meanwhile, FLC's difficulties in its Canadian and British pulp and paper operations were well known; the same applies to weaker prices for methanol, in which it is the world's biggest producer following the purchase of Cape Horn Methanol last year. Late June saw drastic revisions in analysts' forecasts for the group, saying that the anaemic world recovery, especially in newsprint demand, would defer its forecast recovery by a year. Most analysts are predicting a profit of around NZDollars 330m for the current year to next June 30, and NZDollars 400m for 1993/94. The market's second-liners are continuing to perform strongly. This is especially the case for stocks such as Ceramco, Steel and Tube, and Mair Astley, which have little or no debt and have been rewarding shareholders with substantial dividend increases. Many of these companies' shares have doubled, trebled or quadrupled in price in recent months. Carter Holt Harvey, New Zealand's other forestry heavyweight, has held firm in spite of a seven-week strike at its former NZ Forest Products' plants. There is continuing speculation that International Paper, which manages the company under an agreement with Brierley Investments, will eventually seek to increase its 16 per cent holding. Brierley Investments has seen its shares fall back from NZDollars 1 to around 85 to 86 cents, largely because of its ownership of Mount Charlotte, the UK hotel group. For several years Fletcher Challenge and Brierley vied for the equity market's number one spot in market capitalisation terms: they are now at numbers three and four, having been replaced by Telecom and Carter Holt. Lion Nathan weakened yesterday, losing 8 cents to NZDollars 4.25, after a high of NZDollars 4.85 earlier this year. This followed the announcement that a joint venture would own and manage the Pepsi soft drink franchise in both Australia and New Zealand. There had been some speculation that Lion Nathan would sell its Australian Pepsi franchise to the US soft drink giant, freeing up capital.</p>

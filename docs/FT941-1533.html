			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The strong sell off in gilts led to a sharp turnaround of nearly 100 points in stock index futures and pulled the cash market lower after UK inflation data disappointed the market, writes Joel Kibazo. Heavy selling of the June contract saw it close at 3,155, at parity with cash but 10 points below its fair value premium to cash of around 10 points. Volume was heavy reaching 23,989 contracts. June had been strong earlier in the day. Having opened at 3,232, buying mainly from independent traders (locals) saw the contract advance to the day's peak of 3,246, just before 9.30am. The announcement of the inflation figures brought a sharp retreat in gilts and a reverse in June. It fell back in heavy selling, once again led by independent traders, reaching a low of 3,149, a decline of 97 points from its earlier peak. The FT-SE June contract in the mid-250 closed at 3,802, but once again the screen showed no turnover in the same contract on the OMLX. It was expiry of the stock options in the Liffe traded options sector. Total volume was 45,430 of which 17,465 was in the FT-SE 100 option and 4,166 in the Euro FT-SE option. HSBC was the busiest stock option at 2,453 lots.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Repap optimistic on outlook US ADVERTISING has reversed its two-year decline, according to Repap Enterprises, North America's third-biggest producer of coated papers for magazines and newspaper inserts. Industry order backlogs, it added, were running 25 per cent higher year to year. 'The US recovery is under way,' Mr George Petty, chairman, said, after Repap's annual meeting. 'A price rise of 6 to 12 per cent, according to grade, due July 1 should stick and European producers will go along.' The increase was led by Champion International, the leading producer. Groundwood coated papers now sell for USDollars 680 to USDollars 800 a short ton. Repap has completed CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.6bn) investments at its New Brunswick and Wisconsin coated paper mills and at its big north-western British Columbia softwoods kraft pulp mill. It was caught by severely depressed pulp and paper markets last year, and delayed a big pulp expansion in Manitoba indefinitely. Repap reduced its losses in the first quarter this year. Mr Petty said that, with higher prices for pulp and coated papers, second-half cash flow would cover interest costs and Repap would be back in the black in 1993. Mr Petty, who admits he underplayed the severity of the recession and Bank of Canada monetary policies, said he saw 'a new golden era' for Northern softwood pulp on world markets because little new capacity was coming on stream. Also, little new North American coated paper capacity was due on stream by 1995. Producers operated at 92 per cent of capacity in April. Mr Petty said Repap would concentrate on reducing more than CDollars 1bn in term debt over the next 18 months. Repap would retain ownership of its new Alcell pulping technology. The first full-scale commercial plants to use it would be financed by outside partners. A demonstration plant had shown the process could operate on softwood as well as hardwood.</p>

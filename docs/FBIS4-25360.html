			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial forum on enterprise ideological and  political work, jointly sponsored by the provincial party  committee's propaganda department and the provincial financial  and economic commission and lasted for two and a half days,  closed in Xining on 2 June. Forum participants exchanged  experiences in doing a good job of enterprise ideological and  political work in the new period and discussed and studied the  question of how to strengthen and improve enterprise ideological  and political work while establishing a socialist market  economic structure. During the forum, Yin Kesheng, secretary of  the provincial party committee, and Wang Hanmin, Standing  Committee member of the provincial party committee and vice  governor, spoke.    Yi Kesheng pointed out: Ideological and political work is  our party's fine tradition. In carrying out the drive for  reform and opening up to the outside world and developing the  market economy, we should vigorously propagate the party's line,  principles, and policies, enhance the consciousness of  enterprise staff members and workers and their willingness to  get involved in reform and working for development rather than  relax our efforts or weakening ideological and political work in  the slightest degree. At the same time, those doing ideological  and political work should be good at summing up advanced ideas  and deeds among the masses of people and give them wide  publicity so that they will become powerful driving forces.    In his speech, Wang Hanmin said: Current enterprise  ideological and political work confronts new developments and  problems. There have been complexity and liveliness in real  work and ideological conceptions. Under these circumstances,  party committees at all levels and enterprise leading comrades  should have a full understanding of the urgency and arduousness  of strengthening and improving ideological and political work at  present. In practical work, on the one hand, they should  develop the spirit of pressing forward in the face of  difficulties and working with perseverance and unswervingly push  reform ahead; on the other hand, they should foster a rigorous  and ample scientific approach, promptly solve problems, and try  their best to put an end to the situation in which those doing  ideological and political work are lacking in initiative and  overcautious and take an inactive and wait-and-see attitude.  Party and government organizations, trade unions, and the  Chinese Youth League organizations in enterprises should work  together, heighten their fighting spirit, carry out enterprise  ideological and political work in a down-to-earth manner, and  contribute to the continuous deepening of reform, economic  development, and social stability.    Also present at the forum were Xiao Xiangcheng, member of  the  provincial party Standing Committee member; Wang Enke, vice  chairman of the Standing Committee of the provincial people  congress; and Ma Tingxiao, vice chairman of the provincial  committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference.    Tian Yuan, director of the provincial party committee's  propaganda department, and department deputy director Luo  Chengyuan also spoke at the forum.</p>

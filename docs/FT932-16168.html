			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Arts: Dear Michael Jackson . . . - Television / Christopher Dunkley writes to the new BBC2 Controller Congratulations] You have just been put in charge of the best television channel in the world. When it was announced that you were to succeed your friend Alan Yentob as controller of BBC2, after his move to BBC1, you were too modest and English to put it like that; you said 'I believe BBC2 is the best and most interesting channel on British television', which implies that somewhere outside Britain there is one that is even better and more interesting. I doubt it. In the past 20 years I have taken a careful look at television in the US and Europe and attended lots of international television festivals. There is certainly good work done elsewhere. Some of those pompous politicians who bang on about British television being the best in the world (having watched the breakfast show in a Washington hotel room and I Love Lucy late at night in Brussels while hunting for Europe's fabled porn) might be quite surprised if you showed them just how good Swedish television drama tends to be, or American news, or Brazilian soap opera. But have you ever come across a channel anywhere else with the range of BBC2, from Red Dwarf to The Late Show, from Newsnight to Floyd On Spain where the quality is maintained through so many programme categories? I have not. On Sunday alone BBC2 showed, as the last in a season of 'Screen Two' dramas, The Snapper, which brought an extraordinarily light touch to the explosive subject of accidental pregnancy in a Dublin family; Every Picture Tells A Story, which put as clearly as I have ever heard on television the arguments for and against the radical renovation of old paintings; and in The Nineties, a startlingly passionate and graphic account of the effects of alcoholism before and during the First World War. I actually thought The Nineties was not quite as impressive as Labour Of Love, another series, recently ended, which also went to very old people to hear them bear witness to history while they are still able, this time on the subject of child rearing in the first half of the 20th century. But that was a BBC2 series as well, or anyway an independent series shown by BBC2. Since this is an open letter and the 40 per cent of FT readers who live outside Britain may be thinking that BBC2 sounds like an awfully worthy network but not a lot of fun, I had better point out that it carries some of Britain's best comedy, too. Last week it showed the last episode in another run of French And Saunders, a female double act which, although it arrived as part of the 'alternative' comedy boom, is now so well established, and so funny, that it is not entirely crazy to talk about the possibility of these two young women taking the place of Britain's immortal Morecambe and Wise. If only French and Saunders would put themselves in the hands of a ruthless editor with instructions to banish self indulgence and pare their over-long sketches to the bone, they really could reach those heights. What is more it was BBC2 that brought us Jennifer Saunders's comedy, Absolutely Fabulous, which has quite rightly just won two BAFTA awards; and the same channel again which is about to start another run of the admirably dangerous comic news quiz Have I Got News For You. But this letter is getting bogged down in detail. What I really wanted to do after congratulating you was remind you of the tremendous responsibility now resting upon you. Television generally is moving down market, not just nationally but internationally. Everywhere public service broadcasters are being forced to compete for audiences and funds and, I suspect, for their very existence against commercial broadcasters who are more concerned now with ratings than ever before. In this country we had until recently two 'protected' channels where ratings were of less importance than programme quality and originality: BBC2 and Channel 4. Now, as one of the last gasps of full-blown Thatcherism, Channel 4 has been driven into the market place and obliged to compete for its own slice of the advertising cake. As you might expect with Michael Grade in charge, it is proving a pretty effective competitor and is regularly achieving an audience share of around 12 per cent instead of the 9 to 10 per cent that it used to get. Whatever the people at Channel 4 may bravely proclaim about sticking to the famous 'remit' to 'be different' and 'cater for minorities' I think we must expect that Channel 4, at least in peak viewing time, will continue to look more and more like any other conventional commercial channel with game shows (The Crystal Maze) soap opera (Brookside) and the largest proportion of American imports in British terrestrial television (The Wonder Years, Mork And Mindy, The Golden Girls and soon The Golden Palace). That leaves just you and BBC2 to defend the faith. True, under John Birt the entire BBC is more likely to go for 'the Himalaya option' and attempt to re-group on the old high ground than to move further out on to the plain to concentrate on fighting ITV and the satellite people for the mass audience. Yet the fact remains that, however novel it may seem to a man of Alan Yentob's tastes (not snootily highbrow, more eclectic and modern, but still many miles from the Bill Cotton school which has traditionally run BBC1) he is going to have to maintain a relatively high level of popularity on BBC1 if the corporation is to avoid being pushed to the margins of British broadcasting. Which is why so much depends upon you. There is now no channel other than BBC2 to which the more demanding viewer can switch, safe in the knowledge that whatever is being shown - cookery programme, arts magazine, documentary series - it will not insult your intelligence. This is not just a form of words. I believe there really is a danger today, thanks to the immense financial forces involved and the steady globalisation of the industry, that television as a whole could become exclusively a mass-appeal tabloid medium. As with tabloid newspapers there would still be good and bad, but, in sharp contrast to the print medium, there would be no The Independent, no The Guardian, no The Times, let alone an FT. I will believe all the talk about digital compression providing 500-channel systems with niche marketing and The Economist of the airwaves when I see it. Meanwhile I look to you to go on providing Newsnight as the most civilised and rigorous round-up of the day's events, and to open up The Late Show to a wider spectrum of attitudes, not, chiefly, in its interviewees but in its presenters. The programme covers most of the right subjects, but often feels more old fashioned than Late Night Line Up. This does not mean 'popularise' it in hopes of winning bigger ratings: we have seen such efforts on BBC2 in last year's Young Musician Of The Year and in the current Soundbites in both of which the essential content - music - has been sacrificed to chat, a desperately retrograde step. You inherit a tremendously strong foundation on which to build. The history series Timewatch and the broadly literary series Bookmark turn out some of the BBC's best documentaries these days, and the Video Diaries idea of supplying amateurs with cameras to record aspects of their own lives has produced some astounding triumphs. You would have to be crazy to harm any of those. If I were you (and your new job is the only one in television that I would ever volunteer for) I would immediately contract the After Dark team to bring to BBC2 the open-ended late-night studio discussion series which Channel 4 was mad enough to scrap. Then I would sit back and think for quite a long time before making any other changes. Good luck, Christopher Dunkley</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Darwin Romero Montiel from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Confirmation of the subsidized student bus fare is  the condition students are demanding to halt disturbances. A  meeting was held behind closed doors at the Interior Ministry  between representatives of the government and secondary and  higher education students. Reporters had to wait outside the  Ministry to learn the results of this meeting. The interior,  education, and transport and communications ministers, and the  Federal District governor were questioned by the secondary and  higher education students regarding the violence in recent days  in Caracas and the rest of the country. The first to leave the  meeting was a secondary school student from the Fermin Toro  secondary school who expressed his discontent. He indicated that  no definite solution was found at the meeting.    [Begin unidentified student recording] They defended  themselves [words indistinct] that President Caldera would come  out to say that it was a lie, that the [word indistinct] did not  agree with that document. This is just political chicanery. [end  recording]    The first questions Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom  had  to answer concerned the remarks by the prosecutor general who  justified the use of firearms by police during student  demonstrations.    [Begin Escovar Salom recording] They have regulation weapons  and their use is regulated. Therefore, I do not know in what  sense the prosecutor general expressed his opinion, but I  imagine that it is legally well-grounded. [end recording]    No concrete solution to the recent student problems came out  of the meeting. In any case, the students reiterated that the  violence will not stop until the transport and communications  minister publicly states that the student fare, which is  scheduled to be eliminated on 31 July, will continue to be valid.</p>

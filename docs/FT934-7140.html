			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Practical Traveller: The Sting in any language A FEW years ago, strolling beside the Nile in Cairo, I fell into conversation with a middle-aged Egyptian. He was charming and affable, well-dressed and well-spoken. I liked him immediately. He was, he told me, a lecturer in middle-eastern history. We stopped for coffee. We talked about Egyptian politics, history, social life. We got along famously; before the hour was up he had invited me to his niece's wedding that evening. We also discussed my own plans to travel around Egypt. He had a contact in the department of railways, he told me, who could issue two-week, unlimited-travel rail passes at considerable savings. Normally they were available only to researchers and academics on official visits. But for me, his friend, it could be arranged. We took a taxi to a vast ministry building. I gave him the money for the pass and waited outside. It was better that way, he said - in shorts and T-shirt I did not look terribly academic. An hour later I was still waiting, and went in to investigate. There was no official who dealt with foreign academics. There was no such thing as a two-week rail pass. And there was no history lecturer. My 'friend' - one of Cairo's accomplished confidence tricksters - had taken the money and vanished. I had no-one and nothing to blame except his wholly convincing act and my own naivete. We live in a sophisticated age where image and marketing power are everything. It is no wonder that street crime, too, uses its own slick methods to exploit the gullibility of travellers unfamiliar with local conditions. There are still plenty of brutal gunmen and dark alleys out there, but there are also lots of perfectly charming people who are capable of lightening your pockets with little more than a smile. What is worse, you will, at least until it is too late, smile right back. The following are just a few of the more common methods of non-violent crime practised on city streets from Mexico to the Philippines. Diversions and distractions. On a pavement in Zambia I once received a hearty handshake from a man welcoming me to his country - so vigorous was it, so engaging his conversation, that it was only minutes later that I realised he had removed my watch from my wrist. In Barcelona once I was taken aback when a young woman with a remarkably prominent chest bumped into me, as it were, head on; I would have liked to think it was true love - her real purpose, though, was to take my mind off the hand slipping into my back pocket. Such diversionary tactics are commonly practised by thieves in crowded places and often planned by groups of two or three. If a man in your path appears to slip, or if two boys begin rough-housing in front of you, beware: as you are bumped and concentrate on not falling, an accomplice may be deftly picking your pocket or slicing your bag open with a razor. Do not even check your money if someone rushes up and says you have just been pickpocketed. This is an easy way of finding out just exactly where you keep your money; five minutes later you might not have any left. Extortion by petty bureaucrats. Policemen, soldiers and minor functionaries are often pitifully paid in the developing world and sometimes cannot resist abusing the power they have to supplement their wages. At Lagos airport, for example, customs officials often bluntly ask departing businessmen for 'presents' - so anxious are these travellers to catch their aircraft that they will hand over money. Extortion at frontiers and in government offices, though, is one case in which the victim has a choice. A polite but firm 'no' is usually enough to make an official back down; the alternative - outright theft  - and its possible consequences are rarely worth his while. Credit cards. Never let them out of your sight. A favourite trick of dishonest Bangkok merchants, among others, is to disappear just long enough with your card to make a number of blank impressions. A few seconds are enough. As they have your signature along with your purchase, they are then free to fake the signature and fill in the blanks as they like. In countries where credit card purchases may be made by telephone, your credit card number alone may be sufficient for fraudulent use. In some cities, customers now ask that even the carbon sheets used to make card receipts be returned to them - anyone might make use of them once thrown in the rubbish. Bank accounts. Be equally cautious about handing out your bank account number. Although banks are leary of wiring money without sufficient verification, crooks who are able to obtain your home account number may try setting up a local account in your name and having funds transferred to it. Some succeed. Impersonation. In Manila, tourists are sometimes stopped by men in neat suits driving large new cars. They flash phoney police badges and explain they are checking for counterfeit bank notes. They invite the tourists to step inside, check their cash, surreptitiously remove whatever pleases them, assure their relieved victims that their money is the real thing, and then drive off. Drugging. Strong doses of barbiturates may leave no marks, but in south-east Asia especially, this is a fast-growing method of robbery. It is easily practised, for local hospitality - a sweet given on a bus ride, the offer of a cup of tea - is hard to resist. Alarmingly, such invitations can end with the guest waking up hours later on a piece of waste ground with a sore head and an empty wallet. It may be a pretty young woman at the post office, or a smiling man who says he was your airport bus driver. These days, sadly, one can never be sure of a smiling stranger's motives. Caution remains the traveller's best companion.</p>

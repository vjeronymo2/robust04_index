			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy After two months of worryingly sharp rises, December's producer price figures show that the upward pressures on industry's raw material costs appear to be abating. With fingers firmly crossed, the Treasury cites this as evidence that sterling's depreciation has done its worst to input prices. Doubters will retort that the full effects of devaluation take time to materialise, but the crucial question will be how soon the recent spurt in industry's input costs feeds through at the factory gate. This seems likely to be a slow, if inexorable, process. Yesterday's figures on output prices show the pressure is not yet that great. Slowing labour cost increases may be helping to stall the inflationary impetus. In addition, although recent CBI surveys suggest companies are itching to raise prices to restore margins, they will find it hard to do so while demand remains weak. This must cast further doubts over the prospects for improved corporate profitability. The good news is that the chancellor appears for a while at least to have a touch more leeway than previously in contemplating further interest rate cuts. He may find the going harder in the summer if UK inflation is picking up and his targets are under threat. With the Bundesbank cutting rates by then he would need determination to take an opposite line.</p>

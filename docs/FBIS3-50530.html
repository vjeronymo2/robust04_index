The leader of the  Movement for the Establishment of Democracy in Haiti [MIDH]  believes that the country is threatened by civil war and foreign  military intervention. Bazin explained that violence can in no  way contribute to a lasting solution to the crisis. For the  first time since he resigned, the MIDH leader cited the work  done by his government of consensus and public safety. He  recalled that at the same period of time in 1992, his government  already had several achievements to its credit. Marc Bazin  admitted, however, that he did not manage to bring the two  opposed parties to the negotiation table. The MIDH leader said a  negotiated, peaceful, fair, realistic, Haitian solution must be  found to the crisis. [passage omitted]</p>

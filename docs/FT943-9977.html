			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Advertising rally produces more confident feeling - WPP/Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Interim results for the two marketing services giants, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and WPP, are expected to reflect the growing confidence in a gradual worldwide recovery in advertising expenditure. Zenith, Saatchi's own media-buying division, in its latest half-yearly forecast of world spending trends, sees expenditure growth of 5.5 per cent this year, compared with 3.4 per cent for 1993. Saatchi is expected today to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m-Pounds 13.5m for the first six months, compared with Pounds 9.1m in 1993. The group will continue to suffer from the loss of some large clients in the US. However, there have also been some recent new business wins, notably for Qantas' overseas advertising and, in the UK, for the National Lottery. Analysts will be particularly watching for signs that the shake-up of the US business is beginning to take effect, and that some headway is being made on improving margins beyond 6.3 per cent. A truce between Mr Maurice Saatchi, chairman, and Mr Charlie Scott, chief executive, following an embarrassingly public falling-out, appears to be holding. WPP's interim results on Wednesday are likely to show pre-tax profits of around Pounds 36m-Pounds 37m, compared with Pounds 24.1m in 1993. The group will be particularly keen to emphasise the good news and impress the institutions: the banks, which bailed the group out in 1992 in a Dollars 271.6m (Pounds 175.2m) debt-for-equity swap, will be free to sell their 190m shares - 26.5 per cent of the enlarged share capital - at the beginning of next month. The biggest new business win of the year has been the scoop by WPP agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather of IBM's advertising worldwide. Margins are again expected to improve, and should be heading towards 8 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> New York's Museum of Modern Art Thursday placed on view Vincent Van Gogh's  "Portrait of Joseph Roulin," which it recently acquired from a private Swiss  collection. The painting, the fourth of a series of portraits of the postmaster  of Arles, France, was completed early in 1889, a year before Van Gogh's death,  and is considered one of the expressionist's finest works from the French  countryside.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Yijun (1728 4135 0193)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 2 Apr (XINHUA) -- In a meeting with  Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans today, Premier Li Peng  said there is no conflict of fundamental interests between China  and Australia; the two countries, bound by extensive common  interests, should work to further their friendly and cooperative  relations.    Li Peng said: Through the two countries' joint efforts,  Sino- Australian relations are developing with a strong  momentum. China hopes the two countries continue to develop  friendly and cooperative relations in all fields.'    He noted that China and Australia share extensive common  interests in upholding peace and security in the Asia-Pacific  region, promoting regional economic cooperation, and developing  their own economies.    He continued: In the current international relations, the  economic factor plays an increasingly important role. Sino-  Australian cooperation in iron and steel, energy,  transportation, and communications has a sound foundation and  holds great potentials for expansion.    Evans said he agreed with Li Peng on this. He said:  Cooperation between the two countries has expanded in both size  and substance. Australia is pleased to see the big momentum of  its trade and economic cooperation with China.    Li and Evans exchanged views on the human rights issue.  Evans said Australia supports the "Vienna Declaration" adopted  at last year's world human rights congress. Li Peng added that  China also supports the declaration and made big efforts in its  drafting.    Li stressed: The declaration has written into it the  numerous developing countries' basic viewpoints and demands on  the human rights issue. It specifically states that the right  to development is an inalienable part of the basic human rights.  The declaration, while affirming the universality of human  rights, says "the characteristics of each country and region and  the importance of their historical, cultural, and religious  background cannot be ignored." In other words, people should  not neglect the conditions of different countries or confine  human rights to only one mold.    He said: The declaration states that poverty and foreign  debt are big obstacles to human rights. Therefore, the right to  development is an undeprivable human right.    Li Peng stated: The latest resolution adopted at the recent  UN Commission on Human Rights shows that it would not do [shi  xing bu tong di 5887 0008 6639 4104] to impose one country's  views on human rights onto others. The only correct way is to  conduct friendly discussions on an equal footing [ping deng you  hao di jin xing tao lun 1627 4583 0645 1170 0966 6651 5887 6062  6158] on the basis of mutual respect and seeking common ground  while reserving differences.    Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation,  exchanged views with Evans in the morning on developing Sino-  Australian trade and economic relations.    Foreign Minister Evans held a news conference in Beijing at  noon.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed standards would require each owner or operator to establish a range of values for each of these monitored parameters during the initial performance test. As long as the control device is operated within the established ranges, the proposed emission standards are considered to be met. Consequently, exceedances of these parameters would be considered a violation of the standards since operating the control device outside of the parameters may reduce the efficiency of the control device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cleaning operations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would require enclosed spray gun cleaners to be visually inspected at least once per month for leaks. The inspections would occur while the enclosed cleaner is in operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Primer and topcoat application operations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Where an incinerator or other control device is used to control organic HAP and VOC emissions from primer and topcoat application operations, the monitoring requirements specified above would be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For control of inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations, the proposed standards would require that the pressure drop across the particulate filters or waterwash be monitored on a continuous basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Depainting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No monitoring requirements for organic HAP emissions are being proposed. For inorganic HAP emissions, continuous monitoring of the pressure drop across the filter, as for primers and topcoats, is being proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chemical milling maskant application operations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Where a control device is used to control organic HAP and VOC emissions from chemical milling maskant application operations, the monitoring requirements specified above would be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Handling and storage of waste.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No monitoring requirements are being proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule proposes to adopt the requirements contained in &sect;63.9 (a) through (e) and &sect;63.9 (h) through (j) and &sect;63.10 (a), (b), (d), and (f) of 40 CFR part 63,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed rule, however, contains additional or clarifying elements and changes certain time periods allowed for submitting or responding to certain reports and requests required in &sect;63.10. These elements and changes are summarized below for each of the operations for which standards are being proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Ibid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

For each cleaning solvent used in hand-wipe cleaning operations that conforms to the approved composition list, the records that would be maintained are the name of each cleaning solvent, documentation demonstrating compliance to the approved composition list, and annual purchasing records showing the annual volume purchased of each. For each cleaning solvent used in hand-wipe cleaning operations that does not conform to the approved composition list but does conform to the vapor pressure requirement, the information required to be recorded would be the name of each cleaning solvent, the monthly usage of the cleaning solvent at each operation, the composite vapor pressure, the manufacturer's data sheets or other documentation of the vapor pressure, and any test reports and calculations performed to determine the composite vapor pressure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For cleaning solvents that do not conform to either the composition or vapor pressure requirements and are used for the exempt cleaning operations, daily records must be maintained of the name and volume of each cleaning solvent at each operation at which it is used, and the parts, assemblies, or subassemblies cleaned at these operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, a record of all leaks from spray gun cleaners would be kept, including source identification, the date that the leak was discovered, and the date that the leak was repaired.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

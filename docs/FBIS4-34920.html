			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elio Henriquez and Jose Gil Olmos] </F>   [Text] Cattle ranchers and small landowners in the armed  conflict area have criticized the appointment of Jorge Madrazo  Cuellar as the new peace and reconciliation commissioner in  Chiapas. Jorge Constantino, leader of the Belisario Dominguez  Regional Union of Rural Small Landowners, flatly said that  "appointing one commissioner is a mistake. There should be  several commissioners, not just one."    He added that his comrades hope Madrazo, "unlike Manuel  Camacho Solis, who left his job incomplete, will work seriously  to solve the problem once and for all. We are in no condition  to keep waiting."    Speaking of Jorge Madrazo, Constantino said "he treated us  badly as president of the National Human Rights Commission  (CNDH) during some incidents in Altamirano Municipality. This,  however, is not the time to chide him. We hope he will change  his attitude."    Constantino's opposition to the appointment notwithstanding,  he expressed his desire that "Madrazo will act impartially with  justice on his side to expedite a solution to the conflict,"  emphasizing that "some of my associaites are disappointed by  Madrazo's actions in Altamirano" earlier this year.    The cattle ranchers' leader said the attitude taken by  Madrazo in those days could spark "negative reactions by cattle  ranchers and landowners in the conflict area."    He emphasized the following: We hope the Zapatist National  Liberation Army [EZLN] accepts the new commissioner appointed by  President Carlos Salinas, because "if he is the cure for what  ails us, go ahead. We do not care who solves it."    The leader criticized former Commissioner Manuel Camacho's  work by saying: "I do not know what positive role he played  because the EZLN refused to accept the government's proposals.  Constantino insisted that Camacho's job was left incomplete.    Francisco Lopez Ardinez, leader of the Ocosingo Cattle  Ranchers Association, said his comrades were "not too pleased  with the appointment." The leader of cattle ranchers in  Ocosingo, one of the municipalities most affected by the armed  conflict, angrily and disapprovingly added: "I would rather say  nothing because the best opinion is the one that remains  unspoken, the one that is interpreted only."</p>

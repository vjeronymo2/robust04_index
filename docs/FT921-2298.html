			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: NBD in Dollars 876m banking takeover NBD Bancorp, the Detroit-based banking group with 457 branches in the midwest, has agreed to acquire the Indianapolis-based INB Financial Corporation, an Indiana bank, in a stock deal worth Dollars 876m. The acquisition is the latest example of how the shake-out in US banking is leading to a series of mergers and takeovers throughout the industry. The deal also underscores the way some US banks are managing to extend their branch networks across state boundaries, even though the legislative reform that would pave the way for more of these transactions remains stymied in Congress. The prime example of this trend is the string of recent acquisitions by the Ohio-based Banc One, a successful regional banking group. NBD, the parent of 20 Chicago area banks with assets of Dollars 5bn, is already the 24th ranked US bank, with total assets of Dollars 31bn. INB Financial is a bank with Dollars 6.6bn of assets that operates 124 offices through six banks in key Indiana markets, including dominant market positions in the central and southern parts of the state. NBD has another Indiana bank deal pending, this one with Summcorp, a banking group with Dollars 2.5bn of assets. NBD said yesterday its total assets following both the INB and Summcorp transactions would be Dollars 40bn. The INB takeover calls for NBD to exchange 1.6 shares of its common stock for each INB share. Wall Street reacted to the midwestern merger by marking NBD shares Dollars 7/8 lower, to Dollars 28 7/8 . INB's shares leapt by Dollars 7 to Dollars 43.</p>

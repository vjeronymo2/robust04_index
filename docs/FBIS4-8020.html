			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "E.W.:" "If Government Gives Rosati Up; </F> President-Coalition Talks Possible Next Week"]    [Text] "The president is open to a meeting with the  governing coalition. But, before the meeting takes place, the  coalition's representatives should take an unambiguous stand on  Lech Walesa's rejection of the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati,"  said Andrzej Drzycimski, the president's spokesman, after  Thursday's [7 April] meeting between Lech Walesa and Sejm  Speaker Jozef Oleksy. According to the Sejm speaker, a meeting  between President Lech Walesa and the governing coalition will  take place next week at the latest. "I am hoping for that, and  I want to be convinced of that," the Sejm speaker said.    A. Drzycimski stated that the president wants to talk with  serious politicians, who take the country's problems seriously.  The spokesman explained to journalists that there is a  precondition for L. Walesa's meeting with the coalition--namely,  it is that common themes exist, and one of those is a unanimous  stand by the coalition regarding Dariusz Rosati, who was a  candidate for finance minister and deputy prime minister but who  was later rejected by L. Walesa. The conversation should take  place within constitutional provisions. "According to the  president, a National Security Council would be an appropriate,  constitutionally allowed place for such consultations,"  Drzycimski stated. The council would include the president, the  prime minister, Sejm and Senate speakers, and the chiefs of key  ministries. The spokesman stated that Oleksy failed to present  the president with a new candidate for the post of deputy prime  minister and finance minister [preceding sentence published in  boldface].    As the Sejm speaker said, the meeting at the Belweder was an  opportunity to talk about all things that concern the country  and raise public concern. Among the topics discussed were the  issue of L. Walesa's nonsigning of the budget law, and doubts  concerning the president's signing the electoral law to gmina  [small administrative units] councils. "I was trying to  persuade the president to sign the budget," J. Oleksy admitted.  Conditions for effective functioning by the government and the  coalition in different areas were also discussed. The Sejm  speaker stressed that he is in favor of the president talking to  the coalition without the media playing the role of an  intermediary, but, instead, in a direct way, with the  participation of people occupying some posts at the central  level. Such a meeting, which, as J. Oleksy stressed, would not  have to be in the form of negotiations, would serve the goal of  better communication and also of defining methods for a better  functioning of the state. "I presented my views. I think they  were the average of the views circulating in parliament; such is  my role there," the Sejm speaker said.    The conversation at the Belweder was also an opportunity to  evaluate the results of a Sejm delegation's visit to Russia, and  also to define the goals of a new, breakthrough strategy with  regard to relations with Japan. A delegation of our parliament  headed by J. Oleksy is going to Japan on Friday. According to a  communique by the Belweder's press office, the Sejm speaker  agreed with the president's suggestion that Walesa should be  consulted over international visits by politicians on the  highest level. This would serve to assure a uniform image of  Polish foreign policy.    NOWA EUROPA asked Jerzy Szmajdzinski (Democratic Left  Alliance), chairman of the Sejm National Defense Commission and  a secretary general of Social Democracy of the Polish Republic,  to comment on the president's proposal:    "I cannot answer the question before the meeting of the  coalition. Personally, I do not share the president's arguments  by which he disqualified Professor Dariusz Rosati. That is why  I cannot be sure whether the next candidate would agree to be  `dissected' over several weeks in all possible ways, only to be  informed three minutes into the prime minister's visit to the  president that, either he has been in Poland too long or he is  not involved in any affair, and these reasons disqualify him  from being deputy prime minister and finance minister. I am  sure the coalition will hold a session before the meeting with  the president, and, during the session, appropriate decisions  will be made."</p>

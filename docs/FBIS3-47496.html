He said the reports about Thai  support for the Khmer Rouge's attack against Cambodian  government soldiers were manufactured by the media, which used  his name to give credence to the reports. The reports were  absolutely untrue.    [Begin Tie recording in Cambodian] The reporters asked good  questions. They were young and beautiful and asked good  questions. I, the defense minister, have never talked about the  Khmer Rouge issue. Reports were written by reporters. For  myself, I have never written such reports.

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Sanguinetti wins close Uruguay election: Ex-president's opposition Colorado party edges home in country's tightest poll Mr Julio Maria Sanguinetti was yesterday declared president-elect of Uruguay, as his Colorado party edged out the governing Blanco party and the left-wing Encuentro Progresista coalition in the country's closest ever election. President Lus Alberto Lacalle called Mr Sanguinetti yesterday to congratulate him and invited him to meet to discuss the March 1 transition, the government said. With about 95 per cent of the nearly 2m ballots counted from Sunday's poll, Mr Sanguinetti had 31.36 per cent of the vote, just over 1 per cent more than Mr Alberto Volonte of the centrist Blanco Party. 'Since the country was divided in three parts, we told him he can count on us so his government can benefit all Uruguayans,' said Mr Volonte, conceding defeat. A 55-year-old free-market businessman, Mr Volonte had only a 0.75 percent margin over former Montevideo Mayor Tabore Vazquez of the Encuentro Progresista (Progressive Gathering). Early this morning with most of the 110,000 still uncounted ballots from Mr Vazquez's bastion of Montevideo, there was a strong possibility the left might end up in second place. Mr Sanguinetti - one of four Colorado presidential hopefuls in a system that combines primaries with national elections - looked set to end up less than 2 per cent ahead of Mr Vazquez, who was likely to finish up with the most individual votes but not become president because Encuentro failed to win at party level. The virtual three-way tie, mirrored in parallel congressional elections, will force Mr Sanguinetti to forge a coalition. The need for cross-party accords is likely to slow Uruguay's cautious reform process still further. Mr Sanguinetti, president from 1984 to 1989, said yesterday he recognised that the narrowness of his victory would complicate his ability to govern. 'This has been the most hotly disputed election in our history . . . our political system obliges us to make great efforts to achieve governability and to enable our democracy - as well as guaranteeing freedom - to be effective and functional,' Mr Sanguinetti said. The election, in which Blanco candidates mustered less than a third of the votes, is likely to be seen as a rejection of the administration's curtailed reform attempts. President Lacalle tried to change the country from an inward-looking welfare state to a more liberal economy competing in the international arena. But his attempts to privatise state corporations, dismantle tariffs and cut social security costs aroused public suspicion, despite reducing inflation and producing healthy economic growth. The very strong showing for Encuentro Progresista, a coalition ranging from social democrats to former Tupamaro guerrillas, is evidence that many Uruguayans place defence of generous social welfare provisions ahead of any desire to adopt the neo-liberal policies sweeping across much of Latin America. Encuentro, which in the early stages of vote-counting seemed close to victory, won easily in Montevideo, the capital, but could not do so in the conservative interior. Mr Sanguinetti, who campaigned on a social democratic platform, will take the reins of a very different Uruguay from the one he led in 1984. Uruguay was then emerging from 11 years of military dictatorship and Mr Sanguinetti, now at 58 already considered a grand old man of Uruguayan politics, saw his main task as re-establishing the country's democratic roots. One of his principal challenges this time will be to forge a new role for the country within Mercosur, the emerging customs union that will from next January integrate the Uruguayan market with its enormous counterparts in Argentina and Brazil. During the campaign, Mr Sanguinetti expressed concern at some aspects of regional integration, particularly its potential to expose fragile Uruguayan industry - and jobs - to fierce competition. He has spoken of the need for properly conceived export policies. He also criticised the Blancos for allowing the peso to appreciate as part of its inflation-beating strategy. This has led to speculation - denied by Mr Sanguinetti - he is contemplating a devaluation. The president-elect has said that a too-strong currency has been prejudicial to exports and has helped to fuel a trade deficit, expected to be Dollars 900m this year. Mr Sanguinetti may well try to slow the peso's appreciation, though he will have to balance this against efforts to bring inflation down from 40 per cent a year now. When Mr Sanguinetti left office in 1989, inflation was more than 80 per cent a year and the government was running large budget deficits, leading critics to question his commitment to fiscal rectitude.</p>

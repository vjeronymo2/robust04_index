			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Abbey closes a missing Link - Clients face charge for withdrawals ABBEY National is to charge its customers for withdrawals from cash machines belonging to other members of the Link network. The fee will be 60p a time but there will be no charge for balance enquiries. The measure, to take effect from June 7, applies only to those people with savings accounts and not to Abbey's current account customers. The society says that less than 4 per cent of its customers will be affected. John Berry, the marketing director, explained: 'The cost of processing customer transactions from non-Abbey National cash machines is currently borne by all of our customers and has risen considerably over the last few years. 'The new charge is simply a way of ensuring that the majority of customers are not faced with the prospect of continued cross-subsidisation.' When a Link cardholder withdraws money from the cash machine of another bank or building society, the card issuer has to pay 43p to that bank or society plus another 'few pennies' to Link itself. Halifax, which joined the Link network in July 1989, has charged its customers for making withdrawals from non-Halifax machines from the beginning. The Link withdrawal facility is provided on Halifax's Maxim current account and its Card cash account. The society says that since it has 1,600 machines, it decided its own customers would never be far from one. The cost is 60p per withdrawal. Nationwide, which this week entered the postal account market dominated by the banks, has introduced a cash withdrawal facility on the new account. Customers will be able to use the society's 730 machines to make a maximum withdrawal of Pounds 250 a day but they will be charged 50p for doing so. The charge for making withdrawals from other Link member machines will be Pounds 1. Nationwide says that although it has highlighted the cash withdrawal facility on the postal account, it is not designed to be (in the jargon) a transaction account but a high-interest postal account. 'The charge is designed to reinforce that distinction. We don't encourage people to use it on a daily basis. It is there for peace of mind,' adds Nationwide. The society is considering introducing charges for customers of its other accounts with a Link card facility who use another society's Link machine. 'The move by Abbey National will colour our thinking,' Nationwide says.</p>

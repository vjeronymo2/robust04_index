			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Socialists to debate Craxi's future MR Bettino Craxi, secretary general of Italy's Socialist party, is under mounting pressure to step down from the leadership and to support the election of a successor at tomorrow's extraordinary assembly of the party. Despite receiving four separate notices from Milan magistrates that he is under investigation for alleged corruption and illicit funding of the party, Mr Craxi has insisted on remaining the Socialist secretary general. He has consistently denied any wrong-doing and accused the magistrates of carrying out a personalised campaign of denigration. The special party meeting has been called to consider Mr Craxi's resignation and elect a new secretary general. But the party has already postponed such a decision on several occasions. However his position has been undermined by the arrest of Mr Silvano Larini, an architect and friend since university days. Mr Larini, who has been on the run outside Italy for eight months, handed himself over to Milan magistrates at the Franco-Italian border post of Ventimiglia on Sunday. Mr Larini has been cited 21 times in documents seeking waiver of parliamentary immunity for Mr Craxi, and is now said to be co-operating with magistrates over allegations that he was a major collector of funds for the Socialists in Milan public works contracts. Behind the scenes Mr Craxi has been trying to ensure he holds sway over any potential successor. He has blocked any suggestion that Mr Claudio Martelli, the justice minister, should lead the party or hold high office. The party faces the difficult challenge of finding a new executive with sufficient credibility to overcome the serious damage inflicted by allegations of its involvement in kick-backs on contracts. The Socialists' only solace is that magistrates are widening their investigations towards Rome, exposing other parties. Yesterday, Mr Vittorio Sbardella, a powerful local Christian Democrat politician in Rome, received notice that he was under investigation for alleged corruption. He is the most senior Rome politician to be linked to instances of alleged corruption. In addition, confessions made to Milan magistrates by a former member of the board of Enel, the state electricity authority, have implicated two Republican MPs in alleged illicit party funding - Mr Antonio Del Pennino and Mr Italico Santori. This is embarrassing for the small Republican party and its leader, Mr Giorgio La Malfa, who has maintained it was outside the corruption net. In another development, Mr Aldo Belleli, owner of a prominent contracting company with overseas interests in oil, was yesterday placed under house arrest following a charge of alleged corruption.</p>

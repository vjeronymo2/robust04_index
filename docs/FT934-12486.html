			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vendome makes dull debut THE market debut of Vendome, the Pounds 2bn luxury goods group spun off from the restructuring of Rothmans, was largely shunned by London investors yesterday, the shares slipping in a weak market. However, the new tobacco-only Rothmans advanced strongly in busy turnover as investors sought the high yield on the stock. Although initially supported, Vendome units quickly came off and dealers reported selling pressure throughout the rest of the session. They closed at 317p, a fall of 13 on the day. Turnover was 2.3m. Rothmans climbed 19 to 403p in volume of 5.4m. Both shares are traded in units and do not qualify for the FT-SE Actuaries series of indices because of the companies' capital structures and payment of dividends. Vendome, which includes the Cartier jewellery group and the Dunhill luxury gift company, had pro-forma profits of around Pounds 200m and earnings of 21.5p per share. However, stores analysts said the stock suffered from a low yield and being relatively unknown to UK investors. Mr William Cullen at Panmure Gordon, the house broker, said: 'Vendome is a long-term class situation with excellent earnings growth prospects.' He added that the units would probably find early support from French and Swiss investors.</p>

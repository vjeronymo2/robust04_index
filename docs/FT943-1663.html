			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Clinton not to seek more nuclear arms cuts President Bill Clinton has decided not to look for deeper cuts in the US's strategic nuclear arsenal until reductions already agreed with Russia have been carried out. After a year-long review of US nuclear strategy, the administration decided against trying to move beyond the limits on nuclear warheads already agreed with Russia in the Start 2 strategic arms reduction treaty, which would cut the US arsenal from around 6,000 warheads to around 3,500. Mr Clinton overruled some senior administration officials who had argued that the US should pursue an agreement on still deeper cuts in the Russian and US nuclear forces. Mr William Perry, the defence secretary, was due to give details of the new nuclear policy yesterday evening. Earlier this week, however, he warned that Russia had fallen behind schedule in its programme for dismantling nuclear weapons. Military officials argued that the US needed to maintain an adequate security hedge against the risk of a reversal in Russia's progress towards democracy and its possible failure to complete its promised cuts. Mr Clinton is expected to offer more money for dismantling nuclear missiles when he meets President Boris Yeltsin in Washington next week. The US has decided, however, to trim its stockpile of short range tactical nuclear weapons, which will leave approximately 480 weapons in Europe. In addition, the US is expected to cut its fleet of nuclear missile submarines from 18 to 14, and reduce the number of B-52 bombers from 94 to 66, instead of complying with the Start 2 limits by having each submarine or bomber carry fewer warheads. The US is now concentrating its efforts on talks aimed at extending the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The White House yesterday also called on China to join the moratorium on nuclear test explosions declared by the other nuclear powers, and urged an acceleration of negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test ban.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: East Surrey aided by exceptional East Surrey Holdings, the property, water and building supplies group, turned in a 45 per cent increase in pre-tax profit for the year to March 31, from Pounds 5.7m to Pounds 8.28m. The outcome included a Pounds 1.89m exceptional profit arising from land sales. Turnover was ahead at Pounds 25.5m (Pounds 24.4m), with Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 21.9m) coming from water supplies. Following a 5 per cent drop in the first half, metered consumption at East Surrey Water returned to the previous year's level in the second half, and the company 'performed well', said Mr John Fooks, chairman. 'Costs are under control and have benefited from lower than average demand during the summer of 1993 and a reduction in water lost through leakage,' he said. Capital and infrastructure spending was increased to Pounds 6.49m (Pounds 5.89m), with expenditure rescheduled to develop treatment works and build pesticide removal plant by December 1995. Earnings per share came out at 56.4p (38.8p). A recommended final of 7.95p brings the total dividend to 12.38p (11.46p).</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / IoD sees surge in business confidence A SHARP improvement in business confidence and activity was reported yesterday by the Institute of Directors, adding to evidence that the economy is climbing out of recession. Mr Peter Morgan, the institute's director-general, said the latest two-monthly survey shows business confidence at its highest level for nearly five years with 64 per cent of directors more optimistic about their company's prospects. Mr Morgan emphasised that the upsurge in confidence was accompanied by a rise in output, orders and profits. Predicting a 'brisk' improvement in economic activity, he added: 'When business confidence and performance are marching together, we have a sound base for sustained economic recovery. But it would be wrong to suppose the economy is back to the levels of 1988. It is only a start to the end of a very deep recession and there is a long way to go.' Mr Morgan said that, because of extensive spare capacity, the UK economy was in a position to sustain an annual growth rate of between 3 per cent and 4 per cent, although that was not likely during 1993. He said the challenge was to ensure 'steady, organic growth which avoids the vast booms and terrible slumps of the past'. Public-sector spending and pay had to be kept under tight control to avoid another inflationary burst. The survey - conducted among more than 300 members of the institute in the first three weeks of April - shows that only 9 per cent of directors are less optimistic about their own company's prospects. The upturn is, according to the institute, being experienced throughout the regions - with the south-east coming through strongly. Nearly three quarters of respondents say their business is doing well. Order books are improving significantly, profits are rising and business volumes are also increasing. However, most directors report no significant change in employment prospects, although a third say they expect some improvement in employment levels within their businesses in the next six months. Investment continues to stagnate, with just over half of the companies taking part reporting no increase in spending. The institute says sluggish investment reflects under-capacity and that spending should rise as recovery takes a hold. The survey puts cashflow at the top of companies' present concerns, and Mr Morgan yesterday asked banks to show understanding as businesses coped with the pressures faced when coming out of recession.

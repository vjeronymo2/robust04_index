			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with Timken that alternative three offers the best solution with regard to termination of the review of Mazda and Mazda transactions through Sumitomo Corp. It satisfies Mazda's request and Timken's affirmation to terminate the review with regard to all sales for export to the United States by Mazda, while enabling us to appraise exports by Sumitomo Corp. for sale to parties other than Mazda. Accordingly, in these final results, we are terminating the review of Mazda with regard to all sales for export to the United States by Mazda. In our instructions to Customs we will clarify our intent that Mazda's rate should be applied to all TRBs sold by Mazda for export to the United States, whether directly or indirectly through any entity. For an explanation of our treatment of Sumitomo Corp., please see the following comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 6:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mazda argues that the Department erroneously treated Sumitomo Corp. (also known as Sumitomo Shoji Kaisha, Ltd.) and Sumitomo Yale Co., Ltd. as one company, when in fact they are two separate, independent firms. Mazda also notes that only Sumitomo Yale was included in the 1980/85 reviews (51 FR 24883) and only Sumitomo Corp. was included in the 1985/86 review (51 FR 32817). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sumitomo Corp. states that it should not have been included in these reviews and should no longer be considered a party to this proceeding because Sumitomo Corp. does not manufacture, import, or further process TRBs. Sumitomo Corp.'s role, for which it receives a fixed commission, in the sale and shipment of TRBs, has only been to arrange for the transport of the merchandise from Japan to the United States in transactions between related parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because Sumitomo Corp. did not respond to the Department's questionnaire, Timken argues that, for exports by Sumitomo Corp. for sale to parties other than Mazda, the Department should apply BIA to Sumitomo Corp.'s entries both for appraisement and to derive the cash deposit rate for future entries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Evidence on the record indicates that Sumitomo Yale and Sumitomo Corp. are, in fact, two separate firms. Evidence on the record also indicates, however, that we sent Sumitomo Yale questionnaires for the 1980/85 periods to which the firm declined to respond. Therefore, in accordance with section 776(c) of the Tariff Act and the methodology outlined in the notice of preliminary results, we have used first-tier BIA to determine the margins for Sumitomo Yale. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Department initiated a review of Sumitomo Corp. only for the 1985/86 POR, we inadvertently sent Sumitomo Corp. a questionnaire for several periods preceding that POR. In addition, we cannot confirm that we sent a questionnaire to Sumitomo Corp. for the 1985/86 review. Therefore, it is inappropriate to use BIA, since Sumitomo Corp. did not fail to respond or otherwise impede the proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have considered several additional facts: (1) the age of the proceeding does not allow for efficient retrieval from Customs of information on suspended entries; and (2) Timken has withdrawn its request for a review of Sumitomo Corp.'s shipments with respect to Mazda for the 1985/86 POR. Therefore, we have accepted the portion of Sumitomo Corp.'s case brief with comments regarding its activities for the 1985/86 POR which provides evidence that Sumitomo Corp. did not sell TRBs to the United States during the 1985/86 POR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, for entries suspended as ``Sumitomo Corp.'' entries for the 1985/86 POR, we will notify Customs to liquidate them at the manufacturer's rate, either based on the final results of this review or as provided for by 19 CFR 353.22(e). Specifically, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(e), Mazda entries suspended as ``Sumitomo Corp.'' entries will be liquidated at the amount of cash deposit required at the time of entry. We further note that we are currently conducting a review of Sumitomo Corp. for the 1992/93 POR, and we will determine in that review the role of Sumitomo Corp. in U.S. TRB transactions based on the information on the record for that review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For entries by all firms for which we are terminating these reviews, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22, we will instruct Customs to assess antidumping duties in the amount of the cash deposit required at time of entry. Existing cash deposit rates will remain in effect for those firms until the next publication of final results of review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA June 5 -- Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh  Cam highlighted the active, important roles of the Non-Aligned  Movement [NAM] in the present world situation, and its two main  goals namely cooperation for peace, stability and development,  particularly the trend for stability and development, in  Southeast Asia, and human rights.    Addressing the 11th ministerial conference of the  non-aligned  countries recently held in Cairo, F.M. Cam noted that in an  interdependent and constantly changeable world, regional and  sub-regional cooperation was of vital importance and great  practical significance.    The Vietnamese chief diplomat noted: `Recently the East Sea  area has witnessed some events that caused great worries to  public opinion in the region and the world, particularly to us  because these events happened on our country's continental shelf  and exclusive economic zone. The international laws demand all  countries to respect sovereignty and territorial integrity of  others including their continental shelf and exclusive economic  zone. We reiterate Vietnam's sovereignty as a coastal country,  and the Vietnamese people's determination to protect sovereignty  over their continental shelf and exclusive economic zone in  accordance with the international laws, especially the 1982  Convention on Sea of United Nations. At the same time, we  reaffirm Vietnam's goodwill stance to settle all differences on  the above-said principles, especially the principles of the 1982  Sea Convention...'    On the human right issue, Mr. Cam noted that the draft final  statement of the conference highlighted the movement's  fundamental viewpoints, the principles of independence,  sovereignty, self-determination and freedom to choose the path  of development of all nations. He stressed that the movement's  official documents relating to human rights should reserve a  worthy part to the right of national development as a  fundamental human right. We cannot accept the use of human  rights as condition for relations among countries. This, he  said, does not start from the principle of respect for national  sovereignty and equality among nations moreover it violates the  rights of development of all nations.    The Vietnamese foreign minister stressed it is the people of  each country who have their rights to judge and push ahead the  implementation of human rights in their own countries.    During his stay in the Egyptian capital, F.M. Nguyen Manh  Cam met with foreign ministers and head delegates of a number of  countries including Egypt, Cuba, India, Laos, Cambodia, the  ASEAN Cam met with foreign ministers and head delegates of a  number of South Africa.

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Morocco completes withdrawal from SNI The Moroccan government yesterday announced the sale for about Dollars 190m of 51 per cent of Societe Nationale d'Investissement (SNI), the holding company which has significant interests in a range of big local companies, to a consortium of local and overseas interests. International investors have bought 16 per cent of the company's total equity, although two-thirds of these shares must be sold on the Casablanca stock exchange within the next three years. Mr Alex Papadimitriou, associate director of Swiss Bank Corporation, which, along with Banque Pallas Stern, advised the government, described SNI as 'the jewel of Moroccan state-owned companies'. The sale, which completes the government's withdrawal from SNI, is the largest to date in the Moroccan privatisation programme, itself the most significant in Africa and the Middle East. Banque Commerciale du Maroc led the consortium which completed the purchase. The shares were priced at Dh425 (Dollars 48.90).</p>

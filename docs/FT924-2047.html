			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Fisons Fisons will have to deliver more than well-timed disposals to convince the market that it is, if not completely out of the woods, at least in possession of a map. Granted, it could hardly choose a better time to sell its consumer health interests. The generous multiples paid by Roche for the UK consumer brands yesterday and by Ciba-Geigy for the north American business last month underline the scramble among pharmaceuticals giants to carve a position in over-the-counter medicines. Assuming the horticulture division also fetches a decent price, Fisons will soon be free of debt. However neither the consumer health business nor the balance sheet were ever the root of Fisons' problems. For all the new faces at board level and lower down the hierarchy, there is no conclusive evidence that the rift with the US Food and Drug Administration has healed. Valuable time and earnings are being lost, not least because Opticrom's US patent expires next year. With scientific equipment likely to remain under pressure, earnings recovery hinges on an early and successful US launch for Tilade, the asthma therapy. The US regulator seems unlikely to muster enough seasonal goodwill to clear both Opticrom and Tilade before the year end. Even if it did, there can be no certainty that Fisons has sufficient marketing skills to make the best of the opportunity. Co-marketing agreements with other drug companies - under consideration but not yet concluded - would help. A yield of 5.3 per cent and a secure dividend should provide support for the shares, but on past performance the market can hardly be blamed for taking little on trust.</p>

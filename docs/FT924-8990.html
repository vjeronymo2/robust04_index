			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Fashion: Serious warm-ups SERIOUS walkers, skiers, sailors, alpinists and other wanderers in chilly parts probably already know about Helly-Hansen, a Norwegian company which has supplied undergarments to expeditions to the North Pole, to climbers of the Eiger and to round-the-world sailors, writes Lucia van der Post. This year sees the arrival in Britain of its range of pukka skiwear, called Equipe. Those who would be truly warm can aim for three separate layers. Start with the inner thermal layer, LIFA, which consists of thermal tops and bottoms in varying styles. Then you should add the fleecy layer, called Propile. Finally, we come to the outer waterproof layer of Helly-Tech, one of the new breed of breathable fabrics. The outer garments incorporate all the functional details the serious skier requires. There are high collars, double covered zips, ribbed inner collars, snow stops, hoods with adjustable peaks, zipped pockets, breathable linings, drawstring waists to keep snow out and ventilation zips. Salopettes are Pounds 121.99, jackets, Pounds 185.99 and Pounds 197. A good range is stocked by Ellis Brigham, 30 Southampton Street, London WC2, Canyon Mountain Sports, 92 Granby Street, Leicester and One Step Ahead, 177 Morningside Road, Edinburgh.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Paris Remy Cointreau is due to report final results this week and analysts are uniformly upbeat about the prospects. The Estimates Directory quotes a consensus forecast of a 22 per cent rise in net profits. That would be in line with the performance at six months when profits were up 24 per cent. Despite slower growth in the third quarter, due mainly to tax changes in China, turnover for the nine months to December was up 6.2 per cent. The last quarter traditionally benefits from higher sales in south-east Asia, particularly over the Chinese new year. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "No Return to War Areas"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 25 Apr -- In Bonn on Monday [25 April],  Interior Minister Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) and  Croatian Interior Minister Jarnjak signed an agreement "on the  reacceptance of persons" that controls the issue of repatriating  Croatian refugees from Germany to their homeland. The two  governments agree to a two-phased procedure that takes into  account the destruction and occupation of Croatian areas by the  Serbs. Basically, it will be possible to send Croatian refugees  back to their country from 1 May onwards. However, the agreement  contains an exception clause. "The repatriation of former war  refugees, whose origin from a locality situated in damaged,  fought for, or occupied areas of the Republic of Croatia can be  proved, as well as Croatian war refugees from the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, will be provisionally discontinued until  January," says the agreement. A Croatian diplomatic  representation in Germany must certify that these criteria  apply. Refugees from occupied or damaged areas should be  repatriated from Germany even before January 1995 if a  cease-fire comes into effect in Bosnia-Herzegovina or if  Croatia, for its part, "commences the repatriation of war  refugees to Bosnia-Herzegovina."    Kanther said that the acceptance of refugees as an act of  charity should not be construed as a "permanent right of abode."  Croatia needs people to reconstruct the country, he said.  Germany will help Croatia obtain help from the European Union  [EU]. Kanther promised that Germany would support negotiations  on a cooperation agreement between the EU and Croatia. On the  subject of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kanther said that Germany would  also consider the situation in that country when repatriating  refugees. However, the principle remains whereby once the war  is ended, there is no reason to accept refugees in Germany.  Acting Croatian Prime Minister Kostovic said his government was  holding talks with the Bosnian Government on the subject of  repatriating refugees, but nothing has been decided because of  the situation in Bosnia. There will be a conference on this  subject in Ljubljana in the beginning of May, under the aegis of  the United Nations.    Kostovic pointed out that his country has accepted 280,000  refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina. Another 250,000 Croatian  refugees have fled from Serb-occupied areas. There are only 800  vacancies in refugee camps operated by the Croatian Government.  According to Croatian Government data, the first phase of  implementing the agreement will not pose an excessive burden on  Croatia. The returning refugees could be accommodated in their  former homes. The accommodation of Croats from Serb-occupied  areas will be more difficult. Kostovic expressed his thanks for  the German Government's help. The Croatian Government claims  there are 70,000 Croatian refugees in Germany. Some 20,000 of  them come from Serb-occupied areas. The interior ministers of  the German laender resolved last year that the reprieve on  deporting Croatian refugees would expire at the end of January,  but this deadline was subsequently extended to the end of April.  In February, the conference of interior ministers adopted a  two-phase procedure that takes into account the marital status  and regional origin of refugees.    During the negotiations, the Croatian side assured the  German  Government that it has declared an amnesty for Croatian citizens  who avoided military service or deserted between August 1990 and  September 1992. "Croatia guarantees the protection of human  rights; discrimination over race, religion, ethnic origin, sex,  social connections, and political opinion is out of the  question," says a note from the Croatian Government.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Why farmers feel hedged in: Conflicts over access to the countryside Mr Oliver Walston, who farms 2,000 acres in Cambridgeshire and is an iconoclast in the agricultural industry, adopts an earthy tone to explain the antipathy of many farmers towards those who enjoy walking across their property. 'The ownership of land is the second most basic human feeling after sex,' he says. 'Anyone who interferes with that is playing with very strong emotions indeed. Farmers get terribly, terribly upset.' This sense of defensiveness largely explains why some farmers block footpaths on their land by ploughing them up, growing crops over them, building fences or walls across them, or placing a bull in the adjacent field. And it also explains why yesterday the Countryside Commission, which advises the government on rural issues, launched its 'milestones' initiative. Local councils will be asked to set out what action is needed if the commission is to achieve the target it set six years ago of opening and making usable all 120,000 miles of footpaths, bridleways and byways in England by 2000. According to the commission's last survey in 1988, walkers have a 67 per cent chance of being unable to complete a typical two-mile country hike because footpaths have been obstructed. Since then, the commission believes local authorities, farming and landowning organisations have been won over to the principle of improved access, but this has not yet been translated into practical steps by all farmers. A survey last year by the Ramblers' Association found that a large number of farmers were ignoring provisions of the 1990 Rights of Way Act, which made it an offence not to restore public paths and bridleways promptly after ploughing. Protecting existing rights of way touches a sore spot for some farmers. But Mr Walston goes further. His suggestion is that farmers should allow people to beat new paths of their own choice across agricultural land, provided they close gates and steer clear of crops and livestock. Mr Walston has posted signs on his farm which welcome walkers and horseriders subject to these conditions. Other farmers, he argues, should follow his lead to overcome the bad image farmers have in the public eye largely because of the scale of grants they receive from the European Union. Direct payments to UK farmers this year will total more than Pounds 1.6bn, including Pounds 130m for 'set-aside', under which farmers have to withdraw land from cultivation to cut overproduction. 'What are you going to say when someone asks what you're doing to deserve this?' Mr Walston asks his fellow farmers. 'You've got to have a rather better reply than: 'We're being very nice, we're producing food.' ' The response from many farmers to proposals as radical as Mr Walston's has been one of horror. Mr David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, accepts that 'there are farmers who won't allow people to exercise their rights of way'. But, he says, granting total public access would lead to abuse of the countryside by irresponsible elements such as mountain bikers, jeopardise farm safety, disturb farmers in their homes and interfere with nature conservation. If landowners refuse access on their own terms they could have 'very unpleasant' legislation forced on them to strengthen the rights of ramblers, Mr Walston warns. But, at least in the immediate future, punitive legislation seems unlikely. The government's policy is currently to promote greater access and 'green farming' largely via the system of agricultural grants. The Countryside Stewardship scheme, for example, will pay out Pounds 10.6m in the 1994-95 financial year to farmers who use more environmentally friendly production methods and allow public access where there was none before. Launched by the Countryside Commission in 1991, the scheme has opened some 200 miles of footpaths and bridleways and about 37,000 acres of land to public access. Similarly, under plans drawn up by the government in response to reforms of the European Common Agricultural Policy, farmers will be eligible for grants for introducing and maintaining public access to their land in environmentally sensitive areas and in set-aside. That could mean aid for upgrading paths or restoring hedgerows. Trying to change the behaviour of farmers via subsidies is well tested - and highly successful. Mr Peter Pemberton, of Bidwells, the Cambridge-based land agents says: 'It is incredible sitting here in the green 1990s to think that there were substantial grants for pulling out hedges, grubbing out woods, ploughing up pasture, draining marshes, and here 20 years later is the same level of grant for putting them all back again.' It may be that taxpayers are happy to see their money spent in ways that make farming less intensive. A Newcastle University survey published this month suggested that people would be prepared to pay much more for environmentally sensitive areas in which farmers are rewarded for 'environmentally beneficial' farming. But there are potential pitfalls in paying for public access, as the Countryside Commission acknowledges. It accepts that some farmers, particularly in remote uplands, who have no qualms about allowing walkers over their land without being paid a subsidy, might resent payments suddenly being made to encourage others to do same. Moreover, if public access depends on receiving subsidies, landowners could withdraw that right of access if at a later date the subsidies were phased out. That partly explains why the Ramblers' Association is pressing for a statutory 'right to roam' across open country so that access, once granted, could not be withdrawn at will by the landowner, or when an environmental scheme comes to an end. 'Being a landowner doesn't give you the exclusive right of enjoyment of that land. It's not the same as someone's back garden,' says Mr David Beskine, the Ramblers' campaigner on rights of way. The association is adamant it is not disputing ownership. 'We're concerned with having the right to walk over the land, without impinging on domestic privacy or depriving the owner of any income-bearing potential of that land,' says Mr Beskine. The growth in the association's membership from 38,000 to 94,000 in 10 years illustrates the increasing influence of recreational walkers. Mr Beskine says members are increasingly frustrated at the siege mentality of some landowners. Some of their members, and others who have met obstacles during country walks, might prefer more extreme measures - such as the withdrawal of CAP subsidies if public access is not provided to land where it could do no harm.</p>

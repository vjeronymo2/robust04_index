			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Scrapping to scrap the agreement - Breaking Britain's accord with the Irish Republic is a Unionist electoral goal On a clear day, Scotland can be seen from the coast of County Antrim in Northern Ireland. Just 15 miles away across the Irish Sea, it is the closest the British mainland comes to Ireland. The most visually spectacular part of the province, where tourists visit the Giant's Causeway, is the heartland of Paisleyite politics. The Reverend Ian Paisley, a giant of a man himself, champions the cause of maintaining and strengthening the increasingly tenuous union with Britain across that narrow stretch of water. The manifestos of Paisley's Democratic Unionist party and of the Ulster Unionist party led by James Molyneaux, both set the scrapping of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement as their main electoral goal. The Unionists see the agreement as a betrayal of the union. Dublin must have no role in Northern Ireland's affairs they say. They are campaigning for a devolved regional assembly, but at the same time want stronger constitutional links with Britain. Proposals by the nationalist SDLP for Northern Ireland to become a region of a federal Europe, and be considered with the republic for the purposes of EC funding, would lead to eventual rule from Dublin, say the unionists. Canvassing in pouring rain in his North Antrim constituency town of Ballymena, Paisley flashed his characteristic broad grin at passing drivers who tooted their horns and gave him the thumbs-up. 'We are not against being good neighbours with the Republic, but we are against being taken over. As a region of Europe we would become an annexe to Eire,' he said. But can the Unionists hope to increase their share of the vote on such a platform, with unemployment at 15 per cent in the province and terrorism deterring inward investment? Hostility to the Anglo-Irish agreement was the main feature of Unionist manifestos in the 1987 election, when their total share of the vote fell by 2.3 percentage points to 54.8 per cent, and the UUP lost the border constituency of South Down to the SDLP. Demographic trends are working against the Unionists. In the four Belfast constituencies, the number of registered voters has fallen by some 14,000 to 217,000, over the past 10 years. Most are middle and working-class Protestants moving out to new housing estates in the suburbs. As a UUP party official said: 'They are moving to constituencies where the Unionist vote does not need strengthening.' He added that '51 per cent of the children in the schools are now Catholic'. The fact that, for the time being, the nationalist vote is split between the SDLP and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, assures the Unionists of holding on to Fermanagh and South Tyrone, Mid-Ulster and North Belfast. All three could fall in a future election to a combined nationalist vote. The SDLP last month rejected a move by Sinn Fein to agree a 'compromise candidate' to challenge the UUP's Ken Maginnis in Fermanagh and South Tyrone. The UUP holds nine of the 17 Northern Ireland seats and the DUP three, all with comfortable majorities. In North Down, the DUP is fielding a candidate against Jim Kilfedder, the veteran independent Unionist - the Alliance party and the Conservatives are also standing. Traditionally, the UUP has been the party of Protestant gentlemen farmers and middle class, while the DUP has attracted working class votes. Differences between the UUP and DUP 'are now mostly over personalities and style', according to Peter Robinson, the DUP deputy leader and the sitting candidate for East Belfast. The DUP and UUP are confronting each other only in three constituencies where the total Unionist vote is so large that a split could not let in a nationalist. Robinson said these contests were in preparation for elections to a devolved assembly, which both parties expect to take place next year. 'People will vote for who is seen to be the better Unionist,' he said. The issue of Europe reveals deeper differences. The DUP is implacably opposed to the Maastricht treaty and moves towards regionalisation and a federal Europe. The UUP is more circumspect. It has a European office at its headquarters in Belfast and its manifesto states 'it is prudent to contribute in a positive sense to the various internal debates within the community institutions'. The DUP says it is the only Northern Ireland party that opposes the Delors proposals on European political union and is not part of any political grouping in the European parliament. Paisley says the UUP is allied with the 'mainly Roman Catholic' European Christian Democrat block. Robinson's office is at the Dundonald Ice Bowl, a bowling and ice rink built two years ago with 50 per cent funding from the European Community. The shouts and screams of children playing filter up to his office. 'I am quite happy to milk the cow before slitting its throat,' he said. In the event of a hung parliament, both the DUP and UUP say that with the 12 combined seats they can hope to retain, they will not enter into a coalition, but will vote as a block supporting the incoming government for as long as this serves unionist goals. In spite of Labour's manifesto commitment to a united Ireland, both say the Conservatives 'have done more damage' to the union, than has Labour when in government. A hung parliament is possibly the Unionists' last hope to reverse the Anglo-Irish agreement, and place a bulwark against the 'Europeanisation' of Northern Ireland. For the Unionists, taxes, government spending and investment are secondary issues in this campaign. Like the rain which frequently blots out that view to Scotland, such considerations obscure the 'real' issue of Ulster's link to Britain. They confidently expect the voters will prove their point.</p>

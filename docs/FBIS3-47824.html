			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Cha-su: "Turning the Joint Declaration of </F> the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula Into an  International Treaty"]    [Text] The Foreign Ministry feels nervous about minimizing  the stir regarding the report that the United States is calling  on the ROK to turn the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization  of the Korean Peninsula into an international treaty. It seems  the Foreign Ministry is concerned about a breakup of the  cooperative system with the United States, which may take place  during the final stage of the U.S.-North Korean negotiations.  <H5>  The Government's Position </H5>   The government opposes the U.S. proposal to turn the Joint  Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula into  an international treaty. That is, the government contends that  because the joint declaration of denuclearization signed in 1992  is not a treaty between countries but an agreement signed within  the nation, the government does not need to turn it into an  international treaty.    The government believes the issue of North Korea constantly  keeping nuclear reprocessing facilities, even after adopting the  joint declaration of denuclearization, should be resolved  through North-South dialogue. In other words, the government  believes that the government should persuade North Korea to  destroy the nuclear reprocessing facilities through the Joint  Nuclear Control Committee and, then, abide by the joint  declaration of denuclearization.    A government official explained that "the U.S. proposal to  turn the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean  Peninsula into an international treaty is a result of  considering North Korea's demand for a guarantee that a nuclear  preemptive strike on the DPRK will not take place." That is,  there is a possibility that because North Korea indeed regards  as serious a nuclear threat from the United States and others,  it may stick to nuclear development. Thus, in order to ease  North Korea's threat, it is necessary for the nuclear-possessing  countries to promise not to conduct a nuclear attack on North  Korea.    Government officials have analyzed that the United States is  intending to supplement the weak points of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) by turning the joint declaration  of denuclearization into an international treaty. The current  NPT regulations stipulate that NPT member countries can have  nuclear reprocessing facilities and inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are only required of  the plutonium produced from the nuclear reprocessing process.  Accordingly, if the joint declaration of denuclearization is  turned into an international treaty, North and South Korea  cannot have nuclear reprocessing facilities so suspicions of  nuclear development on the Korean peninsula will be fully  abolished. There was a (Tulatert) protocol signed by South  American countries, including Brazil and Argentina, in 1967 in  which the nuclear-possessing countries acknowledged the contents  that had been agreed upon by the relevant countries.    At that time, when the South American countries resolved not  to develop and possess nuclear weapons, they called on the  nuclear- possessing countries, including the United States, to  acknowledge the guarantee of refraining from a nuclear attack on  them. Thus, the nuclear-possessing countries turned the  agreement into an international treaty through a protocol.    It can be said that the United States has tried to apply  this  precedent to the Korean peninsula.  <H5>  Reaction From the Academic World </H5>   Scholars generally oppose the U.S. proposal to turn the  joint  declaration of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula into  an international treaty.    Dr. Chon Song-hun from the Institute of National Unification  said: "To turn the declaration of the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula into an international treaty, the nuclear issue  of the Northeast Asian countries surrounding the Korean  peninsula, including China and Japan, as well, should be  discussed simultaneously."    Dr. Chon stressed that "either the whole Northeast Asia area  should be denuclearized or nuclear-possessing countries should  clearly assure that they will not launch a nuclear attack  against North and South Korea."    Professor Yun Tok-min from the Research Institute of  Diplomatic and Security Affairs, too, insisted: "If North and  South Korea are to declare to the world that they will not  possess nuclear reprocessing facilities permanently, all  Northeast Asian countries should also clearly promise that they  will not possess nuclear reprocessing facilities."    Concerning the nuclear reprocessing facilities in North  Korea  Professor Yun also stressed that "this problem should be solved  according to the principle of solving problems between the North  and the South."    Professor Yi Sam-song from Hallim University said that from  a  long-term perspective nuclear reprocessing facilities should be  completely eliminated from the Korean peninsula. He said that  nuclear reprocessing facilities themselves are synonymous with a  nuclear waste processing plant and that, therefore, there is a  high possibility of creating environmental pollution. He also  said that due to the development of the technology of nuclear  energy, there is a high possibility of developing substitute  fuel, which is more stable and efficient than plutonium  extracted through the nuclear reprocessing process.    Professor Yi said, however, that we should prudently  consider  the fact that the issue of abolishing reprocessing facilities on  the Korean peninsula should be settled in consideration of the  appropriate process to be taken and of mutuality [sanghosong].  What professor Yi insists is that the issue of abolishing  nuclear reprocessing facilities on the Korean peninsula should  be pushed ahead in combination with the issue of denuclearizing  the whole Northeast Asia area after the nuclear negotiations,  which are being held between North Korea and the United States,  reach a comprehensive solution.    In other words, in its negotiations with North Korea the  United States should, first of all, discuss the issue of  abolishing nuclear reprocessing facilities after it has cleared  North Korea's apprehensions of a security threat. Only through  such a process, can the joint declaration of the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula be developed into one  which declares that the countries surrounding the Korean  peninsula, such as China and Japan, should not possess nuclear  reprocessing facilities.    In conclusion, many scholars hold that the issue of  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula should be solved in  accordance with the principle of solving problems between North  and South Korea, without destroying the potential for possessing  nuclear reprocessing facilities in case of need in the future.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In reviewing actual cases, we concluded that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of repeat substandard quality of care in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified facility should be made without regard to the type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of program participation involved; that is, any standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys conducted in the facility for Medicare, Medicaid or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both should be considered. Since the survey process is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same for both Medicare and Medicaid participating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, there is no reason to consider the facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type of program participation in the determination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether repeated substandard quality of care has occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These issues are being clarified in &sect;488.414.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also concluded that sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act indicate statutory intent that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific remedies be imposed any time substandard quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care is repeatedly noted. Further, the Congress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically provided the authority for continuation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these remedies after compliance has been achieved. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress' specific description of how this type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance must be dealt with clearly sets it apart from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the handling of other cases. Therefore, we have concluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a facility's allegation of compliance or actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment of compliance following the third consecutive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard survey which found substandard quality of care will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not stop the imposition of the denial of payment or State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring. The remedy may be lifted when the facility has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated its ability to maintain substantial compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the satisfaction of HCFA or the State. This point is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also being clarified in this section of the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A number of commenters asked for a clearer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``substandard care.'' Some asked whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substandard care and substandard quality of care are one and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same. Others pointed out that sections 1819(h)(2)(E)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act specify that action is to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken based on the provision of substandard quality of care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are changing the regulation to match the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act and indicate that this provision will apply when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substandard quality of care is identified. For the purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this provision, substandard quality of care is defined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.301.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters requested that the word  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``standard'' be inserted between ``consecutive'' and ``surveys.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They pointed out that the proposed regulation does not match  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wording of the Act at sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(2)(D), both of which specify that the substandard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality of care must be identified in three consecutive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard surveys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with the commenters. We are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amending this section to indicate that the repeated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substandard quality of care must have been noted through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three consecutive standard surveys. Standard surveys are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those described in &sect;488.305.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Four commenters asked for a clearer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of repeated noncompliance. Two commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that repeat noncompliance should be defined as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual repeats of the same problem and the content of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency and not just a repeat of a deficiency at the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tag number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act clearly indicate that action must be taken when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repeat noncompliance in the form of substandard quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care is identified. The Act does not narrow the scope to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify that the basis for finding substandard quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care in a facility must be identical from one standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey to the next or for all three of the consecutive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard surveys considered in making the determination that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repeated substandard quality of care has occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, we do not believe that the regulation should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more narrowly define what constitutes substandard quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care for the purpose of this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulation is being modified to clarify that action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be taken any time any deficiencies which constitute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substandard quality of care are identified in the last three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consecutive standard surveys. This provision will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied solely on the basis of the repeated finding of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substandard quality of care, and no attempt will be made to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether the substance of the noncompliance or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exact tag numbers for deficiencies which constitute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance were repeated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

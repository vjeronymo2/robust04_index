			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Legal action over chatlines FORMER telephone chatline operators are to be sued in an attempt to make good a Pounds 1m shortfall in the fund to compensate people facing substantial bills because of abuse of the services by others. The High Court yesterday gave the compensation fund trustees leave to sue most of the companies which operated the services. Writs have so far been issued against eight of the 12 former operators. Earlier this week, Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, acted to halt the services.</p>

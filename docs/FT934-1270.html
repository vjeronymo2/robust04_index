			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / From award winner to can carrier: Heinz Schimmelbusch's rapid fall from grace as Metallgesellschaft's crisis becomes clear Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the charismatic Austrian ousted as chief executive of Metallgesellschaft on Friday, was once the darling of German management circles. It was only in 1991, at what in Germany is the tender of age of 47, that Mr Schimmelbusch was elected German manager of the year. Two years later, his career at the Frankfurt-based metals, mining and industrial group has been abruptly and ignominiously brought to an end - for alleged mismanagement. Together with his finance director, Mr Schimmelbusch was fired at a specially convened meeting of the group's supervisory board. He was accused of not keeping the board properly informed of problems at MG Corp, the group's US trading subsidiary which last week forced Metallgesellschaft to turn to its bankers to fend off a liquidity crisis. Four further directors were nudged out - two into retirement, two demoted - and a new management team was appointed, headed by Mr Kajo Neukirchen, former chief executive of the Hoesch steel group and a restructuring expert. The scale of the management changes is believed to be unprecedented for so large a German company. They point to the seriousness of MG Corp's problems with its dealings in oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, problems which have yet to be quantified as investigations continue. Equally unprecedented is the turnaround in Mr Schimmelbusch's fortunes. One of the youngest chief executives of a large German company when he was appointed in 1988, he quickly won a reputation as a visionary strategist - able to woo both the Anglo-American investment community and the executives of Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and the Allianz insurance group which together own 26 per cent of Metallgesellschaft's shares and dominate its supervisory board. Mr Schimmelbusch, a man capable of being abrasive and charming in equal measure, joined the Frankfurt-based group more than 20 years ago after an early career as an economics lecturer and a year with investment banks in New York. Wall Street enriched his fluent English with a store of expletives which sometimes shocked the lunch guests he used to take to his favourite Italian restaurant on the outskirts of Frankfurt. While armed bodyguards waited outside, he would deliver his monologues on the future of Metallgesellschaft, and guests left impressed at the eloquence of a gifted salesman. With annual turnover of about DM25bn (Pounds 9.9bn) generated from about 250 subsidiaries, Metallgesellschaft owes its current structure to Mr Schimmelbusch. His strategy was simple: to reduce the group's dependence on base metals by making acquisitions in other business areas. Between 1989 and 1992 he spent about DM2.5bn, culminating in one of the biggest transactions in post-war Germany - the DM1.45bn purchase of the non-paper divisions of Feldmuhle from the Swedish Stora group. While the Feldmuhle acquisition, which included the Buderus and Dynamit Nobel industrial companies, has yielded healthy profits, the focus of his smaller purchases now seems misguided. His aim was to build Metallgesellschaft into the largest provider of environmental services in Europe. The group has nearly 90 subsidiaries in areas such as recycling, pollution control and decontamination. Mr Schimmelbusch hoped that other European countries would catch up with Germany's high standards of environmental legislation. But although turnover from environmental services was DM2.8bn in the year to September, demand has simply not developed as planned and profits were a derisory DM31m. As a strategy aimed at insulating Metallgesellschaft from its dependency on metals and mining, it failed. The group has been hit hard by the downturn in metals prices, partly caused by an influx of cheap imports from the former Soviet Union, and by the severity of the German recession which drove subsidiaries such as Kolbenschmidt, in autocomponents, into deep losses. Generous analysts were prepared to give Mr Schimmelbusch the benefit of the doubt - after all, he could not have foreseen the lifting of the iron curtain when he initiated his strategy in the late 1980s. Who better than the 1991 German manager of the year to see through the rationalisation needed in 1992 and 1993? However Mr Schimmelbusch squandered the goodwill he had won from the international investment community and from the German financial and industrial establishment, which had put him on the pedestal from which he was toppled on Friday. He lost it partly through creative accounting. Few analysts believe that the DM245m profit the group reported in 1991-92 provided a fair representation of underlying performance. This impression was compounded because the group was unwilling to present earnings according to the DVFA formula used by most big German companies to iron out the effects of one-off extraordinary and exceptional income. In the end he came unstuck because of the problems at MG Corp, which has built up its business in marketing and distributing products such as gasoline and heating oil. When the problems first became public two weeks ago, Mr Schimmelbusch and the group's bankers insisted there was nothing sinister. MG Corp had been obliged to make cash payouts - so-called margin calls - on futures contracts as the price of oil moved down. A mere technicality, said Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank'schief executive. But investigations continued and the original assessment had to be revised. As Mr Neukirchen, fabled in Germany for undertaking the savage restructuring of the FAG Kugelfischer ball-bearing group, puts his feet under Mr Schimmelbusch's desk this morning, at least two questions remain unanswered. The first is straightforward: how big is the hole at MG Corp? The big banks have hinted that further equity will have to be pumped into Metallgesellschaft and that the group's pre-tax losses for the year to September will have to be revised from the provisional DM347m reported last month. The second is more far-reaching: what implications will the case have for German corporate governance? Under the German system, poor management is not corrected by the fear of takeover, but by the actions of the supervisory board. How well did the Metallgesellschaft supervisory board supervise Mr Schimmelbusch? Friday's statement said Mr Schimmelbusch was ousted because he failed to keep the supervisory board informed about developments in the US, which might have been in breach of German corporate law. The board - headed by Mr Ronaldo Schmitz of the Deutsche Bank - will no doubt claim to have acted swiftly in ejecting Mr Schimmelbusch once the scope of MG Corp's plight became clear. But the big German banks are particularly close to Metallgesellschaft as shareholders, creditors, providers of financial services and as board directors. Given this degree of closeness, it is surprising they did not identify Mr Schimmelbusch's weaknesses earlier.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Management: Tiers are shed as councils cut back - Britain's local government is preparing for a leaner future. Chris Tighe looks at one authority's experience In his Wallsend town hall office, North Tyneside council leader Brian Flood is pouring tea from a big, canteen-style metal teapot into a mug emblazoned ANC Women's Section. It is the sort of scene which has confirmed Labour-controlled North Tyneside's place in Conservative ministers' demonology of combative, left-wing local authorities. But between sips of tea, Flood is explaining how the council's restructuring is wiping out layers of bureaucracy, making the organisation consumer-orientated, empowering its staff to meet service delivery targets and eliminating around 1,100 jobs. Local authorities throughout Britain are undergoing profound change brought about by financial constraints, shifting social trends and central government-imposed policies like compulsory competitive tendering. But few restructurings are carried out amid such financial crisis. North Tyneside is not only scrapping its departmental structure and toning down its previously confrontational approach to Tory central government, it is simultaneously deciding how to make cuts next year of Pounds 20m - 15 per cent of its budget - shedding in the process at least one in eight jobs. And it is doing all this in a matter of weeks. The restructuring is partly a response to financial duress; council leaders believe no more cuts are possible under the present structure without eroding basic services. The council also believes the delivery of flexible quality services demanded by the public conflicts with the conventional local government structure of departments, each jealously guarding their roles and budgets. 'The present culture, which has to change, is one based on secretive professionalism which has erected barriers around each individual part of the council's activity', says Flood. Within North Tyneside's 'fossilised' departmental structure there are as many as 16 layers between directors and employees. Flood does not suggest that the intervening layers have been idle. 'Everybody's been working hard; they're all answering each others' bloody questions.' The present system has also stifled communication. 'It might start off as broad as the Tyne but it comes through like a tap dripping.' Nor has there been any forum where heads of department meet councillors. Until now, says Flood, local government has been designed to keep elected members out of the way. 'That's why it's failed.' The restructured North Tyneside council will have six executive directors who will meet each week with the leader and senior councillors, forming, in effect, a management board. One side-effect of the new structure is that ruling group councillors will gain more power to ensure that committee decisions are implemented. Present legislation stipulates that councils must appoint directors covering areas like education and social services. North Tyneside's executive directors will bear the titles required by law, but none will be responsible for the day-to-day running of services. That job will fall to 16 heads of function, under whom will be 45 senior managers, 150 managers, a lower tier of first-line managers - and then grassroots employees. 'We want a flat structure,' says Flood. There will be no more than three layers between heads of function and the people on the ground. Heads of function will be set tough targets for service delivery; these may include annual budget reductions for core services so they can introduce pilot schemes to explore new areas of consumer demand. Performance related pay is under consideration. The reorganisation, to be concluded by Christmas, means that all 9,500 employees have had to apply for posts at or around their current level. So far the top three levels have been appointed. The spotlight is now on the lower managerial tiers where job cuts will be heaviest. Compulsory redundancies, anathema to the council until now, are inevitable although 1,000 staff have left voluntarily in the last two years. The unions are sympathetic to the council's budget problems and do not oppose the restructuring in principle. But Nalgo, the white collar public service workers' union which expects 500 of its 3,000 members at the council to lose their jobs, is unhappy at the distribution and size of the cuts. It is holding a one-day strike tomorrow and threatens further action. Branch secretary Trevor Johnston argues that: 'There's this great myth that there are all these layers of managers doing nothing. It might have been true 10 years ago. But there's been substantial delayering over the last five years.' Such is the scale of staff cuts, he argues, that some managers in the new structure may face an impossible task. He complains that the reforms have encouraged an 'opportunity culture', with some employees gaining promotion at others' expense. Nalgo is worried that restructuring is distracting attention from heavy job losses. Conversely, Ian Gordon, Conservative opposition group leader, fears that the service cuts which may result from the council putting its finances in order may cloud the public's perception of restructuring. Although Gordon criticises some appointments as 'blatantly political', both the restructuring and the Labour group's new pragmatism have Tory support. 'We welcome this conversion on the Damascus road,' he says. Still, tough battles lie ahead. But Flood, topping up that tea mug, is bullish: 'We think in three years' time we'll set the standard for the way councils operate.'</p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE TRAVELS FRESH OFF A VICTORY  </P> <P> The Cal State Northridge men's basketball team, fresh off a come-from-behind  victory over Biola on Wednesday, will travel to Cedar City, Utah, for a  nonconference game with Southern Utah State at 7:30 tonight.  </P> <P> Northridge (4-7), which snapped a three-game losing streak with its 62-54  decision over Biola, will again be without the services of starting guard  Eugene Humphrey, who suffered a severely bruised right thigh against Sacramento  State last Saturday.  </P> <P> "Gene is really hurting right now," Coach Pete Cassidy said. "He's limping  badly. We're just hoping now to have him back for the start of conference."  </P> <P> Freshman Bill Mazurie will again start in Humphrey's place.  </P> <P> Senior Derrick Gathers, who has led Northridge in both scoring and rebounding  in six games this season, is averaging a team-high 20.4 points and 8.5 rebounds  a game.  </P> <P> After playing Division I Southern Utah State tonight, Northridge will return  home to play Division III Colorado College on Monday.  </P> <P> The Matadors begin California Collegiate Athletic Assn. play at Cal Poly San  Luis Obispo on Friday, followed by a conference game at Cal State Bakersfield  on Saturday.

			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CATHOLIC BISHOPS ON ABORTION  </P> <P> In the article a group known as Catholics for a Free Choice claimed that only  20% of American Catholics agreed with the bishops in their strong stand against  abortion. Twenty percent? Where does this group get its figures?  </P> <P> Clearly, the vast majority of Catholics are solidly against abortion. This was  seen very dramatically in the last presidential election. Post-election polls  revealed that ethnic Democrats (largely Irish, Italian and Polish Catholics)  crossed over and voted for George Bush because of the abortion issue. They made  a significant difference in the election.  </P> <P> Catholics have been pro-life for 2,000 years. They are not likely to change  now. The fact that Catholics For a Free Choice can only muster 8,000 members --  in a nation of over 50 million Catholics -- speaks volumes.  </P> <P> ANNE WALLACE  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

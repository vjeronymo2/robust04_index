			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CZECHOSLOVAKIA OPENS BORDERS;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: THE MOST HARD-LINE OF SOVIET BLOC NATIONS WILL ALLOW TRAVEL OUT OF  THE COUNTRY WITHOUT THE NEED OF AN EXIT VISA.  </P> <P> Premier Ladislav Adamec said today that Czechoslovak citizens will no longer  need exit permits to travel outside the country, a major reform in one of the  last hard-line East Bloc nations.  </P> <P> The announcement comes less than a week after East Germany lifted most travel  restrictions on its citizens and opened its borders to the West, triggering a  flood of visitors to West Germany.  </P> <P> In an address to the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly, Adamec said his government  regards "tourism as the citizens' important right to get to know the world,  gain experience and establish personal contacts."  </P> <P> Czechoslovakia has been among the most resistant countries in the East Bloc to  the Soviet-style political reforms sweeping Poland, Hungary and now East  Germany. It has crushed public dissent and jailed protesters calling for  democratic reforms. Police used truncheons and arrested scores during  pro-reform demonstrations in October.  </P> <P> During the summer, the government eased some travel restrictions but did not  lift the requirement for an exit visa when traveling to the West. Authorities  have often refused to allow leading dissidents to travel abroad.  </P> <P> In Washington, President Bush hailed the development.  </P> <P> "The people of Czechoslovakia have the same aspirations for freedom that others  have, and I would expect we'd see further changes there, just as we have seen  in Poland, Hungary and in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). So  it's a very good and encouraging step," the President said.  </P> <P> Adamec said the government was changing the law to make travel easier. He did  not say when the new rule would take effect, but it was expected to begin in  January.  </P> <P> "The processing of travel documents is being speeded up," Adamec said. "For  travel to non-socialist countries and to Yugoslavia, exit visas will not be  necessary." Yugoslavia is a Communist country but is not aligned with the  Warsaw Pact, so travel to it had been restricted.  </P> <P> Currently, Czechoslovak citizens wishing to travel West must apply for exit  visas with the Interior Ministry. Before a trip is authorized, would-be  travelers must also obtain stamps from their employers and from military  authorities.  </P></p>

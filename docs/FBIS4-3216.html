			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Foreign investment  totalling more than 10 billion U.S. dollars flowed last year  into the area around Bohai Bay in eastern and northern China.    This area includes Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong and Shanxi  Provinces and two cities of Beijing and Tianjin, where there are  rich natural resources, good transport networks and sound  industrial foundations. It has become the third most  sought-after zone for foreign investors, behind the Zhujiang  Delta in south China and the Chang Jiang River Delta in east  China.    According to figures from the Tianjin-based information  center for the area around Bohai Bay, more than 10,000  foreign-funded enterprises were approved to be set up in the  area last year.    At present, investors from Japan, the Republic of Korea,  Singapore and Taiwan take this area as their first choice and  some transnational corporations and international financial  groups are also most interested in this area.    The Motorola Corp. of the United States will invest 200  million U.S. dollars to build a mobile telecommunication  equipment factory in Tianjin; the AST Company and the United  Tech Corp. of the United States have also decided to increase  their investment in Tianjin.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In connection with this improvement in the collection process, the FDIC believes that it is highly desirable to reduce the regulatory burden imposed on insured depository institutions by shifting to the FDIC the responsibility of computing each institution's assessment. To facilitate this process, the FDIC is also proposing a move to quarterly assessment payments. The FDIC believes that this change would have other benefits as well, both for the FDIC and for insured institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A quarterly-payment schedule is a straightforward means of minimizing inefficiencies in the assessment collection process that would not be addressed by other elements of the proposal. For example, it would simplify the assessment computation by basing each quarterly installment on one quarterly report of condition rather than two. It would also resolve a timing problem resulting from a statutory requirement. Under section 7(a) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1817(a), the certified statements filed by each institution for a particular semiannual assessment period must be based on the two reports of condition <FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>  <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  to be filed by the institution for the prior semiannual period. The report dates set pursuant to section 7(a) are March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. The June 30 and December 31 report dates precede by only one day the beginning of the semiannual assessment periods for which they provide the basis for assessment computation. As a result, the report data needed by the institution for its assessment computation are not complete until the beginning of the semiannual period, and are not required to be submitted by the institution until the end of the first month of the semiannual period. If, as under the existing collection process, the payment due date falls early within the semiannual period, it is necessary for each institution to compute its own assessment, since there is not sufficient time before the due date for the FDIC to receive the relevant report data from the institution and to prepare and edit an assessment statement based on the data. Under the existing collection process, any subsequent amendment of the reported data on which the assessment is based can potentially_and often does_necessitate recalculation of the institution's assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For banks, the report of condition is called the Report of Income and Condition; for thrift institutions, the Thrift Financial Report; and for insured branches of foreign banks, the Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A possible solution to this timing problem would be to move the semiannual assessment due date to a later date during the semiannual period, for example to the end of the first quarter of the period (that is, to March 31 and September 30). This would be preferable to the existing system in that it would provide the additional time necessary for the FDIC to receive the requisite data from insured institutions and to initiate a direct debit for the assessment amount due. However, it would not permit other improvements that would result from the quarterly-collection proposal, such as simplifying the assessment computation, reducing the data-refinement and billing-adjustment complications associated with semiannual collection, and eliminating the risk of nonpayment for insurance coverage provided for some portion of the assessment period in the case of an institution that fails prior to the payment due date. Thus, the FDIC believes that the quarterly-collection proposal is preferable to delayed semiannual collection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the quarterly-collection proposal, institutions would be invoiced for an initial quarterly payment for the first quarter of each semiannual assessment period (for example, the period beginning January 1) approximately one month before the beginning of the period (in this example, on November 30), based on the report-of-condition data for the first quarter of the preceding semiannual period (in this example, September 30). Although the due date for this first quarterly payment (December 30) would fall approximately one month earlier than the due date for the semiannual payment required under the existing regulations, the quarterly payment would be for only a portion (roughly one-half, assuming minimal changes in the rate of deposit growth across quarters) of the full semiannual assessment amount. The balance of the semiannual assessment_based on the report of condition for the last day of the second quarter of the prior semiannual period (in the above example, December 31)_would be due approximately 3 months into the semiannual period (March 30), about two months later than the existing single semiannual payment date (January 31).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on FDIC estimates, the proposed quarterly-payment plan should not result in a material financial loss either to the FDIC or to insured depository institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is currently anticipated that, if adopted, the proposal would be implemented for the semiannual assessment period beginning July 1, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

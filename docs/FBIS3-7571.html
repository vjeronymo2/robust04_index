			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was learned on 28 March that an agreement has  already been reached between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa,  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa,  and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa that they will  work to form a new party under the leadership of "Hosokawa and  Ozawa" and that as a preliminary step, they will inaugurate a  policy study group under the same leadership before the end of  April and call on the ruling parties to join in the group. A  series of plans advocated by Hosokawa and others for uniting the  ruling parties will inevitably invite criticism from the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger], which  are opposed to the idea of Shinseito and Sakigake taking the  initiative in promoting the realignment of political parties,  because these plans have not been fully discussed by the ruling  parties and because they include personnel issues. At a meeting  on the night of 28 March, some members of the Japan New Party  [JNP] expressed opposition to the idea of merging the ruling  coalition into a new party. As such, a rift between the ruling  parties will likely intensify.    On 13 March, Hosokawa, Ozawa, and Ichikawa together met with  the independent Toshio Yamaguchi and senior JNP officials to  discuss the issue of uniting the ruling parties into one party.  On 18 March, Hosokawa and Ozawa continued the discussions. In  the discussions, Hosokawa reportedly urged Ozawa and Ichikawa to  begin work to select unified ruling coalition candidates for the  next general election, which will be held under a combination of  the single-seat constituency and proportional representation  systems, and Ozawa and Ichikawa agreed to begin the work from  April. It has also been reported that they agreed to turn the  policy study group into a new political party at an early stage.    They also agreed to name the policy study group "Reform,"  which would eventually become the Reform Party, to stress the  "continuation of reform efforts," and that membership in the  group will be one of the criteria to be selected as a unified  candidate.    They reportedly held in-depth discussions on the formation  of  the policy study group and a new party. It is said that  considering the facts that the Hosokawa cabinet still maintains  about a 50-percent approval rating and that Hosokawa is seen as  the symbol of the change of government and the inauguration of  the coalition government, they agreed to name Hosokawa as head  of the group. They also confirmed that Ozawa would be in charge  of operating the group. Also, they discussed having Ichikawa be  put in charge of policymaking or be appointed to another  important post. They agreed in principle on these things and  decided to discuss further detailed personnel affairs.    The SDPJ, Sakigake, and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]  are opposed to and perplexed by the quick moves by Ozawa and  Ichikawa to firm up concrete plans to unite the ruling parties  into one party. On 28 March, a senior DSP official said, "Our  party intends not to allow members to participate in the group  even as private citizens." In this way, he disclosed that the  DSP is calling on its members to refrain from joining the group.    On 25 March, Hosokawa told SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama  that "there is misunderstanding" and that "I have not instructed  [Ozawa and Ichikawa to formulate plans to merge the ruling  coalition into one party]." The SDPJ and other ruling parties  are critical of Hosokawa for his insincerity because they  believe Hosokawa has discussed with Ozawa and Ichikawa plans to  unite the ruling parties, including personnel affairs, and that  he is trying to cover up this fact. On 28 March, a top SDPJ  official said: "It is unclear what the prime minister's real  intentions are. We will never accept the plan to inaugurate a  policy study group led by Ozawa."</p>

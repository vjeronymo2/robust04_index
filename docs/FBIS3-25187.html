			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] met  in Maputo yesterday. The meeting seems to have found the need  to quickly and definitely resolve the dispute existing between  the government and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo]  regarding the Salamanga area in southern Mozambique. The CSC  decided that the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], which  occupied Salamanga after signing the General Peace Accord,  should withdraw 30 km away from the area. Renamo has not yet  withdrawn from the area. What is more, Renamo men and war  materiel have begun arriving in the area, apparently to use it  as an assembly area.    In a statement to the press at the end of yesterday's  meeting, Minister Armando Guebuza, head of the government  delegation to the CSC, gave the impression that the government  is losing its patience. The dispute still continues, and Renamo  seems to be usingng out one delaying tactic after another in  order not to withdraw from the area.    [Begin Guebuza recording] The CSC decided that Renamo should  withdraw 10 to 30 km away from Salamanga. Renamo appealed, but  the CSC upheld its decision. It appealed again, and we continue  to have meeting after meeting to examine an issue that has  already been decided upon by the bodies established by the  government and Renamo. The decision was made in the presence of  the government and Renamo. The government and Renamo have the  power to vote against a CSC decision, but Renamo did not do so.  Now it is questioning the decision. [passage omitted] [end  recording]    Asked to comment on the issue, Renamo's Jose de Castro tried  to minimize the problem.    [Begin de Castro recording] Well, I think this issue has  already been well explained [words indistinct] we withdrew first  to avoid dispute. In view of logistical conditions in the area,  Renamo wrote to the CSC, requesting to confine its forces there.  This is well known. However, the government does not want us to  be where we are. They want us 10 km away. We see the government  coming up with a problem that does not exist. Assembly areas  are provisional areas. After a while, some soldiers will join  the future army and others will be demobilized. Accordingly, I  do not see any reason for the government to object. [end  recording]    Meanwhile, Aldo Ajello, representative of the UN secretary  general in Mozambique, promised to take an initiative on 12  February to once and for all resolve the problem.    Yesterday's CSC meeting examined many other issues,  including  the confinement of government and Renamo forces, the training of  the new Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, the demobilization of  troops from both sides, and the need to begin to transport to  regional depots all weapons handed at assembly areas.</p>

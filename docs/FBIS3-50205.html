Exner, the KSCM deputy  chairman, heads the new group.    The nine deputies left Wednesday's session of the LB group  before a vote was taken on the proposal to change the group's  name. Eventually, the remaining deputies decided to retain the  name Left Bloc, but it will be followed with the abbreviations  of the names of the three parties comprising it, listed in  brackets. The three parties are the Left Bloc Party (SLB), the  KSCM and the Democratic Left Party (SDL).    Originally the Left Bloc group consisted of the KSCM, the  Democratic Left, and several smaller entities. On the basis of  the June 1992 election results, the LB got 35 out of the total  of 200 parliamentary seats and formed the second strongest group  in the parliament.    The original number of nine parliamentary groups has  increased to 11 due to various changes affecting non-government  party groups.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Grahams Rintoul to be restructured Grahams Rintoul Investment Trust, management of which was taken over by Lazards last year, is to be restructured and its name changed to the Lazard Smaller Equities Investment Trust. American Express Bank is to sell off its majority stake in the trust, after converting 2m of its stepped preference shares into 1.6m ordinary shares. Its entire holding of ordinary and stepped preference shares has been placed with institutions, subject to shareholders' approval at an extraordinary meeting on March 7. The increasing dividend entitlement of the stepped preference shares has not been covered over the last three years and has forced the fund's managers to concentrate on picking high-yielding stocks. Reducing the number of such shares will give greater flexibility to invest for capital growth as well as income. The restructuring will increase the capital and income cover of remaining stepped preference shares, but will decrease the net asset value per ordinary share. However, the company says that the dividend savings will amount to Pounds 5.3m over the remaining 19 year life of the shares, and the benefit of this will fall to the ordinary shareholders. In the year to December 31 1993, the net asset value per ordinary share increased by 50 per cent to 170.9p, and during January 1994 rose by a further 14.6 per cent. A single dividend for the year of 0.25p is proposed. The trust is not recommending that any further shareholders take up the option to convert, as this would involve loss of both income and capital.</p>

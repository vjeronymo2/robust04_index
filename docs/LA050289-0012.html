			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE SPEAKER JIM WRIGHT  </P> <P> Your editorial calling for Wright to resign puzzles me. The charges presented  so far are, by admission of the Ethics Committee, based on suspicion, not hard  evidence. If the evidence is produced, then he should resign.  </P> <P> What puzzles me is that there is now emerging from the North trial (evidence)  that both Ronald Reagan and George Bush were involved in the illegal activities  and were impeachable. The information emerging is far more credible at this  point than the charges against Wright. So why aren't you calling for Bush to  resign? Is it hypocrisy?  </P> <P> CHARLES CHRISTIAN  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Guide to jobs law planned: Waldegrave to define EC rules on public service contracting-out THE government plans to publish a definitive explanation of how EC legislation protecting the jobs and pay of workers in mergers affects the contracting-out of public services, Mr William Waldegrave said yesterday. Mr Waldegrave, the public service minister, was addressing a conference in London organised by the Cabinet Office to involve business in the government's market-testing programme. Doubts over whether the EC legislation applies have cast a shadow over the programme, which will put Pounds 1.5bn of work out to tender by the end of September. A series of judgments in the European Court of Justice has extended the scope of EC legislation to contracting out. Employment law experts warn that companies which win contracts to provide public services are likely to be covered by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, known as Tupe. That would make it harder for them to sack workers and alter their pay and conditions. Mr Waldegrave told the conference that the Tupe regulations had not yet hindered market-testing and would not in the future. He said he would look at the recent Rask judgment, reported in yesterday's FT, which appears to confirm that the legislation applies more widely than ministers have so far admitted. However, he warned that whether the regulations applied to any contract depended on the particular circumstances of the case. Companies bidding for work should take legal advice on whether they applied in each case. Yesterday's conference - attended by more than 500 business executives  - was picketed by Civil Service unions. Mr John Ellis, secretary of the Council of Civil Service Unions, described the programme as the 'biggest car boot sale ever held'. The unions said they would oppose the market-testing programme, which exposes the jobs of more than 44,000 civil servants to competitive tendering. The CCSU said it would use the Tupe regulations to ensure maintenance of Civil Service pay and conditions . But Mr Waldegrave challenged the assumption that all contracting-out involved cutting pay and conditions. 'Many existing transfers where Tupe does apply have still proved worthwhile for contractors.' The minister said that where the regulations apply, businesses would 'have to be genuinely innovative about delivering services to give good value for money while taking on the staff and their conditions of employment'. The National Audit Office, the public expenditure watchdog, is to audit the market-testing process to ensure fair and open competition. Sir Peter Levene, the government's efficiency adviser, told the conference that when existing staff bid for work in market-testing, they will be expected to follow the same rules as private companies and include the cost of all overheads in their bids. If the staff were successful with their bid, they would sign a service agreement specifying standards to which work would be performed. A second market-testing conference will be staged on March 12, to accommodate the overflow from yesterday's conference, which was almost 100 per cent oversubscribed. Observer, Page 17</p>

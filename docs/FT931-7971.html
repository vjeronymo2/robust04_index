			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Partners make their mark PARTNERS at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's largest accountancy firm, have resisted attempts to restrict their involvement in the choice of a new chairman, in a highly unusual exercise of their power. The firm's governing board earlier this month discussed more democratic selection procedures for the top job, which becomes vacant in May next year. These must now be approved by the elected council in the next few weeks. The procedures follow a revolt by Coopers' 715 partners, at the annual meeting in Birmingham in December, against attempts to restrict their involvement in the process. Mr Brandon Gough, the chairman and senior partner, had proposed that partners merely ratify a candidate selected by a nomination committee, which would have included all members of the 13-strongboard selected by him not standing for the post. Under the revised proposals, a nomination committee of up to 40 people will be elected by all the partners, with only two places reserved for board members, four for partners aged under 40 and several for those from the regions. All partners will then vote from a shortlist prepared by the committee, at an election likely to take place before December. One senior partner said that the new chairman might be drawn from outside the partnership, and might even not be a chartered accountant. He added: 'The candidates must have the attitudes and characteristics that reflect the needs of the business, and will present a plan on how to delegate any elements of their role.'</p>

The decision to  boycott the poll had been re-affirmed by the AVF's highest body  at its latest meeting, Dr Hartzenberg said in a statement.    In an apparent reference to Gen Constand Viljoen's  resignation from the directorate of AVF generals, Dr Hartzenberg  said the AVF's power base was "virtually uninjured". The AVF  would continue to pursue its ideal of attaining freedom and  self-determination for the Afrikaner/Boerevolk [Boer people], he  said.    "Participation in the elections is viewed as a fatal choice  for the existence of our people and I as leader of the AVF can  never commit myself to that.    "The necessary internal organisational measures have been  arranged so that the AVF can continue with its task with the  least possible disruption.    "The power base of the AVF is virtually intact and we  continue with the implementation of our planning for the next  weeks," said Dr Hartzenberg, who is also "president" of the  right-wing transitional assembly.</p>

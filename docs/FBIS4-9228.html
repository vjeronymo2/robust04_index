			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 21/4/1994 -- A delegation of  the Socialist Party of Labor of Romania [PSM], headed by  President Ilie Verdet, met on 20 April evening with a delegation  of the Palestine Liberation Organization, headed by Yasir  'Arafat, PLO Executive Committee president, now in Romania for  the Crans Montana forum proceedings.    The Palestinian party noted during the talks the traditional  relations between Romanians and Palestinians, the fact that the  Palestinian movement has always enjoyed full support, as  regarded the right to self-determination of the Palestinian  people and the negotiated settlement of the issue.    President Yasir 'Arafat said he felt encouraged by that  meeting with the Romanian socialists.    The Socialist Party of Labor's leadership emphasized the  possibility of expanding the relations between the two parties  on multiple planes and the economic relations as well, to the  benefit of the Romanian and Palestinian peoples.</p>

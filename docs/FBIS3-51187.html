Up until 12 April -- when the ceremony for  the final signing of the Uruguay Round of the GATT (General  Agreement on Trade and Tariffs) talks will be held in Marrakesh,  Morocco -- tariffs may not be increased. Lampreia, Brazil's top  negotiator in the Uruguay Round, denied that the Brazilian  agricultural sector was harmed by the negotiations.    "Brazil did not win, but is not worse off than it was," he  said. In making an evaluation of the Uruguay Round, Lampreia  admitted that the liberalization of trade for industrial  products was more comprehensive than it was for agricultural  products. "Negotiations over farm products are always more  complicated," he emphasized. Lampreia said that Brazil could  still obtain tariff reductions in the U.S. and European markets,  especially on orange juice. The United States reduced tariffs on  orange juice by 15 percent, and the Europeans by 20 percent.    Lampreia explained that the greatest progress made in the  Uruguay Round was represented by the agreement on the rules that  will ban the adoption of unilateral, arbitrary, antidumping  measures. "The margin of arbitrariness will be considerably  reduced," he said, adding that after the ceremony in Marrakesh,  which will be attended by the foreign ministers of 117  countries, the agreements signed in Geneva will be translated  and sent to each signatory country. The Senate Economic Affairs  Committee will begin studying the agreements by mid-May.    Lampreia said that there are no possibilities for any  modifications. "Either the Senate approves them or rejects  them," he noted. At the beginning of 1995, GATT will host a  ministerial conference to evaluate the approval of the  agreements, and will start the work for the creation of the  International Organization of Commerce, which will replace GATT.  Lampreia said the new organization will begin operating in July  1995.</p>

Convention No. 87 of the International Labor Organization  (ILO) "On Trade Unions' Freedom and Protection of the Right to  Assemble" must be respected even in relation to civil servants,  Petrus stresses. He quotes the agreement as saying that both  employees and employers have the right to establish  organizations according to their own choice, without previous  approval, and to become members of these organizations.    Czechoslovakia ratified the convention in 1964, and the  document is binding the Czech Republic as well, Petrus states.    He admits certain restrictions, mainly as regards the right  to strike and collective bargaining, which can be replaced by  another kind of negotiating working conditions. These partial  restrictions can be applied in relation to civil servants and  organizations providing for fundamental services, Petrus says.    "It is impossible either to replace trade unions with any  loyal association of interest or push for senior officials'  associating in their own, exclusive and loyal trade union  organizations," Petrus says.    At its meeting on Monday, the CMKOS board discussed a draft  General Agreement for 1994 and decided not to sign it in its  present form. One of the reasons for the decision was the  board's opposition to the removal of trade unions from the state  administration, as proposed by the government.    The agreement aimed to maintain social peace is concluded  annually by the government, trade unions, and employers.</p>

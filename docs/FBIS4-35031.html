			<p>BFN     [Text] President Eduardo Frei departed for a three-day  visit to the United States at 2045 on 26 June. During his brief  trip to the United States, Frei is scheduled to hold meetings  with top-ranking U.S. political and economic officials, the most  important of which will be his meeting with U.S. President Bill  Clinton. It is expected that the two presidents will surely  discuss the Chilean-U.S. free trade agreement during this  meeting.    Before his departure, the president headed the traditional  transfer-of-power ceremony. During this ceremony, President  Eduardo Frei transferred the presidency to Interior Minister  German Correa in compliance with a decree read previously by  Interior Under Secretary Belisario Velasco. German Correa  assumed the presidency in his capacity as Chilean vice president.    Before boarding the plane that would take him to the United  States, President Frei stated that his meeting with Bill Clinton  does not seek solely commercial objectives:    [Begin Frei recording] This visit has much broader  objectives. The free trade treaty is, of course, among the  issues that will be discussed. This is not, however, the only  issue to be discussed. There are many other issues. We are most  interested in strengthening our political ties, on having fluent  bilateral ties with the United States in vast areas. [end  recording]</p>

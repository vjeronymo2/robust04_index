			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy Those who believe that the government's sudden decision to cut interest rates last month was a slap in the face for the Bank of England will find little point in listening to what its next governor has to say about interest rates. But Mr Eddie George fought back last night - appropriately enough in Frankfurt, the Mecca of all independent-minded central bankers. By drawing attention to the Bank's inflation reports, he has served notice that he does not intend to submit quietly to attempts at monetary subversion. By saying there is little room for further adjustment, he raised the stakes some more. For a while, at least, the government will not be able to cut rates without an open rift with the Bank.</p>

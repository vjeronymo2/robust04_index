			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Profits up but T&amp;L slips Dealers in Tate &amp; Lyle reported a badly handled selling order early in the session which cast a shadow over the group's impressive full-year figures. A block of around 600,000 shares was said to have done the damage, bringing an early retreat in the stock. The shares closed 9 lower at 430p. A further slide in the stock was prevented by euphoria at a 23 per cent increase in full-year profits to Pounds 273.8m, which topped the most optimistic forecasts and persuaded many analysts to upgrade profit expectations. Credit Lyonnais Laing increased its current year forecast by Pounds 25m to Pounds 311m and the following year's figure by Pounds 35m to Pounds 354m. Reiterating their buy stance on the stock, analysts at the securities house said: 'We believe the company will be able to report 10 per cent dividend growth for the next three years while at the same time increasing dividend cover.' Mr Carl Short at Strauss Turnbull raised his forecast by a more modest Pounds 5m to Pounds 290m and advised investors to take profits as he expects 'slower earnings growth in the year to September 1995'.</p>

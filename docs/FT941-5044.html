			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (6): The stuff of science fiction - Technology 'It's the stuff you read about in science fiction,' runs the voice-over in Bell Atlantic's latest television ads. All the RBOCs are talking excitedly about convergence, broadband and multi-media, and rubbishing the plain old telephones (pots) as relics about to hit the scrapheap. It is important to distinguish two different processes at work: regulatory changes allowing companies to offer services over their systems that other people were offering before; and the construction of broadband networks bringing new inter-active services on stream. The two get blurred, since the first process inevitably requires some network upgrading. But allowing telephone companies to start supplying cable TV, and vice versa, provides only a small number of consumers with services they could not procure before. In reality, however, the upgrading planned by the RBOCs will take them far beyond the stage necessary to offer cable TV. Indeed, only one of the RBOCs  -Bell Atlantic - appears to be seriously experimenting with technology that would simply upgrade existing copper wire to carry video and even that company's executives privately concede that it is no more than a transitional technology. The vogue is for full broadband networks, which appears in most cases to mean fibre to the kerb and coaxial cable into the home. The sums about to be spent on network upgrading are colossal. By one estimate, US telecoms operators are planning to spend around Dollars 20bn a year between them. But when it comes to identifying the new services, the picture becomes more fuzzy, once you get past video-on-demand and still more cable channels. Shopping and travel services are the most popular candidates for the first explosion of new inter-active services. Says Mr Raymond Smith, chairman of Bell Atlantic: '1994 and 1995 will see the first transactional shopping services - there's already a Dollars 55bn catalogue shopping business, and the market could grow like wild.' Health and educational uses also feature prominently in the rhetoric, though estimates of how fast the market will develop vary wildly. State by state a plethora of on-line educational services have sprung up, and in the bid to present themselves as friends of universal service without the need for unwieldy regulation, most of the RBOCs are promising Congress they will provide free or reduced-rate broadband connections for educational institutions. Mr Bob Fuher, head of US West's multimedia group, highlighted four sources of revenue as critical for the new broadband operators: entertainment, communications, shopping and games. 'It's on the information services side that there's a weak link,' he said. 'We are still searching for the anchor information services that will attract the market.' All of the RBOCs have broadband experiments past, present or future. Accounts conflict, but all agree that the more starry-eyed projections of an explosion in demand for new services are off-beam: everything will depend upon getting the services to market at prices much lower than those generally envisaged. The RBOCs are also grappling with the issue of universal service for broadband - Vice-President Al Gore's insistence that there should not be information haves and have-nots in the superhighway world. Every operator has its own solution, and it is becoming one of the most contentious issues in Congressional deliberations about broadband and regulatory reform. More immediate than broadband, however, is a further competitive flurry in the cellular mobile business. The Federal Communications Commission is set to auction more than 400 licences for Personal Communications Services (PCS) next year, and competition for the licences will be intense. RBOCs will be limited in their capacity to bid for licences in areas where they already have cellular operations, but there are no such limits on licences covering new areas. A rush is on to form bidding and operating consortia. One RBOC - San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis - has even split itself into two, moving its cellular activities into a separate operator which is about to be spun off into an entirely separate company. That way it hopes to maximise its value and increase its bidding potential.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE SEVEN REGIONAL BELL COMPANIES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     Access   Operating                                                      lines*   revenues                                                              (Dlrs bn)**  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bell Atalantic          Philadelphia, Pennsylvania   18.181m    10.943 BellSouth               Atlanta, Georgia             18.109m    12.412 Ameritech               Chicago, Illinois            17.001m     9.799 Nynex                   New York, NY                 15.699m    11.540 Pacific Telesis         San Francisco                14.551m     8.910 US West Communications  Englewood, Colorado          13.345m     8.324 Southwestern Bell       San Antonio, Texas           12.603m     7.759  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  * As at December 31, 1992 ** 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: US Telephone Association  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

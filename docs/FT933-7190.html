			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Moscow keeps Baltics guessing on troop pullout RUSSIA'S sputtering troop withdrawal from the three Baltic states has turned into a curious political game. Last week, for example, Russia stopped the pullout from Lithuania to protest against Lithuanian demands for reparations - less than two weeks before the planned first complete withdrawal from a former Soviet republic. And yesterday Moscow tersely told Vilnius it was breaking the agreement to be out by August 31. 'The withdrawal will take place according to the norms of international law, but now over a period which the Lithuanian side will be informed about,' a Foreign Ministry statement said. Their quarrel stems from Lithuanian demands for Dollars 143bn to cover damages for 50 years of Soviet rule - unrecoverable financially but, for the Lithuanians, an important admission of occupation by Russia. Russia refuses to be held responsible, financially or historically, for the Soviet era. While Lithuania, which has granted citizenship and the right to vote to most Russians living on its territory, has enjoyed good relations with Moscow, Latvia and Estonia are engaged in a vigorous debate on the troop question. Citizenship and language laws have strained relations in both states, where 1.5m ethnic Russians live. The troop withdrawal was repeatedly halted, most recently in Estonia after the country passed a discriminatory aliens law. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, last week said: 'Russian troops will not leave the Baltic states until an agreement is completed which guarantees the Russian-speaking minority's rights.' Mr Kozyrev affirmed his support for an autonomy vote in Narva, an Estonian city that is 95 per cent Russian. An Estonian government spokeswoman likened the move to the Russian army's involvement in conflicts in Moldova, Georgia and Tajikistan. Both sides are playing on the European diplomatic field, where Russia and the Baltic states are eager to look good and preserve western political and financial assistance. Estonia pulls no punches in trying to break from the past, in the process alienating the Russian population, and rekindling historical links, especially to Scandinavian countries. President Lennart Meri asked both the Council of Europe and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to review the controversial aliens law before signing an amended version - an unprecedented move for a sovereign state but indicative of Estonia's desire for European blessing. Russia similarly covets Council of Europe membership - awarded to Estonia over Russian objections earlier this summer - but seems willing to jeopardise entry by refusing to honour international resolutions by the Council and the United Nations for 'early, orderly and complete withdrawal'. This signal, Baltic leaders contend, shows hardline nationalists still have a strong hand in Moscow, advocating any means, including military conquest, to secure rights for the 25m ethnic Russians who live outside Russia. A United Nations observer arrives in the three countries on August 28 to monitor the pace of Russia's pullout. Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, has mediated in recent tensions and has called on Russia to expedite the withdrawal. Moscow, as usual, now holds all the cards. Western leaders, especially Mr Bildt, see troop pullout as an important test of how Russia handles relations with republics which, unlike Belarus or the Central Asian republics, want to sever political ties to the east.</p>

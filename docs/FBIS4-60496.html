			<p>BFN     [Text] Iraq's senior diplomat in Washington has been  expelled for alleged violations of the agreement that allowed  Iraq to maintain a diplomatic presence in the United States.  THE WASHINGTON POST said that the diplomat had tried to lobby  members of Congress and sent out news releases calling for an  end to the United Nations economic embargo against his country.  It said that he had also hired and fired staff without  notifying the State Department or actions counter to the  agreement. The paper said that the State Department did not  announce his expulsion, but confirmed it when queried.</p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEORIA WELCOMES ITS RANSOMED SON;  </P> <P> ABDUCTION: THE CITY THAT RAISED FUNDS TO PAY COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS GREETS HIM IN  THE MATTER-OF-FACT WAY IT HELPED OBTAIN HIS RELEASE.  </P> <P> Independence Day came a bit early to Peoria this year.  </P> <P> The city, which raised the funds to win the release of kidnaped Scott Heimdal,  is welcoming him home, in the same neighborly but matter-of-fact way it went  about helping win his freedom from Colombian guerrillas.  </P> <P> No parade. No big hero's welcome. Not a lot of self-congratulation for the way  they came to the aid of this native son they hardly knew.  </P> <P> A hundred or so balloon-carrying, sign-waving well-wishers met Heimdal at the  airport upon his return to Peoria Monday night, and another hundred or so  greeted him outside his parent's home. But on Tuesday folks hung back and let  the Heimdals get reacquainted.  </P> <P> "Just the family is going to celebrate," said Angie Heimdal, Scott's sister.  "We're celebrating all week. Thursday is Scott's birthday."  </P> <P> Scott Heimdal, 27, an engineer who worked for the IMINCO Gold Mining Co. in  Ecuador, was kidnaped April 28 while traveling by canoe on business on a river  near the Equadoran-Colombian border. After his arrival in Peoria Monday night  he told with an almost casual air how the man piloting the canoe was killed in  the ambush. A second passenger was abducted along with Heimdal but later was  released with a ransom demand for Heimdal.  </P> <P> His captors wanted $1.2 million for Heimdal's release. They later lowered the  demand to $60,000. Peoria Mayor Jim Maloof asked every household in the  metropolitan area -- there are nearly 60,000 of them -- to contribute at least  a dollar, and the community quickly responded.  </P> <P> Nursery home residents held bake sales, children collected money in jars, bar  owners staged benefit dances, radio stations gave away concert tickets in  exchange for donations to free Scott Heimdal.  </P> <P> The money was raised in a matter of days. In the end, $108,000 was raised for  Heimdal's release, according to some reports. After further negotiations -- the  kidnapers at one point raised the ransom demand to $600,000 -- Heimdal was  released Friday.  </P> <P> "There aren't any words to describe the happiness I feel," said Marge Heimdal,  Scott's mother, upon her return to Peoria Monday night. She and her husband,  Roy, flew to Ecuador two weeks ago to personally take charge of the  negotiations to get their son released.  </P> <P> "I'm very glad my son is with me, but as I said before I left I wasn't coming  home without him."  </P> <P> Roy Heimdal remained in Ecuador to clear up banking business and to help secure  a visa for Scott's Ecuadoran girlfriend.  </P> <P> "This is a powerful story," said Maloof. "It's a mother and dad who, when the  State Department and government officials could not get involved to help, they  took it upon themselves. They would not give up. They had great faith, great  determination and great love."  </P> <P> On Saturday, the family will host a "small reception" in a city park to show  their appreciation to Peoria. Everyone in the city will be invited.  </P> <P> "It's kind of an old fashioned way, a simple way, of saying thank you," said  Jim Maloof, Peoria's mayor and a longtime friend of the Heimdals. "That is far  more valuable, to me, than having a big parade and what have you."  </P> <P> Heimdal said he was kidnaped simply because he is North American.  </P> <P> "I was abducted by the EPL, which is a Colombian guerrilla group," he said.  "The motive for kidnaping me was money to finance the war against the Colombian  government. . . . They were looking to kidnap a North American."  </P> <P> He said he talked his kidnapers, whom he said treated him with "great respect,"  into lowering their ransom demands.  </P> <P> "I just told them they (his parents) don't have that kind of money," he told  reporters. "Very few people in the United States have that kind of money. In  Latin America they feel that being an American and being rich are the same  thing."  </P> <P> Heimdal's family is far from rich. They live in a rented frame house in a  middle-class neighborhood. They moved there two years ago after the family had  been forced to sell everything they owned to pay bills after they went into  debt.  </P> <P> "They just had problem after problem, yet they had the strength and courage to  go on," said Maloof, who has known the family for 20 years. In the early 1980s,  during an economic downturn in Peoria in which Roy Heimdal, then a real estate  agent, lost his job, the family moved to Wisconsin. While there, Marge Heimdal  was twice critically injured in car accidents, one by a drunk driver. Rising  medical bills caused the family to go into debt. They returned to Peoria in  1988.  </P> <P> When the family received the ransom demands from her son's kidnapers, Marge  Heimdal went on television to ask for help. "Her appeal on television and in  all the media was very dramatic: 'I want to save my son,' " said Maloof. "That  triggered a whole lot of action. . . .  </P> <P> "In 1975 we lost a 27-year-old son due to an illness," Maloof said. "The  Heimdal family was as close to me or closer than my own family members during  that time of trouble."  </P> <P> He said he was overjoyed to see that kindness returned. "What a beautiful time  to be the mayor of such a giving community," he said.  </P> <P> After Heimdal's release from captivity on Friday and before his return to  Peoria, Heimdal's two sisters removed the yellow ribbons they had tied to the  trees surrounding the family's house and replaced them with red, white and blue  bunting. More than a dozen small American flags poked from the front lawn to  greet Heimdal's return. A sign stretched across the front door said: "Welcome  home Scott."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Warsaw, 27 Apr--[passage omitted] The president  gave a news conference lasting a dozen minutes or so at Okecie  Airport.    To the comment that Solidarity had called a general strike  for 28 April and was demanding the withdrawal of the so-called  neopopiwek [wage control tax], the president said: "Let's not  allow ourselves to be driven mad; I think common sense will win  in the end. After all, there is no popiwek for the time being.  I have not made a statement on this matter, and I think that  everything will turn out well." [passage omitted]    Asked what he would say to the miners, Walesa replied: "I  would say that the reforms are very difficult, that in the  center of Europe we must change the representatives of the law,  but we must respect the law. Imagine that somebody in Poland  starts driving on the left-hand side, not obeying the law.  Imagine what would happen in Warsaw. It is the same with other  rules."    If you were a worker now, would you go on strike? the  president was asked. "It would depend on what factory I was in:  in one yes, in another no. But I would not overturn the entire  law. That would be going a bit too far," he replied.    Would you be able to create a minority government with the  Polish Peasant Party, based on the Belweder?    "Based on the Belweder, it depends. If somebody said that  only people from the Belweder (were to go) into the government,  then no. But if it were a question of being based on the  Belweder, which appoints (a government), then I am ablebecause I  have a good understanding of circles. Of course, I do not have  a spare set of ministers at the Belweder. We are not talking  about a political government; we are talking about a government  of experts," Walesa replied.    Asked if he would support Grzegorz Kolodko, the Left's  candidate for deputy prime minister and finance minister, the  president said that he had no reservations up to now, and the  candidacy would probably go through. He added that he had no  formal proposal on this matter. [passage omitted]</p>

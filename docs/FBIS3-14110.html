The statement said the battalions had been stationed between  the regions under the control of the self-declared government of  Northern Iraq and Chamchamal region in the Karkuk Province.    There are six officers among the forces, possibly affiliated  to the Iraqi First Corps, the statement said, adding that due to  the harsh economic conditions and political isolation of Iraq,  the number of the personnel deserting the army is increasing in  the country.    According to the sources close to the SAIRI, the Iraqi  forces  would probably intensify their military pressures on the  northern and southern population, in addition to increasing  their threats against Kuwait on the coming days.</p>

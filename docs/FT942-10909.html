			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Arts: American strings A visit to London by the Emerson String Quartet is always eagerly awaited, and the group's concert at the Wigmore Hall on Thursday fulfilled expectations.  As one of the foremost chamber ensembles around today, the Emersons provide a special kind of musical nourishment all too rare. The American group, founded in 1976, has a reputation both for its performances of standard works and for expanding the repertory with significant commissions.  Each work on Thursday's weighty programme - early Ives, late Beethoven and Shostakovich - revealed in turn another of the group's strengths. It was the sheer beauty of the group's sound that characterised its playing of IVe's First Quartet, 'A Revival Service'. Ives drew inspiration for the piece form his work as a church organist.  Hymns spiced up beyond the approval of the ladies' committee found their way into the quartet, but some of the textures are recognisably organ-like, and the Emersons filled the hall with the deep sonorities. All the textures in Shostakovich's Quartet No. 14 were carefully balanced too.  The Emersons played with restraint in the mournful Adagio and radiant conclusion, and made light of the virtuosity the composer demands elsewhere.  Intonation in the high octaves of the first was impeccable. The group's serious-mindedness was epitomised in its approach to the Beethoven, No. 15 in A minor, Op. 132, in which the players sustained the long musical arguments, welding the juxtaposed blocks of material together impressively, never loosing sight of the work's symmetry. The central Heiliger Dankgesang unfolded in all its rapt mystery, leaving one in awe both of the music and the musicianship of the Emersons</p>

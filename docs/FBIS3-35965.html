"Depending on the sides' reaction to the proposal, Russia  plans further steps aiming at termination of combat operations  in Nagorno- Karabakh," said the diplomat.    Bloody fighting around Nagorno-Karabakh has been on since  the  second half of December 1993. It has claimed the lives of  several thousands of people and wounded another several  thousands, mainly the attackers.    "The new escalation of combat operations is even more  senseless as heads of all the warring sides admit the conflict  has no military solution and make statements favoring political  settlement. The bloodshed recurrence hampers peace-making  efforts of Russia and international organizations," stressed the  Foreign Ministry spokesman.</p>

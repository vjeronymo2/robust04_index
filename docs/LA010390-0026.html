			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISSING BAGS  </P> <P> Travelers who find their luggage missing would do well to file a police report,  not just a complaint with the airline -- their luggage may well have been  stolen, not lost.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Department detective who recovered my two bags (empty)  from the home of an arrested receiver of stolen goods advised me that such  theft is a common occurrence at all airlines at all airports.  </P> <P> This receiver had 150 bags at his home when arrested. The detective told me a  thief can waltz out with perhaps four bags a day, selling them each (unopened)  to a receiver for $75 apiece. (One such bag contained $10,000 worth of cocaine,  one thief told the detective.)  </P> <P> Such people are ripping off us, the airlines and their insurance companies.  Perhaps if enough "lost" luggage were repored to the police, security would be  tightened at the baggage claim areas. Since we have electronic readers to route  the bags, can't electronic readers be used to assure that only the proper  owners can retrieve the bags?  </P> <P> I'm glad my real valuables were in my carry-on luggage.  </P> <P> ANITA M.

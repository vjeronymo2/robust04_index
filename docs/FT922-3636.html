			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Bush may soon join rivals on chat shows PRESIDENT George Bush may soon join Governor Bill Clinton and Mr Ross Perot, his rivals for the presidency, on the radio and television talk show circuit, according to rumours swirling around Washington this week. This would represent a substantial tactical shift for Mr Bush who said only last week that he would wait until after the Republican convention in August before engaging in formal full-time campaigning. Even then, he implied he would shun what has become, thanks to Mr Perot, the most popular form of political communication this year. However, the president last week entertained as an overnight guest in the White House Mr Rush Limbaugh, an abrasive and generally conservative radio talk show host. No official word of the discussion has emerged, but it may be assumed he was trying to impress Mr Limbaugh and, by extension, his audience. The president had been frustrated last week when the three main commercial networks refused to carry live his prime time news conference on the grounds that it might amount to no more than free political air time. Talk and celebrity shows, on the other hand, actively compete for prominent guests. The need for both Mr Bush and Mr Clinton to reach out more to the general public was reinforced by another poll yesterday, by the Washington Post and ABC. This not only had Mr Perot in the lead with 38 per cent to the president's 30 per cent and Mr Clinton's 26 per cent, but found Mr Bush's overall approval rating, at 35 per cent, dropping to an historic low. Yesterday morning, Mr Clinton sought to relaunch his struggling campaign further by answering viewer's questions for an hour on NBC's breakfast time 'Today' programme. Mr Clinton said that talk shows could both help and harm; they could help if they eased popular frustration with 'the artificial nature of politics', but harm if they merely encouraged greater 'cynicism'. It was most important, he said, for people to be able to distinguish between good and bad public service. But the medium does not make it easy to get that message over in any detail. In his hour yesterday, reduced to under 50 minutes by station and commercial breaks, Mr Clinton responded to 25 questions, covering the full range from veterans' benefits to Haiti. All his answers were of necessity truncated. The callers had been screened for balance by the programme's producers, which probably explained why only two questions were specifically about the threat of Mr Perot. At Mr Bush's press conference last week, at which reporters could ask what they liked, about half were about the prospective independent candidate.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Generally, where a nonattainment area's anthropogenic sources contribute very little to violations, it is likely that controlling those emissions to the extent feasible for the area will be insufficient to attain the NAAQS. In such cases, it would be unreasonable to require the area to implement more stringent and more expensive controls on anthropogenic sources since they would contribute little to attainment or to reducing the public's exposure to unhealthy air quality. In similar fashion, where nonanthropogenic emission contributions are great, even after the area has taken reasonable steps to reduce them, at some point it may not be feasible for the area to reduce nonanthropogenic (or anthropogenic) emissions sufficiently to effect any real change in ambient concentrations. Consequently, it would be unreasonable to require the area to continue to pursue control measures that are beyond the area's practicable abilities. These principles are discussed below in connection with each of the two waiver tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In selecting an appropriate ``significance'' contribution from anthropogenic sources (for the purposes of deciding whether serious area requirements should be waived), EPA has elected to rely on the test of significance that is applied under new source permitting programs. Under the new source review (NSR) permit program, the EPA requires State permitting programs to consider new major sources or major modifications as causing or contributing to a violation of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS when the source would add, at a minimum, over 5  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/m3 to the 24-hour average or over 1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/m3 to the annual average PM&hyph;10 concentrations in an area that does not or would not meet the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS (see 40 CFR 51.165(b)). Given that the purpose of new source permitting programs is also to protect air quality in both attainment and nonattainment areas, EPA generally believes that the test of significant contribution to violations under that program should also be applicable when determining significant contributions of anthropogenic sources under section 188(f) of the Act. It should also be noted that, in determining ``significance'' for purposes of section 188(f), the plain terms of that provision and its underlying purpose dictate that EPA consider the impact of the anthropogenic sources as a whole. Consequently, where emissions from all anthropogenic sources as a whole contribute less than or equal to 5  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/m3 to 24-hour average design concentrations and less than or equal to 1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/m3 to annual mean design concentrations in a nonattainment area, after all RACM have been implemented, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA will generally regard such contributions as insignificant for purposes of waiving requirements applicable to serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas pursuant to section 188(f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation of RACM (including RACT) is required in all moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas and that requirement is not waived under the provisions of section 188(f). Therefore, the issue is whether anthropogenic sources still contribute significantly to violations of the NAAQS in an area, after implementing RACM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Generally, if an area meeting this test has not yet been reclassified as serious and the area would qualify under this test for a waiver of certain serious area requirements as deemed appropriate by EPA (see discussion below), then EPA will not require reclassification, since that action would have no practical effect. Generally, if the contribution of anthropogenic emissions to the 24-hour design concentration exceeds 5  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/m3, or if the contribution to the annual design concentration exceeds 1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/m3, even after the application of all RACM, then the area should be reclassified as serious, and serious area requirements, including BACM, should be implemented. The EPA will consider exercising its authority to waive serious area requirements on a case-by-case basis where the anthropogenic source contribution exceeds these levels, and it can be persuasively demonstrated that because of unique circumstances, anthropogenic sources do not contribute significantly to violations of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA will consider nonanthropogenic sources to contribute significantly (and hence grant an attainment date waiver) only if, after the application of RACM to nonanthropogenic sources, their contribution to the 24-hour average design concentration exceeds 150  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/m3, or their contribution to the annual mean design concentration exceeds 50  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/m3. Because the basic purpose of title I is to protect public health and welfare through attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS, EPA believes that before it may generally presume a serious area's nonanthropogenic emissions contribution to be significant, that contribution should by itself prevent the area from attaining the NAAQS after reasonable steps have been taken to reduce or minimize their impacts. Areas which do not meet the above criteria, and other situations for which the general presumption is rebutted, will be reviewed on a case-by case basis (see question 4 below).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information derived from chemical and optical analyses of ambient filter catches, area emission inventories, and dispersion modeling to determine maximum source impacts can be used to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic sources. Analysis of filters collected with a network of monitors over a long period (1 or more years) should reveal the portions of normal area PM&hyph;10 concentrations attributable to background, nonanthropogenic, and anthropogenic sources, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

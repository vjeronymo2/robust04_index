			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Thatcher leak undercuts move to boost Major: Conservative attempts to create a public display of unity at conference are undermined FRESH CRACKS appeared last night in the Conservative party's effort to underpin Mr John Major's leadership after the disclosure of further criticism of the prime minister by Lady Thatcher. Despite a subsequent damage-limitation exercise, the first day of the party's Blackpool conference was overshadowed by the leak of excerpts from Lady Thatcher's forthcoming memoirs revealing her less-than-flattering opinion of Mr Major. The furore surrounding the leak, published in the Daily Mirror, forced a public statement last night from the former prime minister in which she recalled that she had backed Mr Major for the leadership when she resigned in November 1990. The Sunday Times, which has bought the serialisation rights to the memoirs, The Downing Street Years, last night failed in an attempt to get a High Court injunction preventing further publication of information from the book and this morning the Daily Mirror printed what it said were more leaked extracts. Lady Thatcher's statement added that she wanted to confirm 'that she would do the thing again today and that she continues to support John Major as leader of the party and as prime minister'. Her friends then flatly denied reports that she had referred in the book to her successor as 'intellectually lightweight', 'politically naive' or 'small-minded'. Beyond those phrases there was little sensational in the leaked report. But the memoirs are understood to reflect Lady Thatcher's view - expressed frequently to confidants - that Mr Major has failed to display firm leadership. One senior Conservative who has seen a manuscript of the memoirs described the report as 'exaggerated but broadly accurate'. The row destabilised attempts by the party leadership to create a public display of unity during what is seen as a critical week in Mr Major's efforts to restore his political authority. With Lady Thatcher due to arrive in Blackpool today and appear alongside Mr Major tomorrow, senior ministers maintained a public display of indifference to her alleged criticisms. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, led calls for the party to bury its divisions. But privately there was anger at Lady Thatcher's continued refusal to give full support to her successor. Party officials said if attempts at bridge-building failed they were determined that she rather than Mr Major should bear the blame for any public breach. The anxious mood of the conference was reinforced by a warning from Lord Tebbit, a leading Eurosceptic, that support for Mr Major from the party's right wing would depend upon him sticking to an aggressively anti-federalist approach to Europe. In a speech designed to prevent a renewed outbreak of the party's civil war over Europe, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said Conservatives now had the opportunity to unite behind a policy which would defend Britain's identity in Europe. But the tensions below the surface were underlined by Lord Tebbit's deliberately faint praise for Mr Major and by a warning from the party's pro-European wing that they would not tolerate concessions to the sceptics. Meanwhile, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was said to be determined to keep open the option of further tax increases in his November Budget.

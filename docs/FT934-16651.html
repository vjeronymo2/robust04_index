			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Groupe Bull agrees factory sale GROUPE BULL, the French state-owned computer group, is to sell one of its two French manufacturing centres as part of a rationalisation programme aimed at stemming heavy losses. According to Bull, it has agreed in principle to sell its factory at Villeneuve d'Ascq in northern France to Decathlon, a French distributor of sporting goods. Bull declined to comment on the price of the proposed sale. The decision comes at a time when Bull is under increasing pressure to reduce losses which have amounted to about FFr15bn (Dollars 2.6bn) over the past three years. The company has asked the French government for FFr9.2bn in new capital over the next two years to help it fund a restructuring plan which includes 6,500 job losses and a shift in emphasis from the production of computer hardware towards services and the supply of software. The French government is considering Bull's request for a capital injection and is expected to make an announcement within the next week. But Mr Karel van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, is considering opening an inquiry into the French state's financing for the computer group. Industry analysts argue that a return to profitability at Bull requires a shift in production to low cost sites, possibly outside Europe and the US. The sale of the Villeneuve d'Ascq plant is regarded as a step in this direction.</p>

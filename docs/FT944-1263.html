			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Observer: Don't Bank on it Scotland's Celtic is the latest football club to tread the road to the stock market. Yesterday it announced a plan to raise up to Pounds 9.4m and disclosed that a group headed by Dermot Desmond, former chairman of Dublin's NCB Stockbrokers, intends to become a significant shareholder in the 106-year-old club. Fans are also being offered a first chance to buy a stake in the club for as little as Pounds 7.77 per week. But the deal failed to impress Celtic's oldest supporter - the Bank of Scotland. After a century-long association, Celtic has dropped the Bank of Scotland and switched its favours to Manchester's Co-operative Bank. Celtic chairman Fergus McCann says the level of support required by Celtic was not forthcoming from Scotland's oldest bank.</p>

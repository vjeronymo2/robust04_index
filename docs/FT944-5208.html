			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: No place for mutuality in Halifax and Leeds building societies Sir, David Miles is wrong on at least two counts when he refers (Letters, November 30) to the obligations building societies have to their members. First, building societies do not repurchase depositors claims - they give members their own money back. Mr Miles's implication that there is some similarity with companies not being obliged to repurchase their equity is misplaced. Second, Mr Miles thinks that building societies have an absolute obligation to give members their money back, when members want it. Power over when, or even if, a building society gives members their money back lies, I am afraid, with the society. Tucked away in the rules of every society are words which say that the board has the power to suspend or limit the payment of withdrawals when, at its discretion, it considers it necessary. Societies may use such power rarely, but they do have it. The real reasons why the Halifax has chosen to convert is simple - a mutual form of corporate governance for an organisation of its size and complexity involving 8m members simply does not work any more. Members of neither the Halifax nor the Leeds have in the past nominated, voted, attended or even appointed proxies in any significant numbers. The operation of a credible form of mutual corporate governance has to be based upon member involvement and participation. And among the UK's building societies it just does not happen. The fleeting exception might be when Halifax and Leeds members are asked to support the merger and subsequent conversion. The only real question at that point will be just how large the inducement will have to be to get them to do even that. And if Mr Miles wants to know what effect the operation of financial markets will have on the Halifax directors' behaviour when it becomes equity based, all he has to do is ask Mr Mike Blackburn, the Halifax's chief executive, how much he already cares about the rating that Standard and Poor awards the Halifax currently. Whatever the strength of the strategic reasons for this merger might be, one has to applaud the Halifax board for wanting to free itself from the hypocrisy of a mutual constitution that is only being maintained by the most basic of life support systems. The kindest course of action for the Halifax is to pull the plug through conversion to end this particular form of corporate diversion.

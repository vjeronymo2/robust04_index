			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Col Kim Serikbayev, Cand Mil Sci: "Reform in the </F> Army: The First Stage Nears Completion"]    [Text] As we know the reform of the republic's armed forces  is proceeding in three stages, each of which is planned to last  1.5-2 years. Its first stage is nearing completion. Have we been  able to accomplish what we planned, and what kind of changes are  happening in the army? It was to these pressing questions that  an article by L. Bakayev titled "The Kind of Army We Need" in  this year's 25 August edition of KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA was  devoted. It illuminated a number of issues rather objectively,  but I believe that there were some inaccuracies in conclusions  pertaining to military doctrine.    Having had the opportunity to participate both in the  development of military doctrine and other legal documents and  in implementing them in the interests of creating the republic's  own armed forces, I would like to share some of my ideas.    L. Bakayev writes that there are three contradictory  principles in Kazakhstan's military doctrine. Leonid  Nikolayevich sees the first contradiction in the presence of a  theater of military operations (TMO) and the possible appearance  of centers of military tension on one hand, and the assertion  that there is no adversary on the other. What can I say? The  obsolete notion that if you have an army, you must have an  adversary as well, is firmly entrenched in our consciousness,  especially among the military. But the situation of recent years  has necessitated new approaches and new conclusions.    Coexistence of states in the present stage is unique in that  the old division of all countries and coalitions into enemies  and allies has, from our point of view (that of the author's  collective that wrote the doctrine), become unsuitable.  Therefore Kazakhstan does not feel any country of the world to  be its adversary, and it makes neither territorial nor any other  claims upon them. This is what is new in the foreign political  activity of our young sovereign state, as expressed in its  military doctrine. It is an objective fact that Kazakhstan is  located at the junction of three theaters of military  operations--European, Near Eastern, Far Eastern. Naturally in  the event of a military conflict in any of these TMOs, a threat  of Kazakhstan's involvement in a war against its will may arise.  But does this really conflict with our belief that no country of  the world is our adversary?    The second contradiction L. N. Bakayev sees is that "despite  the presence of legislative acts prohibiting the use of Kazakhs  in military contingents outside the state and participation of  Kazakh servicemen in 'hot spots,' adherence to collective  security is proclaimed." However, significant changes have  occurred since publication of the Supreme Soviet's decree  prohibiting the transfer of Kazakhs to other regions. A number  of agreements and a treaty on collective security have been  signed by the heads of Commonwealth states. This was preceded by  consultations and meeting within the system of representative,  legislative and executive power of the CIS. Consequently the  military doctrine was approved in December 1992 and servicemen  were sent to defend Tajikistan's borders in June 1993 by a joint  decision of the Supreme Soviet and the republic's government.  This is evidence that the Supreme Soviet, the sole supreme  legislative body of the republic, does not consider its  decisions, once adopted, to be dogma, and that the corresponding  changes may be made in support of the interests of both national  and collective security.    And finally, if we consider that the main objective of  collective security is to adopt effective measures by which to  prevent any kind of conflict, primarily through political and  diplomatic resources, then it becomes obvious that there are no  contradictions of any kind in this case either.    "Third," L. Bakayev writes, "it is proclaimed that nuclear  weapons will not be used, even though Kazakhstan does not have  its own nuclear forces, it does not possess the right to control  them, and there are none located within the state." These  arguments do appear justified at first glance. However, once  again the advent of new legal documents determining both the  right of ownership and the agreement on joint development of a  unified nuclear policy are not accounted for.    Presence of a an interlocking system in the hands of the  leaders of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine allows them to  participate in the control of nuclear weapons on one hand, and  blocks the possibility for the president of Russia to  single-handedly decide to press the nuclear button on the other.  Under these conditions Kazakhstan's clear position, which is  spelled out precisely in its doctrine, was met with the approval  of the world community.    Now about military personnel and military science. We have  an  extremely urgent need, writes L. Bakayev, "to undertake decisive  practical steps" to train personnel. The main directions of  solving this problem were spelled out back in April of last year  at a conference with the president, and he approved them.    We can now summarize some of the results. Some of the  officers that had been discharged into the reserves have been  returned to regular ranks, graduates of civilian VUZes who are  also reserve officers have been called up into the army, and  Kazakh officers serving in other regions are returning. The  border and fire engineering schools were reorganized for the  training of specialists with a higher education, and the Almaty  Higher Combined Arms Command School was transformed for  multiprofile training.    A five-year agreement was signed with the Russian Federation  Ministry of Defense for the training of specialists in Russian  military VUZes. Several graduates of military schools are  studying in Turkey. There are plans for sending representatives  of the republic to other states for training. However, these  measures are not enough to completely solve the personnel  problem. It is especially difficult to predict the future, after  the term of the agreement with Russia, mentioned above, expires.  It would probably be pertinent here to recall the old saying  "Put your hope in God, but don't make any mistakes yourself."    One promising way of eliminating the shortage of national  military personnel is to train them in military boarding  schools. There are three such schools in the republic--in  Almaty, Karaganda and Shymkent. They were opened in 1983, and  they are still on the balance sheet of the Ministry of  Education, even though the personnel are trained primarily for  the Ministry of Defense. These schools need serious and urgent  assistance. Experience tells us that we need to transfer them to  the subordination of the Ministry of Defense.    A proposal by some veterans who recommend establishing  junior  lieutenant training courses in Leninsk, Kurchatov, Priozersk and  other cities deserves attention. As far as opening our own  military academy is concerned, as I see it this is still an  unreachable objective for us. But when it comes to forming  military faculties under the military departments of civilian  VUZes and at the Aktyubinsk Civil Aviation School, this is  something we need to think about.    L. N. Bakayev is absolutely correct when he proposes that we  develop Kazakh military science, upon which the entire personnel  training system is based. But the first thing we need to do is  create the science. I feel that it has become urgently necessary  to establish a special administration of VUZes, military science  and nonmilitary training in the Ministry of Defense that could  forecast and develop the concept of personnel training, and  develop an extensive program of establishing and furthering  military science.    Now about the ways of solving the army's crisis. The facts  L.  Bakayev offers as evidence of the crisis do actually exist in  the army. But I cannot agree with the opinion that "this crisis  is one not of the soldiering masses but of their command": This  can lead to the wrong decisions.    Analysis shows that "dedovshchina" became widespread in the  army in the early 1960s, when persons serving terms for criminal  acts were called up into the army. As for "zemlyachestvo," its  development is associated with events of recent years. Higher  political organs that became absorbed with administration by  injunction, window-dressing and demagoguery lost sight of the  problems of education. All of this promoted transformation of  "dedovshchina" and "zemlyachestvo" into an ugly, abnormal army  tradition, and led to the revelry of violence and brutality and  the army's demoralization. Termination of military-patriotic  work and the repeal of all forms of conscript training also  contributed to the fall in the prestige of military service.    It is absolutely clear that criticism alone isn't going to  solve anything. In our opinion the vacuum in educational work  could be filled by establishing a new institution in the  republic's armed forces. The president supported the initiative  for its establishment by his edict of 18 January of this year,  which introduced the institution of deputies for educational,  social and legal work into the armed forces, from the defense  ministry level down to company commanders and persons equal to  them.    As the president noted in the report he gave at the  republic's ideological conference, we need to develop our own  state concept, one which must be based on instilling Kazakh  patriotism. The president's directives obligate commanders and  leaders of educational institutions to clearly determine the  forms and methods of such education. Consequently the problem  will not be solved without a deeply thought-out concept and a  detailed plan.    The success of any reform depends not only on the  preparedness of the personnel but also on proper statement of  personnel policy. Authoritarianism and protectionism, which are  abnormal phenomena in personnel policy, must give way to  collective decision making and objectivity in deciding the fate  of every officer. Analysis of military history shows that as a  rule, when a commander is ungifted, this has a sharply negative  effect on troop combat training in peacetime, while in wartime  it leads to unjustifiable death of people, and defeat. You can't  hide mediocrity with an officer's trouser stripes and sheepskin  hat.    The adoption of the legal documents only created the  foundation for the reform. Figuratively speaking, the present  stage of the army's development may be likened to Kazakh yurt  with only its wooden frame assembled.    Reform in the army is a process that includes numerous  aspects that fall outside the scope of this article. Its  implementation requires serious work and a long time. I believe  that participation of competent persons directly or through the  mass media in the reform could help to hasten it. Perhaps the  time has come to organize and conduct a scientific-practical  conference, to which a wide range of interested persons could be  invited. As our laws stipulate, security and defense are the  business of all the people.</p>

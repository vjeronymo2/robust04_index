			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROJANS' SECONDARY READY FOR THE WORST  </P> <P> USC's young, inexperienced secondary has been burned with uncommon regularity  this season.  </P> <P> Quarterbacks Tony Sacca of Penn State, Mark Brunell of Washington and Greg Frey  of Ohio State enjoyed their most productive passing games of the season against  the Trojans.  </P> <P> Jason Palumbis of Stanford passed for 360 yards and three touchdowns against  USC, including 230 yards in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Even Arizona, the worst passing team in the Pacific 10 Conference, completed a  48-yard pass play against USC, its longest of the season and one of only four  scoring passes by the Wildcats in 10 games.  </P> <P> So, it is with great trepidation that USC fans look to Saturday's matchup  between the Trojans' secondary and UCLA quarterback Tommy Maddox, who leads the  Pac-10 in total offense and ranks third in the conference in passing  efficiency.  </P> <P> "Maddox is as good as anybody we've played -- maybe better," said Bobby April,  who coaches USC's defensive backs. "He's tremendous. He's on the verge of being  one of the great players in the country."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, April says he doesn't believe that USC's defensive backfield will  be overmatched.  </P> <P> "It's improving each week," he said, adding that, despite a propensity for  giving up a lot of yardage, the Trojans rank third in the Pac-10 in passing  efficiency defense. "Certainly, a lot of times we've given up big plays -- more  big plays than I'm accustomed to giving up. But every week, we've gotten a  little better."  </P> <P> USC has put together a makeshift unit in the backfield. Fourteen months ago,  none of the Trojans' defensive backs were projected as starters this season.  </P> <P> But then:  </P> <P>  -- Cornerback Marvin Pollard blew out a knee.  </P> <P>  -- Safety Mark Carrier, winner of the Thorpe Award as the nation's top  defensive back last season, made himself available for the NFL draft.  </P> <P>  -- Safety Lamont Hollinquest fell behind in class and was suspended by Coach  Larry Smith.  </P> <P>  -- Cornerback DeChon Burns was forced to quit because of a spinal defect.  </P> <P> And it didn't help that the Trojans' top pass rusher, linebacker Junior Seau,  also made himself available for the draft.  </P> <P> April was left with a group that includes two converted tailbacks and a  converted split end. Two of USC's six most frequently used defensive backs are  redshirt freshmen. Another is a true freshman.  </P> <P> Before last March, cornerbacks Mike Salmon and Calvin Holmes were offensive  players. "They'd never even backpedaled before," April said. Salmon has started  in all but three games, Holmes in all but one.  </P> <P> Cornerback Jason Oliver was still in high school last spring. He has started  twice and is expected to start again this week.  </P> <P> The Trojans' on-the-job training has not always gone smoothly.  </P> <P> Still, April said: "I'm not unhappy with the way they're playing. They've made  tremendous strides. People have gone after them -- they've thrown on us a lot  -- and they've improved."  </P> <P> Sophomore Stephon Pace has been the leader of the group, shuffling between  cornerback and safety and making 58 tackles to rank third on the Trojans. He  has two interceptions, and his 14 pass deflections are a team high.  </P> <P> His teammates in the secondary have not been as consistent.  </P> <P> Senior safety Marcus Hopkins has been a disappointment, mostly because the  Trojans, perhaps unrealistically, expected him to have a big season. "I thought  he would be more of an impact guy," April said. "Although he has done a lot of  good things, he hasn't made a lot happen. He hasn't made highlight film-type  plays."  </P> <P> Holmes, a converted tailback, has been a quick study, April said, but still  needs seasoning.  </P> <P> As pass coverage halfback, he is probably the most visible and vulnerable  player in the backfield.  </P> <P> "He's the one who really has his (butt) hanging on the line," April said. "He  has improved as much as any player I've ever had because he's only been a  defensive back for about eight months."  </P> <P> Salmon also has shown flashes of excellence. A converted split end, he leads  the Trojans with four interceptions. Oliver, though, has pushed him for playing  time.  </P> <P> Against Oregon State last week, Oliver intercepted a pass and returned it 66  yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> April sees room for improvement, obviously, but he does not seem discouraged.  When he said, "We have to play better than we have all year in the secondary to  beat UCLA," he said it as if he believed it would happen.  </P></p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Bertam Holdings down at Pounds 284,000 BERTAM HOLDINGS, which has interests in oil palm and rubber plantations as well as property development in Malasia, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 284,000, down from Pounds 354,000, for the six months ended June 30. The company said, however, that the results were not comparable following the sale of 810 hectares to Bertam Properties (40 per cent held) and the purchase of three Malaysian estates in late 1992. Turnover expanded from Pounds 598,000 to Pounds 708,000. Interest income rose from Pounds 138,000 to Pounds 257,000. Earnings worked through at 0.74p (1.07p). Crops and sale prices for both oil palm and rubber were similar to a year ago.</p>

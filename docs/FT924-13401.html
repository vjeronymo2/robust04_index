			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: CBS returns to the black with Dollars 42.7m CBS, the US broadcasting group which owns one of the country's leading television networks, yesterday reported third-quarter net profits of Dollars 42.7m, a significant recovery when compared with a loss of Dollars 169.1m suffered in the same period of last year. The profit, struck on revenues 7.5 per cent up at Dollars 672.8m, translates into earnings per share of Dollars 2.76, against a loss of Dollars 11.11 per share a year ago. CBS said its third-quarter earnings a year ago included a Dollars 195.5m provision related to broadcasts of professional baseball and football. The company, which is controlled by Mr Larry Tisch, the billionaire investor, said profits also benefited from the combined effect of a stronger prime-time programme schedule, better advertisement pricing and active cost control. The CBS television network returned to a 'slightly profitable level' in the third quarter. Net interest income of Dollars 21.5m also helped, as it was twice the level of a year ago. Interest income on investments in the quarter included capital gains of Dollars 14.5m. For the first nine months of 1992, CBS had net income of Dollars 53.8m, compared with a loss of Dollars 95.2m in the same period of 1991. Revenues were Dollars 2.53bn in the first nine months of this year, compared with Dollars 2.09bn last year. On Wall Street, the CBS share price was marked Dollars 1 1/4 lower at Dollars 206.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> PACIFIC NORTHWEST FLOODS KILL 6, DAMAGE HIGHWAYS, RAILROADS  </P> <P> Flood waters from a series of storms that killed six people in the Pacific  Northwest were receding today, but highway and rail traffic between the  region's two major cities remained seriously curtailed.  </P> <P> Damage from high winds and five days of rain and flooding was expected to run  into the tens of millions of dollars, said state officials and insurance  companies.  </P> <P> "We have not even begun to assess financial damage," said Joanne Schwartz, a  commissioner in Washington's Lewis County. "We do know that we have numerous  county roads that have to be rebuilt. This is the worst flooding everybody says  that they have ever seen."  </P> <P> The weather forecast called for another storm from the Pacific Ocean this  weekend.  </P></p>

It is being increasingly  blamed for the ongoing rise in unemployment not only within the  framework of the debate on the country as a center for industry  but in a manner that extends well beyond that. Excessive wage  increases are said to have led to a situation in which there is  an insufficient demand for labor on the part of companies and in  which there is a threat of another sharp rise in unemployment.  However, this approach does not concentrate on the relevant  subject matter to an adequate degree. It is another instance of  narrow-minded economic thinking, which sees the labor market  compared with markets for goods. By contrast, monetary policy  is to a large extent excluded from discussion.  <H5>  Wage Policy </H5>   It is obvious that both sides have made mistakes with  respect  to wage policy. In its January 1992 report, the DIW [German  Institute for Economic Research] wrote that wage policy should  not take things too far in the conflict with monetary policy;  otherwise, a recession and unemployment would be inevitable.  Last year's wage increases already indicated that corrections  were under way, corrections that would permit a high degree of  price stability and competitiveness in the medium term. This  year, the first wage agreements and union demands in key sectors  indicate that the wage increases will be closer to 2 percent  rather than 3 percent.    In public debate on the subject, wage cuts are being  frequently called for with a view to making Germany more  competitive and providing openings for the unemployed. However,  anyone who calls for wage cuts today must take into  consideration the fact that overall economic development in the  1980's was marked by extremely moderate wage growth. Nominal  wage increases hardly exceeded the progress that was made in the  production field. That was also in no small part due to  moderate wage hikes under collective agreements and reductions  in working hours. This behavior on the part of the parties to  collective agreements led to a high degree of price stability on  the one hand and to very substantial increases in profits on the  other hand. Accordingly, there was a boom in investment as a  result of the low cost of capital and low money market interest  rates. The poor level of investment, which was complained about  at the beginning of the 1980's, became entirely a thing of the  past. Until 1991, western Germany recorded a constant rise in  the level of investment, one that was also high in international  terms.    There is no doubt that such a development would have been  impossible if if German labor costs had been "too high"  internationally. The opposite is true. Until 1991, the rate at  which west German unit labor costs were rising, in German marks,  was always below the average rate of increase among Germany's  trading partners. It was not until 1992, when the German labor  market situation at the beginning of the year was still  influenced by the preceding boom and the rest of the world had  already been experiencing the effects of a recession on labor  markets for a long time, that German unit labor costs began to  grow more rapidly in comparison to those among its trading  partners for the first time since 1970.    The fact that at the end of the boom, and at a time when the  labor market situation was good, unit labor costs grew more  rapidly than before and markedly more sharply than prices in  industry is simply the product of a "normal" economic reaction  on the part of unions and employers to a preceding period of  significant increases in profits. One may take exception to  that. However, it is not a convincing basis for expressing  concern about a fundamental change in power structure on the  labor market or constant mistakes on the part of trade unions.  Thus, labor in Germany has not become "too expensive," neither  in international terms -- if one excludes exchange rate  fluctuations -- nor in relation to domestic productivity and  price trends.    There is also no proof to support the assertion that labor  has become too expensive in relation to capital. Labor can only  become too expensive in relation to capital if not only nominal  but also real wages grow "too much," so that in the  manufacturing process, the production of a certain quantity of  goods involves "too little" labor and "too much" capital. The  rate at which real wages increase is not determined by the  parties to collective wage agreements, however, but by the  market or markets, where the prices of all goods are determined.  In addition, the overall rate of economic development would be  an obstacle to a strategy of reducing real wages. One cannot  draw a straightforward comparison between the labor market and  the market for consumer goods.    For example, if there is an oversupply in the automobile  market, a reduction in prices can rapidly lead to an increase in  demand: That does not, mean, however, that the volume of  automakers sales and the demand that they generate will rise.  The situation in the labor market is different. Even if prices  remain constant in the wake of a reduction in nominal wages,  which would entail a reduction in real wages, an increase in  company demand for labor in the short term cannot be expected.  Even if companies consider the reduction in real wages to be  lasting, their first reaction will only be to gradually start to  reorganize the production process with a view to making it more  labor intensive. However, what would have an immediate impact is  a drop in demand, which would probably entail a further increase  in unemployment. That would in turn lead to another reduction in  real wages. Even if a strategy for reducing wages were  considered possible and economically safe, it would pose  problems for a country such as the Federal Republic. A  reduction in real wages and the change in the ratio of labor to  capital that this entails, one tending toward greater labor  intensiveness, also means a decline or at least a lower rate of  growth in productivity. It is also questionable whether Germany  would then still be able to manufacture the products that are  manufactured by the leading group of technologically advanced  countries.    Wage cuts -- irrespective of how they are justified in each  individual case -- constitute a defensive strategy that does not  promise success. However, a modern wage policy -- as the  institutes jointly recommended in the fall of 1993 -- is  warranted. As a fundamental adjustment to distribution is not  required, wage negotiations over the next two years will be  solely about making a adjustment to those increases in 1991 and  1992 that have exceeded the medium-term rate. If wage  agreements were of the order of 2 percent, that would be  guaranteed for the entire economy. If this course were to be  followed, then it would be possible to make the adjustments that  are appropriate for each branch of industry without abandoning  the principle of overall collective agreements.    After two "adjustment years," wage policy can return to a  reasonable medium-term rate of about 4 percent. The normal and  necessary economic adjustments to distribution that benefit  profits will entail increases in productivity, increases that  will significantly exceed the medium-term course in the short  term. All demands that tend downward regarding such a course,  including those that follow one or several rounds of zero wage  increases, are economically harmful and also harm company  profits.    Zero wage increases are also inappropriate in an  international context because -- especially in Europe -- they  only lead to increased pressure on wage settlements in partner  countries. This is also an area in which there is a fundamental  inconsistency in the present discussion: A devaluation of the  German mark vis-a-vis European currencies is categorically  rejected, a freeze on wage increases or reductions in nominal  wages, which would have the same effect -- namely a devaluation  of the German mark in real terms -- internationally, are being  discussed and promoted as possible solution.  <H5>  Reductions in Working Hours </H5>   In view of the rapid increase in the number of unemployed to  an annual average of 4 million this year and the possibility of  a high level of unemployment in the medium term, further  reductions in working hours are being discussed. Volkswagen has  come up with a radical option in this respect. The Volkswagen  proposal of a drastic reduction in working hours is only a model  for companies that expect a significant reduction in personnel  to be necessary in the medium term. Because the loss of income  that personnel will experience could be marked, the state can  offer some compensation in this regard. What would, for  example, be appropriate is a temporary and degressive reduction  in unemployment insurance contributions for those concerned.  This would also compensate for the lower benefits provided by  unemployment insurance under the Volkswagen model.    However, in terms of the economy as a whole, such a large  step as the reduction in working hours at Volkswagen is barely  acceptable. Thus, individual steps aimed at reducing working  hours should, as has been the case until now, take place within  a framework of higher productivity. This permits settlements to  be found that have a neutral impact on costs and maintain the  real income levels of those affected by such moves.    At the same time, shorter working hours should be  accompanied  by a further separation of working hours and machine operating  hours. Optimal plant operating hours are necessary for a country  like the Federal Republic of Germany with its relatively high  wage and high capital costs if it is to compete internationally.  Internal company agreements on annual working hours can better  harmonize company and personal interests than has been the case  so far. Thus, overall, a significant contribution can be made  to reducing unemployment.  <H5>  Fiscal Policy </H5>   So far, fiscal policy has prevented more serious harm from  occurring to overall economic development. In 1993, the  contribution of the state amounted to as much as 1 percent of  the GDP. To a large extent, this was the result of stabilizing  factors that are built into taxation and transfer systems. This  year, the effect of these elements will be much weaker. In  addition, there are also the negative effects of discretionary  components -- that is, reductions in social welfare provisions,  as well as increases in taxes and contributions so that in 1994,  the state will have a restrictive influence on the overall  economy.    There is no doubt that fiscal policy is in a precarious  situation. The possibilities for it are more limited than  before with regard to offsetting a reduction in private demand  and providing a positive stimulus to the economy. The rapid  increase in the level of state debt reduces whatever room for  maneuvering there is. In 1995, there will be a further increase  in the state debt when the state takes over the debts of the  Trust Agency. The state will then have debts totaling almost  2.2 trillion German marks [DM], which will require annual  interest payments totaling DM150 billion -- almost a fifth of  all tax receipts.    The difficult state budget situation is primarily due to the  fact that costs of German unification were largely financed with  loans. However, it is also a reaction to the fact that, for a  long time, monetary and fiscal policy have had conflicting  effects in the economy. The costs that adjustments entailed and  had to be borne by fiscal policy as a result of a restrictive  monetary policy and its effects on the economy were significant.  If monetary policy now becomes more expansive, it would be  disastrous if fiscal policy were then to counteract a more  relaxed monetary policy. Used correctly, monetary and fiscal  policy are the key automatic stabilizing elements in a free  market system.    In times of recession, monetary policy becomes more stable  through a rapid normalization of the interest rate structure and  fiscal policy does so through the acceptance of growing  deficits. If one of these stabilizing factors is absent, the  other policy area has a greater burden to bear. A strategy from  which both these stabilizing elements are absent prolongs a  recession. However, this year, monetary policy will only  gradually be equal to its responsibility. Thus, 1994 is an  exceptionally inappropriate time for attempting to consolidate  public budgets. Reductions in expenditure mean reduced demand  and lower incomes in the economy as a whole and lower taxes and  social insurance contributions. For this reason, the government  cannot be sure that its austerity program, which amounts to DM20  billion, will result in a reduction in the deficit of the same  order. In the best case, the shortfall that has to be financed  will be reduced by DM10 billion. Finally, the state will only  regain the ability to act if there is a lasting upturn, because  only then will revenues rise and the need for funds to finance  unemployment will diminish, and only then can the contributions  made to other social insurance systems be reduced.    In the discussion on the causes of the recession, it leads  to  confusion to repeatedly mention dues that are "too high" and  "too high" a level of social benefits. These assertions do not  tally with the fact that the enormous expansion of employment in  the late 1980's and the 1990's took place within such a social  framework. It makes just as little sense at a time of declining  demand for labor to make the seemingly inflexible range of jobs  offered ("excessively high benefits") responsible for  unemployment. No one "suddenly" decided to become unemployed in  1992 to take advantage of the high level of unemployment  benefits. To redefine the current level of unemployment, which  is due to economic factors, as "voluntary" unemployment rules  out finding a solution that tackles causes.    Of course, in a recession, the social insurance burden on  companies is much higher than in an economic upturn. The social  welfare system must be maintained in a crisis. It will now  become apparent whether the system operates efficiently -- that  is, is it in a position to alleviate the effects of the economic  crisis on those who have been affected involuntarily and, thus,  contribute to stabilizing the entire system. Like wage costs,  in a recession, social insurance payments -- and taxes -- cannot  be low enough for companies. However, what might appear right  for a businessman in a given situation is not necessarily  advantageous for the economy as a whole. What economic policy  requires at the present time is not a limit on employment market  instrument but the expansion of such instruments. This  particularly applies to eastern Germany, where the state will  bear a responsibility for developments on the labor market for a  long time to come.    Today -- and this discussion also has a cyclical character  --  the social welfare system is seen as being too costly to  finance. It should not be forgotten that the current low level  of public funds is the product of taxation (redistribution)  measures in the 1980's and the beginning of the 1990's. The  declared aim of the policy was to increase incentives in order  to make the economy more competitive internationally. This  policy not only failed to prevent the recession but could not  succeed because the international race to lower taxation has  resulted in all economies having a high level of state debt.    When there is an economic upswing, the condition of public  finance almost "automatically" improves, just as its condition  worsens when there is a downturn. However, it remains an open  issue whether the improvement will result in attaining what is  considered a normal level. Much depends on the extent to which  politicians are prepared to check the content and scope of state  tasks and create more efficient administrative structures. It  is rightly conjectured that there is considerable potential for  economies in public administration. In the short term, however,  this potential can barely be used.  <H5>  Monetary Policy </H5>   Wage policy has performed its role in a reasonable way in  that it has responded to the recessionary increases in  unemployment with declining nominal wage increases. This also  means it has been the most important element in combating  inflation in Germany. A provision has been made for ensuring  that the shocks that the German economy has experienced in the  wake of unification can be dealt with with in the medium term  without inflation. The mechanism that has produced this result  can be easily understood: As a result of the reduction in the  availability of money that is prompted by an economic upturn,  monetary policy causes interest rates to rise, which leads to  lower investment activity and unemployment, and because  unemployment means that fewer wages are being paid out, this in  turn leads to a new upturn, which is prompted by a reduction in  interest rates above all.    Whether the inflation rate rises or falls at the same time  has no bearing on whether the operation of the mechanism is  successful, because only an increase in prices that leads to  higher wages on a constant basis leads to inflation.    The restrictive effect of monetary policy will immediately  prevent demand-related inflation, as well as a cost-related  secondary inflation through the wage adjustment process that has  been described.    What monetary policy cannot in itself prevent is an increase  in the rate at which prices grow as a result of a real decrease  in supply -- the effects of the explosion in oil prices provided  a textbook illustration of this. Ultimately, such price  increases have an important function: They alter relative  prices and create an incentive for substitution, for increasing  the supply of the scarce commodity and for restricting demand  until a higher level of supply is available. However, it is  also conceivable that to the extent that one particular price  rises, others will fall, so that despite a real shock, the  inflation rate will remain stable. The reduced supply of one  particular commodity does not automatically lead to a decline in  the demand for other goods, because as a rule, a reduction in  supply is accompanied by the redistribution of income, which  does not have to affect effective demand. As a result, a  reduction in demand for other goods must be achieved through  monetary policy. However, that can only occur by way of rising  interest rates and rising unemployment, as described above.    Nevertheless, monetary policy does not have to prevent an  increase in price levels that stems from a real shock, because  after a certain period of time, the rate at which prices grow  returns to its previous level if waged-induced secondary  inflation does not occur. This cannot be expected under the  conditions that exist in western Germany if unemployment  increases.    In the case of the FRG, the real shock was unification at  the  beginning of the 1990's. It entailed an enormous redistribution  of state resources that was to a large extent financed through  raising indirect taxes. Such measures have a direct impact on  prices. The housing shortage in western Germany has also become  more acute through migration. In view of the liberalization of  the housing market, this has resulted in rapid increase in  rents. At its highest point, the increase in rents amounted to  over 6 percent (at the end of 1992). Rents and administrative  prices have had a big impact on the rate of inflation. They  kept the rate at which prices were rising high well into the  recession. A monetary policy that is oriented toward the  inflation rate is led of course by this effect. That is  precisely what happened in Germany. German monetary policy has  not followed a medium-term oriented strategy, but starting in  the middle of 1992, sought to limit the risk of inflation, which  no longer existed, with an approach based on small steps. Once  the recession had started, the Bundesbank, following a  medium-term course, should have sought to reduce its key  interest rates quickly and by substantial amounts to support and  accelerate the fall in long-term interest rates stemming from  the worldwide recession. The Bundesbank did not do that and the  consequences are grave. To express things clearly, the German  Bundesbank's policies are forcing industry into a crisis in  terms of costs and earnings, because more housing is needed in  Germany.    This policy means that jobs are being lost, because it is a  policy that prolongs and intensifies the crisis. Anyone who  complains about a new increase in unemployment must take account  of the following: Over the past 20 years, monetary policy has  steadily become more restrictive. In the 1950's and 1960's,  interest rates never assumed an inverse character. At the  beginning of the 1970's it amounted to five quarterly periods  for the first time. In the middle of the 1970's, following the  highest inflation rate that the FRG had experienced since the  beginning of the 1950's, it amounted to four quarterly periods.  At the beginning of the 1980's, it was already 11 quarterly  periods. Since the beginning of 1991, it has already amounted  to 12 quarterly periods.    Monetary policy that is geared toward continual expansion  must always allow for a slowing down of economic growth. If one  wants to stabilize prices, one must be in a position to check  investment activity and accept unemployment temporarily in the  belief that in the medium term, the inflation rate will come  closer to the goal that has been set because wage policy has  responded accordingly. That has always been the case in western  Germany. Thus, there is no reason for monetary policy to become  extraordinarily restrictive.    Since the summer of 1992, doubts have always been voiced  about a rapid reduction in central bank interest rates. At a  time when the German mark was largely under pressure to rise in  value and subsequently became an overvalued currency after being  an undervalued one, it can be assumed that the argument has  little to do with reality: A rapid reduction in German money  market interest rates would have led to a devaluation of the  German mark and an increase in German capital market interest  rates, because it has boosted expectations that inflation will  rise and the difference in interest rates between Germany and  other countries has grown. As has been pointed out several  times in this article, since the summer of 1992, there was no  basis for fearing inflation and -- as the rather premature  behavior of several central banks showed in the first half of  1993 -- other European countries responded to a reduction in  German interest rates with appropriate reductions. However, even  if there was a certain devaluation of the German mark in  relation to, for example, the U.S. dollar, it would counteract  the tendency to overvalue the German mark -- that is, a  situation that is as undesirable in the long term as that trend  toward undervaluing the German mark that lasted many years.    A rapid relaxation of monetary policy has been and is  rejected with the argument that this would lead to an expansion  of the M3 money supply. This argument is questionable for two  reasons: First, over the past one and a half years, the  expansion was justified in terms of potential: As has been  indicated on many occasions, the Bundesbank set far too low a  money supply target for 1992. Second, a rapid reduction in  interest rates on short-term deposits -- despite a significant  increase in the M1 money supply -- has not led to an  acceleration, but to a slowing down of the M3 money supply, as  many depositors have reduced short-term savings -- an important  component of the M3 money supply -- by converting such savings  into long-term forms of investment.    Trends toward checking monetary expansion are already  apparent. The slowing down of monetary expansion should continue  this year, especially as money market interest rates continue to  fall. In this respect, the Bundesbank goal of between 4 and 6  percent for 1994 is completely realistic. However, the  Bundesbank's money supply goal contains an element that responds  to economic developments in a way that cannot be reconciled with  a medium-term strategy. The Bundesbank is not guided by  whatever rate of growth is possible in the medium term but by  the actual current rate of growth. The potential medium-term  rate of growth amounts to 3 percent, whereas the actual rate  amounts to 2.5 percent. This relatively low rate is  attributable to the decline in west German investment activity.  The decline is not entirely but largely due to a restrictive  monetary policy. To allow that to influence the future monetary  supply goal simply amounts to a partial abandonment of the  concept of a medium-term monetary policy and the inclusion of a  cyclical factor.</p>

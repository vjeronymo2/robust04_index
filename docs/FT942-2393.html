			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / 'Fragile' consumer confidence seen Weakness in the housing market is the greatest threat to further consumer spending growth, PA Cambridge Economic Consultants says today in its latest quarterly survey. It adds that consumer confidence remains fragile but has improved slightly following the impact of April's tax increases. Only 12 per cent of people believe the recession has ended, it says. However, the number of people intending to buy houses or flats within the next year has fallen to its lowest level since the survey began more than three years ago.</p>

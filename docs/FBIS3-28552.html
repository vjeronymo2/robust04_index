			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung, head  of the non-profit Peace Foundation for the Asia-Pacific region,  has called for an early summit meeting between South and North  Korean Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Kim Il-song.    Kim, in Hong Kong on his way home from a 10-day tour to  Sweden, Norway and Denmark, told foreign reporters here that the  two heads of state should meet in Seoul or Pyongyang as soon as  possible to end their hostility and distrust, and instead open a  new era of cooperation and reconciliation.    A meeting between the leaders of the capitalist South and  communist North itself would be significant, the long-time  opposition leader said.    Kim, chairman of the private think tank on Korean  unification  and Asian democratization, made it clear that he had no  intention of meeting North Korean leaders before the summit nor  did he wish to return to politics.</p>

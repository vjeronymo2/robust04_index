			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses mixed on devaluation effect HOPES of lower interest rates boosted shares in Milan yesterday, but the Bundesbank's decision to keep its rates high hit prices in Paris and Frankfurt, writes Our Markets Staff. Mr Sushil Wadhwani, the Goldman Sachs strategist, said last night that recent events were good news for European equities, at a minimum implying lower interest rates in countries where they had risen to protect the currency, and a probable acceleration in the timetable to cut German rates. FRANKFURT closed an uncertain day with a late decline, the DAX index ending 5.89 lower at 1,578.67. Caution reigned ahead of the expiry of stock and futures options today, and the French Maastricht referendum on Sunday, and turnover fell from DM6.3bn to DM5.9bn. Currency considerations moved from the D-Mark/dollar relationship to that with others in the EC, and the threat to some major exporters. Volkswagen dropped DM9.20 to DM320.80, cutting its rise on the week to just DM4.80, while BMW, only DM2.50 lower at DM544.50, stayed DM28.50 ahead on the week. Mr Horst-Kaspar Greven, of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, said that VW had such thin margins in Europe that a 1 per cent swing in the D-Mark/French franc parity could wipe out its trading profits there, whereas BMW was much more profitable. VW too, he said, was more susceptible to the fear that the German consumer would cut spending, and push up the national savings ratio in the interests of economic austerity. That fear hit retailing, where Douglas, Karstadt and Kaufhof fell DM10 to DM455, DM4.50 to DM525, and DM11.50 to DM418.50 respectively, all showing falls on a week over which the DAX was still 3.3 per cent higher yesterday. Meanwhile, Mannesmann lost DM12 to DM231 and Thyssen DM4.50 to DM190, both emerging as serious underperformers on the week so far after Reuter, in Amsterdam, reminded markets of the serious overcapacity in the European steel industry. PARIS was disappointed in the Bundesbank decision, which stifled a morning rally and left the CAC-40 index down 7.04 at 1,852.74, after an intraday high of 1,879.32. Turnover remained reasonable at FFr3bn. Some corporate news enlivened activity with first half earnings from LVMH coming in slightly ahead of expectations. Its shares closed up FFr35 at FFr3,913. Chargeurs also pleased the market with good figures, particularly from the textile division, and it closed FFr59 ahead at FFr1,199. MADRID seemed to be undecided about the merits of a pesata devaluation, as the general index shed 0.27 to 210.98. Turnover was high at Pta15bn. Some analysts said that devaluation was likely to add seriously to the inflation rate and affect the economy because of the lack of a strong export base. There were also fears that the interest rates may have to be raised. The Spanish component of the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index, expressed in D-Marks, fell 32.91 to 965.50 in the post-bourse. Active stocks included Popular, up Pta70 at Pta9,760 and Union Fenosa, down Pta26 or 4.9 per cent at Pta499 with some 3.2m shares traded. AMSTERDAM found much to talk about after Elsevier revealed that it was to merge with Reed of the UK. Some analysts were cautious about the terms and Elsevier's shares shed Fl 11.50 or 9.8 per cent to Fl 105.20. Frans Maas, the transport group, reported a 6 per cent increase in first half earnings, and it closed Fl 2.50 higher at Fl 62.50. MILAN, which soared on Monday when the lira saw a limited devaluation (and receded on Tuesday and Wednesday), climbed again as the Bank of Italy suspended its obligations to keep the lira inside the set limits of the ERM. The Comit index rose 12.22 to 367.15, leaving the market little changed on the week so far in lira terms. The hard currency investor, meanwhile, is looking at a fall of nearly 10 per cent in the lira denominated equities against the D-Mark over the same period. ZURICH, the professionals' investment choice in recent days, closed higher in heavy volume, dominated by foreign demand. Major banks and front-line industrials were in the limelight as the SMI index rose 15.6 to 1,889.6. A higher Swiss franc and lower interest rates helped Union Bank bearers top the active list as it rose SFr11 to SFr770, CS Holding bearers putting on SFr95 to SFr1,905. Nestle came second, its bearers gaining SFr11 to SFr988, and Brown Boveri were also active as the bearers rose SFr70 to SFr3,800. BRUSSELS enjoyed another day of advances, led by dollar-sensitive stocks. The Bel-20 index gained 20.96 to 1,131.56. Delhaize was one of the strongest performers, up BFr70 or 4.2 per cent at BFr1,710. STOCKHOLM saw advances in some dollar-sensitive blue chips and forestry shares although the general mood remained uncertain. The Affarsvarlden Index lost 4.7 to 735.3 in turnover up to SKr505m from SKr430m. Banks were upset by high interest rates and news on Wednesday that Gota AB had suspended payments to creditors. S-E-Banken C shares lost SKr2.00 to SKr11.50 and Handelsbanken B shares dropped SKr5 to SKr25. OSLO gained on the stronger dollar as the composite index advanced 5.7 to 324.18 in turnover of NKr267.4m. Among the day's strongest performers were Norsk Hydro, up NKr5 to NKr144 and Saga Petroleum free shares up NKr3.50 at NKr66.50. HELSINKI displayed one of the open wounds of the Nordic markets this year. The HEX index rose 1.6 to 578.7 but this masked a 10.5 per cent drop in the bank and finance index on continued gloomy prospects for the industry.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 17                             Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open     10.30am   11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1058.54  1059.29  1060.09  1058.70  1056.45  1055.28  1056.07  1058.13                 Day's High  1062.33    Day's Low  1053.80         Sep 16      Sep 15      Sep 14     Sep 11      Sep 10        1053.63      1051.69    1073.79    1033.57     1027.59  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

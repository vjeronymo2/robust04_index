			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pepsico to take Dollars 125m restructuring charge PEPSICO, the US soft drinks, restaurants and snacks group, is to take a Dollars 125m charge against fourth-quarter earnings to cover the restructuring of its domestic beverage operations, along with 'several international operations'. The company said the restructuring of the domestic beverage division related primarily to the management structure there, and had already been outlined in the quarterly filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Pepsico declined to elaborate on which international operations were involved in the overhaul. However, it said that the annual cost-savings from these changes should be around Dollars 150m. The company combined news of the restructuring charge with an announcement that it intended to adopt two non-cash accountancy changes. These will also primarily affect earnings during the fourth quarter, although both changes will also have a small impact on future earnings. The first change relates to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 106, which deals with the treatment of retirees' health benefits, and will involve a one-off charge of Dollars 575m before tax (or Dollars 357m at the net level, equal to 44 cents per share). The second deals with SFAS 109, which relates to income taxes, where the one-off charge will be in the range of between Dollars 400m and Dollars 550m after tax, or 49 to 68 cents per share. Pepsico said the size of the SFAS 109 charge reflected the significant increase in intan-gible assets stemming from the large number of acquisitions the company had made.</p>

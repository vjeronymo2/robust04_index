			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / International Company News: Murdoch to sell Boston paper to clear TV deal News Corporation, the media group, is to sell the Boston Herald newspaper in the US to clear the way for the acquisition of the city's WFXT television station. Chairman and chief executive Mr Rupert Murdoch said yesterday the sale was necessary under the Federal Communications Commission's cross-ownership rule prohibiting the joint ownership of a television station and a newspaper in the same market. The newspaper, with a circulation of about 350,000, competes with the larger Boston Globe. It is being sold for an undisclosed sum to a News Corp executive - Mr Patrick Purcell, the publisher of the Boston Herald and the New York Post - who will now leave News Corp to run the paper. The WFXT television station is an affiliate of the Fox television network, a News Corp subsidiary. It was previously owned by News Corp but was sold to Boston Celtics Broadcasting in 1990 to comply with the FCC rule. Last autumn, News Corp acquired options to re-acquire WFXT but said the Boston Herald would have to go if the options were exercised. Mr Rupert Murdoch said yesterday he was 'saddened to give up what has become an excellent newspaper and a wonderful resource of executive talent'.</p>

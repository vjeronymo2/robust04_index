			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, June 11 (XINHUA) -- The total output value  of the rural areas of this north China industrial port city in  1993 hit 63 billion yuan, and the per capita annual income of  farmers reached 1,593 yuan, increases of about 13 percent over  the previous year.    About 600 villages in the suburban areas have become  better-off ahead of time. They also have made great  achievements in science and technology, education, culture, and  in health care.    Meanwhile, township enterprises are mushrooming in the  suburban areas. The city now has 30,800 township firms,  employing 885,700 workers. The rural industrial output value  accounts for 36 percent of the city's total.    Also, economic development zones at all levels have taken  initial shape, and more than 100 projects in the zones have gone  into operation.    The latest figures show that the overall rural industrial  output value of the zones accounts for 36 percent of the city's  total. Some 14 township enterprises engaged in metallurgy,  machinery, chemicals and textiles have achieved a total annual  output value exceeding one billion yuan each.    As rural industrialization progresses farmers have begun to  turn their eyes from solely production to the market. Large  numbers of business and trading companies which combine  production and sales have been set up in the rural areas.    Each year the suburban counties provide the city with more  than two billion kg of fresh vegetables. In addition, some of  them have become processing centers for non-staple foodstuffs.    So far, Tianjin has built 44 satellite towns with all the  necessary utilities and modern multifunctional buildings.    The majority of the suburban towns and villages have  schools,  hospitals, nurseries and entertainment centers. In Tianjin all  the villages have electricity and running water.    In the rural areas about 95 percent of the farmers enjoy  social welfare. The average per capita living space has reached  nearly 18 sq m, and most farmers live in two-story houses.    Meanwhile, since the rural areas provide abundant labor and  raw material resources, about 80 percent of the city's garment  factories and several auto parts companies have been set up in  the suburban areas.</p>

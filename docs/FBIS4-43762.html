			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Some of the views of the IBDA-C </F> [Islamic Great Eastern Raiders Front"]]    [Text] Secularism: "We are against the concept of  secularism in Turkey. We believe that it has no historical or  ideological basis within Turkish culture. No other state is so  afraid of its own people. It exerted special efforts to implant  the notion of discrimination between Islam and canonical law in  the minds of the people. The Ataturk revolution was against  Islam. That is why we question it."    The United States: "The United States is afraid of radical  Muslims and is searching for moderate Muslims to act as its  agents. This is its concession to the Muslims."    Fethullah Gulen: "He is a volunteer agent of the secular  front."    Great Unity Party [GUP]: "The fact that its grass roots are  Muslim obliges the GUP to adopt an anti-Kemalist stand or at  least show that it is not Kemalist. All it has done so far is  to pursue a contrived policy that wavers between Kemalism and so  called anti-Kemalism."    Turkish-Islamic synthesis: "Our ideological relations with  the Intellectuals Hearth are not good at all. We are against  such things as the Idealist movement and Turkish-Islamic  synthesis. One cannot combine Turkish nationalism and Islam.  Islam comes first."    The Kurdish issue: "Islam does not interfere in the customs  and traditions of any race, religion, or language. It gives  them freedom. The Kurdish problem is a regional issue."</p>

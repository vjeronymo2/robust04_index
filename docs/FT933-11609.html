			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Pakistan remains firm PAKISTANI stock prices continued their bullish fervour yesterday, with the KSE-100 index closing 13.17 higher at 1,432.07, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad. The continuing rise is largely the result of last week's devaluation of the rupee, which has improved export prospects for textiles. Almost one-third of the KSE's 652 listed companies are textiles, which have suffered losses during the past year due to sagging exports. The market's positive sentiment has also come in response to a visit to Washington this week by Mr Moeen Qureshi, the prime minister, who is expected to hold discussions with senior officials at the IMF and World Bank, to clear the way for fresh loans.</p>

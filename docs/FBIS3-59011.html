Mr. de Ruiter, who will be traveling to South Africa this  weekend, will head a team of experts in the areas of the  electoral process, law, the media, conflict resolution,  security, and logistics.    The unit, which will work closely with South Africa's  Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), will be responsible for  the coordination of the European Union's support for the  forthcoming election and for the deployment of some 312 EU  observers.    This support constitutes an essential element of the joint  action decided by the European Union on 6 December 93 to  underpin the transition of South Africa to a democratic and  multiracial country.    The European Union will provide advice, technical assistance  and training, and continued support for non-partisan voter  education, as part of an overall international effort  coordinated by the United Nations.    In this context, the European Commission has allocated about  ECU12 million (rand 43 million) to assist the South African  election. This does not include direct support by EU member  states. Further financial resources can be made available for  this initiative, if required.</p>

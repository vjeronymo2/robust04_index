			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Down - but not yet out - What next for C&amp;G and Lloyds? After euphoria comes disappointment for most Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester customers, who had been looking forward to generous pay-outs from the building society's take-over by Lloyds bank. Lloyds was to have paid C&amp;G Pounds 1.8bn in cash, which the society intended to distribute among most of its 1.4m customers and staff. All C&amp;G investing members would have been entitled to a bonus of 10 per cent of the balance in their accounts once the deal was completed - providing they had the account at March 31 1994 and held it to completion day. Voting investors and all borrowers would have been entitled to a Pounds 500 cash pay-out as well. The plan was thrown into doubt when Sir Donald Nicholls ruled in the High Court this week that Lloyds could not make cash payments to members who had been investors for less than two years before December 31 1993. Investing members are those with a share account such as Cheltenham Gold, London Share or Instant 7. The judgment also suggested that the society's borrowers - around 370,000 of them - could not be paid at all unless they happened to have a share account. C&amp;G had wanted to give generously to its more recent investing members and to its borrowers to ensure that the deal went through. It needs the approval, in separate votes, of both types of member but it faces a potential problem. Since about 27 per cent of the society's 840,000 voting investors have been with the society for less than two years, C&amp;G wanted to include them in its distribution of sweeteners for fear of their scuppering the deal. Customers of societies taken over by C&amp;G in the past two years - Heart of England and Mid-Sussex - count as C&amp;G members providing they had been members of their old societies since December 1991. So, what should customers of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester do now? An FT straw poll in a Birmingham branch of C&amp;G after the judgment found many disgruntled customers. But anger should not be a reason to consider leaving the society. There is no suggestion that the High Court has stopped the merger taking place - simply that it objects to elements of its structure. Lloyds says its bid still stands and C&amp;G is trying to come up with a new structure acceptable both to its voting members and to the Building Societies Commission. The commission's challenge to C&amp;G's original plan led to the court hearing. C&amp;G says it will be several weeks before it will be in a position to say anything substantive. But it still wants to come up with a deal to benefit all its members and staff and it might yet decide to appeal against the ruling. While C&amp;G is not commenting on the form a restructuring might take, analysts have suggested: Offering preference shares to all shareholders and borrowers, or offering these shares to new members. It is unlikely that C&amp;G would be allowed to offer shares which could be exchanged easily for cash. Giving members of less than two years' standing some value for the surrender of their voting rights. Closing the society to new members until all had acquired at least two years' standing. Halting the growth of the society in this way would be a drastic step, although C&amp;G has barred new customers from joining as it considers its options. It says that it will be closed only for a few days to stop people from joining in the mistaken belief that they will be able to make money by doing so. Loans threat, Page VIII</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / International Company News: Ambroveneto to control Sicilian bank Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), a leading Italian bank, is extending into southern Italy by buying control of Societa Banche Siciliane, a small Sicilian bank. Ambroveneto is paying about L85bn (Dollars 51m) for 69.2 per cent of SBS, held by Istituto Centrale di Banche e Banchieri. It will purchase a further 9 per cent from the minority shareholders who own the rest of the stock. The acquisition will allow Ambroveneto, which is concentrated in northern Italy, to break into the underdeveloped Sicilian market. SBS has 29 branches and 300 employees across the island. This purchase follows the acquisition last year of Citibank's retail banking operations, concentrated in the Naples area. Milan-based Ambroveneto has grown rapidly in recent years, and now has 500 branches nationwide.</p>

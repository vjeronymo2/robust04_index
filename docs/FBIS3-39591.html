			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mario Monti: "True Solidarity"] </F>   [Text] At a time when there are cries and recriminations on  the unemployment problem, an "Informative Note on The Problems  of Employment and Development," distrisbuted yesterday by the  Office of Social Problems and Labor of the Italian Episcopal  Conference (CEI), deserves particular attention. This document  sheds light on the two most serious aspects of Italian  unemployment, and clearly indicates suitable policies for  tackling this problem.    In our country this problem is particularly serious because  unemployment is concentrated in the south and among young people  (thus, it strikes the youth of the south very hard).    The document observes, "The rate of unemployment in central  northern Italy is no greater than the level in the former West  Germany (8 percent), and in the north it can be compared to the  more modest unemployment level in the USA (6.7 percent). On the  other hand, in the south, unemployment is now 18 percent. Apart  from certain regional or short-lived situations, the problem of  unemployment in Italy is, therefore, essentially a problem of  the south and its unsuccessful development." Thus, "the work,  which should be shared in order to redistribute jobs, is  unfortunately concentrated in the north. In the south there is  still a need to build factories (and not only this, of course)."    As far as the structure of unemployment by age and family  background is concerned, the document notes (even though data  from 1991 are used) that only 12 percent of the unemployed are  heads of families, versus an average of 37 percent in Europe. On  the other hand, 63 percent of the unemployed are children versus  an average of 38 percent in Europe. From the results of another  recent study among industrialized countries, Italy (at almost 30  percent) is second only to Spain for the percentage of young  people between 15 and 24 who are looking for work without  results.    The Informative Note of the CEI succinctly, but clearly,  moves from the analysis of the data to a diagnosis: "These are  specific characteristics that are linked to a labor market  situation that is particularly closed and protected, with rules  that primarily defend those who already have a job."    The document then moves from diagnosis to therapy. To get  out  of the crisis, in the short term it is necessary "to implement  measures meant to make labor market rules more open, coordinated  and flexible." In the medium term it is also necessary to  provide for "a better balance when locating industries by  transferring some of them to the south" and through a "massive  basic investment process."    With regard to the situation pointed out in the Note, the  unemployment problem in Italy is certainly destined to worsen in  the future. There are three reasons for this.    First of all, the recession. According to the CEI, this is a  recession that, in terms of unemployment, is affecting the  service sector more than the industrial sector to which  observers have preferred to turn their attention. Secondly,  privatization; it may be good for the country, but,  unfortunately, may eliminate redundant jobs. Thirdly is the fact  that economic growth and job creation are moving in any case  from Europe to America and Asia, and this is also due to the  greater flexibility of those labor markets.    For the very reason that the problem is destined to get  worse, the therapy suggested by the document is even more  essential.    The employment emergency is burdened by the suffering of  individuals and society. But fighting to keep nonproductive jobs  alive is an act that smacks of solidarity, and that morally  gratifies those who take part in it because they do not realize  that they are hurting those who are even weaker--the unemployed.  These are individuals, and particularly young people, that will  not be able to find work because the economy allocates resources  to dead-end projects rather than the creation of productive  jobs. Social welfare measures are possible and appropriate, but  they should be well-defined, and not involve nonproductive work.  The conclusion of the CEI Note should also be noted: "Going in  all these directions means making a fundamental choice to favor  future (and collective future) investments in the short term  over immediate (and individual) consumption. When taking into  consideration the current state of public finances, this also  means that it will be essential for social consciousness to  prevail over demagoguery in the lively debate regarding taxes  which is currently taking place in our country among  politicians." I have felt it necessary to go into detail on the  CEI's "Informative Note" due to the importance of imposing (as a  sensible economic and social policy program) a vision based on  flexibility and development on a tradition of thought and  teaching that frequently is inclined to favor collective  solidarity over growth. One wonders if, in the very terms  proposed in this document, it may not be possible to develop a  program that is quite similar to the one that I tried to outline  on several occasions in this column (in particular on September  3, 1993 and January 5th):     -  it should defer the reduction of  the tax burden to a time when a substantial new equilibrium in  public finances has occurred, and in particular, when the  current deficit has been eliminated    -  it should also liberalize  labor markets and, at the same time, better regulate them    -  there  should be more public involvement to protect competition and  openness, and less government interference in price and supply  decisions    -  there should also be more flexibility (including  regional) regarding wages and salaries, fewer restrictions on  hirings and firings, and more room for decentralized and  individual bargaining    -  unemployment offices should be eliminated  and unemployment subsidies introduced    -  there should be fewer  taxes on production, but fewer subsidies to businesses, less  recourse to bailout measures, and more recourse to letting  companies fail    -  furthermore there should be less protection for  low productivity, and more care given to human and environmental  "capital."    An economic policy along these lines would have the  disadvantage (or the advantage?) of being neither "progressive"  nor "moderate." It would simply be radical.</p>

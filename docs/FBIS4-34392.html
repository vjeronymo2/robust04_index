			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate of </F> Colombia's Conservative Party, from the Red Room of the  Tequendama Hotel in Santa Fe de Bogota--live]    [Text] Before anything else, I want to say thank you,  Colombia. Before anything else, I want to congratulate Ernesto  Samper Pizano. [cheers] Before anything else, I want to  congratulate Ernesto Samper for his election as president of the  Republic. [cheers] We bid him the best of luck; we bid him the  best of luck because we want the best of luck for Colombia.    We were contenders in this campaign, but the campaign ended.  We are no longer divided between Samperists and Andreists  today. We are all Colombians, [cheers] and nothing is more  important than fighting for the future of our fatherland and  liberating it from the politics and poverty of the past. We  thank the 3.5 million Colombians who supported us, those who  shared our hopes, and those who demonstrated they want the  change we proposed. I truly tell them this is not Andres' time,  but we are going to do everything within our reach so that this  can be Colombia's time. [cheers]    I did this campaign independent of the economic groups. I  did this campaign against the political machineries, against  corruption, and against the drug traffickers.    That is why [crowd shouts: "No"] that is why [repeats  himself] I assured the country a president who has received  money from drug trafficking has no moral right to lead Colombia.  We recovered our campaign's moral tone and the sense of decency  in politics, and that is what the Colombian people voted for  today. That was the motivation behind the struggle of this  campaign, and it is the foundation of the new political phase  that I am inviting you to initiate with us as of today.  [applause, cheers] The people's vote is the strongest of  voices in a free society.    We have heard that voice today, and we will obey it. We will  continue to strive for educational reform so that we can prepare  our people for the work that lies ahead in the 21st century. We  will continue to support training and programs of improvement  for our workers and work-oriented educational plans so as to  make new opportunities for the young people who cannot go to a  university. We will continue to defend drinking water as a basic  right and not a privilege.    We hope and expect the 660,000 housing units will become a  reality for our fellow Colombians who have no home. We will be  determined in our search for peace and security for all our  fellow Colombians, particularly the weakest. We will continue  to oppose with all our strength the legalization of drugs.  [cheers] All of these things were by no means mere  presidential campaign promises; they were and remain commitments  we hold deep in our minds and in the bottom of our heart.    Allow me to tell the 3.5 million Colombians--the 3.5 million  of you who supported us--and all Colombians alike that as of  right now we begin fighting for these commitments and more.  [cheers] We have begun to fight for these and other  commitments to make Colombia the country of our dreams.    In conclusion, I want to thank you. [cheers, chants] I  finally want to thank all of those who worked hard with us in  this campaign. I want to thank all of those who supported us in  this voyage for change without giving up the faith in their  hearts. We want to thank the women, the workers, the peasants,  the young people, and all those who campaigned along with their  parents as they never did before. I also want to thank the  children who campaigned along with their parents as we had never  seen before.    Allow me to express my deep feelings of gratitude to Luis  Fernando Ramirez. [cheers] He is going to be a powerful force  in Colombia's future. We have already seen his capabilities and  work in the social security reforms. They will reach each and  every Colombian thanks to him .    I especially want to thank the companion of my life, the  mother of my children, [cheers, chants] my friend, and my  trustworthy partner. She was with me all the way, touring the  country inch by inch. Thank you.    I also want to thank my parents and my brothers for their  support and confidence. [cheers] They are the source of my  inspiration. I also want to thank all the individuals whom I  discovered throughout this marvelous country.    I want to thank those people who are willing to give  everything they can to carry out the hard work we all want in  order to make changes.    I will never forget the hands I shook during each one of my  tours. I will never forget the places we visited nor each one  of the conversations I had with you, face to face; with you, the  Colombian people; [shouts] with you, the people of Colombia and  each and every one of you who welcomed us, who welcomed Nora,  Luis Hernando, and Emilia; all of us, in each one of your  cities, of your neighborhoods, plazas, blocks, and streets; and  above all, those who received us in your hearts. I thank you  all.    This has been a campaign of the people. It was among you  that I found the strength and the reason to run for president  [applause], and it is from you that I will keep finding the  strength to continue seeking the well-being of all Colombians.  Your needs, your hopes are my reasons.    I did not seek the Colombian Presidency for its importance  or  to simply obtain a title. I did it because I believe it is the  president's duty to struggle for the people's work. The  president has the opportunity to make Colombia a country of  opportunities. [shouts] That challenge goes beyond any time or  any campaign. A new generation of leaders makes us keep on  moving ahead.    Therefore, I ask you tonight to keep loving our country, to  keep helping our country advance, and together with each one of  our actions, let us continue to serve the people and not the  powerful. [shouts] That has been and will remain our objective.  That was and remains our vision. Not today, but some day not  too far away, we will have the opportunity to make it a reality.  Thank you. [applause]</p>

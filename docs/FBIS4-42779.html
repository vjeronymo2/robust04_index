			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Pietro Armani: "A Foreign Policy Founded on </F> New Premises"]    [Text] The unseemly outbursts by various members of the  European Left against the alleged "fascist revival" in Italy  upon the inclusion in the government of five AN [National  Alliance] ministers and 12 under secretaries are mainly rising  -- as was only to be expected -- on the wave of the Strasbourg  parliament election campaign. As AN leader Fini has rightly  said, this empty, sterile upsurge against AN must be allowed to  simmer down, to get the election campaign out of the way, and  the facts left to speak for themselves, the facts being the  actual conduct in government of our ministers and under  secretaries, which will reveal the falseness of the many  prejudices cunningly being spread to date.    Indeed, it must be acknowledged that our foreign minister,  Antonio Martino, has determinedly and effectively helped sweep  away a lot of the preconceptions and misinformation in both the  United States and Europe, which have been built up against the  new governing majority over recent weeks. Martino's actions  have also served a useful purpose in sending out precise signals  to the international community as to the new government's  intention to establish new foundations for Italian foreign  policy which will make its premises and objectives clearer and  more visible.    The end of the Cold War; the breakup of the Soviet Union;  the  emergence from its ashes of new state entities over which the  Russian Federal Republic wants to reestablish its hegemonic  influence; the unification of Germany and its resumption of  political and economic expansion toward East Europe and the  former Soviet world itself; the implosion of the former  Yugoslavia with the birth of the new sovereign states in the  area and the consequent return to the traditional instability of  all the Balkan states; Turkey's new bid for an international  role and the resumption of its potential conflict of interests  with Greece; the Palestinian movement's progress toward autonomy  and its new relations with Israel; Iran's dynamic policy toward  the new central Asian republics that used to form part of the  Soviet Union: These are just some of the many issues that are  inexorably forcing Italy, too, to redefine its geopolitical role  in Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. The election  of Mirko Tremaglia as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee  in the Chamber of Deputies is also significant in this  connection, giving an unequivocal sign of the new, active  attention that the governing majority is devoting to the matter  of a nontraumatic, constructive revision of the Osimo Treaty and  the reinstatement of millions of Italians who live and work  abroad into the life of the nation.    However, this is neither the time nor the place to discuss  the foreign policy decisions that are a matter for the new  government and its parliamentary majority. Although we fully  agree with these decisions, they obviously remain outside our  field of expertise. We merely wish to stress that any foreign  policy adopted by the Italian state with the claim to be serious  and credible and with the intention of successful implementation  requires the use of effective instruments to carry it through,  particularly in the economic and military spheres.    Indeed, if it wants to acquire credibility abroad, Italy  must  prove itself capable of reducing the public deficit, of  reversing the soaring growth rate in its public debt, of  boosting its economy and, with it, employment and the national  income. Only a country with a strong economy can play an  incisive role on the world stage, where relations are governed  by trade in goods and services, by exchange rates, and by the  increasingly close socioeconomic links between the various  geographical areas in the world, which has turned into a true  "global village."    A country without the proper credentials as to its overall  economic clout in the concert of nations will perforce pursue a  wishful, drifting foreign policy lacking credibility. Suffice  it to mention the importance attributed nowadays to the area of  economic and financial aid to the developing countries, toward  which we must channel resources for the creation of local  facilities for the production of wealth capable of absorbing the  local workforce, which is otherwise destined to turn into waves  of migration; and the higher the rate of demographic growth in  their countries of origin, the wilder the waves will be and the  greater the turmoil that they create. Suffice it to mention  also the savings capacity, and the resulting investment  potential, that an industrialized country with a strong economic  structure can yield to defend its share of the export market and  its imports of raw and semifinished materials. All these are  vehicles for "showing the flag," for acquiring credibility when  confronting foreign policy issues as well, and may be seen as  the natural projection of vitality at home.    But an appropriate specific weight in terms of the economy  is not enough in itself for the pursuit of a credible, effective  foreign policy. Credibility at the military level is needed as  well, not, of course, to pave the way for aggressive policies,  which have long ago ceased to be in our national interest, and,  indeed to be part of normal international relations, especially  now that we live in a "post-Cold War" world, beset as it sadly  is by grave local and/or multiethnic conflicts that had been  quelled for decades under the bipolar domination of the two  opposing power alliances. The role of the United Nations, NATO,  the Western European Union, and perhaps the CSCE in controlling  and peacefully resolving all the tensions that have sprung up in  the world -- and in particular those nearest our own doorstep,  in Yugoslavia, the Balkans, northern Africa, and the Middle East  -- can be backed up and enhanced only by credible military  forces at the service of the economically stronger states, among  which Italy rightly wishes to be numbered.    This is why our country must have at its disposal -- to  perform this role properly, without groundless ambitions and  empty posturing, but with the serene awareness of carrying a  weight commensurate with our strength -- a largely career-based  Army, Navy, and Air Force equipped with modern defensive weapons  and machinery and manned by motivated, fully trained personnel:  a military instrument that is no longer overweight and  bureaucratized (as it still is today), but lean, flexible, and  rapidly deployed in response to the changing, and often  unexpected, requirements of "international policing." Moreover,  the factor that could weld economic structure and military  structure together for the purposes of the new Italian foreign  policy would be the revival of our disaster-ridden arms and  military electronics and interception, aircraft, and  shipbuilding industries.    A lean, efficient, professional military apparatus cannot do  without national industries to supply it with products produced  alone or in international joint ventures, at least at the  European level, as visions of protectionism in this field would  be anachronistic now, given the research, development, and  production costs typical of this type of product. Nevertheless,  no clear distinction can now be drawn at a technical level  between military and civilian output in many sectors of industry  (electronics, for example): Either we give up national  representation in the sectors concerned, thus clipping the wings  of industrial development in the country as a whole, or we must  agree to the production of military goods alongside those made  for civilian purposes. A resumption of state arms procurement  would thus make it possible to modernize our armed forces and  turn them into a viable instrument of foreign policy and, at the  same time, to set these sectors of industry, which have long  been on the brink of collapse, back on their feet. (Moreover,  most of the companies are publicly owned, and likely to remain  so for a long time in view of the low profitability that results  from the high level of investment and associated costs  involved.) Lastly, as domestic demand alone will certainly not  suffice to keep these industries working to capacity, our  foreign policy (like, on a large scale, those of France,  Germany, and Great Britain) should also be able to use the said  industries to channel exports to its own specific purposes,  without this contributing to the "gun running" logic that must  never influence our objectives or our national interest.    In conclusion, therefore, economic policy and military  capability must be regarded as necessary premises for the  foreign policy of the advanced industrialized country that is  Italy; without them, Italian foreign policy would be in danger  of remaining wishful and confused, and this is something that  the government and majority can no longer afford.</p>

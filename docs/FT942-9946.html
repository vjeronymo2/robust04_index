			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Mexico invites UN to observe elections The Mexican government has formally invited the United Nations to participate in the observation of presidential and congressional elections in August, in a move designed to convince international and domestic opinion that the voting process will be fair. Mr Jorge Carpizo, the interior minister, asked the UN to issue a technical report on the electoral system, and to offer assistance to the network of Mexican electoral observers, and help ensure their 'professionalism, independence and impartiality'. The UN role will be more limited than many had hoped, as the organisation will not directly observe the electoral process, nor assess the legitimacy of the electoral result. Mr Carpizo said that the country's constitution and laws gave such authority exclusively to Mexicans. The decision to invite the UN came after internal debate in the Mexican government, with some nationalist ministers unhappy about allowing an international organisation a role in the observation of the elections. The compromise worked out has allayed fears of those who opposed UN presence, according to one official. President Carlos Salinas and other ministers believe the presence of the UN will help assure a credible electoral outcome. The belief is that as long as the election is fair, the creation of an impartial group of Mexican observers backed by the UN will make it more difficult for the opposition to discredit the vote by claiming fraud. The US has also put increasing pressure on the Mexican government to take steps to assure a legitimate election, and strongly supported the presence of foreign observers.</p>

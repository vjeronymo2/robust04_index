			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says it  is wholly legitimate for the Cambodian Government to seek  military assistance from the international community. He was  commenting on a warning from Thailand's security chief for  Australia not to give military aid, saying it would only  escalate the conflict between the Cambodian Government and the  Khmer Rouge.    In a statement issued in Canberra, Senator Evans said  Australia is giving serious consideration to the Cambodian  Government's request for military assistance. He said Australia  would consult with and take into account the views of other  countries, including Thailand.    The foreign minister said it is in line with the Paris peace  accord for the elected Cambodian Government to seek aid from the  international community in order to maintain the country's  sovereignty and territorial integrity. But Senator Evans also  made it clear that it would be helpful if countries which  committed themselves to the Cambodian peace process were to help  the Armed Forces of the legitimate government.</p>

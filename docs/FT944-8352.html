			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Saudi-Russian trade accord Saudi Arabia and Russia, which established full diplomatic relations after the 1990-91 Gulf crisis, yesterday agreed to improve relations and strengthen trade ties. The agreement was signed during a two-day visit to Saudia Arabia by Russian prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin, who held talks with King Fahd and Saudi officials and businessmen. Russian officials said that the agreement would open the door for specific deals on trade, economics culture, technology and sport. They said that they also hoped for closer political ties. Diplomats in the region said that Mr Chernomyrdin, who is on a tour of Gulf countries, was keen to reassure wealthy Gulf Arabs suspicious of Moscow's ties with Baghdad that Russia would not develop them at the expense of relations with other states. Moscow has been leading a campaign in the UN Security Council to ease sanctions on Baghdad imposed after its 1990 invasion.</p>

Vromberg),  a renowned Swedish entrepreneur in industrial, commercial, and  financial circles. Chairman Li Ruihuan expressed his  appreciation for Mr. (Vromberg's) foresight and judiciousness in  developing economic relations with Chinese, as well as his  long-term, unremitting efforts to develop Sino-Swedish friendly  relations and cooperation.    Li Ruihuan said: China's economy is developing in a  sustained, rapid, and healthy manner. Sweden possesses ample  experience and certain advantages to help China develop, on a  priority basis, a variety of sectors, such as transportation,  communications, energy, and raw and semifinished materials. I  am convinced that through joint efforts by the two sides, Sweden  will be able to make even greater progress in developing  cooperation with some Chinese provinces and municipalities, as  well as cooperation between enterprises in the two countries.    In the evening, Chairman Li Ruihuan cordially met with local  Chinese nationals and student representatives at the Chinese  embassy.

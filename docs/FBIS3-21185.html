			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     On 10 November, completion ceremonies will be carried out  for the headquarters laboratory of the Research Institute of  Innovative Technologies for the Earth (RITE) in the Kansai  Science City (Otsu-machi, Kyoto Prefecture). The Institute aims  to do R&amp;D on technology useful for resolving environmental  problems and to contribute to the world through environmental  technology. This newspaper questioned Tsutomu Yamaguchi,  managing director of RITE, about its goals.    -- This is the real beginning of RITE's activities, isn't  it?    -- RITE is a key institution for developing revolutionary  environmental technology for implementing the ``Earth  Revitalization Plan'' (plan for comprehensive development of new  energy technology and other earth conservation technologies).  This is the only industry-government-academia partnership to  grapple with these issues. We have a grave responsibility.    -- What will be the focus of RITE's research?    -- RITE will tackle three areas of fundamental research.  Five  researchers have been hired for five years on the annual salary  [nembo] system. First, in the area of biology, RITE will do  things such as using genetics to create plants that can be grown  in deserts and searching for microorganisms which fix carbon  dioxide, the cause of the earth's warming.    In the area of chemistry, research will be conducted on  topics such as developing catalysts that can remove hydrogen  from water, developing a computer system that can design  catalysts, and using a high polymer film to separate hydrogen  dioxide. In the systems area, research will be conducted on  using computers to evaluate technology for fixing carbon dioxide  and for putting a price tag on environmental pollution.    -- Internationalism will be another mainstay of RITE, won't  it?    -- RITE will take an international perspective on forming a  network [for research cooperation]. There are plans to invite  researchers from the Institute for International Applications  Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Vienna to come as senior researchers  for two months. They'll be the vanguard. In the future we want  to have regular research exchanges between the two institutes.    There is currently a Russian scientist on the catalyst  research team. The chief researcher in the systems area is a  Japanese who is concurrently an associate professor at Harvard  University. An Italian chemical company is participating in the  hydrogen production project and we're sounding out a large  French chemical company on the possibility of research exchange  on the fixing project.    -- What method will be used for receiving the foreign  countries?    -- We're aiming to be an internationally open research  institute. Research has no meaning if it is not actually used.  Since it's no good if Japan goes by itself, international  participation is being sought from the R&amp;D stage.    Foreign countries simultaneously feel impressed and fearful  about Japan's industry-government-academia effort in  environmental technology. America and Europe fear that Japan  will monopolize environmental technology. But it's also true  that no country other than Japan is pursuing the same vision.  RITE is calling for the countries of America and Europe to open  their minds to participation.    -- Why will many corporations participate in projects to  develop environmental technology?    -- That is because environmental problems are a constraint  on  growth, so corporations can't survive if they don't consider the  environment. However, it's a basic truth that most companies  pursue environmental research by themselves. The national  project has to get by with a small contribution from industry.  The results will be owned by its funders, the New Energy and  Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) and RITE.  However, patents can be transferred to corporations according to  a stipulation providing for return in the event that the  research results are not used within a set period. This is to  provide an incentive for corporations to participate.  <H5>  Viewpoint: Topic of Networking Research </H5>   The cities of Yokkaichi in Mie prefecture, Munekata in  Fukuoka prefecture, and others tried to attract RITE, but, due  to the active efforts of its business community, the Kansai area  won RITE's headquarters headquarter for the Kansai Science City.  It is hoped that RITE will become the core facility of the city.    RITE was established in 1990 and has already spent three  years working on projects entrusted to it by NEDO. These include  carbon dioxide fixing, biodegradable plastic, and others.  Research sites for carrying out research are scattered around  the country among participating corporations and national  research institutes.    Only 30 of the approximately 400 researchers connected to  RITE will go the headquarters to conduct fundamental research  and to work on the environmental catalyst project. There will  probably be discussion of linking the scattered research sites  in a network.</p>

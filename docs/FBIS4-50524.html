			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 19 (AFP) -- China warned the United  States Thursday not to attach any conditions to renewal of its  MFN status, saying such an action would have an "adverse  influence" on bilateral ties. A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman  said most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade status was "a reciprocal  and a mutually beneficial trade arrangement." "Any move which  runs counter to this will undermine the foundation for the  economic and trade relations between the two countries and will  have adverse influences on Sino-U.S. relations," she said.    The comments followed confirmation by a senior U.S. official  Wednesday that Washington may settle for imposing limited  sanctions on Beijing to express displeasure over its human  rights record, rather than carrying out its threat to withdraw  China's MFN status. China has consistently condemned U.S.  President Bill Clinton's 1993 decision to make "significant  overall progress" in human rights a condition for this year's  renewal of MFN. Clinton must make a decision on the issue by  June 3. U.S. businessmen, who have invested some eight billion  dollars in China, have warned the President that even attaching  conditions could draw a visceral response from Beijing.    Foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said China had taken  note of support from U.S. businessmen, congressmen and  journalists for the unconditional renewal of MFN, saying this  was a "positive" development. "We hope the United States  government will make a sensible decision," he told a weekly news  briefing. He said the two sides seek to resolve their  differences through dialogue on a equal footing, indicating that  there was in any case only so much Beijing could do to satisfy  Washington. "The U.S. can only do what is permitted by its  laws. The same is true of China. China can only do what is  permitted by China's laws," Wu said. He said it would be  "inappropriate" to give details of any ongoing diplomacy, but  added that "the channels for contact between the two countries  are always in place.</p>

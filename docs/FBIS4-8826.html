			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Agrarian Federation Chairman Tamas Nagy by </F> Ildiko Csuhaj; place and date not given: "All the Conditions  Are There for Success"]    [Text] In the election series starting today, the leaders  of parties that have submitted a national list are interviewed  on their parties' program points and concepts. We asked  Agrarian Federation Chairman Tamas Nagy about his party's image,  its relations with the liberal parties, and how this party would  treat the crisis of the Hungarian villages and agriculture if it  became a force in government.    [Nagy] The past three or four years have been characterized  by an unpredictable and often ill-considered amount of economic  ideas. Only 18 percent of the world's land can be used for  agricultural production, and good results can only be achieved  on 9 percent of that. About 72 percent of Hungary's land  belongs to this 9 percent. We have trained professionals. It is  important to have a five-year agricultural-orientation plan and  to make sure that government activity is a service activity.  The accelerated compensation process should mean that the lands  have been allocated and their transcription into the land  registry is carried out. This is one of the major messages of  the Agrarian Federation.    [Csuhaj] You have been calling yourself a bourgeois agrarian  party lately. What does this mean?    [Nagy] It is important not to mystify the concept of  burgher. We do not say that if one wants to be a burgher, one  should leave his village and his profession; instead, we say  that the village should participate in everyday life at a higher  level. The middle-peasant class was already building bathrooms  in their houses before the war, although there was not yet water  in them; they were preparing, however, a more comfortable life  for the next generation. In Germany, the word "peasant" means  builder. In Hungary, this word has a different meaning, and we  should break with this meaning! The first step is to have a  political interest representation. In 1947, the Smallholders'  Party received a historic opportunity, and this opportunity is  here again today. Therefore, the Agrarian Federation does not  want to represent a village elite. Our goal is to build a party  between 1994-1998, a party that represents this concept, because  a greater percentage of Hungarian citizens are connected to this  concept.    [Csuhaj] Your party succeeded in presenting 20 territorial  lists and 134 candidates. Have your support and position in the  liberal bloc changed as a result?    [Nagy] The Agrarian Federation has increased in value.  According to the opinion polls, 40 percent of our supporters  voted for the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] in 1990, and  almost 17 percent voted for the Smallholders' Party. We have a  good chance of making it into Parliament. We are working now on  making sure that the program of the liberal parties becomes  known to the public during the campaign.    [Csuhaj] In addition to the well-known liberal parties, can  you also think of other parties as potential partners? Such  signals have emerged, partly about the Hungarian Socialist Party  [MSZP], and partly about the MDF.    [Nagy] The MSZP alone can muster considerable power, but the  liberal bloc together is stronger than the MSZP, and is stronger  than the MDF and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]  together. Until the second round of the elections, the question  is not who will ally with whom if we separate. We are still far  from coalition talks. Four parties have agreed to work together  to succeed in the elections.    [Csuhaj] Your party also calls itself a pragmatic program  party and an ideology-free party within the liberal bloc,  although the village people whom it mainly represents are mostly  conservative.    [Nagy] It is quite easy to understand the image of the  Agrarian Federation. We think that our effort for a change in  the economic system is the main guideline of our program. We  stress that the Agrarian Federation is a fresh force in  politics; it was created by experts engaged in politics. There  are five [number as published] issues to which we pay particular  attention: villages, backward areas, agriculture, tourism,  environmental protection, and intellectual resources. These are  five breakthrough points that give our party a clear image.  Ours is a party that does not argue and does not make a clamor;  instead, it is engaged in real things.</p>

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Recovery plan lifts Asda to Pounds 55m ASDA, the grocery chain, yesterday showed that it was starting to reap the benefits of the three-year recovery programme introduced by its new management with the announcement of sharp improvement in interim profits. Before exceptionals, the profit of Pounds 46.1m for the 28 weeks to November 14 beat all analysts' forecasts. For the same period of the previous year pre-exceptional profits amounted to Pounds 10.1m. Exceptional gains this time of Pounds 8.7m (provisions Pounds 78.9m) raised profits at the pre-tax level to Pounds 54.8m (losses Pounds 68.8m). Asda also booked an extraordinary gain of Pounds 69.1m from the sale of its stake in MFI, the furniture retailer. The pre-tax figure compared with analysts' forecasts which averaged about Pounds 35m. The shares rose 7 1/2 p to 61p. Analysts had expected much of the rise to be accounted for by a reduced interest bill following the company's Pounds 357m rights issue in October 1991, and other actions to cut debt. But the difference between forecasts and the actual figures was largely due to a better-than-expected operating profit for the Asda stores. 'It would appear that some professional managers have taken hold of the business and are knocking it into shape,' said Mr Bill Myers, food retailing analyst at brokers Henderson Crosthwaite. However, Mr Myers believed Asda needed to do more than it was planning to enhance value for shareholders and has suggested a rights issue is necessary to fund a widespread refit of its core stores and boost sales. Group turnover rose to Pounds 2.35bn (Pounds 2.3bn), and group operating profit for the 28 weeks improved to Pounds 79.9m (Pounds 74m). That reflected increased operating profits in the Asda stores division, to Pounds 91.9m (Pounds 84m), and a small reduction in the operating loss in the Allied Maples carpet and furniture stores division to Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 13.2m). Mr Archie Norman, chief executive, said like-for-like sales growth for the Asda stores was significantly above the industry average, although sales at Allied Maples continued to suffer owing to the stagnant housing market and lack of consumer confidence. Another encouraging sign was a reduction in borrowings from Pounds 677.8m in May to Pounds 471.6m, bringing gearing down from 61 per cent to 39 per cent. Earnings per share were 2.01p (losses 5.71p). The interim dividend is being cut to 0.5p (1.25p) - a figure which disappointed some analysts. But Mr Norman said this reflected the company's plan to have the dividend twice covered by earnings. He said three months of 'tough negotiation' had resulted in a new Pounds 300m syndicated bank facility, with softer covenants, more competitive interest rates and involving fewer banks. 'That is an important move forward and gives us the green light to go ahead with our plan over the next three years,' he said. See Lex</p>

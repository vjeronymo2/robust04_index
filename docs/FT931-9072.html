			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Jefferson Smurfit in Dollars 500m debt offering THE US interests of Jefferson Smurfit, which were the subject of a complex Dollars 2.9bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, are being refinanced through a Dollars 500m public debt offering. The Irish paper and packaging group intends to repay some of its US associate's Dollars 1.7bn bank debt as part of its plans to float the business in two years. A subsidiary of Smurfit will provide its US interests with a Dollars 200m loan. Mr Ray Curran, Smurfit's chief financial officer, said: 'This is an important step on the road to positioning our US interests for an initial public offer in 1995.' The group's main US paper and paperboard interests were combined in a highly leveraged deal in 1989. This involved the acquisition of Container Corporation of America (CCA), a paperboard company Jefferson bought in the mid-1980s, and Jefferson Smurfit Corporation (JSC), its St Louis-based subsidiary, by a leveraged buy-out vehicle called SIBV/MS Holdings. SIBV/MS Holdings, in turn, is 50 per cent cent-owned by Jefferson Smurfit, and 50 per cent by an investor group led by Morgan Stanley. The LBO deal netted Smurfit some Dollars 1bn in cash, and transformed its balance sheet. But, since then it has been affected by recession. JSC/CCA was last year refinanced via a Dollars 400m equity investment, in cash and via the conversion of JSC's outstanding preferred stock. The group decided to go for a second refinancing because it wanted to tap the capital markets. Morgan Stanley is underwriting the debt offering. Smurfit's loan to its US associate will help retire high-cost subordinated debt. It will pay interest at 11 1/2 per cent when fully drawn and will save JSC/CCA about Dollars 7m a year. JSC/CAA has filed the senior notes, which mature in 2003, with the Securities Exchange Commission in Washington.</p>

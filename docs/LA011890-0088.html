			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ALASKA;  </P> <P> NEW VOLCANIC ASH MINGLES WITH SNOW  </P> <P> Gritty volcanic ash fell with the snow in sparsely settled parts of Alaska  after an overnight eruption of Redoubt Volcano, and scientists said more  eruptions may occur without warning. "Ash came down with the snow," said Joyce  Logan in Skwentna, a small town northwest of Anchorage that is more than 100  miles from the volcano. The 10,197-foot mountain rumbled briefly before it  erupted, sending a plume of ash 38,000 feet skyward, geologists at the Alaska  Volcano Observatory reported.  </P></p>

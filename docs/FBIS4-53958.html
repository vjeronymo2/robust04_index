			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- An advisory panel of JNR  [Japanese National Railways] Settlement Corp. has come up with a  proposal calling for priority on the sale and listing of West  Japan Railway Co. (JR West) stock in fiscal 1994, officials said  Monday [23 May]. The corporation is entrusted with liquidating  a huge amount of debts accumulated by the defunct Japanese  National Railways (JNR), which was privatized and split into  seven passenger and cargo transport firms.    Following the formal recommendation by the advisory council  early next month, the corporation will start preparations for  the listing of JR West stock in February next year, the  officials said. The Transport Ministry and the corporation  planned to list stock of both JR West and Central Japan Railway  Co. (JR Tokai) in fiscal 1994.    The council stressed the need to promote stock sales for JR  companies by taking into account the stock market environment in  order to liquidate long-term debts held by the corporation. The  council put priority on the sale of JR West stock over JR Tokai  in view of stiff competition faced by the company on the rail  transport market. The council also recommended sales of an  additional portion of 1.5 million shares of East Japan Railway  Co. (JR East) held by the corporation. JR East was listed on  the market last year.</p>

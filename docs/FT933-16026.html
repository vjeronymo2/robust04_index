			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Scottish &amp; Newcastle At first sight, Scottish &amp; Newcastle seems to be managing the beer price war quite well. Due to its regional concentration in Scotland and the north of England, it is not really a target of Bass's attempts to gain market share. Due to its brand portfolio, it has managed an impressive 8 per cent volume increase in the off-trade. If the beer market grows more difficult, S&amp;N has its leisure side to fall back on. Pontin's appears to be recovering from a very bad summer last year; Center Parcs continues, against all the odds, to defy recession. The question, though, is whether the company's bets are too well hedged. S&amp;N is determined to remain in brewing - its Pounds 14m restructuring charge relates to cost savings in distribution rather than removal of capacity. But S&amp;N ranks fifth in terms of UK brewers, which is not an easy starting point for a significant increase in national market share. Similarly, S&amp;N's relatively weak presence in the south of England may restrain the development both of its brands and pub retailing, the latter being a weak spot in the annual results. Whitbread, which has focused with much greater clarity on brand development and retailing, has seen its share price outperform since beer discounting intensified in the spring. S&amp;N must be running some risks by opening another Center Parc in France at this stage in the economic cycle. But assuming there are no serious setbacks, its leisure business could soon become the largest single contributor to operating profits as well as the largest division in terms of operating assets. Its strategy will then look even more like one of trying to be all things to all people. Such an approach may appear safe: it also makes for a dull share price.</p>

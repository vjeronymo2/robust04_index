			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / HK polls, here today, gone tomorrow: Sunday's local elections are under death sentence by China Mr Cheung Yuk Ming, a 42-year-old accountant, is standing at the corner of Nelson and Reclamation streets in central Mong Kok, Kowloon. It is early in the morning and he is reciting his election pitch into a microphone connected to an amplifier and speakers in a wire shopping trolley. Few passers-by stop to listen to him as he speaks about the poor public hygiene in Mong Kok, its inadequate water supply, and the prevalence of crime in the neighbourhood. Yet, like other candidates in Sunday's local elections throughout Hong Kong, Mr Cheung tells the voters that he can make a difference to their lives. The election is the first fully-democratic poll in Hong Kong since Britain colonised this tiny corner of southern China 150 years ago. It is also likely to be among the last. Sunday's poll is being held against China's expressed wish and under sentence of annulment, come the Chinese takeover on July 1, 1997. Beijing demonstrated graphically earlier this week its power to hold up the development of Hong Kong's port (the world's busiest) simply by calling for the ejection of the Jardine group, the British trading house, from a consortium building the facility. Yet its promise to overturn the result of Sunday's poll has had surprisingly little impact on people wanting to stand for election or, if opinion polls are reliable, on the voters as well. In all, 756 candidates are contesting 346 seats in the colony's 18 district boards, including many supporters of Beijing. The DBs, as they are known, are like a secular parish council advising a 'district officer' who holds all local decision-making power. This has not, however, made the DBs irrelevant. It has simply meant that the role of members is more social worker than political leader, although a stint in the local district is seen as a proving-ground for higher elective office. In spite of Beijing's threats, Mr Wong Che Ming, a lawyer, sees no conflict in his role as an appointed adviser to China on local affairs, and as a candidate for Mong Kok in Sunday's poll. 'We can't stand still simply because someone has threatened to demolish the whole system,' he says. 'I still have something to do, to achieve. Two years is a long time in a place like Hong Kong.' Mong Kok is not the sort of place western tourists frequent. It has the distinction of being the world's most densely populated urban area. It houses 96,650 people per square kilometre, against the average for Hong Kong of 5,380 a sq km. With that population density go all the problems of crime and social deprivation which Mr Wong, Mr Cheung and Mr Ng Wing Fai, candidate for the avowedly pro-democracy United Democrats, tell the voters they can ameliorate. The building housing Mr Ng's campaign HQ, on the corner of Shanghai and Arran Streets (the Scots presence in the colony not being confined solely to Jardine's and the upper echelons of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank), is a microcosm of the community. Within its walls are a Baptist church, a karaoke bar, a sauna and various trading companies. Mr Ng, an earnest town planner seeking election for the first time, explains that the building is relatively safe, mainly because the triads, the Chinese version of the Mafia, run the Kara-OK Bar. 'With the triads running the bar, we have no robberies in this building,' he says. A short walk from his office is a 16-storey apartment block. A 400 sq ft flat in the building sells for about HKDollars 1.5m (Pounds 126,000), but that is the least of the occupants' problems. Some 100 people live on the roof in what the Hong Kong government calls 'illegal structures' which house mainly mainland Chinese immigrants who do not qualify for public housing and which sell for about HKDollars 150,000 each. Mr Ng says his task is to intercede on behalf of these people with the building's management company and the government. The water and electricity used by the 30 or so families living on the roof is illegally siphoned off the supply to the building. Poor plumbing has already caused the failure of one lift because of seepage into the elevator shaft. Intercession, with government or landlord, is also one of the main tasks Mr Wong has performed since he was first elected to the Mong Kok district board in 1985. He also spends a lot of time advising people how do things, such as organising a tender for repair works to an apartment building and supervising the work. 'You can actually achieve something,' he says. In his campaign literature, Mr Wong makes a point of the fact that he is an elected member of the Mong Kok district board. This raises the question, given his status as a China adviser and Beijing's preference for the appointment, why it is worth drawing attention to. 'It would help my campaign to point out that I had been elected,' he says. 'People will take note. It would mean I had not come by my position easily, but from hard work.' But as if to underline the irrelevance of Sunday's vote, Beijing let it be known a week ago that it will shortly appoint a further 200 local advisers to keep it abreast of the concerns of people at the grass roots.</p>

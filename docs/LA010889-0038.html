			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS  </P> <P> Britain's preeminent guide, Fred Pearson, is taking to the skies in '89 with  his newly established HelicopTours, providing sightseers with the opportunity  to eavesdrop on castles, palaces, manor houses and the rural beauty of England.  On London flyovers, Pearson's on-board guides point out the city's landmarks:  Trafalgar Square, Westminster Abbey, Piccadilly Circus, London Bridge, the  Tower of London, St. Paul's Cathedral, Buckingham Palace, Covent Garden.  </P> <P> Operating daily, Pearson's fleet of helicopters will propel visitors beyond  London to Stonehenge, West Wycombe Park (landscaped by the legendary Capability  Brown), Leeds Castle (former home of William the Conqueror), Canterbury  Cathedral, the white cliffs of Dover, Woodhenge, Silbury Hill, Palladian Bridge  at Wilton House, the thatched cottages of the Cotswolds, Blenheim Palace,  medieval Oxford, Eton, Hampton Court and other attractions. Choppers land while  passengers take pictures, dine at unusual restaurants. Plan your own itinerary  or join one of three tours.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Pearson's land tours by private car provide pickup and delivery to  your hotel. Offbeat tours (including a visit to Sherlock Holmes' private study)  are on Pearson's list, along with an opportunity to dine at Britain's oldest  inn (circa 1155). Pearson's Take-A-Guide does private tours throughout England,  Scotland, Wales and the Continent. Specially planned trips for the handicapped.  Others for youngsters.  </P> <P> Only recently, Pearson was cited for his leadership in tourism by the London  Tourist Board. His Take-A-Guide will arrange meetings with members of  Parliament, send visitors off on fox and grouse hunts. Pearson insists he's  prepared to arrange anything short of tea with Queen Elizabeth II. TAG's  celebrity clientele includes James Michener, Robert Redford, Bob Hope, Irving  Wallace, crown princes and princesses and dozens of other prominent figures.  Humorist Art Buchwald described Take-A-Guide as "a unique organization that  operates on the theory that tourists hate to be herded around in large groups."  </P> <P> Pearson preaches that travel should be "glamorous, fascinating and rewarding."  His customized tours include Royal London, Legal London, Breakfast in London,  London at Night, Doctors' London, Classical London, Shopping in London, Heart  of England, plus others.  </P> <P> For helicopter/land tour rates, contact Take-A-Guide, 11 Uxbridge St., London  W8, England, or Take-A-Guide in the United States at 65 E. 79th St., New York  10021. The toll-free number: (800) 223-6450.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another Small Hotel  </P> <P> We failed to include the Beaufort today among our small hotels featured on page  1. Comprises two early Victorian houses. Only a squeak from Harrods department  store. During summer, an umbrella of plane trees rises over this remarkable  little hotel. No reception desk, no bartender. Just sign in, pour yourself a  drink and sign the honor tab. A total of 29 rooms (each decorated differently).  More than 200 English water colors. Pop-up maps of London. Free memberships in  a London health club. Loads of books. The hotel will arrange car hires, tours,  restaurant bookings. It's near Hyde Park (great for joggers). The Beaufort will  store your suitcases and other belongings for your next visit. Charming.  Expensive. Rates: 90 single, 105/130 double. We give the Beaufort five stars:  *****.  </P> <P> The Beaufort, 33 Beaufort Gardens, London SW3 1PP.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Still Another  </P> <P> It's not elegant. But it gets good marks for its reasonable prices: The  Fielding Hotel, 4 Broad Court, London WC2 (just off Drury Lane). Rates: 38  single plus 15% VAT; doubles with showers, 48 plus 15% VAT. The Fielding is  opposite the Royal Opera House in the area of Covent Garden. One of the best of  central London's cheaper hotels. Dates from the 18th Century. Two stars: **.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dining in London  </P> <P> Alastair Little serves marvelous meals in an atmosphere of mediocrity. In the  words of The Times of London: "Paper napkins and food are unceremoniously  dumped on your table." The floor is scuffed. The tables are chipped. But the  menus are rated high (this is one of Fred Pearson's favorite restaurants).  Menus change regularly. Here's a sampling of the offerings: chicken wrapped in  bacon, calves liver with sweet onions and a wine sauce, toasted scallops, fine  meat dishes. Pearson swears by this nondescript little restaurant that makes a  Denny's look like Chasen's by comparison.  </P> <P> Alastair Little, 49 Frith St., London W1. Open Monday through Friday. No credit  cards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Traveler Information  </P> <P> Before leaving the U.S., contact the British Tourist Authority, 350 S. Figueroa  St., Suite 450, Los Angeles 90071.

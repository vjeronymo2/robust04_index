			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Treasury Changes a Date: The Treasury announced that it is amending next week's  13-week and 26-week Treasury bill auction, pushing up the issue date from  Thursday to Tuesday. The auctions will each be for $7.8 billion in securities  and will be held Monday. The Treasury also announced an auction on Monday for  $2 billion in 51-day cash management bills; the bills will have a Tuesday  issuance date. The changes were made so that the Treasury could borrow the  funds in advance of Oct. 31, when a temporary federal debt ceiling of $2.87  trillion expires and the ceiling reverts back to the permanent level of $2.8  trillion.  </P></p>

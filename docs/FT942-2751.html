			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: CS chief dampens fear over Creditanstalt bid Mr Rainer Gut, the chairman of CS Holdings, yesterday said Creditanstalt would remain 'a proud and independent Austrian bank with its own identity' if CS succeeded in winning control of the bank. Mr Gut said he was well aware of political opposition to the efforts of the Swiss banking group to take control of Creditanstalt, Austria's banking flagship. He felt CS had an even chance of winning control against competition from a rival Austrian-led consortium. Mr Gut said he would prefer to buy all the government's 49 per cent stake but would be content with a smaller stake in the short term. He declined to disclose his offer price. Based on Creditanstalt's share price, the government stake is worth about Sch14bn (Dollars 1.2bn). Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the Austrian finance minister, has said his decision would not be based on price but on national interest and the interests of Creditanstalt. Mr Gut was in Vienna to meet Mr Lacina, who wants to privatise Creditanstalt quickly and encourage public support for his offer. His earlier announcement that CS was aiming for a 100 per cent control of Creditanstalt has aroused controversy in Austria. This led to the formation of the rival bid.</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Why we need a 60 ft skinhead: Dominic Lawson prefers a badly behaved press to badly behaved politicians ANTHONY Burgess, the author, said the experience of being scrutinised by the British media was like being picked up by a 60 ft high skinhead, examined roughly, and put down again. He spoke from experience, having suddenly become notorious when Stanley Kubrick's film of the novelist's Clockwork Orange burst upon a British public unused to graphic sexual violence. I have only once experienced something of Burgess's giant skinhead treatment. It was after I published a controversial interview with Nicholas Ridley, then trade secretary. Journalists swarmed into The Spectator office and television crews squatted in the garden, insisting that, while they had not been invited, they would not go until I spoke to them, or rather the people they called 'our viewers'. It was not an altogether wonderful experience. The best way to cope is to pretend all this is not really happening to you. When it is all over you wonder whether indeed it did happen. I suppose this is a symptom of what doctors call shock. We are now told by the political lobby correspondents that this sort of event might become a thing of the past. John Major, we are 'reliably informed' is considering bringing in a parliamentary Bill to protect people's privacy against the intrusions of the media. The spur to Major's idea is apparently, the publication by The Independent of a story - true, as it happens - that the Health Secretary Virginia Bottomly became in 1967 a teenage unmarried mother. (Three months later she married the child's father, Peter Bottomley). What particularly enraged Major, and the Bottomleys, was that The Independent revealed the child's name. For this The Independent has apologised, thus saving itself the embarrassment of being reported to the Press Complaints Commission. I can understand Major's eruption. As a man, one can take rough handling from the press. But when one sees a shy retiring sensitive female colleague being given the same treatment - well, noblesse oblige. Though what a shy retiring sensitive female is doing in charge of Britain's most controversial ministry is another matter. I am sure that if Major asked his Minister for the Media, David Mellor - who is thank God, neither shy nor retiring nor sensitive nor female - to bring in a press privacy Bill, such a Bill will become law. And it will not need any parliamentary whipping. Members of Parliament tend to be vivid characters with private lives to match. They know how much more fun they could have, if only they could be reassured that their constituents would, by law, be prevented from reading about such escapades. While it would be the merest cant to pretend that the press, whether the Sun or the supposedly high-minded Independent, reports scandal out of a sense of public duty, their efforts do have the effect of ensuring that public figures behave with a discretion befitting their position. As one such figure - in the world of finance - said to me: 'The easiest way for me to know whether I ought morally to peruse a possible course of action is to ask myself 'how embarrassed would I be if this action was subsequently reported in Private Eye?'' The public figure is in any case, not without defences, as Private Eye knows to its considerable financial cost. There are, of course, the laws governing defamation. There are the laws covering infringement of copyright - under which the Queen a few years ago instituted proceedings against the Sun, when the latter published private holiday snaps of the Duchess of York. That cost the Sun Pounds 100,000. And there are the laws against trespass, perhaps the closest we have to a law protecting privacy. It is difficult to see that a story which is not defamatory, does not involve a breach of copyright, and has not involved any physical act of trespass, is one which an Act of Parliament should be created to prevent. But while I do not think that Mrs Bottomley has legitimate grounds for complaint, there is another politician whose cause I will support: Bill Clinton, the Democrats' presidential candidate. The diary column which published the name of the Bottomleys' illegitimate child also chose that same day to print a telephone number in the US which plays tapes of private conversations between Clinton and his alleged former mistress, Jennifer Flowers. Now that's what I call tacky. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator</p>

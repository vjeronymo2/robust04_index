			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / After The Budget: TUC gives welcome to job subsidies THE TRADES Union Congress took the unusual step yesterday of welcoming some employment measures in the Budget, including the use of job subsidies to encourage employers to take on the long-term unemployed. The TUC described as 'hopelessly inadequate', however, the larger package of special employment measures which will provide 100,000 jobless people with work experience or learning opportunities at a net cost of Pounds 125m. Training and Enterprise Councils - which deliver government-funded training schemes in England and Wales - will administer two of the four pilot job subsidy programmes. They gave the government's move a guarded welcome. Several Tecs already sponsor similar schemes and reward employers for offering training and employment to the jobless. One Tec chief executive said: 'If this initiative is developed and used more widely we may find it more difficult to persuade employers to provide training in return for a subsidy. If they get a subsidy for just giving a person a job they may not be as eager to provide training.' The Budget initiative that was given the warmest welcome was 'Tec Challenge', a scheme in which Tecs are invited to come forward with new ideas for tackling unemployment. Some Pounds 25m will be available for projects. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, has asked a special committee of Tecs to prepare ideas to tackle unemployment. It is expected to report in June.</p>

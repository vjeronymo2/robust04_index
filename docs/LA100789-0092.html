			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORWAY GOVERNMENT TO STEP DOWN OCT. 13  </P> <P> Norway's minority Labor government will officially step down on Oct. 13, Prime  Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's office said Friday.  </P> <P> It will be replaced by three center-right parties that earlier this week formed  a coalition, prompted by Labor's dismal performance in national elections last  month.  </P> <P> State Secretary Arne Strand said Brundtland would probably stay in charge over  the weekend until Oct. 16 when Conservative leader Jan Syse takes over as prime  minister.  </P> <P> Brundtland's minority government has ruled this country of 4 million people,  with its oil-based economy and extensive welfare state, since 1986.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FIRST LADIES' LUNCHEON IS LITERALLY A PAIN IN THE NECK  </P> <P> Barbara Bush joined Europe's first ladies today on a sightseeing trip  encompassing the Louvre and Versailles. It proved to be a pain in the neck --  literally -- for one of the group, Hannelore Kohl, wife of German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl.  </P> <P> The tour concluded with a gourmet luncheon hosted by French First Lady Danielle  Mitterrand.  </P> <P> Among the guests at Versailles' Grand Trianon palace was Mrs. Kohl, whose meal  ended prematurely. As photographers rushed to take pictures of Mrs. Bush, one  of them accidentally bumped into Mrs. Kohl. The French photographer's camera  and heavy lens grazed her neck as they slipped off his shoulder.  </P> <P> Mrs. Kohl winced and began rubbing the wound while Mrs. Bush expressed her  concern. Mrs. Kohl excused herself from the table after being hurt. The  photographer said he was unaware of the incident when it happened but later  apologized to Mrs. Kohl.  </P> <P> Raisa Gorbachev was the last to arrive -- skipping the guided tour of the Grand  Trianon, built in pink marble in 1687 by Louis XIV to accommodate his volatile  private life. She exchanged warm greetings with Mrs. Bush.  </P> <P> The group enjoyed a four-course meal prepared by one of France's leading  caterers. The menu included coquilles St. Jacques and shrimp mousse, roast  beef, vegetables, cheese, fruit and chestnut ice cream, accompanied by three  vintage French wines.  </P></p>

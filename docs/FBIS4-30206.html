			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit  reported that a proposal had been made to the cabinet early last  week to support the move taken by the Justice Ministry to  establish a court to deal with cases concerning intellectual  property rights [IPR] and international trade. This is because  cases involving intellectual property requires the service of  competent legal experts in order to promptly carry out  examinations and produce court decisions. There are also a  growing number of cases involving violations of intellectual  property rights. The move taken by the Justice Ministry is  considered necessary and timely to prepare for the economic and  commercial expansion of the country. The draft bill on an  intellectual property court will be discussed by the cabinet  next week and then will be forwarded to parliament for  deliberation.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Investors flock to Reuters buy-back SHAREHOLDERS in Reuters, the international news and information group, have flocked to take advantage of the company's special Pounds 350m share buy-back offer. Around 38.65 per cent of the company's shares were tendered under the offer, although Reuters plans to buy back only 5.84 per cent of its capital. The deal proved so attractive because a large proportion of the payout is being treated as a distribution by the Inland Revenue. Gross funds such as UK pension funds will accordingly be entitled to a tax credit on top of the purchase price of Pounds 14 per share, pushing their total receipts up to Pounds 17.21. Reuters shares closed at Pounds 15.24 per share. The deal was less attractive for US shareholders, who own around 35 per cent of Reuters' equity. Their tax credit is limited to around 80p so the buy-back was unprofitable once the Reuters price passed Pounds 15. The number of shares tendered in the form of ADSs (American Depositary Shares) was accordingly just 1.92m, out of a total tender of 164.3m shares; the company is offering to buy back 25m shares. Reuters proposed the buy-back as a means of returning its cash pile, Pounds 710m at the end of 1992, to shareholders. Sir Christopher Hogg, Reuters' chairman, said: 'The board believes that all shareholders will benefit from the repurchase since it should lead to an increase in Reuters' earnings per share.' Shareholders who have submitted valid tenders will have their shares purchased in full, up to a maximum of 5.84 per cent of their holdings as of August 25. Additional shares will be purchased pro rata.</p>

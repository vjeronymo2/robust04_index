			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Rev. Jesse Jackson flatly denied any interest in running for mayor of  Washington and said he would never move to unseat Mayor Marion Barry. "I've  expressed no interest in the job," Jackson said after leading an anti-drug  rally at a city high school. "Under no condition would I run against Marion  Barry." Asked later if he would run if Barry decided not to seek reelection in  1990, Jackson responded: "I have expressed no desire to be mayor."  </P></p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / EC protest at China-US trade pact THE European Community has complained at China's special trade deals with the US which, Brussels alleges, discriminate against the EC. Foreign ministers of the 12 EC states also yesterday reviewed the Community's attitude to the communist government's record on human rights. Despite a Danish-led push to toughen the EC's political stance towards Peking, the Twelve decided to maintain their 1990 policy of gradual normalisation of relations with Peking. However, EC officials stressed they made no link between the trade and human rights issues, because to do so would open the Community to political blackmail over commercial issues. The European Commission has complained that China recently signed an exclusive shipping agreement with the US, requiring US-Chinese trade to be carried in boats of the two countries. This, say EC officials, goes against the EC's agreement with China which has a no-discrimination clause in it. Brussels' other complaint is that China has given US companies better treatment than other foreign firms on intellectual property by awarding them retrospective rights. The Commission has now written to Peking asking for equal treatment with the US. If it gets no satisfaction, the EC side will raise the issue at next month's meeting of the joint EC-Chinese working group on trade. A similar row over discrimination arose a couple of years ago when Brussels complained that South Korea was giving preferential treatment to the US on intellectual property rights. Eventually the EC persuaded the Seoul government to treat European companies on a par with their American counterparts and the issue was defused. Brussels is hoping to achieve the same with China.</p>

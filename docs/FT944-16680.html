			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Subtle benefits from a rebalancing act Buying bonds will raise pension scheme costs, calculate actuaries grappling with the implications of the proposed UK minimum solvency standard. Over the past few decades equities have achieved a rate of return averaging 5.5 per cent a year more than gilt-edged. That is why the equity exposure of UK schemes has drifted up to more than 80 per cent. This makes company pension plans cheap to run, according to conventional actuarial assumptions. But the trend has exposed scheme members to greater discontinuance risks, which have aroused political scrutiny. So here is an interesting question. Suppose at the beginning of 1986 a pension fund with the then typical equity exposure of 74 per cent (excluding property) had decided to fix at a 50:50 mix of equities and bonds, to be rebalanced every quarter. How much worse would it have performed up to March 1994 than the typical fund which allowed its asset mix to drift with the superior performance of equities? (The drifting mix, incidentally, would have finished with about 78 per cent in equities, which was in the event further lifted by 9 percentage points by eager fund managers.) The answer, according to First Quadrant, the quantitative investment management firm, is that the 50:50 mix would have produced a slightly better return, at 14.4 per cent against 14.0 per cent, and with lower volatility. Why should a mechanistic process such as periodical rebalancing to a benchmark have this beneficial result? The answer is that the rebalancing procedure acts as a counter to valuation distortions between the two asset classes and forces the fund to offset them. When equities become expensive relative to bonds the equities are capped, and a small profit taken. Similarly when bonds are expensive relative to equities. It is a kind of automated contrarian approach, with a ratchet-like effect. For quantitative managers such as First Quadrant, an offshoot of the Xerox Corporation, the approaching minimum solvency standard offers an opportunity to break into the UK pension fund market, at present dominated by balanced managers. Ideas such as rebalancing are common in the US but are largely ignored in the consensus-chasing British market. But British pension fund trustees have proved unreceptive to quantitative methods so far. Perhaps balanced management has taken the drifting mix further towards risk than the trustees would have wished to go, but the results have been good. The trouble with quantitative methods is that it would be tough to find excuses if they were to go wrong. The trustees might have to confess that they had not understood what they were buying. It might not be enough simply to blame external managers. What could go wrong? Take the simple question of rebalancing to a benchmark. One reason why it has worked so well since 1986 is that the extra return on equities has not been 5.5 per cent during this period, but only 2.5 per cent. That relative decline in equity return will be the subject for another article, but the point here is that the penalty for high bond exposure has been small in recent years. Over longer periods drift has beaten rebalancing, but often not by a large margin. The obvious problem with rebalancing is that, as with any contrarian approach, it will often be uncomfortable. The fund's trustees will have to be willing to bet against the crowd for periods which may not be very long but will certainly seem so. If the return differential between equities and bonds were to widen, perhaps because of unanticipated inflation, the drifters would win. Finally, the capturing of profits from rebalancing depends on the existence of volatility in the relative valuations of the asset classes. Low volatility - that is, persistent trends - would make rebalancing costlier. UK pension funds have to come to grips with strategies which pay attention to the liability side of their balance sheets, rather than being driven by historical returns or peer group emulation. At least First Quadrant's study provides hope that matching liabilities more precisely against safe assets may not prove as expensive as often feared.

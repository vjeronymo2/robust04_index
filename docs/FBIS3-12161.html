			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Environment Minister Yosi Sarid by Hayim </F> Hecht following the cabinet session, outside the Prime  Minister's Office -- live]    [Text] [Hecht] The cabinet session has ended, and the  first bit of news is that the cabinet decided to set up a state  commission of inquiry. All the resolutions the government made  today were unanimous. Minister Yosi Sarid is here with us.    [Sarid] All the resolutions were unanimous. The first  decision is to create a state commission of inquiry. Another  decision passed was to issue restrictive orders against the  extreme settlers, the men who instigate fighting and strife,  those who constitute a real danger. Another decision speaks of  administrative detentions; yet another speaks of the need to  disarm extremist settlers, mainly in Qiryat Arba' and Hebron.  Also, the attorney general was ordered to examine the  possibility of outlawing extremist organizations. It is my  understanding that he will present his decision in a few days.    These are the cabinet resolutions. They are important and  set a precedent. I believe their gravity matches the grave view  the government holds of the terrible incident that took place at  the Cave of Patriarchs on 25 February.    [Hecht] When you speak about restrictive orders, we even  heard of exile orders....    [Sarid, interrupting] Not exile [haglaya] orders; I speak of  restrictive [hagbala] orders. Exile orders were also examined  but, for legal reasons, we reached the conclusion that they will  not be effective enough.    [Hecht] What do restrictive orders mean, and to how many  people will they apply?    [Sarid] I do not want to discuss figures because they do not  matter. What matters is the resolution, the precedent that was  set. In the initial stage, the figures may be low but, should  the need arise, they will grow. A restriction means that people  within the Green Line boundaries will not be able to cross it if  it is feared that they may constitute a threat. People residing  beyond the Green Line will not be able to enter sensitive places  that might turn into centers of riots when such people who act  madly -- and they are not mad, they only act that way -- arrive  there.    [Hecht] Does this mean that the hard-core Kakh activists and  supporters will be removed from Hebron and Qiryat Arba'?    [Sarid] I cannot speak in generalizations because the  reference is to specific, individual people. There is no doubt,  however, that the government today decided to deal with the  hard-core extremist elements with a very firm hand.    [Hecht] What will be the terms of reference for the state  commission of inquiry that you decided to set up?    [Sarid] The precise mandate of the commission will be  drafted and determined today by three persons: the foreign  minister, the justice minister, and the education minister.    [Hecht] Who will head it?    [Sarid] By law, the president of the High Court of Justice,  and he will determine the composition of the commission, not the  government. This is one of the advantages of a state commission  over other investigating teams.    [Hecht] You and the other Meretz ministers came here today  well prepared, with a precise list of measures that should be  taken against the mad extremists in the Hebron area. Are you  satisfied that the government accepted your recommendations?    [Sarid] We are very pleased. The government did not accept  our recommendations. I said before the session, and I say now,  there is nothing special about the Meretz ministers. I am happy  to say that the vast majority of the ministers share the same  views. I believe all of them do -- after all, the decisions  were unanimous. Therefore, I do not believe that Meretz should  keep itself separate from the other ministers.    [Hecht] Did the prime minister brief you about the upcoming  resumption of the peace talks? Do you, as a senior member of  the negotiating team, know of it? Did you get any message from  the PLO?    [Sarid] Regrettably, we cannot say that talks are resuming  at this point. There is no doubt, however, and we believe that  the resolutions we made today will make it significantly easier  to resume the negotiations in the coming days.</p>

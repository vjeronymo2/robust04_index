			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS  </P> <P> Barbara Campbell, formerly of Kona Village on the Big Island of Hawaii, has  taken wing and settled at Kamuela (also on the Big Island), where she operates  a lodging service called Hawaii's Best Bed &amp; Breakfasts. Everything from  B&amp;Bs to private cottages. Her headquarters are in upcountry Kamuela (10/20  minutes by car from the ocean, less than an hour from Kailua-Kona and 57 miles  from Hilo). One of Campbell's hosts is former Los Angeles newspaper reporter  Dee Dickson.  </P> <P> High on Campbell's list is a converted barn with two bedrooms, a kitchen,  living room, fireplace, TV, telephone, stereo. (The owners live in a separate  cottage nearby.) Another rental faces Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, with a view all  the way to the Pacific. Campbell's own Waimea Gardens cottage features antique  furnishings and a kitchen where guests prepare their own breakfasts with  ingredients supplied by Campbell (she lives just next door).  </P> <P> Barbara Campbell's Best Bed &amp; Breakfasts, P.O.

That's the cost for living the celebrity life in a 4,000-square-foot spread at  the Bungalows at Mauna Lani Bay, which is downcountry from Campbell's cottages.  Five enormous homes, each with two bedrooms, two baths, a steam room,  individual swimming pools, a film/stereo library. A butler on call 24 hours a  day. Limousine service from the airport.

Merriman's specializes  in fresh meats from local ranches, fresh fish. Gets raves for his wok-charred  ahi (local fish), his veal with mango and peppercorn sauce, and his steak kiana  (filets with shiitake sauce). Merriman, who is credited with introducing the  idea of regional cuisine in the islands, is the son of Woodene Merriman, the  former food editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MELVIN DURSLAG: HOLTZ MAY NOT HAVE A PHI BETA KAPPA IDEA  </P> <P> To begin with, you don't want to underestimate the cerebral endowment of Lou  Holtz, football coach at Notre Dame.  </P> <P> Lou has experienced success on the field. He is a philosopher and noted  speaker, renowned for his wit.  </P> <P> Thus, you aren't sure whether Holtz was pulling society's leg the other day  when he observed, quite unblinkingly, that professional sports should set up a  chain of 10 academies, at which they would train athletes for their armies.  </P> <P> "If you want to be a professional athlete," he said, "go to that academy.  Preparing people for pro sports is not the role of the universities. We are  there to educate people."  </P> <P> The listener draws back, reflecting on this profound thought. If, indeed,  universities are to reject athletes leveling an eye on the pros, the first  thing that's going to happen is that NBC is going to cancel the  multimillion-dollar football contract it recently signed with Notre Dame.  </P> <P> Could the network sell Ivy League-type football? If it could, it would have  signed a contract with Columbia.  </P> <P> Proceeding only with student athletes, Notre Dame and maybe 100 colleagues  embracing what is labeled big-time college football must brace themselves for  unoccupied seats in their stadiums, not the automatic sellouts on which they  have feasted for years.  </P> <P> And what are they going to say to their angels who are asked to make  contributions to the university each year in order to retain choice locations  in the stadium?  </P> <P> "Look, Jack," they are going to say, "all the top players are now attending pro  academies, and what we offer is schoolboy football, but we are sure that will  not water down your generosity."  </P> <P> If, as Holtz suggests, the academies are activated, what will be the impact on  bowls, from which the universities are dredging millions, and whose bids serve  as such an emotional stimulant to team supporters?  </P> <P> Informed the prime players have fled, Federal Express, Mobil, USF&amp;G, Mazda,  John Hancock, Sunkist and Eagle are going to shrug.  </P> <P> "We don't mind 150-pound quarterbacks," they are going to say. "Five feet-seven  is tall enough."  </P> <P> "But will they sell delivery service, gasoline, automobiles, insurance and  orange juice?" they will be asked.  </P> <P> "It isn't important," they will respond. "The only thing that counts is  education."  </P> <P> Now the Associated Press and United Press International are contacted.  </P> <P> "Under the Lou Holtz plan of student athletes," they will be asked, "will you  continue to run weekly polls?"  </P> <P> They will answer: "Running them is easy. The problem is getting someone to read  them."  </P> <P> "And you don't foresee beefs over which team is No. 1?"  </P> <P> "When cricket season approaches at Oxford," they reply, "a sign is posted on  the bulletin board, soliciting recruits. In some cases, knowledge of cricket is  unimportant if one has a car one is willing to use to transport teammates to  matches, petrol shared. Cricket has been played at Oxford for 600 years,  without a single argument developing over which club in the league is No. 1."  </P> <P> Now approaches July, the time of year at which drums begin to roll in behalf of  Heisman candidates. How much universities spend to promote a hero for the  Heisman Trophy rarely is known, because such expenditure is a point of  embarrassment.  </P> <P> When candidates are students only, and no prospects for the pros, will  promotion budgets change? And will television carry live announcement of the  winner?  </P> <P> More important, will he be contacted by Bob Hope?  </P> <P> When Lou Holtz recommends pro academies, he must allow for major adjustments in  the lives of the coaches. One adjustment would call for a farewell kiss to  salaries spiraling into six figures.  </P> <P> And what kind of radio and TV shows are tendered the coaches of St. Mary's,  Santa Clara, Occidental, Whittier and Pomona-Pitzer, engaged in student  football?  </P> <P> Often, arrangements are made with local car dealers for the head coach and his  staff to drive new machines, in exchange for promotional opportunities, if not  tickets.  </P> <P> Told the team is shifting to student football, the car dealer will give the  coaching staff a bus schedule.  </P> <P> Since Lou Holtz is only 53, we don't like to disillusion him at an age so  tender. But he must be informed that we already have pro academies in this  land.  </P> <P> They are called Notre Dame, USC, Ohio State, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Clemson, Miami  and the like. Pursuing the buck as they do, they serve as idols of the children  they shepherd.  </P></p>

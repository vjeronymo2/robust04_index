			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Shigeru Handa, from the "Building of the New SDF </F> Following the End of the Cold War" series; part four entitled "I  Shamefully Say That I Am a Soldier in the SDF Reserves"]    [Text] Last winter, a group of reservists from the Ground  Self-Defense Force [GSDF] underwent marksmanship training at the  Kitafuji Training Ground in Yamanashi Prefecture. About 120  reserves from Shizuoka, Yamanashi, and Kanagawa Prefectures  participated in the training. Many wore spectacles for the  elderly because they had been discharged from the Self-Defenses  Forces [SDF] at the mandatory discharge age.    Kenso Goto, 60, said after finishing his training: "Why did  I come here? I came here to meet old friends again." He was a  warrant officer in the reserves. Reservists undergo five days  of markmanship training every year.    It is rumored that the fixed number of the GSDF members will  be reduced when the Guideline for Defense Buildup is reviewed,  and that the reserves are a "trump card" for the GSDF. The  GSDF, which has 46,000 reserves, intends to maintain its combat  capability by making up for future reductions in its numbers by  using the reserves, but there are a host of problems with the  GSDF reserve system.    Uniforms are given to reservists when they report to  training; they pin their insignia on and begin markmanship  training. Unlike SDF members on active duty, no officer is in  charge of overseeing their training, and no call-up training has  ever been conducted to prepare them for an emergency. The GSDF  reserve system falls short of meeting the requirement for  immediate preparedness, and has a fatal defect in maintaining  the reserves as supplementary combat capabilities.    The "Guideline for Defense Buildup," which was formulated 18  years ago, clearly carries a provision calling for the  "expansion" of the reserves to bolster the SDF's combat  capabilities during an emergency. If the expansion in the  provision aims at bolstering the nation's combat capabilities by  calling up the SDF reserves in large numbers and by making  emergency procurements of such mainstay military hardware as  tanks and fighters (as a senior official in the Defense Agency  [DA] interprets), then the SDF reserve system should be revamped.    The "Defense Issues Council," an advisory body for Prime  Minister Hosokawa, held its fifth round of meetings on 6 April.  Providing an explanation of the provision at the meeting, the  Defense Agency said: "In the past we studied it, but we do not  do so now. We have no system for emergency procurement."    Explaining the reason for the DA leaving the provision  untouched, a senior DA official has said: "We need legislation  to strengthen our combat capabilities in the event of an  emergency. However, we fear being interrogated in the Diet  about such legislation." While some say such "legislation is  locked in a safe," others say the legislation has been shelved  because of a lack of tension in Japan's neighbors. Seiki  Nishhiro, an adviser to the DA who was involved in formulating  the Guideline for the Defense Buildup, has recalled: "The  provision was fake."    What has the DA done over the past 18 years since the  Guideline for the Defense Buildup was formulated? Another  senior DA official has said: "If the DA takes aggressive  measures to enforce the provision and announces the recruitment  of SDF reserves, the people will undoubtedly criticize the DA  for trying to institute a draft." Although the 1992 Defense  White Paper described the SDF as "the people's forces," the DA  in fact feels alienated from the people.    Bureaus in the DA as well as the Ground Staff Office in the  GSDF have begun studying ways to adopt a new SDF reserve system,  but they will certainly encounter rough sailing in their study.  Recently the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear  development has been raised, and Prime Minister Hosokawa, who  expressed an for disarmament, announced his resignation on 8  April.    Several senior DA officials are revealing their hopes that  the current SDF reserve system will be strengthened by external  factors, asking: "Will the direction of the winds change?"</p>

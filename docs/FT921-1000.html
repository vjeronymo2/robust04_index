			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Although prices paid for wool in Australia have declined again this week, there is a view that the pace of decline has slowed down and some finer merinos became dearer on March 25. The Wool Realisation Commission has not lowered its prices with the market decline, and much of the wool offered at auction is drought-affected. Buyers expect a setback after February's strong rise and have held back, but growers have also withdrawn their wool at their own reserves rather than see it go at prices they believe may be only temporarily lower. The market indicator on March 25 was 574 cents a kilogram from 619 a week before.</p>

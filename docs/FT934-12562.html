			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Simon agrees extension of its banking facilities SIMON ENGINEERING, the maker of access equipment including fire rescue gear, has negotiated in principle an extension of its banking facilities to the end of next year. Mr Maurice Dixson, who became chief executive as the group announced a first-half pre-tax loss of Pounds 52.6m at the beginning of September, yesterday described the proposed extension as 'a milestone.' It would give the management time to take the necessary actions for a return to profitability, he said. Under the proposals, which have been submitted to lenders for approval, Simon would receive bonding facilities to allow it to compete for new business in key areas - including the sale of fire rescue equipment in North America. The group would grant security to the small number of mainly UK banks with which it has Pounds 60m of medium term finance, and to North American holders of Dollars 125m (Pounds 83m) of unsecured loan notes. Both the banks and the noteholders would waive Simon's breach of banking covenants earlier this year. The group is committed to reducing its net debt substantially by the end of 1994. Mr Dixson, on taking up the reins of the group, identified the reduction of net debt from Pounds 143m to less than Pounds 100m as his most urgent task. 'I have set a target below Pounds 100m as a matter of priority,' he said yesterday. 'I don't need anyone to drive me to do that - it's a commercial imperative.' The simplest way to reduce the debt was to make the company more profitable. Mr Dixson said a lot of his attention had been directed at the access equipment business, where he planned to sort out the working capital and boost margins. In addition, there would have to be further sales both of businesses and property assets. While Mr Dixson said he had now identified the core businesses which would provide a future for Simon, he would not be drawn on details. The main part of the debt reduction programme is expected to fall in next year's second half. The first half loss was struck on turnover of Pounds 190.8m, and compared with a previous profit of Pounds 6.16m on turnover of Pounds 242.3m. The deficit marked the culmination of more than two years of bad news for the group, which has suffered from an ill-fated diversification into environmental engineering, loss-making plant contracts, the recession and rising debts. At the end of June gearing was 195 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS CALL FOR SMOKING BAN IN PUBLIC PLACES  </P> <P> In what it says is a significant change of heart and not a change in tactics,  the California Restaurant Assn. declared Tuesday that it would support an  outright, statewide smoking ban in restaurants -- but only if smoking is also  banned in all other public places.  </P> <P> The organization, representing owners of about 10,000 restaurants, said its  decision is largely an acknowledgment of new data on the risks of secondhand  smoke. Such a legislative ban could leapfrog local smoking regulations, like  those in place in Los Angeles and many other California cities, as well as Los  Angeles Councilman Marvin Braude's proposal to ban restaurant smoking  altogether.  </P> <P> At a press conference in the smoking section of a downtown restaurant,  association officials disclosed that they are drafting legislation that would  enact the smoking ban. They said it would be "premature" to define a public  place, although a representative in Sacramento said it would include such spots  as bowling alleys, sports arenas and theaters.  </P> <P> "Rather than point a finger to the workplace or to other environments where  secondhand smoke far exceeds that in restaurants," said incoming association  President Ted Burke, "the restaurant industry . . . encourages a total ban on  smoking in each and every public place in California, without exception or  exclusion."  </P> <P> The restaurant association is one of the most influential lobbies in  Sacramento, its members representing everything from food contractors to haute  cuisine. It has battled smoking regulations at all levels, urging voluntary  changes on its members, many of whom have found nonsmoking sections to be  profitable.  </P> <P> The California-based Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights lauded the "breakthrough"  turnabout in the position of the restaurant owners, but in the next breath said  it was doomed by the cigarette industry's leverage in the Legislature.  </P> <P> "We're very pleased the restaurant association now recognizes that secondhand  smoke is a public health problem," said Julia Carol, associate director of the  anti-smoking group. She predicted that a total ban would not come about because  the Legislature is "in the hip pocket" of tobacco interests.  </P> <P> Braude said that while he was glad the group had recognized the dangers of  smoke, the overreaching goals of such legislation makes it look like "a  conspiracy to destroy local initiative."  </P> <P> "That acknowledgment is very good indeed," said Braude, who got smoking banned  in elevators a decade ago and has since carried forward his anti-smoking  campaign. "But I've seen many times when industry groups use the state  Legislature to preempt local government from regulating their industry and  protecting the public health, and I'm very suspicious of their motives for  wanting this to go to Sacramento, and I'm also suspicious of the claim that you  should regulate it everywhere -- that restaurants aren't any different from any  other public places."  </P> <P> Braude added that "it's clear they're fearful (because) they've resorted to  such a tactic, admitting something ought to be done . . . What they're saying  is the city should not have the power to control the local health and safety of  their own community . . . The net effect is to organize to prevent the city of  Los Angeles from proceeding, but they will not do so. We shall prevail and the  tobacco industry is not gonna win on this."  </P> <P> Linda Jo Thompson, the restaurant association's senior director of government  affairs and general counsel, said she has finished the first draft of the bill,  which could not be introduced in the Legislature before January. Beyond  prohibiting smoking in eating and drinking places, the proposal would ban  smoking in "every public place, including bowling alleys, sports arenas,  theaters," she said. It would not apply, for instance, to an employee cafeteria  at a privately owned plant, she said.  </P> <P> "We are fairly certain that our proposal is going to get a lot of pummeling. We  have been pummeled before. We'll just have to take what comes," Thompson said.  </P> <P> She said the association is looking for a legislator who will carry the bill.  It is certain to draw the attention of a large number of legislative combatants  ranging from local governments to the tobacco lobby, health and medical  interests, and restaurant and bar owners.  </P> <P> Braude and the nonsmoking group are concerned that the legislation might pose a  risk to smoking regulations already in place. One fear is that the legislation  would be so sweeping in defining "public" that the Legislature would back away  from it. Alternatively, they worry that any watered down compromise would  impose less than rigorous standards statewide, possibly cutting off at the  knees more stringent local measures.  </P> <P> Legislation that would enact a smoking ban "is not going to hurt us at all,"  said Carol, of the anti-smoking group. "The only thing that would hurt us is a  state law with preemption (of more rigorous local standards) in it, and we'd  fight that tooth and nail, and it wouldn't pass."  </P> <P> The restaurant association's executive vice president, Stan Kyker, dismissed  local restrictions as "piecemeal" and confusing. "If secondhand smoke is a  health hazard, then it is a health hazard for employees as well as customers,  and it is a health hazard in all types of establishments in all parts of the  states," he said.  </P> <P> Association officials said the about-face, which came on a 90-0 vote at the  June meeting of its board of directors, was not a direct response to Braude's  May 29 proposal for a total restaurant smoking ban, the toughest in any major  U.S. city.  </P> <P> It is a reaction "only to the degree that Los Angeles becomes part of that  patchwork quilt (of regulations) that is beginning to develop all over the  state," said Kyker. "To say that it had absolutely nothing to do with it would  be shortsighted, but to say that it is a response to it is also clearly too  simplistic."  </P> <P> Throughout the country, local government agencies have sometimes been more  vigorous in legislating matters from gun control to fireworks and smoking  issues. In part, it is because lobbying money and special-interest leverage are  often more effectively employed at the state level.  </P> <P> The restaurant association opposed piecemeal legislation as creating unfair  competition between restaurants in neighboring cities. Kyker said it also would  be against any state legislation banning smoking in restaurants alone, without  including other public places.  </P> <P> "Our board believes it is not a rights, moral or ethical issue," Thompson said.  "It is simply a health issue. We feel beyond a reasonable doubt that secondhand  smoke is a real health problem, especially for employees."  </P> <P> "In the past, and up until this year, we have understood the smoking  controversy to be a rights or moral issue that we felt we didn't have any  business making any judgments about," she said. "Our board was not pro- or  anti-smoking. They just wanted to accommodate those who wanted to eat at the  restaurant or drink at the bar. They wanted people to be happy."  </P> <P> Thompson said the reversal also came in the wake of passage of the anti-toxics  Proposition 65 in 1986, which, among other things, required the posting of  signs where food is served warning of the hazards to health of smoking.  </P> <P> "Our board looked at that and they felt this was the beginning of their  acknowledgment that maybe there is something to the scientific studies that  secondhand smoke is dangerous," she said.  </P> <P> Contributing to this report was staff writer Carl Ingram in Sacramento  </P></p>

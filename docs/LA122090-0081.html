			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.  </P> <P> Ah, the Christmas spirit: John Wilson of Venice spotted a hand-printed sign off  the San Diego Freeway that said, "Trees for Sale, Cheap as Hell."  </P> <P> It's been a big week for bizarre freeway obstructions. The Artesia was closed  the other night after some suspected armed robbers threw a couple of hundred  dollars out their windows during a chase.  </P> <P> Nighttime traffic also slowed near the Pomona's Euclid Avenue off-ramp in  Ontario. The problem: Motorists were slowing to gaze at a huge Christmas light  display at one residence.  </P> <P> And then there was what KNX traffic reporter Bill Keene calls his "first ever  'Dog-Alert.' "  </P> <P> A pack of wild dogs charged onto the Glendale Freeway north of the Echo Park  area, causing the freeway to be shut down for about 15 minutes while  authorities rounded up the intruders.  </P> <P> Keene called it: "A six-pack of curs."  </P> <P> Jeff Daniels of Playa del Rey wonders if the mutant chicken described in the  accompanying ad has two heads or, maybe, three wings.  </P> <P> Friday marks the 50th anniversary of the death of F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose  final (unfinished) work, "The Last Tycoon," is considered one of the best  novels about Hollywood.  </P> <P> Fitzgerald, 44, died of a heart attack in the West Hollywood apartment of his  lover, Sheilah Graham, a few blocks from his own residence on North Laurel  Avenue.  </P> <P> In her book, "Beloved Infidel," Graham reminisced about how she and Fitzgerald  (who was on the wagon) would go "shopping at night in the supermarkets on  Sunset Boulevard, or spend an hour in Schwab's drugstore." Fitzgerald enjoyed  reciting Keats as they walked in the darkness and "sometimes a passerby stared  at us and I would burst out laughing, but Scott would maintain a stern  demeanor."  </P> <P> A few months ago, a group on a literary tour of L.A. made a pilgrimage to  Fitzgerald's old apartment, only to be shooed away by the current tenant, who  said she was weary of the novelist's admirers knocking at her door.  </P> <P> And so we beat on . . .  </P> <P> Santa Monica, which is a bit different, may be the only city that can boast  that its last three mayors have been arrested at anti-nuclear demonstrations in  Nevada.  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> In 1948, Emmanuel Lutheran Church in North Hollywood became the first place of  worship to inaugurate drive-in services. About 120 cars gathered on the church  playground while ushers walked from driver to driver, passing out hymnals and  taking collections. The drive-in services were discontinued about two decades  ago.  </P></p>

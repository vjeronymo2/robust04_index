			<p>BFN     [Text] As havoc and indiscriminate slaughter of civilians  continue in the southeast of Liberia, indisputable evidence has  emerged that the motives behind the LPC [Liberia Peace Council]  mayhem is to depopulate and (?hurt) the entire southeast of the  country. LPC fighters are frustrated over failure to gain any  substantial support and ground from the Bassa, Kru, Grebo, and  even some Krahn citizens in the south and southeast of the  country and their unprovoked battle against the NPFL [National  Patriotic Front of Liberia]. [sentence as heard] Eyewitnesses  say the LPC has unleashed a reign of mayhem on these citizens,  because LPC is of the notion that these citizens [are] original  supporters of the NPFL.    Political analysts are also of the conviction that the  current wave of violence to depopulate the southeast is intended  to deplete the area of potential voters, who are all likely to  vote for the NPFL in the ensuing general and presidential  elections in Liberia this year.</p>

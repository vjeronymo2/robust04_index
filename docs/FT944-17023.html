			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / US anti-trust law will aid foreign co-operation US anti-trust enforcement agencies are expected to be able to expand their reach overseas when President Bill Clinton signs a bill, passed in the closing hours of the congressional session on Saturday, to allow greater co-operation with foreign competition authorities. The bill will allow the US Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, which share responsibility for enforcing anti-trust laws, to provide information which they would otherwise be barred from divulging to countries which agree in return to share their own information. The US has this sort of legal co-operation agreement only with Canada. Justice Department officials credit the co-operation pact with helping them to break up a cartel to fix the prices of thermal fax paper and plastic cutlery earlier this year. Ms Janet Reno said the new law would 'give us unprecedented access to evidence needed to conduct investigations of international business activity'.</p>

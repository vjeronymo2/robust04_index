			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Securitised asset rule may change BANKS are likely to be exempted from a new accounting standard requiring certain securitised assets such as mortgages to be included on their balance sheets, it emerged yesterday. The Accounting Standards Board said it had no intention of turning the banks into 'unintended casualties' of EC regulations under preparation. Mr Allan Cooke, the board's technical director, said: 'For some months we have made no secret of the fact that we do not want to pillory the banks for guidelines drawn up by people to whom securitisation means nothing.' Securitisation is the process by which certain assets such as mortgages and other loans are packaged together as securities and sold on to third parties via an intermediary company. Banks argue that this arm's-length intermediary - which may have been set up by a bank - acts in the interests of the purchasers of the securities, and that most of the risks and rewards of the loans are transferred to it. Banks therefore record securitised assets in notes to the accounts rather than counting them as assets on the balance sheet. Securitisation has come under threat as one of a number of practices subject to change in a discussion document on off-balance-sheet finance issued by the board last October. The board is about to launch a series of informal discussions over the next few months in anticipation of a standard about off-balance sheet finance by the end of this year. It says that securitised assets should generally be included on the balance sheet because they are resources available to the business from which it makes money. However, under an EC draft directive, the Bank of England will be required to ensure that banks have sufficient capital to cover their balance sheet assets as defined under UK accounting standards. Banks argue that the board's current proposals will restrict their lending and place the UK at a competitive disadvantage. This is because they will need to provide additional capital to match the securitised assets placed back on the balance sheet. The board stressed yesterday that if the EC draft directive is modified so that it does not require banks' securitised assets to be matched by additional capital, then its own standard might then require securitised assets to be dealt with on the balance sheet.</p>

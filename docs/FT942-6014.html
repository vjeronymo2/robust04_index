			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Warning on finance for EU networks The European Union must act now to ensure that there will be no shortage of finance for constructing transport, energy and communications networks in Europe, Mr Henning Christophersen, European Commission vice-president, said yesterday. In a report to next week's meeting of economics and finance ministers on the funding of so-called transeuropean networks, Mr Christophersen said possible financing problems for the projects were already so alarming, that he was inviting member states, EU institutions and private operators to consider what action is necessary to maintain adequate investment. He stressed again the the need to attract private finance, his comments coming in the wake of another recent sharp rise in long-term European interest rates, pushed higher by investor nervousness about inflation. Mr Christophersen said market trends this week made it ever more important to get a clear signal from next week's meeting of EU economy and finance ministers, and from the Corfu summit later this month, that ministers were planning to step up their anti-inflationary policies. 'This message is even more important than two weeks ago because the market fears that inflation is going to come back,' he said. The recent rise in long-term borrowing rates will strengthen the position of those member states that are wary of Commission proposals to raise an extra funds through the issue of 'Union bonds'. However, Mr Christophersen retained the prospect of Union involvement, saying that where other financing sources were not available, the EU should be able to co-finance, with the European Investment Bank, loan packages to priority projects. Another option for capital market funding would be for the EU to underwrite private sector projects. Such guarantees could be made available to loans specific to projects that were co-financed with the EIB. Mr Christophersen also pointed out that there was likely to be a shortfall in financing of up to Ecu6.4bn (Pounds 4.9bn) for Europe's 10 priority transport projects. Projects receiving public assistance would have to satisfy economic viability tests. 'They should be expected to produce a substantial net benefit to society, taking into account also the external costs and benefits,' he said. He added that at Union level, the EIB would be the largest single source of finance for the transeuropean networks. The European Investment Fund, now operational, would work with the private sector in helping to allocate and manage risks.</p>

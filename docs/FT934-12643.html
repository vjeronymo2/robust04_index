			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Hostility to Jews 'less in Britain' ATTITUDES towards Jews in Britain are more positive than those towards other minorities, says a survey by Gallup for the American Jewish Committee, the international lobby group. The survey of 959 people, which was published yesterday and is part of an international series, also showed that hostility towards Jews was less in Britain than in many other countries, including the US. Dr David Singer, director of research for the committee, said the results were encouraging but he noted that 25 per cent of those questioned still thought that anti-Semitism would increase in the fut-ure. Eight per cent of respondents thought Jews behaved in a way which provoked hostility. This compared with 57 per cent who felt this about Gypsies, 28 per cent about Pakistanis, 26 per cent about West Indians and 21 per cent about Arabs. Asked if Jews had too much influence in British society, 8 per cent said they did, 42 per cent said they had the 'right amount' of influence, and 7 per cent 'too little'. On the extent of anti-Semitism, the survey found that 45 per cent felt it was 'not a problem at all'. International comparisons show that 28 per cent in Austria think Jews have too much influence, compared with 20 per cent in the US, and 5 per cent in the former Czechoslovakia.</p>

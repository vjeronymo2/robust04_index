			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The benefits of applying the ORVR requirements to LDTs exceed the costs of the requirement. Since EPA believes, and the manufacturers' comments indicate, that most vehicles will use an integrated evaporative/refueling control system, the incremental costs of LDT ORVR controls are relatively small. As detailed in the RIA, EPA's cost is comprised of added hardware (mostly an improved vent/rollover valve and larger diameter vapor line) and short term development costs (for emissions and safety certification, facility modification hardware/tooling modifications, and systems engineering) minus the fuel recovery credit. The size of the fuel recovery credit depends on the amount of vapor captured. This in turn depends on the fuel used, the emissions rate (g/gal), and the presence or absence of Stage II vapor recovery. Taking all of these factors into account, and assuming Stage II controls in most of the ozone NAAs, the cost estimate for LDTs/HDVs are shown below in Table 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 6,L2,i1,s50,15,15,15,15,15 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 1._ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estimated Per-Vehicle Costs of ORVR Systems in LDTs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Vehicle group <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Hardware  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> ($/vehicle) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Develop  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> ($/vehicle) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Operating cost (NPV) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Short term  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> net cost <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Long term  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> net cost <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> LDT <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $4.79 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $2.65 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> ^$3.70 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $3.74 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $1.09  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> For vehicles operating in nonattainment areas (NAAs), the recovery credits are smaller and the short and long term net costs increase by about $3 per vehicle over those in the table above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As was discussed above, LDTs represent over 33 percent of the nation's gasoline consumption. With the test procedure and control system approach mentioned above, EPA expects that the in-use control efficiency of LDT ORVR systems will exceed 95 percent. Incremental to Stage II controls, LDT ORVR controls would provide a nationwide average annual emission reduction of 115,000 tons between 1998 and 2020. Reductions in NAAs with Stage II controls are large as well. With no Stage II phase-out, the average annual emission reduction in the NAAs is 31,000 tons. If Stage II is phased out when ORVR is in widespread use (2010), the average annual emission reduction in the NAAs attributable to LDT controls increases to 68,000 tons. These incremental reductions in NAAs are large relative to the other control options available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As is discussed below, reductions in refueling emissions have value in all areas of the country. However, the main focus of the ORVR requirement is to provide ozone NAAs additional reductions to assist them in complying or maintaining compliance with the ozone standard. Thus, the important areas to consider are those which are not now in compliance with the ozone standard. At present there are 54 marginal or worse ozone NA areas, which represent about 54.9 percent of the nationwide highway gasoline consumption. Of these 54 areas, about 43 now have, or are expected to have, Stage II vapor recovery systems in place. Since ORVR controls are required on all LDVs, and Stage II vapor recovery is (or will be) in place in most moderate or worse ozone NAAs, the key comparison to be made is (1) retaining Stage II controls in the moderate or worse ozone NAAs solely for the purpose of controlling LDT/HDV refueling emissions, versus (2) requiring ORVR controls for LDTs and possibly HDVs, assuming the Stage II control that is or will be in place. This comparison provides a worst case perspective on the LDT/HDV cost effectiveness, since benefits outside NAAs are ignored and planned Stage II is assumed to continue after the ORVR requirement is promulgated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As is described in the RIA, EPA has conducted the analysis for both the Stage II retention and ORVR options. The cost effectiveness of retaining Stage II solely for the purpose of controlling LDT/HDV refueling emissions is about $3400 per ton. The cost effectiveness of the LDT ORVR controls incremental to the Stage II now in place is about $200 per ton if Stage II is phased out when ORVR control is in widespread use (2010) and only about $700 per ton if Stage II is never phased out. Under either scenario the cost effectiveness of the ORVR option is attractive. Thus, even with the Stage II controls, it is more cost effective to require ORVR controls on LDTs than to retain Stage II solely for controlling LDT/HDV refueling emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the VOC emission reduction benefits cited above, LDT ORVR controls have other benefits. These benefits have not been considered in the calculations above, but would further enhance the attractiveness of LDT ORVR. LDT ORVR controls would result in an average annual fuel savings equivalent to about 31 million gallons of gasoline per year between the period 1998 and 2020 assuming no Stage II phase-out, and about 43 million gallons per year if Stage II is phased out. In addition, there will be health benefits as a result of reductions in air toxic emissions. Best estimates are the avoidance of 2&hyph;3 cancer incidences per year as a result of lower refueling benzene emissions. Additional cancer avoidances are possible depending on the assumption regarding the toxicological impact of the remainder of the constituents of the gasoline vapor. Reductions in potential non-cancer health effects and welfare benefits such as reduced crop and material damage due to ozone would occur as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: HENDERSON SAYS HE'LL SIGN 9-MONTH DEAL WITH SOCKERS  </P> <P> Eddie Henderson, the fourth pick in the Major Soccer League draft, said he will  sign a nine-month contract with the Sockers.  </P> <P> "They've offered me a contract and I'm happy with the offer," he said.  </P> <P> "For sure I'll sign it and get it back to them on Monday."  </P> <P> Ron Cady, Sockers' president, would say only that the team is still negotiating  with Henderson.  </P> <P> Drafted from Washington, Henderson is said to have the speed of Socker  defensive runner Paul Wright, considered the fastest player in the MSL, but  Henderson shook his head at that.  </P> <P> "If we ran a 100-yard dash, he would beat me," Henderson said. "I just have  people fooled. My quickness is in my first three steps and I play the ball  early so I don't get beat."  </P> <P> Henderson (5-foot-1, 145 pounds) is expected to be among the Sockers' most  bountiful draft. Defender Marcelo Balboa of the U.S. national team, selected  with the first overall pick, said he will not report until signed, and Cady has  already gone on record saying that would not be a problem. Defender David  Banks, a third-round pick from Philadelphia Textile, is also expected to be  signed, and Eric Yamamoto, a goalie taken in the fourth round from Santa Clara,  may stay as well.  </P> <P> In other matters, the Sockers cut Bob Lilley, the only free-agent defender with  professional indoor experience brought into camp.  </P> <P> "But it's not what they bring with them," said Erich Geyer, Sockers' assistant  coach. "It's what they show on the field." JOHN GEIS  </P></p>

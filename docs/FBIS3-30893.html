			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan  Karadzic said here Thursday [10 February] he would not take part  in peace talks until the massacre last Saturday in Sarajevo was  properly investigated to determine who was responsible. He  spoke as he was entering the talks here, and said he would tell  the Bosnian and Croatian delegations his conditions for  proceeding.    Karadzic looked drawn as he entered the UN headquarters. The  Bosnian Serbs were threatened Wednesday with NATO air strikes if  they do not withdraw their heavy artillery from around Sarajevo  by February 21.    "I just want to say that we are not going to go on with the  conference until we get an international investigatory body to  investigate and resolve the Sarajevo massacre," Karadzic told  reporters as he went in for talks with mainly Moslem Bosnian  Government and Bosnian Croat delegations.    UN forces in Sarajevo have said a bombing Friday in Sarajevo  that killed eight people was carried out by Serb artillery but  have not determined who was responsible for the Saturday attack  in a Sarajevo market that left 68 dead and aroused the ire of  the international community.    "I would remind you that Moslems have stage-managed the  killing in the bread queue killing 18 of their own people," he  said, referring to a previous civilian bombing in Sarajevo for  which the Moslems and Serbs each blame each other. He also said  the Moslems were responsible for shooting down an Italian plane  in September 1992.    Karadzic said the problem was that only Yugoslavia "got  sanctions" after these incidents. "We don't have any reason to  go on with the conference until we get a commission to  investigate evidence in single circumstances and to say publicly  who is responsible for this massacre," Karadzic said.    He said he would tell the Bosnian and Croatian delegations:  "We are going to tell them we demand an investigatory body to  get findings and to make this public."</p>

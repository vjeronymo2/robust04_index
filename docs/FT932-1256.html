			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Alexon calls for Pounds 16.4m to underpin reorganisation ALEXON Group, the women's wear retailer, yesterday announced a 4-for-5 rights issue to raise Pounds 16.4m to underpin the reorganisation of its business. The 28.5m new shares are being offered at 60p each. The existing shares, which were yesterday relisted after a temporary suspension at the company's request, fell 13p to 65p. Alexon, which is under new management, also restated its results for the 53 weeks to January 30, showing a pre-tax loss of Pounds 12.2m. It made Pounds 11.3m pre-tax profit in the previous year. The deficit is Pounds 11.2m greater than shown in the preliminary announcement of unaudited results made on March 30. The loss has been inflated mainly because of provisions made against old stock, which has been written down by Pounds 10m. The cash call has the support of Alexon's three biggest institutional shareholders - Gartmore Pension Fund Managers, Scottish Amicable Investment Managers and Mercury Asset Management. In April they took the unusual step of forcing a change of management. Mr John Osborn, a former director of Sears who took over as chief executive, said he was confident of the support of most of his shareholders after talking to 26 institutions. The rights issue is being underwritten by Kleinwort Benson. Mr Osborn said the Dash leisure wear brand would be replaced in the group's shops with a ladies brand named Ann Harvey. Dash would return to a concession-only brand. Alexon's US operations would close. COMMENT With new management installed at Alexon it was only a matter of time before shareholders would be tapped for cash. Mr Osborn, who arrives at Alexon with a good track record, is not prone to tinkering around the edges. Instead of repositioning Dash in the group's shops he has effectively replaced it with a new brand. He aims to get the old stock below Pounds 30m by the year end. However, in a fiercely competitive market it still remains a high-risk policy. The group's own brokers, Kleinworts, are forecasting a pre-tax loss of Pounds 7m by the end of January 1994, followed by a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4m the next year. This would put the shares on a prospective multiple of 13.8 - a discount to the stores sector. That might be judged a good enough return by the group's big shareholders, but it is unlikely to prove attractive to anyone else.</p>

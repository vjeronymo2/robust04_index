			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Sport: Taking the risk out of victory - Sport Insurance DO NOT be surprised to read in the near future about a generous sponsor offering the England soccer team a multi-million pound bonus for winning the 1994 World Cup. The only thing remaining to be settled is the exact cost of the benefactor's premium on the insured risk of having to pay out on such a surprise victory. 'We have already quoted on this one,' agreed Mark Chapman, one of four directors of Tyser Special Risks. All over international professional sport huge bonuses are beginning to replace enormous fees and retainers. The reason is simple. Sponsors can insure against the possibility of a pay-out (however large) but not the certainty of a salary. Racing driver Nelson Piquet drove in Formula One without a salary - preferring instead to be given a bonus per Grand Prix point by sponsors Bennetton. They in turn, said Tyser, were almost certainly insured in the Lloyds market for whatever they eventually paid the Brazilian driver. This subject is one that many sports fans find slightly dubious, without being able quite to explain why. Perhaps it is the notion that one normally insures against calamities rather than the attainment of ambitions. Certainly soccer teams prefer to keep quiet about their policy of insuring against a promotion they have fought for all season. Financially such a tactic makes sense for them because reaching the Premier League, say, can cost a fortune in mandatory ground improvements and staff expansion. Millwall Football Club covered the expenses of their promotion with such a policy. Stockport's hapless chairman admitted the existence of a similar policy - which was promptly cancelled by the underwriter as a breach of the confidentiality clause. At its most sophisticated this strategy enables small companies to compete with the big boys. How, for example, did the tiny shoe company ASICS manage to compete with the likes of Reebok and Nike, the latter paying athletes tens of millions of dollars to employ its footwear? Insuring at Lloyds is the answer. 'The only way to get successful in that game is to put your shoes on well-known feet,' said Chapman's colleague Richard Woods. Leroy Burrell, Liz McColgan and Olympic gold-medal hurdler Kevin Young have all worn ASICS. Each will have a personal schedule of bonuses to be paid out if certain targets ranging from world records to medals are achieved. Golf is another sport for contract bonus / prize indemnity, as it is known in the London insurance business. Want to promise Nick Faldo a squillion dollars for wearing your sweaters and winning two Majors in 1993? Tyser will quote you a rate - after enough research. 'We study form and then quote the odds essentially. Everything from the player's past statistics to the state of his marriage is relevant. The difference between laying off the risk with a bookmaker and insuring is that a betting slip is not acceptable to the company auditors,' said Chapman. Some sports risks relate not to the performance of a well-known professional but to the achievement of an against-all-odds target by an amateur. A hole-in-one is the classic example. Recently a competitor at a pro-am in the US won an uninsured Dollars 1m prize for potting his tee-shot at a par three. It sent shudders round every promoter and did wonders for Tyser. But Chapman and company will not just write a policy based on actuarial averages for that hole. Sometimes they will want to walk the course, feel the green. The phenomenon of the 'bowl green' is not unknown where the ball travels down towards a hold cut at the exact centre of a shallow depression. Promoters of angling contests in the US sometimes offer huge cash prizes for fish that break a world weight record. They provide a 'moral hazard', according to Woods. Before Tyser will authorise a pay-out it demands that the fisherman take a polygraph test and that the fish be gutted before expert witnesses. They sometimes turn out to have had an extraordinary appetite for lead shot. Almost the only sport untouched by Tyser and its competitors is the noble art. 'Boxing? That's not one for us thank you,' said Chapman. 'Definitely a major moral hazard.'</p>

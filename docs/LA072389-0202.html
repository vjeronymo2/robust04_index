			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT;  </P> <P> NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.  </P> <P> Museum Update -- A location near Pectin Reef, one of the county's richest  paleontological sites, looks like a likely candidate to become the permanent  home of the Museum of Natural History and Science, now housed in a former  elementary school in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> The marine fossil trove, off Moulton Parkway on Aliso Creek, is part of the  county's proposed Aliso/Wood Canyons Regional Park. A general development plan  for the 3,200-acre park includes a site for a museum building of 100,000 square  feet, according to Eric Jessen, the county's chief planner. The plan is about  90% complete and at least three months away from approval by the Board of  Supervisors, Jessen said.  </P> <P> "We're certainly carefully studying the county's proposal," said Dudley Varner,  the museum's executive director, who called the site "a highly desirable  location." Pectin Reef is the source of many specimens in the museum's marine  fossil collection, one of the biggest in the country.  </P> <P> A building of 100,000 square feet would allow the consolidation of exhibit,  storage and administrative space (a county warehouse is overflowing with  fossils). Finding a permanent museum site has occupied Varner since he took his  post in 1987. Dozens of sites have been considered, he said. The county's  Pectin Reef proposal will be discussed at a museum board meeting Wednesday.  </P> <P> Varner and the board are also searching for an interim site to house the museum  in the estimated five years it would take to build a permanent facility. They  are seeking a building with high ceilings that has not been highly  compartmentalized. Heading the list are several industrial buildings near John  Wayne Airport. An interim site would probably incorporate large-scale animated  dinosaurs and other creatures created by a local company called Dinamation.  </P> <P> At one time, Varner had hoped to find a permanent site near Upper Newport Bay,  but land prices and traffic considerations have apparently nixed that idea.  Earlier last week, county supervisors accepted 114 acres bordering the bay from  the Irvine Co. for a regional park. A $2.1-million interpretive center is  planned for the site, to be operated jointly by the county and the state, but  the donated property is too narrow to accommodate a large museum facility,  Jessen said.  </P> <P> Also, the Irvine Co. has ruled out construction on most of the land.  </P></p>

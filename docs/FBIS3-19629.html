Now a new phase has begun."    In a statement at Istanbul's airport, Cetin, who took part  in  the March 18 ceremony in Washington, described the agreement as  a very important step for the preservation of the territorial  integrity, sovereignty and independence of Bosnia.    "As a country which gained the confidence of both the Croats  and Bosnians, Turkey will continue its initiatives and efforts  towards finding an equitable solution to the problem. We also  believe that this first step should be reinforced by further  steps," he added.    He added that Turkey hoped the Serbian side to take part in  this agreement, respecting the independence, sovereignty and  integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Cetin, recalling that people were still being killed by  Serbs  in Maglaj, Bihac and Uskara, repeated Turkey's proposal to send  troops to the UN forces in the region.    "This agreement is one of the first test for the world after  the cold war and the opportunity has arisen to pass it within  legitimacy," he said.</p>

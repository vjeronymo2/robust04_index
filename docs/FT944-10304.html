			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Pounds 1/4 m pay-offs on offer as 700 health jobs go Some senior Department of Health civil servants will qualify for financial packages of up to Pounds 250,000 under proposals for job cuts announced yesterday. About 500 posts are to be abolished in the department's London offices and another 200 at the National Health Service executive headquarters in Leeds - a 21 per cent reduction in the number of staff responsible for the central administration of health and social services. Job losses will affect all levels of staff, including the most senior. Staff had been aware that jobs were to go since July, when the government published two reports proposing a more streamlined central structure now that the delivery of NHS services is managed locally. Although employees did not know the scale of the proposed job losses until announcements were made to meetings in London and Leeds yesterday, details of voluntary severance arrangements were outlined three weeks ago. The department said it had already received 200 serious inquiries about the scheme, which will remain open until January. Compulsory redundancies have not been ruled out if there are insufficient volunteers. From next April the department will be reorganised around the three main responsibilities of Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary - the NHS, local authority and voluntary social services, and public health. More flexible structures and more team working are planned. Mr Graham Hart, the department's permanent secretary, said the changes would lead to the central department doing 'only what must be done at the centre'. Other work would be cut out or devolved to local level. The job cuts, part of a wider Whitehall drive to reduce bureaucracy, are in addition to the shake-out in regional health authorities. About 1,500 regional posts have already gone, and a similar number are scheduled to be eliminated by 1996. A quarantine period will be applied to civil servants leaving the department or executive, restricting their ability to take on other health service jobs for 12 months.</p>

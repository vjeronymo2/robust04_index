			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TALKS ON U.S.-JAPAN AIR LINKS FAIL AS TOKYO TRIMS AMERICAN PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Talks to expand air links between the United States and Japan halted after  Tokyo cut in half a proposal Washington had found inadequate five months ago, a  U.S. negotiator said today.  </P> <P> "We were taken by surprise," said the negotiator, who requested anonymity.  Talks are scheduled to resume in July, he said.  </P> <P> U.S. and Japanese airlines want to expand service on the lucrative and busy  passenger and cargo air routes. Seven million passengers traveled between the  two countries in 1988 -- a 25% increase over the previous year -- and about a  quarter of all U.S.-Japan trade in goods moves by air, the official said.  </P> <P> In December, Washington proposed 16 new services for Japanese carriers and 13  new services for U.S. carriers, while Japan countered with 10 new lines for  Japanese carriers and six for U.S. carriers.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Japanese police today  arrested a member of a right-wing organization after he fired a  gun at the ceiling of a hotel lobby in an abortive attack on  former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the KYODO NEWS SERVICE  said today.    Hosokawa, who escaped unhurt, was on his way home from a  party at the Keio Plaza Hotel in central Tokyo marking the  establishment of the Tokyo chapter of the Japan New Party which  he heads.    Police identified the attacker as Masakatsu Nozoe, who is  52.  The shot missed the target when plain-clothes policemen slapped  the gunman on the hands as he held a revolver aimed at Hosokawa,  KYODO quoted witnesses as saying.    But police later quoted Nozoe as saying that initially he  was  aiming at Hosokawa, but then decided to fire at the ceiling, the  news agency said.    It also said the assailant later told police that he had  become upset with Hosokawa's apologies for Japan's invasion of  its Asian neighbors during World War II and with his economic  policies.    As soon as the attack occurred police officers subdued the  assailant while plain-clothes officers rushed the former premier  out of the hotel and into a waiting car.    A shaken Hosokawa reportedly expressed concern for his wife  as he was being escorted out of the hotel, saying, "Kayoko is  still there. Please..."    Hosokawa, who resigned last month over his dubious financial  dealings, has been threatened by rightist groups since he took  office last August because of his remarks condemning Japan's  wartime atrocities.</p>

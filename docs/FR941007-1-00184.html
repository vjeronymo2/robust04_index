			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.604(e)(4)_The Secretary proposes to allow a school no more than 45 days after the school's receipt of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a late disbursement of loan proceeds to deliver those loan proceeds to the borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 682.604(f)(1)_The Secretary proposes to change the requirement for counseling first-time borrowers. A school will not be required to administer initial counseling to a student who has already borrowed under the FFEL or Direct Loan Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.605 Determining the Date of a Student's Withdrawal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.605_The Secretary proposes to revise this section to clarify that a school must determine the date of a student's withdrawal by following the procedures in 34 CFR 668.22(i). The Secretary proposes to delete the provisions regarding leaves of absence. The Secretary's regulations now provide in &sect;668.22 that a student on a leave of absence is considered to have withdrawn for purposes of the refund calculation. Therefore, the Secretary believes that, for consistency, such a student should be considered withdrawn for all purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.606 Refund Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.606_The Secretary proposes to delete this section from the FFEL regulations. A school is required to follow the procedures in 34 CFR 668.22 regarding refund policies for all of the Federal Title IV Student Financial Assistance Programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.607 Payment of a Refund to a Lender  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.607(c)_The Secretary proposes to revise the timely payment requirement to require a school to pay a refund to the lender within 30 days after the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn under 34 CFR 668.22(i). This change is proposed in order to conform to existing General Provisions Regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Assessment of Costs and Benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere in this preamble under the heading  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal governments in the exercises of their governmental functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 2. Clarity of the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Executive Order 12866 requires each agency to write regulations that are easy to understand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary invites comments on how to make these proposed regulations easier to understand, including answers to questions such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the proposed regulations clearly stated? (2) Do the regulations contain technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity? (3) Does the format of the regulations (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce their clarity? Would the regulations be easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections? (A ``section'' is preceded by the symbol ``&sect;'' and a numbered heading; for example, &sect;682.200 Definitions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) (4) Is the description of the regulations in the ``Supplementary Information'' section of this preamble helpful in understanding the regulations? How could this description be more helpful in making the regulations easier to understand? (5) What else  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could the Department do to make the regulations easier to understand?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of any comments that concern how the Department could make these proposed regulations easier to understand should be sent to Stanley M. Cohen, Regulations Quality Officer, U.S. Department of Education, 600 Independence Avenue, S.W. (Room 5100, FB&hyph;10), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;2241.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the statute requires that the Secretary regulate certain actions that must be taken by various program participants, these requirements would not have a significant impact because they would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose minimal additional requirements to protect the Federal fiscal interest, as well as the interests of the borrowers under the programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 682.205, 682.602, 682.604, and 682.605 contain information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department will submit a copy of these proposed regulations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review.

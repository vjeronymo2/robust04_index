			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Uri Lubrani, coordinator of </F> government activities in Lebanon, by Hayim Zissowitz; place not  given -- live]    [Excerpt] [Zissowitz] Mr. Lubrani, in his speech in the  Knesset yesterday, the prime minister said Syria is still not  evincing enough openness and flexibility to permit a  breakthrough in the talks on the substance of peace. This also  relates to Hizballah activity, which Syria is allowing to  continue. What is Syria's policy in Lebanon?    [Lubrani] Syria undoubtedly regards Hizballah activity in  Lebanon as leverage for gaining advantages on its track.    [Zissowitz] A report in HA'ARETZ this morning speaks about a  joint Syrian-Lebanese military operation against Hizballah arms  caches in Ba'labakk.    [Lubrani] I can only say that from what we know, this  operation can be considered mere cosmetics. They are trying to  prove that they are doing something, but I know nothing about  such a thing in practice.    [Zissowitz] Are there any signs that Syria is trying to curb  Hizballah attacks against Israel?    [Lubrani] Occasionally, as a result of U.S. pressure and in  order to appease the United States, Syria attempts to curb  Hizballah, even if only for appearances sake. There have been  two such cases. During the last elections, there was a period  of one month without any serious Hizballah attacks. Recently,  in anticipation of the al-Asad-Clinton summit, complete calm was  restored. Syria can stop Hizballah attacks if it wants to.    [Zissowitz] What about the SLA's [South Lebanese Army]  operations? This organization suffered many casualties in  battles against Hizballah last weekend. Civilians were also  killed. Is the SLA's morale flagging?    [Lubrani] The SLA is undoubtedly facing a process of  attrition. Both Hizballah and the rejectionist organizations  are trying to undermine the SLA and the security zone. The SLA  is having a hard time dealing with this situation, but it is  continuing to function and is manning its posts. The SLA is our  spearhead in maintaining calm along our northern border.    [Zissowitz] Is there any truth to the reports that the SLA  is bitter over the fact that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is  limiting its ability to react to the terrorists' provocations?    [Lubrani] There is some truth to these reports. It is only  natural, however, that they would prefer to react much more  firmly to attacks on them. On the other hand, they know that  our actions are aimed at trying to preserve the understandings  we reached with the Syrians via the Americans. Most of the  time, they refrain from reacting, even when they are provoked to  retaliate. Sometimes such outbursts do occur, such as the  attack on Sidon last Friday.    [Zissowitz] There were reports of a massacre perpetrated by  the SLA in the village of 'Aramta.    [Lubrani] There was no such massacre. It was invented by  Lebanese and Syrian information circles, who turned Hizballah  attacks in 'Aramta -- which hit the civilian population  primarily -- into an SLA attack against the population of this  village. This is an outright lie.    [Zissowitz] Are you completely satisfied with continuing the  cooperation and coordination between the IDF and SLA?    [Lubrani] I have no doubt that the coordination and  cooperation will continue. There are easy periods and more  difficult periods. We have already been through such periods.  We must realize, however, that we are in the midst of a war of  attrition aimed not only at the SLA but at the IDF as well. The  SLA is bearing a very heavy load, and we must realize this fact  and deal with it accordingly. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Economy likely to slow next year, says Item Club The UK economy will slow next year with base rates unlikely to rise above 7 per cent, says an independent economic forecaster using the Treasury's model of the economy. The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club says in its forecast for the economy released today that the central scenario is for UK economic growth to slow to 2.75 per cent next year from more than 3.5 per cent this year. The forecast follows other recent signs of weakness in the economy including a 0.3 per cent fall in manufacturing output in August. Further signs of a slowing economy come today from consumer credit figures for August, released by the Finance and Leasing Association. The association says consumer credit in August rose 29 per cent on an annual basis to Pounds 1.89bn, a slower increase than in recent months. The association said that fear of higher interest rates, based on experience of rates rising to 15 per cent, was depressing consumer spending. Mr Paul Droop, chief economist at the Item Club, said consumer spending in 1995 would be restrained by the impact of higher interest rates on the housing market, lack of jobs growth, and tax increases.</p>

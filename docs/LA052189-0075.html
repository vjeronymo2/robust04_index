			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: THE RADIATORS;  </P> <P> "ZIG-ZAGGIN' THROUGH GHOSTLAND." EPIC **: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE  STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> New Orleans' second-favorite (to the Neville Brothers) sons attempt to spice up  the commercial ingredient in their white-soul/bar-band/blues gumbo, with  less-than-finger-lickin' results most of the time. Instead of moving toward the  elegant, contemporary blues of a Robert Cray or the fiery blues-rock of a Mason  Ruffner, the Radiators land facelessly smack dab in the middle of mainstream  rock. On the title tune the band locks into an infectious, rolling rhythm  worthy of a Crescent City street parade, and they turn in a solid version of  J.J. Jackson's 1966 hit "But It's Alright." The rest of the time the Radiators  sound more like a band you'd find in a Red Onion than Tipitina's. They'll be at  the Coach House on Wednesday, the Palace on Friday and the Ventura Theatre on  Saturday. RANDY LEWIS  </P></p>

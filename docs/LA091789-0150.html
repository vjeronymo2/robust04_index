			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ILLNESS AND THE CURE  </P> <P> Nancy Mairs' review of Anne Stevenson's "Bitter Fame: A Life of Sylvia Plath"  (Book Review, Aug. 20) brought to mind the tragic and yet successful life of  the late Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Theodore Roethke (1908-1963). Subject to  periodic attacks of manic depression, Roethke fought to overcome his possibly  inherited and gene-based disease and to use the experiences of the attacks in  his writings. As the biographer Allan Seager wrote: "The very qualities that  made Ted a poet seem to have been the ones that made him ill -- his sensitivity  and his energy."  </P> <P> KENNETH LLOYD LARSON  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES  </P></p>

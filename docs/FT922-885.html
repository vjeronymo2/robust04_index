			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Rabin calls for partners committed to peace MR YITZHAK RABIN, Israel's prime minister-elect, yesterday capitalised on the Labour party's triumphant return to power in the country's election on Tuesday by calling for coalition partners who share his commitment to Middle East peace talks. The US yesterday pushed for a speedy resumption of the peace talks, while most Arab and Palestinian leaders welcomed Mr Rabin's victory. However, Jewish settlers, still building in occupied Arab lands, vowed yesterday to block Mr Rabin's plans for Palestinian autonomy within nine months. 'We are against autonomy in the strongest of terms. It is a precursor to a Palestinian state,' said settler spokesman Bob Lang. 'We will fight by every democratic means possible that it should never happen.' Labour's win over Mr Yitzhak Shamir's Likud party left Mr Rabin, premier in the mid-1970s, in a commanding position with 45 seats against Likud's 32. With the support of Labour's traditional small party allies in the Knesset (parliament) he found himself in the unexpected position of leading a majority government without having to forge costly deals. Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, said he hoped the next round of bilateral peace talks would take place 'just as soon as it is conveniently possible in the aftermath of the formation of a new government'. The last round ended in Washington in April. Although the Arab and Israeli participants have agreed to hold the next round in Rome, no date has yet been fixed. The Likud was consigned to opposition for the first time since 1977, unless it was prepared to join Mr Rabin as a junior partner on Labour's terms. The Labour leader has often signalled that he favoured an alliance with Likud, but the vanquished party showed little sign of accepting what would be a humiliating deal. Likud ministers and officials went to ground yesterday, offering almost no comment to the media on the election. Earlier, Mr Shamir hinted that he might soon retire, saying he was near the end of his 'personal road'. Egypt said the result could give a 'strong push to peace efforts and the reaping of a golden opportunity to achieve historic reconciliation between Israel and the Arabs'. Mr Yassir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, said Israelis had voted 'against war and the terrorism of Shamir'. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian negotiating team, said she hoped Mr Rabin would move quickly to fulfil his pledge to reach a speedy interim settlement allowing Palestinian autonomy in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Mr Rabin did move quickly to revive an issue which earlier this year caused an unprecedented rift between Israel and the US. He said he hoped his willingness to curb Jewish settlements in the occupied territories would prompt the US to release Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees Israel wants to help it finance the absorption of more than 300,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union. However, Mr Rabin said he was not prepared to freeze all settlements, the price Washington had demanded for the loan aid. Mr Baker said it was better 'not to speculate or engage in questions like (the loan guarantees)' until a new Israeli government had actually been formed.

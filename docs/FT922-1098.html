			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Meeting over transfer of care SENIOR MINISTERS met at Downing Street yesterday to try to resolve the difficulties over the planned transfer of responsibility for community care from the government to local authorities. At a discussion chaired by Mr John Major, ministers from the health, social security and environment departments agreed to press ahead with the aim of making the transfer as intended in April next year. Funding problems had led to suggestions from some ministers that the transfer should be delayed again, or even postponed to allow an alternative policy to be developed.</p>

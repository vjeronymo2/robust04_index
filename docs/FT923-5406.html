			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Ecu market close to collapse as union hopes fade THE ECU bond market, built on the assumption of European monetary union, appears to be close to collapse, after prices dived again and liquidity evaporated last week. A series of opinion polls showing that a majority of French voters are preparing to reject the Maastricht treaty on European monetary and political union in this month's referendum sent a further shock wave through the market, which was still reeling from the blow delivered by Denmark's rejection of the treaty on June 2. 'The market is effectively closed,' said one marketmaker, after attempts to revive liquidity by resetting marketmaking guidelines failed. The price of the Paribas 10-year Ecu bond index dropped to 97.64 late last week, from 100.13 the previous week. Ecu bonds issued by France and the UK held up better than most, while Italy's bonds due 2011 again bore the brunt of selling, dropping from more than six points to 86.30 in the course of last week. The Italian issue, now yielding 11 per cent, is starting to look cheap, in terms of relative value. But the market has become so illiquid, that such valuations have lost much of their significance. 'The downside for the Ecu market at this point is no longer value but liquidity,' one trader said. 'Even if the bonds theoretically hold value, the fact that it is impossible to sell paper means that investors will not buy.' Consequently, it is difficult to see where the floor for the market lies. Already, the yield of the Paribas 10-year index stands at 9.77 per cent, 50 basis points more than the theoretical yield compiled from the yields of the component currencies. Prior to last week's sell-off, the margin was around 20 basis points. 'Ecu bonds are offering tremendous value, but there is always the risk that they will offer even better value next week,' said Mr Bob Tyley, head of bond analysis at Paribas. As fund managers reassess their portfolios ahead of the French referendum, there is little incentive to hold Ecu bonds. If the French vote yes on September 20, the Ecu bond market is undoubtedly set to rally. But if they vote no, it is likely to be worse hit than other markets. Given the degree of political uncertainty surrounding the referendum, few fund managers want to take a strong view on the outcome. 'Some of the higher-yielding European markets, like Italy and Spain, offer better prospects,' according to Mr Michael Burke, bond analyst at Yamaichi International. While they would suffer from a no vote, the lira and peseta will still be viable currencies without Maastricht, while the Ecu would no longer be an attractive investment for institutional investors, if European monetary union is abandoned. In the case of a no vote, a realignment of the Exchange Rate Mechanism is seen as an increasingly likely prospect. Without the pull of monetary union, the strains within the ERM, many economists believe, would become intolerable. Here too, the Ecu bond market stands to pay a high price. Further, if the French vote yes by only a narrow margin, a mood of uncertainty could continue to depress bond markets at least until the end of the year, when other countries, such as the UK and Germany, have ratified the treaty. There are also nuances of reaction within the Ecu bond market. 'The two-tier structure of the Ecu bond market is becoming more distinct, reflecting the advances for the no vote over the last week,' said Mr Steve Major, bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais. Mr Major places issues by France, the UK, Spain, Denmark and Belgium in the top tier, since these issues will receive official government support, even in the case of a no vote. The lower tier consists of less liquid state-backed agency, sovereign and corporate issues. 'A yes will lead to outperformance by the recently out of favour tier-2 group but a no will favour the more liquid tier-1,' according to Mr Major. Not all potential sellers of Ecu bonds have been able to unload their stock, either because of the market's illiquidity or because they do not want to realise losses. But any attempt at a rally has been, and will continue to be, used by asset allocators as a selling opportunity. Further, the problems experienced by investors in offloading paper will not be forgotten soon. Until a couple of years ago, institutional investors eschewed the Ecu bond market, which was dominated by retail investors. Then, the sponsorship of the market by European governments, in the form of large Ecu borrowing programmes - coupled with extensive marketing by banks - drew them in. Now that their claims for the market have collapsed, how far should the responsibilities of market participants go, and can they be blamed for the current disarray? Certainly, the conduct of marketmakers has not been a pretty sight. For the last two years, banks and securities houses have been falling over each other to gain marketmaker status in the sector, keen to gain a foothold in what could become Europe's bond market. Since the Danish vote on June 2, the rush for the doors has been equally fierce. Although there are nominally 44 marketmakers recognised by the International Securities Market Association, the self-regulating body which oversees the market, there have never been more than a dozen serious players. By the end of last week, no one was actually making a market. A one-day suspension of marketmaking in July, followed by a resetting of marketmaking guidelines had already failed to reinject liquidity. Last week, as liquidity diminished still further, a group of marketmakers led by Paribas attempted to take matters into their own hands by again resetting spread and size guidelines, in the hope of encouraging dealers to make prices. Although a group of four marketmakers did make prices for a few hours on Friday, the initiative failed, and market participants now seem resigned to an almost total loss of liquidity at least until the referendum. Given the surplus of sellers and non-existence of buyers, it is difficult to see how the banks could remedy the situation. 'There is Ecu100bn of bonds outstanding in the market. The street cannot be expected to buy the whole market back,' one trader argued. Little comfort, however, for the numerous institutional investors who bought on the sales pitch that Ecu Eurobonds issued by European states were quasi-government bonds, with comparable liquidity.</p>

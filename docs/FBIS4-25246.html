			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 7 Jun (XINHUA) -- The People's Bank of  China, Agricultural Bank, and Industrial and Commercial Bank  recently held a meeting in Beijing to report on the work of  supplying funds for the purchase of summer grain and oil-bearing  crops. Speaking at the meeting, Vice President of the People's  Bank of China Dai Xianglong urged that all banks and relevant  departments should prepare sufficient funds for the purchase of  summer grain and oil-bearing crops in a timely manner so that  farmers will not be given "IOU's."    Dai Xianglong called on all localities to seriously  implement  the responsibility system of supplying funds for the purchase of  summer grain and oil-bearing crops. Under the unified  leadership of governments at all levels, banks and relevant  departments should ensure funds for the purchase of summer grain  and oil-bearing crops. All branches of the People's Bank of  China should supervise the supply of money in addition to  coordinating the work of supplying purchasing funds. Before the  end of June the supply and management of funds for the purchase  of grain and oil-bearing crops will be the responsibility of the  Agricultural Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank. Beginning  1 July, the Agricultural Bank will undertake sole responsibility  for supply and management.    Dai Xianglong stressed: To ensure the needs for purchasing  funds, all banks should strengthen unified management and ensure  the orderly use of funds. The branches of specialized banks  should ensure payment, ensure funds for the purchase of grain  and oil-bearing crops in various localities, and grant other  loans in accordance with plans and policies and the amount of  available capital. Should there be a surplus of funds, it  should be used under the unified management of banks of a higher  level. He said: Serious efforts should be made to strengthen  management to ensure the prompt supply of funds for the purchase  of grain and oil-bearing crops and to prevent the diversion of  purchasing funds for other purposes. Specialized banks and  their branches, and the People's Bank should ensure their funds  and short-term loans are first used for payment and purchasing  of grain and oil-bearing crops. The People's Bank will allocate  an additional sum of 6 billion yuan to the Agricultural Bank to  be used for purchasing farm and sideline products.    Dai Xianglong pointed out: It is necessary to strengthen  control over the size of purchasing funds. When funds for the  purchase of state-controlled farm and sideline products such as  grain and oil-bearing crops are insufficient, purchasing  authorities may obtain loans first and report the borrowing to  the state later. He also stressed: It is necessary to  strengthen the management of markets for grain and oil-bearing  crops in coordination with relevant departments by applying the  means of credit and account settlement. Granting loans to  support rush purchasing in other localities and selling and  buying grain and oil-bearing crops outside the prescribed limits  must be strictly prohibited.    In conclusion, Dai Xianglong urged all banks to do a good  job  in supplying and managing funds for the purchase of summer grain  and oil-bearing crops, and to satisfy the farmers by avoiding  the practice of writing "IOU'S" due a shortage of purchasing  funds.</p>

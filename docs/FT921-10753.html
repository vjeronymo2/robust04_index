			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Chilean 'miracle-makers' for hire: Santiago's economic gurus are in demand MEET Chile's latest non-traditional export: the globe-trotting economic consultant. With much of Latin America and eastern Europe seeking to emulate Chile's export-driven success, Chilean economists have never been in such wide demand. Confident, multi-lingual, generally US-trained and with a record of public service, they are advising countries which are beginning to tackle economic reforms on everything from debt management to how to set up private pension funds. Most, but not all, are former luminaries of the 1973-1990 military regime. They include Mr Hernan Buchi, finance minister between 1985 and 1989 and acknowledged architect of the Chilean 'economic miracle'; Mr Hernan Somerville, chief debt negotiator during the difficult years following the 1982 debt crisis; and Mr Jose Pinera, a former mining and labour minister who reformed the country's social security system. Chile boasts an impressive record of firsts: it was ahead of Mrs Margaret Thatcher in the privatisation crusade; it pioneered debt-for-equity swaps as a way of retiring part of its Dollars 19bn foreign debt; its private pension fund system, now 10 years old, manages more than Dollars 9bn-worth of assets and has been a key factor in the development of Chile's capital markets. Chile is also the only country in the developing world that has an independent central bank. 'Chile has amassed a huge store of knowledge,' says Mr Somerville. At a time when other Latin American debtors were using confrontational tactics against their creditor banks, Mr Somerville was bitterly criticised for sticking to International Monetary Fund targets and religiously servicing Chile's debt. 'Ours was a very lonely position,' he recalls, 'but by 1988 pragmatism had begun to reign. The old rhetoric was dead.' The privatisation of Chile's steel, electricity, telecommunications, airlines, nitrates, sugar, and banking sectors have attracted streams of interested parties from around the globe. The Chilean experience is seen as more relevant to developing countries than the sale of state companies in Britain, which already had institutional investors and a sophisticated capital market. What Mr Somerville emphasises when he talks about privatisations abroad is that Chile sold well-run companies, with proper balance sheets and real investment plans. 'Before privatisation, Chile redefined the whole concept of how you run public sector companies. They learned to compete in an open market without subsidies,' he says. In many countries, it is not a company that is being sold, just assets. Mr Buchi's services are in such wide demand that he only spends two weeks a month in Chile. He has advised Czechoslovakia on privatisation, Paraguay on tax reform, Brazil on pension systems, Mexico on the planned sell-off of the electricity sector and Poland on bankrupt state banks. He writes a column in the Buenos Aires financial daily El Cronista Comercial. His think-tank, the Institute for Liberty and Development, recently invited 25 Soviet economists for a seminar on the Chilean economic model. During his brief sojourns in Chile, Mr Buchi never loses an opportunity to criticise the present government's economic policies. Some say this is sour grapes, for Mr Buchi has never quite recovered from the blow of losing the 1989 presidential election to Mr Patricio Aylwin. Others believe Mr Buchi, who jogs 10km a day, is in training for the next presidential marathon in 1993. Mr Buchi this year joined the extreme-right Union of Independent Democrats, which is carefully grooming his new public image. His latest political stunt was to leap up the 12 flights of stairs to his former offices in the Finance Ministry for a press conference in which he blamed the present incumbent, Mr Alejandro Foxley, of mismanaging public spending and causing a 'loss of dynamism' in the Chilean economy. Mr Foxley dismissed this as political agit-prop. The government accounts are balanced, inflation is falling and the economy is on target to grow by 5 per cent this year, he said. The toughest question these former technocrats of the military regime must answer when abroad is whether the strategies they pursued can be implemented in a democracy. Most elected governments would be unable to withstand a 15 per cent contraction of GDP and unemployment rates of more than 30 per cent that afflicted Chile in the early 1980s. Critics of the Chilean model also argue that it has been unsuccessful in redistributing wealth. An estimated 5m Chileans, almost 40 per cent of the population, live below the poverty line. Mr Pinera says: 'What happened in Chile was not essentially the product of an authoritarian regime. What we had was a cohesive team of economists who sold the free-market model to the military.' Unlike other technocrats, Mr Pinera does not shy away from publicity or television cameras. Rather, he used television extensively to popularise his plans to privatise the Chilean pension fund system. Drawing on his advice, Peru and Argentina recently announced plans to introduce private pension schemes of their own. Mr Pinera believes the Chilean experience was the key to the change in economic thinking in Latin America.</p>

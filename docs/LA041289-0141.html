			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SOCIAL SECURITY CHIEF CHALLENGED  </P> <P> Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.) urged an investigation today into the verification  for banks and credit unions of Social Security numbers, which he called the  "largest breach of privacy in the history" of Social Security .  </P> <P> In a letter to Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of health, education and welfare,  Pryor requested the inquiry by the HHS inspector general into the legality of  the transactions and into the competence and credibility of its chief, Dorcas  Hardy.  </P> <P> Pryor's demand for an investigation stemmed from a hearing earlier this week by  the Senate Aging Committee, which he heads, and at which Hardy, the veteran  head of the Social Security Administration, testified.  </P> <P> Under the program, according to Pryor's investigation, the Social Security  agency has verified from its magnetic tapes the Social Security numbers listed  by applicants at banks and credit bureaus.  </P> <P> "I was extremely concerned that the commissioner apparently had little  knowledge of the many disclosures that have been taking place at SSA," Pryor  said. "Her testimony raised serious questions about either her competence or  her credibility on this issue."  </P></p>

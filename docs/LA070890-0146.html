			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAYA VISTA DEVELOPERS PLAN PUBLIC WORKSHOPS  </P> <P> In a continuing effort to reach out to the community and eliminate any  potential roadblocks, the developer of the multibillion-dollar Playa Vista  project will hold a series of public workshops this week to discuss the impact  of the planned city-within-a-city.  </P> <P> The first of the evening meetings, to be held Monday, will focus on  transportation issues associated with the huge development envisioned for the  area between Marina del Rey and Westchester Bluffs.  </P> <P> The session will examine the traffic, air quality and noise impacts of the vast  office, residential, retail, marina and hotel complex -- one of the largest  developments in Los Angeles history.  </P> <P> Representatives of Maguire Thomas Partners, developers of Playa Vista, will  discuss the importance of achieving a balance between the number of jobs and  housing units to reduce commuting and minimize air pollution.  </P> <P> Tuesday's session will deal with Maguire Thomas' specific plans for development  for the property, including land use and aesthetic issues, public services,  grading and geological questions.  </P> <P> The session on Wednesday evening will deal with natural, biological and  cultural issues, including restoration of the Ballona Wetlands, archeology,  water quality, energy and public works.  </P> <P> All of the sessions will be held at the Airport Marina Hotel, 86O1 Lincoln  Blvd., Westchester, beginning at 7 p.m.  </P> <P> Senior partner Nelson C. Rising said in an interview last week that the  workshops are intended to offer the public an opportunity to address issues of  concern early in the planning process. The meetings are the latest in a series  of public sessions that began after Maguire Thomas took over the 887-acre  project last year.  </P> <P> An environmental impact report is now being prepared on Maguire Thomas' plans  for the property. Although the evening meetings are separate from that effort,  Rising said Maguire Thomas wants to get the public's thoughts "now rather than  waiting until the environmental impact report is completed."  </P> <P> Rising has said previously that early identification of the issues will  expedite Maguire Thomas' efforts to win approval for the development.  </P> <P> Intense opposition from environmentalists and residents of surrounding areas  frustrated efforts by the Summa Corp. to develop a high-rise community on the  land, which stretches nearly three miles inland from the Pacific Ocean to the  San Diego Freeway. The property had been owned by industrialist Howard Hughes  since the 1940s and was part of his estate.  </P> <P> After taking over, Maguire Thomas abandoned Summa's design. The new plans call  for a mid-rise community with 5 million square feet of offices, 11,750  apartment and condominium units, 2,400 hotel rooms, 720,000 square feet of  retail space and a small-craft marina with 750 boat slips.  </P></p>

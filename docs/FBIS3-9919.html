			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 Feb (NA) -- Felipe Sola,  agriculture, livestock, and fishing secretary, today stated that  the government "will not remain indifferent to the outrage"  caused by the Mexican Government's decision to forbid the import  of some Argentine agricultural products.    Sola has asked the Foreign Ministry to "urgently" convey a  protest to the Mexican Government, and to demand that the  measure be revoked.    On 16 February the Mexican Agriculture and Hydraulic  Resources Secretariat banished the import of rice, wheat,  garlic, and peanuts from Argentina for health reasons, although  this decision was not officially reported to Buenos Aires.    In a communique Sola stated: "We are confronting a serious  nontariff restriction to commerce, which sets a very bad  precedent for future commercial relations."    He said: "The argument of plagues and diseases is nothing  new for Argentina, and the measure is technically groundless  considering that most of them also affect Mexico."    He added: "Mexico imports these products from other  countries such as the United States, which is also stricken by  the same plagues."    Sola believes that "the Mexican Agricultural Secretariat's  attitude is dishonest" and added: "I cannot understand either  the measure or its implementation, as under the same criteria  Mexico should have already suspended the import of a great  number of products from the United States."    He noted that should this measure persist, the export of  rice, peanuts, and garlic projected for this year will be harmed.    The measure worsens the situation for wheat because of the  U.S. and Canadian decision to subsidize its sales.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Imre Szerekes, deputy chairman of the </F> Hungarian Socialist Party, by Grzegorz Lubczyk; place and date  not given: "Coalition Is Not a Married Couple"]    [Text] [Lubczyk] Why did the Socialists receive so many  votes in the first round of Hungarian parliamentary elections  (on 8 May)? Was it because Hungarians support your program so  much, or rather because they wanted to express their opposition  to the activities of the present coalition?    [Szekeres] I think that there were three reasons for this  outcome. First, vast numbers of people were indeed dissatisfied  with the government's policy and style thus far. Second, the  liberal forces were not able to offer an appropriate alternative  to the coalition. And third, the four years that have passed  were enough for the people not only to become familiar with our  program -- they observed the behavior and approach of the party  in various situations -- but they knew what they could expect  from the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. We offered numerous  examples showing that we have many experts at our disposal. I  believe that we scored additional points for the degree of  openness we presented.    [Lubczyk] At news conferences both you -- in the absence of  Gyula Horn, who is in the hospital, you are acting as the  party's number one man -- and your colleagues in the leadership  of the MSZP state that you stand a good chance of forming the  next government.    [Szekeres] We are realists and pragmatists. When we  consider the possibility of forming a coalition with the Free  Democrats, we know what the liberals can achieve, particularly  in the area that is most important to the country: in the  economy. On many issues our programs are convergent or similar.  We would like to govern the country in a style different from  the style presented by the current coalition with the Democratic  Forum. We believe that this should be done through dialogue with  the people; we also think that the people should be respected.  Among our people, there are still latent forces, which are  enormous. They must only be liberated and utilized in the  interest of the country, which is in a crisis.    [Lubczyk] What then, is most important in the economy?    [Szekeres] Our fundamental goal is to stimulate and boost  production, curb inflation, create new jobs, and consistently  decrease the number of unemployed people. We also want to  change the approach to the terrible social conditions in which  considerable numbers of our people live, especially elderly  persons.    [Lubczyk] What about foreign policy?    [Szekeres] Further integration with West Europe, tightening  cooperation with our closest neighbors, and caring about the  fate of the Hungarian minority abroad.    [Lubczyk] Do you include Poland among your neighbors?    [Szekeres] Unfortunately, we do not have a common border;  however, I would like to emphasize that we really want to have  good relations with your country.    [Lubczyk] In an interview with RZECZPOSPOLITA, Ivan Peto,  leader of the "Free Democrats," did not rule out the possibility  of entering into a coalition with you. However, he pointed to  numerous differences in your two programs, which means that  negotiations might be rather difficult.    [Szekeres] Well, we are different parties and so there must  be differences. We will have experts hold interparty  discussions and, if need be, we will look for compromises. We  have set an initial period of six months to reach an agreement  and work out a program of cooperation that I believe would be  good and feasible.    [Lubczyk] Mathematical calculations suggest that you might  form the new government alone. Do you not want to do that?    [Szekeres] Only a coalition guarantees a stable and strong  government. Cooperation with the "Free Democrats" would broaden  the social support for our future undertakings. If we do not  find a partner or partners, we will have to take on this  difficult task alone. I do not think, however, that we will be  doing this alone.    [Lubczyk] You said "partners." Who else would you take into  consideration?    [Szekeres] Certainly the parties of the present coalition  are out of the question, but we have not abandoned the  Federation of Young Democrats, "Fidesz."    [Lubczyk] Despite the fact that you were so fiercely  attacked by their leader, Viktor Orban?    [Szekeres] You know, a coalition is not a married couple.    [Lubczyk] You are probably the only group which did not put  forward its own candidate for prime minister before the  elections.    [Szekeres] And we did the right thing. We wanted to show  that what we wanted was not concrete posts and perches. When  the final results of the elections are known, we will do this  without such great emotions.    [Lubczyk] I have come across opinions among many Hungarians  that a very good candidate, who might be acceptable for many  parties, would be Miklos Nemeth.    [Szekeres] Nemeth is indeed enjoying great popularity in  Hungary. In January, we discussed with him his participation in  the elections. He said then that his contract with the European  Bank for Reconstruction and Development would expire in the  summer of 1995 and that he would not like to break it. We  believe that after that he will take part in the political life  of the country once again.    [Lubczyk] However, today the situation is different than the  situation in January. If the MSZP Congress asked him to do so,  I do not think he would refuse. I know that he came from London  and cast his vote in Budapest.    [Szekeres] I have not spoken to him. Until the second round  of elections is complete, we will not discuss the issue of a  possible candidate for prime minister.    [Lubczyk] Your voters also mention Laslo Bekesi and Gyula  Horn.    [Szekeres] Really, no decisions on this issue have been  made.    [Lubczyk] You often say that your party is a "pragmatic  party, without an ideology." How would you briefly characterize  the MSZP?    [Szekeres] This is the correct name for what we are doing.  We are living in a crucible of transformations, we are  arranging things anew, as it were. Today it is a mistake to  create an ideology that one must adjust to at a later time. I  believe that a party such as ours should tread firmly on the  ground, should be close to the problems of our people, should  try to resolve them, so as to make this difficult life easier.  Of course, we call ourselves a socialist party because we are  striving for social justice. We want to be with those whose  lives are difficult; we want to fight for them.    [Lubczyk] The name of your party includes the word  "socialist." What is your understanding of the word?    [Szekeres] Solidarity with the people who -- as they say --  live from the work of their hands, fair distribution of duties,  and the creation of equal opportunities.</p>

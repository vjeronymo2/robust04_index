			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Pachegina: "Despondent Russians Want To </F> Leave Chechnya, but Neither Dudayev nor Yeltsin Can Guarantee  Their Future"]    [Text] Republic government agencies have no statistics on  the migration of the Russian population of Chechnya, including  Cossacks, just as they lacked these figures two years ago.  According to officials, and these statements seem reliable, this  is not a mass "exodus." The people who make up the  Russian-speaking population of the republic today, according to  Groznyy's self-assured reports, are in complete agreement with  the official aim of building a sovereign Chechen state. The  "loyalty" of the Russian minority in Chechnya, however, seems  more comparable to the submissive acceptance of circumstances  than a conscious choice. A sociological survey conducted in  Groznyy in December on a semi-legal basis by researchers from  the Russian Academy of Sciences (a group from the academy  Institute of Sociopolitical Research was driven out of Chechnya  two years ago) indicated that 74 percent of the Russians,  including Cossacks, wanted to leave sovereign Chechnya. After  they had described the Russian Federation leadership's efforts  to protect the rights of Russians in the republics of the  Northern Caucasus as inadequate (an opinion expressed by 94  percent of the respondents), 73 percent of the Russians said  that in spite of the obvious, in their opinion, increase in  interethnic friction in the republic, they could not afford to  move and to settle down in today's federation without  considerable help from the government and public organizations  in Russia.    The recent campaign for the protection of the civil rights  of  the "Russian Caucasians" oppressed by Moscow officials virtually  eclipsed the long petition Russians from Chechnya had sent to  the Russian Federation president, chairman of the government,  and heads of kray and oblast administrations. There has been no  effective response yet to the petition with its 56-page  supplement, citing cases in which Russians were the victims of  physical assaults and harassment in 1992 and 1993 in Chechnya.  Its authors are convinced, however, that the Chechen  leadership's policy toward the Russian minority is intended to  "drive out the Russians and Cossacks so that Russian territory  can be taken over by Chechnya." Reminding the president of  Russia that they were ineligible to vote in elections to the  Federation Council and to participate in the discussion of the  draft RF Constitution, the "former" citizens of the "former"  Chechen-Ingush Republic reported that, in contrast to the  Chechens living in Moscow and St. Petersburg and in Rostov,  Tver, Volgograd, Novgorod, Astrakhan, and Orel oblasts,  Stavropol Kray, and other regions, who are endowed with the same  rights as citizens of Russia, they are not receiving wages,  pensions, and benefits, were left out of the "voucherization"  process, are not participating in the privatization of state  property, and so forth. They were the first to be affected by  the paralysis of industrial production in the republic. The  "breadwinners" of Russian families--specialists--have lost their  jobs. Teachers and physicians are being ousted from their  position by their more fortunate Chechen colleagues (according  to the sociological survey conducted by the Sociopolitical  Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 55  percent of the respondents in Groznyy reported the loss of  administrative or prestigious positions on ethnic grounds).  Russians are the main target of criminals in Chechnya: The  authors of the petition informed the Russian president that they  live in "constant fear" of thefts, violence, abductions,  including the kidnapping of children, forcible eviction from  apartments and private homes, and the seizure of private plots  and motor vehicles. Although the crime rate in the republic is  so high that President Dudayev even announced a special campaign  to fight crime, Russians are unlikely to enjoy stronger legal  protection at the end of the Chechen campaign. Republic  officials have admitted that the 80-90 felonies a week (this is  the official crime statistic for Chechnya) already require  military intervention.    The uncertain relationship between Russia and Chechnya also  precludes the protection of the Russian minority by the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has not received any  "instructions from above" on these matters.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA learned that the Federal Migration  Service of the Russian Federation is still the only agency in  Russia from which the Russians from Chechnya can expect advice  or assistance. According to the FMS staff, the service will  provide Russians with a guaranteed address of a new place of  residence and employment in any part of the country. A Moscow  residence permit could be difficult to obtain unless the new  arrival from Chechnya has relatives in Moscow, but even this  problem has a solution: According to the information of the FMS,  a residence permit for the capital of Russia can be purchased.  In view of the fact that the average wage of civil servants in  Chechnya in dollars amounts to only 6-8 "greenbacks," however,  this is a largely theoretical possibility for the Russians from  Chechnya.</p>

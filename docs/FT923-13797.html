			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Letter: Disturbing Sir, Sir Leon Brittan (Personal View, July 1) would like to find a way to reassure the Danes that the Community is not a centralising juggernaut. What disturbs many Danes is that only the Commission can suggest new legislation. In matters of importance to Denmark - for example, violation of fishing rights - the Commission should introduce into the Community system any legislation that the Danish Folketing might wish to put forward. Christian Estrup, M &amp; A Consultant, 8370 Hadsten, Denmark</p>

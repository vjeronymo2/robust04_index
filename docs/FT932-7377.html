			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: Japan constructors hit by weak demand JAPAN'S leading construction companies forecast sharply lower profits this year, expecting that the fall in private orders would outweigh the new contracts arising from a planned expansion of public works spending. Apart from weak orders, several companies were bruised by their own financial exposure to projects. Shimizu reported a 56.5 per cent fall in net profit after writing off losses of Y75.5bn (Dollars 638m) related to its involvement in developments in the UK and Australia. The company said further write-offs would be necessary this year for US projects, and net profit was expected to be halved again to Y10bn. Shimizu was forced to sell short-term holdings of stocks, whose book value fell from Y46.7bn in March last year to Y6.2bn at the close of the year. Sales last year at Shimizu were 1.8 per cent higher at Y2,168bn, although orders were down 19.9 per cent. Most Japanese contractors are suffering because of weak demand for new commercial buildings and a continuing fall in corporate capital spending. At Kajima, pre-tax profit fell 29 per cent to Y87.9bn, which it blamed on a slowing of orders for office buildings and an increased interest burden. There is still an excess of office space in Tokyo and Osaka, where rents fell almost 20 per cent last year, making developers wary of launching projects. A similar fall is expected this year at Taisei, which managed a 4.8 per cent increase in pre-tax profit last year to Y101bn on a 15.3 per cent increase in sales to Y1,980bn. Orders last year were down 20 per cent, and the company expects another 4 per cent decline this year. However, Obayashi is expecting 6 per cent growth in pre-tax profit to Y52bn after a 7 per cent fall to Y49bn in the year just ended. Orders were 19 per cent lower and sales were 0.8 per cent higher at Y1,519bn.</p>

The agencies believe that the revised proposal, which entails a series of examiner decisions in reliance on detailed data concerning an institution's actual lending, service and investment performance, would provide the proper balance between objective analysis and subjective judgment. In order to minimize unnecessary subjectivity, the agencies have attempted to provide more guidance in the revised proposal as to the standards that examiners would apply to make the required judgments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to identifying the data that would form the basis for their performance analysis, the information that would provide the background assessment context, and the criteria that would guide the assessments, the agencies have proposed detailed performance rating profiles for each rating level of the lending, service, and investment tests. An institution's performance need not fit every performance aspect of the typical profile in order to receive a certain rating. Exceptionally strong performance on some aspects can compensate for weak performance on others. However, the institution would receive a rating which is generally consistent with the institution's overall performance on the various aspects of the profile.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The December proposal based its presumptive ratings on comparative terms, for example whether an institution's qualified investments were significant as compared to its capital, or whether an insignificant percentage of an institution's branches were located in or readily accessible to low- and moderate-income geographies in the institution's service area. While many comments stated that these terms should be further defined, few  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters, despite a specific request in the December proposal, actually suggested what these definitions should be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ratings profiles in the current proposal continue to use comparative terms, such as excellent, significant, and poor, without further specification. Many comments agreed that the mechanical application of numerical ratios would not foster fair and appropriate CRA assessments. The agencies continue to believe, given the wide diversity of institutions and communities, that it is inadvisable to provide such specific numerical ranges or ratios. The agencies expect the current proposal to increase the consistency and clarity of the examination process. By identifying a set of performance-based assessment criteria, and expanding the objective performance data available to examinations, institutions and the public will be better able to evaluate the basis on which examiner judgments are made. In addition, by providing more detailed profiles that involve several criteria, assessment under the current proposal will not turn on the evaluation of a single factor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised proposal also modifies the lending and service tests for retail institutions to emphasize the importance of community development activities in the assessments of performance under those tests. In addition, the revised proposal replaces the investment test with a community development test for wholesale or limited purpose institutions. The proposal incorporates into this community development test both community development lending and community development services in addition to qualified investments. Therefore, under the revised proposal, wholesale or limited purpose institutions would be subject only to the community development test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised proposal would reduce data reporting burdens by streamlining reporting requirements to coincide more closely with existing requirements and eliminating unnecessary reporting. The one significant new data reporting requirement would be that small business and small farm loan data reported to the agencies would include information on the race and gender of small business and farm borrowers to respond to concerns that the December proposal did not give enough weight to the fair lending aspect of an institution's CRA performance. This concern is also reflected in the revision of the provisions regarding consideration of illegal discrimination to conform them more closely to existing regulatory language.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

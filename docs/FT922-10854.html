			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: EIT lifts final dividend to reflect inflation target EDINBURGH Investment Trust yesterday announced a 5.1 per cent increase in its final dividend to 5.2p, despite a 3.8 per cent fall in net assets per share over the year to March 31. Mr Ian Massie, fund manager, said the trust's long term policy was to increase dividends faster than inflation. He was confident about the outlook for the economy. Portfolio performance lagged behind the FT-A All-Share index, which fell 1.8 per cent during the year. Mr Massie said the cyclical sectors in which the trust had invested had shown an improved performance since the general election. At the end of March, the geographical split of assets was as follows: UK (61.2 per cent); North America (10.7 per cent); Europe (13.9 per cent); Japan (9.4 per cent); other Far East (5.4 per cent). Net assets per share at end-March were Pounds 745.8m, equivalent to 253.8p per share, against an adjusted 263.8p at end-March 1991. The final dividend increases the total to 8.05p (7.7p), payable from earnings of 8.19p (8.17p) per share.</p>

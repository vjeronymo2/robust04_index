			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- President Alberto  Fujimori of the Republic of Peru said here today that Peru  attaches much importance to its ties with Asia, and China in  particular.    China's endeavor to build a socialist market economy has  yielded great success, the president said a press conference  here today.    He noted that China is not only one of Peru's most important  trade partners, but also its third largest foreign investor.    The current visit has enabled him to have a first-hand  knowledge of the great achievements of his host country, said  Fujimori, whose last trip here was made three years ago.    China's successes would not have been achieved without the  political system and the democratic form that conform to its own  national conditions, he said.    No matter what a political system or democratic form is  called, it is crucial that they should fall in line with the  conditions of that country, he stressed.    Referring to Peru's experience, Fujimori said that the sort  of democracy and political system Peru once inherited from the  West had, in fact, infringed upon human rights and brought about  disasters to the people and their nation.    Since 1992, he said, Peru has been trying to build a  political system that best suits its own national conditions.  As a result, the economy has recovered, foreign exchanges  increased and inflation effectively curbed, he said.    No country should be allowed to interfere in the internal  affairs of other countries, he said, adding that only when  countries respect each other, can people develop economy,  safeguard world peace and build up a new world order.</p>

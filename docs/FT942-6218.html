			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Libya pulls out of Chad land Libya and Chad said in a joint statement yesterday that Libya had completed its withdrawal from the Aouzou Strip, which it had occupied since 1973, Reuter reports. Chad state radio said Mr Abderamane Miskine Izzo, interior minister, other Chadian officials and UN observers witnessed the handover by Mr Omar al-Montasser, Libya's foreign minister. The 42,000 square mile region is thought to contain oil and uranium. Chad and Libya twice went to war over the strip. In February the International Court of Justice ruled it belonged to Chad.</p>

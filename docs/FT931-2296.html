			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Markets: Believe it or not, that wasn't a recession - London / The Budget and You WHEN COLERIDGE first thought up that phrase about the 'willing suspension of disbelief' - the 'poetic faith' we feel in the presence of true artistic creativity - he probably did not have the Budget in mind. But he should have done. Consider this year's example. Norman Lamont asked us to believe that significant business tax rises - through Advance Corporation Tax and Petroleum Revenue Tax - were actually tax concessions proffered in response to eager pleas by the corporate sector. He asked the gilt market to believe in the bankability of government promises to raise taxes stretching several unfathomable years into the future, and in the plausibility of a spending review that has barely even started. Most improbably of all, the Treasury asked us to believe that there was really no recession last year after all. The UK's non-oil gross domestic product shrank by only  1/2 per cent point during 1992, according to the economic estimates published to accompany the Budget. Even that modest slippage overstates what actually happened, on the Treasury's figures: if you compare the fourth quarter of 1992 with that of 1991, there was really no change. Manufacturing output was actually 1/2 per cent higher in the fourth quarter than it had been a year before. Faced with all this, the markets did their best to suspend their incredulity. Share prices fell on the day after the Budget, with the FT-SE 100 index dropping 29.4 points to 2889.9. By the end of the week, blue chips had recovered some of their lost ground, and the FT-SE 100 closed at 2900.1 on Friday, down 15.8. Smaller companies had no lost ground to make up: the FT-SE Mid 250 index actually rose on the day after the Budget, and closed the week up 1 per cent. The gilt market, which had begun the week in a mood of foreboding, appeared to have suspended its critical faculties by the close. Even though the Treasury's new estimate of the 1993-94 public sector borrowing requirement, at Pounds 50bn, was higher than earlier estimates, the market responded enthusiastically. The yield on 10-year gilts, which was 7.56 per cent at the end of last week and 7.66 per cent in the immediate aftermath of the new PSBR estimate, ended the week at 7.61 per cent. The decisive factor for the gilt market was probably not the Budget itself, nor Norman Lamont's promise of a 'wedge' of rising tax revenues in years to come. It was the growing evidence that a solid economic recovery is under way, ranging from the discovery, in the Treasury's figures, that last year had not been as ghastly as it seemed, to higher building society lending and lower unit wage costs, culminating in Thursday's unexpected drop in unemployment for the first time in 34 months. The market has convinced itself that only economic growth can deliver an escape from the spectre of ever-rising government borrowing; this week, that prospect seemed on balance a little more likely. Ever since last autumn, the equity market has been expecting such a recovery. This week's developments, therefore, have been dominated by an attempt to calculate whether the tax changes in the Budget were likely to help or harm the value investors put on the profits stream that recovery will generate. For higher-rate and tax exempt shareholders, the changes in the tax treatment of dividends mean that the stock market is less valuable than it was before the Budget, as articles elsewhere in this section explain. The gross dividend yield on the FT-Actuaries All-Share seems likely to drop from around 4.1 per cent to something like 3.9 per cent. At that figure, it would be reaching the level at which equities have traditionally been seen as unsustainably expensive. Of course, gross dividends are only of direct relevance to tax-exempt investors; for others, the net dividend is the more important figure. Taking that into account, brokers' analysts seemed divided about the impact of the change. NatWest Securities reckoned that only 39 per cent of equity investors were adversely affected; Goldman Sachs put the proportion at 70 per cent or more. Amid the confusion, two facts seemed clear: the government had stepped up its tax take from companies and their shareholders by Pounds 1bn a year; and it had chosen to help companies with surplus ACT problems at the expense of those without. Since surplus ACT is concentrated in a relatively small number of businesses - those with a very heavy dependence on overseas profits, or with unusually high dividend payouts  - individual gainers stand to win much more than individual victims will lose. Shares that benefited from this reasoning included Redland, up 21p since the Budget to 477p, and BAT, up 19p to 992p. The market seemed reluctant to single out other individual gainers and losers from the Budget. Rolls-Royce Motors, part of Vickers, stands to be a significant loser from the changing structure of company car taxation, which will penalise very expensive cars much more heavily than at present. Vickers shares scarcely budged, however, dropping only 2p after the Budget to close the week at 129p; presumably investors no longer regard Rolls-Royce as a significant factor in valuing the group. Whisky distillers, singled out for favourable treatment in the Budget speech by a whisky-sipping chancellor, also stand to benefit, in relative terms at least, from a less onerous rise in excise duties than that imposed on other forms of alcohol. Guinness shares dropped 28p to close at 462, affected more by lack-lustre results than by any advantage accruing to the whisky trade. Oil companies with North Sea interests fell into two camps after the Budget. Those with mature fields and little to gain from a continuation of the old system of lavish allowances for future exploration (perhaps because they had already used up all the allowances the taxman would give them) stand to be big gainers. Analysts decided that BP was the best example of this category: its shares rose only 4 1/2 p, however, closing the week at 299 1/2 p. Oil companies which had counted on a continuation of allowances in the future, typically smaller independents, stand to lose: overall, the sector lost 0.4 per cent. In principle, you might think that gas and electricity utilities would also suffer from the Budget, with its promise to impose value-added tax in years to come on domestic fuel and power. Curiously, the stock market appears to believe that consumers are indifferent to the price they pay to stay warm: British Gas shares lost only 2 1/2 p, closing the week at 297 1/2 p. In this, as in other respects, investors proved willing to offer companies, and the chancellor, the benefit of the doubt. Spring weather, favourable economic statistics, a strengthening pound, and a Budget speech which made a nod in the direction of future austerity - together these left traders eager to set their darker thoughts aside. Still, Coleridge's willing suspension of disbelief is a transitory experience. At the end of the play, the audience leaves the theatre; at the end of the story the reader puts the book down. Just how long can this particular outbreak of poetic faith be expected to last?</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / British companies 'take longer to pay debts' BRITISH COMPANIES take significantly longer to pay their debts than their European competitors, says a survey by Intrum Justitia, the continent's largest debt collection company. Companies are paid on average 53 days after invoicing on domestic debts and 74 days later on exports, compared with average contracts for payment of 29 days and 50 days respectively. The survey, which questioned 1,782 companies employing 408,000 people, highlights widespread difficulties of late debt payments. British companies said late payment caused liquidity problems, loss of profit and higher interest costs. Across Europe, payments are made on average 15 days late for domestic trade and 16 days late for export trade. That compares with average agreed credit terms of 36 days and 40 days respectively. Nearly 60 per cent of companies said payment habits had deteriorated in the past year, with greatest difficulties in Germany and Switzerland. Other countries with longer overdue payment periods include Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and France. The survey says the UK is the worst, with the lowest level of legislation and no right to interest on overdue amounts. The UK government is considering measures on late payment, including disclosure of speed of payment in company annual reports. The EC is considering a directive on the subject. Credit terms vary widely, with Italy providing long agreed terms of 60 days on average and France 66 days. Few companies check the creditworthiness of clients after they have started trading with them.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COST ESTIMATES SOAR FOR UPGRADING CITY'S SEWAGE TREATMENT  </P> <P> City officials quietly warned the San Diego City Council this week that  tentative cost estimates for upgrading the city's sewage treatment system have  sharply increased, with the six options now under consideration, ranging in  price from $2.4 billion to $4.2 billion, City Hall sources said Wednesday.  </P> <P> If they hold up under further analysis, the new estimates would reflect an  increase of hundreds of millions of dollars over the $1.5-billion to  $2.4-billion projection that city officials have been using in discussions of  the project during the past year.  </P> <P> The new estimates reflect inflation, a sizable contingency fund and the added  cost of water reclamation technology, which the council has committed itself to  pursuing, sources said. Water reclamation involves an even more thorough  cleaning of waste water than the "secondary sewage treatment" mandated by  federal law.  </P> <P> But city officials cautioned that the new estimates are only tentative  proposals that have not undergone thorough analysis by the Water Utilities  Department and the city's hired consultant. Two sources said final cost  estimates, expected to be ready for the March 28 meeting of the Metropolitan  Sewer Task Force, could be lower.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Cost Estimates Completed  </P> <P> Deputy City Manager Roger Frauenfelder, who oversees the upgrading of sewage  treatment, said Wednesday that no new cost estimates have been completed.  </P> <P> "There is not a report that shows higher costs. We were going to try to get it  together, but it just hasn't happened yet," Frauenfelder said. He said there  would be no discussion of costs at a City Council workshop today at which the  entire sewage-system upgrading will be reviewed.  </P> <P> But several City Hall sources said staff members shocked council members with  cost estimates ranging from $2.4 billion for an option that does not include  water reclamation to $4.2 billion for a plan that would pump treated effluent  over the Laguna Mountains for agricultural use in the Imperial Valley.  </P> <P> Four other options that differ in varying degrees from the two extremes would  cost $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion, the sources said.  </P> <P> The figures were apparently released during a closed-session discussion of the  sewer-treatment system upgrading Tuesday. Among the items on the agenda for  that meeting was a discussion of the city's legal battle with the Environmental  Protection Agency, the U. S. Justice Department and the state Regional Water  Quality Control Board, all of which sued the city last July to force it to  upgrade to secondary sewage treatment as required by federal law.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Battling for Timetable, Cost  </P> <P> The city has agreed to move to secondary sewage treatment, but is battling the  federal agencies over the timetable and the cost. The agencies also want the  city to pay fines for 1,814 sewage spills over five years.  </P> <P> The cost of upgrading the sewage treatment system will be borne by the 1.5  million users of the Metropolitan Sewerage System in cities throughout the  county. It is unclear how much sewer bills would increase under the new cost  estimates, but city officials estimated last year that a $1.5-billion to  $2.4-billion upgrade could quadruple sewer users' bills.  </P> <P> The average fee would rise from about $10.40 to nearly $40 a month in the next  three to five years, officials said then.  </P> <P> The cost to sewer users could be sharply reduced if Mayor Maureen O'Connor is  successful in her efforts to win passage of federal legislation that would pay  for 55% of the costs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Options Down to 7  </P> <P> Consultants have winnowed the city's options from 21 to seven -- the six  treatment upgradings and a "no-project option" still favored by Councilman  Bruce Henderson.  </P> <P> All the options would upgrade the existing Point Loma plant to secondary  treatment. Several others involve building more treatment plants in the North  City area and the South Bay, along with smaller, satellite plants scattered  about the city. Two of the options do not include water reclamation.  </P> <P> Secondary sewage treatment removes 90% of solid waste from raw sewage before it  is dumped in the ocean.  </P></p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Racal strong Recommendations by at least two broking houses, coupled with a reportedly very successful presentation to institutional investors hosted by NatWest Securities, saw Racal Electronics shares burst through the 200p barrier to gain 15 for a record close of 205p. The day's turnover of 9.9m was the heaviest this year. The shares also benefited from somewhat dubious takeover stories, with GEC suggested as a possible bidder. The electronics team at Credit Lyonnais Laing highlighted potential for Racal from the recovery in the US datacommunications industry, also pointing out that export order intake is rising at Racal's Radio and Decca divisions. Kleinwort Benson was also believed to have been a keen buyer of Racal. News of an oil discovery - thought to contain between 250m and 500m barrels of oil - by BP and Shell, West of the Shetlands, came after market hours and therefore failed to impact on the participants. BP eased a shade to 288p although turnover remained exceptionally heavy and reached 12m. Shell eased 4 to 574p on 3.4m traded, with dealers talking of switching out of the majors and into the exploration and production stocks. In the latter, Enterprise Oil edged up 2 to 478p. Lasmo eased 3 to 182p, although there were renewed hints that another asset disposal could be on the cards. The BP/Shell news could well influence shares in Aran Energy and British Borneo which hold stakes of 10 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively in Block 205/26, adjacent to the BP/Shell discovery and which contains an oil find made last year by Amerada Hess. Aran was unchanged at 25 1/2 p and British Borneo 4 firmer at 178p. Monument Oil &amp; Gas moved up 1 1/4 to 41 1/2 p, with one leading UK securities house, thought to be Smith New Court, said to have bought a block of 6m shares. Shares in conglomerate Williams Holdings shed 5 to 355p on turnover of 5.5m after it announced a placing of 11.8m shares at 345p. The Pounds 44m rights issue by housebuilder Berkeley Group, the second such fund raising by the company in three years, took the market by surprise, although the buildings sectors are seen as prime candidates to raise capital via the rights issue path. Housebuilder Bellway recently launched a Pounds 33m rights issue. Berkeley shares dropped to 347p on the cash-call news but staged a swift recovery as dealers absorbed the encouraging profits and dividend forecast. Berkeley said it would use the funds to 'seize market opportunites', and said the housing market had shown some signs of recovery. At the close the shares were 10 up on balance at 370p. Galliford dropped 8 to 39p after the steep fall in interim profits and the almost halved dividend. Blue Circle Industries eased 2 to 213p after a bearish note on the stock from Yamaichi, whose building specialist Mr Scott Fulton said a combination of the sharp rise in the shares and the timing of BCI 's results, after those of Rugby, the cement group, and those of Hepworth, the heating equipment group, suggests BCI are vulnerable to profit-taking. A stock overhang in food retailer Tesco left the shares 2 lighter at 245p. A block of around 3m shares was said to be looking for a home. The poor trading at Ladbroke's DIY division weakened several stocks in the stores sector with similar DIY subsidiaries. Boots gave up 6 to 505p, while Kingfisher lost 13 to close at 529p. WH Smith 'A' eased 5 to 428p. Public houses, hotels, drinks and nursing home company Boddington Group cheered the market with a 29.6 per cent improvement in full-year figures to Pounds 26.3m. The shares jumped 14 to 230p, with many brokers moving to upgrade current-year profits forecasts. The recent profits downgrading from Cazenove continued to hurt Allied-Lyons, which ended 11 lower at 582p with volume reaching 4.3m shares. Guinness bounced 4 to 444p on trade of 3.8m after Smith New Court reiterated its buy recommendation. Speculation that engineering group James Wilkes would soon be at the receiving end of a bid drove the shares 5 forward to 64p. A buy recommendation from Henderson Crosthwaite published earlier this week continued to boost British Aerospace. At the day's best the stock was trading at 290p, but came off the top with the market to close 11 1/2 ahead at 273p after volume of 3.7m. The positive sentiment in BAe helped Smiths Industries harden 3 to 358p. US buyers continued to favour British Steel and the shares edged  3/4 forward to 85 1/4 p in trade of 9.2m. Recovery prospects boosted both Glynwed International and William Cook. The former appreciated 7 to 289p, while the latter moved forward 7 to 174p. Among motors, Thomas Cowie lost 5 to 206p on profit-taking after Wednesday's strong run which followed good figures.</p>

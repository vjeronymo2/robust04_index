			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Yemen's 'secrets' continue to elude oilmen - Explorers remain hopeful, though new finds are getting smaller Mr Bernard Isautier, president of Canadian Occidental Petroleum, remains sanguine about Yemen's oil industry despite a general decrease in the size of new discoveries and increasing costs of further exploration. He insists that much potential remains in Yemen, while acknowledging that more information is needed before 'the secrets' of the region can be disclosed. 'We are maintaining an active exploration programme in the concession area where we are already producing. There are smaller structures still to be tested and we are actively pursuing these since they are close to our facilities,' Mr Isautier said. With depressed oil prices affecting exploration budgets CanadianOxy is currently placing less emphasis on the possibility of large discoveries in remote areas of its 37,500-square-km concession and more on smaller finds that can be joined economically to its existing facilities. Located at al-Masila in southern Yemen, CanadianOxy's oil fields and central processing facility are linked by a 138km pipeline extending southwards to export facilities at Ash-Shihr on the Gulf of Aden coast. Since coming on stream in late September 1993 the company has announced recoverable reserves of 546m barrels and has reached an average production rate of 135,000 barrels a day, about a third of Yemen's total output. Although Mr Isautier doubts that the company's production will increase substantially from existing fields in the coming year he is optimistic about other possible finds in the area. 'There is still upside potential particularly in the fractured basement,' he said, referring to the hard rock foundations underlying porous limestone formations where oil is usually found. 'We now have one well producing 8,000 barrels a day of natural flow, a higher quality oil, and flowing under very steady, stable pressure. That is indicative of a large well connected area and it's very encouraging,' he says. CanadianOxy is meanwhile trading information with other companies adjacent to its concession area, particularly Clyde, Lasmo, and Nimir, all of which are working to the north and north-east of the al-Masila fields. In the current climate of cost effectiveness, traded data saves on exploration costs and could be especially important for CanadianOxy. 'If those companies make significant discoveries, that would suggest more potential in the eastern portions of our concession,' says a company executive. Based on CanadianOxy's discoveries, oilmen have long suspected a trend running through the region. But confirmation has so far eluded them. Last April, Total announced a find capable of yielding 12,000 b/d to the east of al-Masila and to the north Clyde is currently evaluating results after a recent strike along its concession line with CanadianOxy. But Lasmo is now said to have drilled three dry holes, while Nimir has just begun its drilling programme. As prospects of large discoveries diminish, oil companies will gradually have to adjust their exploration programmes, gearing their efforts to smaller finds near existing facilities to ensure commerciality. But oilmen insist that even such modest exploration efforts may be uneconomical under present production-sharing agreements with the Yemeni government. 'The government has tended to think in terms of quick large-scale finds and has negotiated contracts accordingly,' one says. 'That means small finds become commercially unattractive and that, in turn, puts a damper on further exploration.' But there are signs already that the government is adjusting to the new conditions, announcing last month extensions in the exploration agreements of Shell and Clyde. With concession areas ranging from 7,000 to 40,000 sq km, the added time should enable companies to explore larger portions of their territory and to evaluate more carefully the data they gather. CanadianOxy has now been in the country seven years and, as Mr Isautier points out: 'We still have a lot of ideas to work on to determine the ultimate potential of our fields'.</p>

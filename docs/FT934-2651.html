			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Telford and Shropshire (2): Fledgling finds its wings - Hazel Duffy looks at the young town's efforts to attract newcomers Telford was 23 years old when it was abandoned by its parent, the Telford Development Corporation, in 1991. The corporation had been the guiding influence of the new town from its inception. Abandonment, forced by the government, was hard and Telford protested to no avail. But Telford does not have to stand entirely on its own two feet - yet. The corporation's responsibilities were split three ways. The government's own body, the Commission for New Towns (CNT), was assigned to dispose of 2,500 acres of land that had been in the ownership of the corporation. The Telford Development Agency, was set up by the CNT, Wrekin District Council and Shropshire County Council to market the town and attract inward investment. The district council resumed planning powers, except for the acreage which is the responsibility for the CNT. Arguably, at 23, it was time for Telford to get out from under the wings of its parent. Those who opposed, did so on similar grounds to those used by other new towns - they were not yet ready to be launched into a harsh and highly competitive world without the special care implied by the development corporation structure. Telford has been helped to the tune of about Pounds 1bn from government over the past 25 years, complemented by Pounds 800m investment by the private sector. This may seem generous, given a population of only 120,000, although others might compare it with the public subsidies that have gone to London Docklands over just 10 years. Young Telford has had some tough times in its short life. It was hard to tempt manufacturers into the area when communications with the outside world were as poor as they were until the M54 was opened in 1983. Meanwhile, the existing industrial base in the town was crumbling fast. Tens of thousands of Telford jobs disappeared in the recession of the early 1980s, when so much of manufacturing industry was unable to live with a sterling exchange rate dominated by North Sea oil. The past 10 years have been much more successful. Telford Development Corporation had been far sighted in the 1970s, seeing the threats to manufacturing industry on the horizon, and reading the omens for a town which depended on corporate parents which were located anywhere but in Shropshire. The corporation knew it had a lot to offer, particularly to Japanese companies which were starting to look towards Europe, and to towns which could offer greenfield sites. It went out and marketed, and got the companies in. Christopher Mackrell, the CNT's director for the West Midlands (Telford and Redditch), and former commercial director of the Telford Development Corporation, says that 35 per cent of Japanese investment in the UK is in the town. It has taken time to build up this level of confidence, however. The plight of the town in the early 1980s was such that the Treasury agreed to an Enterprise Zone to help the town become more competitive. The rates holiday, and attractive terms for writing off capital expenditure against tax liability, have helped to sell most of the 250 acres EZ. Just 20 acres remain undeveloped. Unlike in the early days of Telford, when factories were predominantly rented, most of the property has been bought by investors or the occupiers of the premises. Under the New Towns Act 1985, the CNT, which will be wound up itself in 1998, is charged with disposing of a land bank equal to 2,500 acres. It is all outside the EZ. The land is spread mostly around the outer ring of the town. It already has outline planning permission for development, either for housing, or employment, most for industry, but also for commercial purposes. Sites can be assembled if this is what a client wants. The grant of formal planning consent for specific projects lies with the CNT, in conjunction with the Environment Secretary. However, it is highly unlikely that an end purpose which did not meet the approval of the District Council would be permitted. The land bank is important from the point of view of the West Midlands region. Greenfield sites are a rarity, given the government's leaning towards disallowing further development of green belt land. The Telford land bank, according to the Telford Development Agency, represents about 40 per cent of good quality land in the region. It is a powerful marketing tool within the region, although Telford has plenty of competition from outside the region. Industrial land is priced at about Pounds 115,000-Pounds 125,000 an acre, land for housing at nearly Pounds 200,000 an acre, prices which, Mr Mackrell says, 'provide a yardstick for negotiated disposals', to current occupiers, as well as to prospective developers. In the two years, since the disposal edict was issued, Pounds 20m has been realised in land and property sales by the CNT in Telford. This breaks down into about 100 acres sold for housing, 25 acres for employment. Wrekin District Council also owns property, worth about Pounds 40m, which it rents out at Pounds 3.50 to Pounds 4.50 a sq ft for industrial users, and between Pounds 6.50 and Pounds 10.50 a sq ft for offices. The Council works closely with the CNT. It is content to let the CNT, with the Development Agency, market Telford, acknowledging that they have far superior networks of international contacts than a district council could muster. Among existing businesses, however, the Council is working hard to promote networking. Under the old system, the Development Corporation was responsible largely for external relations with the private sector. Now, increasingly, it is the council. David Hutchison, chief executive, admits that they are still learning. But he points proudly to the Business Link (One Stop Shop), opening next year, which Telford has managed to secure with strong Council input. Before the end of the decade, and the wind up of the CNT, Wrekin will have acquired the skills of parenting.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Natalya Varnavskaya, Valeriya Ochinyan report in the "New </F> Tax System Debated" column: "Yekaterinburg Is For a New Reform"]    [Text] Addressing a conference of heads of oblast and  republic administrations in the Urals region on 9 April, Sergey  Glazyev, chairman of the State Duma Economic Policy Committee,  stated that the existing "tax system of Russia is a direct  threat to the country's economy." In this context the  Yekaterinburg-based association Russia's Taxes has been tasked  within a month to work out and present to the State Duma a  basically new tax system because without reforming the tax  legislation "it is impossible even to start discussing the 1995  budget." Experts, however, doubt the feasibility of tax reform  "Glazyev style."    The Russia's Taxes association favors the idea of reforming  the tax legislation in effect since 1992. The proposed concept  was approved by sessions of the Sverdlovsk Oblast Council and  the Russian Government. Nonetheless up to now it has not been  viewed as a serious alternative to the existing taxation system.    According to information in possession of KOMMERSANT-DAILY,  the Yekaterinburg concept envisions a reduction (value-added tax  from 20 percent to 13 percent) or full abolition (profit and  income taxes) of those taxes which at present constitute the  bulk of budget revenues, and also increasing the rate of  resource and property taxes. It is proposed also to abolish the  tax for exceeding the wages fund and basically to revise  procedures for taxing enterprise property (exclude the  enterprises' monetary assets from the tax base). The plan is to  tax funds used for consumption; to impose a tax on the export of  capital, the franchise to produce minerals, and "on ecology."  According to estimates by the concept's authors, if their  system is adopted, the taxation level for enterprises in the  processing industry will constitute not more than 25 percent  (instead of 44 percent at present). Moreover, increasing the  tax on property will lead to its more effective and rational use.    According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY's experts, in spite of the  fact  that it is supported by a wide circle, the adoption of the new  tax program promoted by Sergey Glazyev is unlikely -- because  the idea of such a reform in the tax legislation is opposed not  only by influential factions in the State Duma led by Gaydar  (Russia's choice), Nikolay Medvedev (New Regional Policy), and  Boris Fedorov (12 December), and representatives of the Finance  Ministry and the State Tax Service but also representatives of  the presidential administration. Thus, Yevgeniy Yasin, chief of  the administration's analytical center, stated at a recent  Interaction club meeting that "if the government does something  `Glazyev style,' it would be a catastrophe."</p>

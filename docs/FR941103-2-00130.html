In addition, Commentary .03 to PHLX Rule 1025 requires member organizations to maintain, at the principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over the office servicing the customer's account, information to permit review of each customer's options account to determine the compatibility of options transactions with investment objectives, the size and frequency of options transactions, commission activity in the account, profit or loss in the account, undue concentration in any options class or classes, and compliance with the provisions of Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board. The PHLX proposes to amend PHLX Rule 1025(d) and Commentary .03 to allow member organizations to maintain the required customer information and account statements off-site, rather than at the principal supervisory office, as long as the records are readily accessible and promptly retrievable. However, branch offices must continue to maintain customer account information on site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Matveyeva, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI Far </F> Eastern correspondent: ``The Eastern Shore Is Still  Inhabited...''    [Text]    Russia's Pacific coast is threatened by a general  environmental disaster. Freighters and nuclear submarines  belonging to the Pacific Fleet and loaded with liquid  radioactive wastes are docked at seaports in the Far Eastern  region. Furthermore, some of the vessels are in a dangerously  dilapidated condition. The situation is extremely hazardous, and  at this time there is no solution to the problem. That was the  announcement made a few days ago by Yevgeniy Nazdratenko,  administration chief of Maritime Kray.  <H5>  MN Dossier </H5>   There are only 10 areas in the Far Eastern seas where  radioactive waste (both liquid and solid) is dumped. Just one of  these, located in the Sea of Japan 105 nautical miles from  Vladivostok, 80 miles from Nakhodka and 295 miles from Hokkaido,  has over the past 20 years been the dump site for more than  33,000 cubic meters of liquid radioactive wastes with a total  radioactivity of 10,842 curies. In addition, 9,846 cubic meters  of solid radioactive waste with a total radioactivity of 2,230  curies has also been dumped there. At the same site the sea  floor at a depth of 3,250-3,700 meters is littered with 1,689  containers and 18 vessels filled with solid radioactive waste  taken from the power units of nuclear submarines, five steam  generators and 21 circulating pumps, which are not even in any  sort of container whatsoever.    For many years the Pacific Fleet dealt with radioactive  waste  quite simply: it was all dumped at sea. After a recent  international scandal in which daring members of the omnipresent  Greenpeace organization located and announced to the whole world  radioactive dumping by a Russian freighter in the Sea of Japan,  central agencies have decreed an end to such operations. The  extremely polluted Far Eastern seas, which are being turned into  a radioactive dump, got a respite. Liquid radioactive waste is  now being stored on shore. No one knows what to do with it.    The people of the Far East have been put in a difficult  situation before by the military units based in their region.  One need only recall the numerous accidents at sea and on land  for which the Pacific Fleet has been responsible. Three years  ago the fleet command attempted to carry out an unprecedented  operation in Postovaya Bay near Sovetskaya Gavan: disassembly of  reactors on board outdated nuclear submarines mothballed there.  On orders from Admiral Gennadiy Khvatov, Pacific Fleet  commander, the complex task of removing the reactors'  radioactive nuclear fuel-containing cores -- a task that  requires trained specialists and special conditions -- was to be  carried out by the local garrison. But the sailors had never  done that kind of work before, and the bay was not specially  equipped for the job. The residents of Sovetskaya Gavan and the  town of Vanino learned of the planned secret operation by  chance. It cost them a great deal of effort to stop the military  from going ahead with the operation.    Now there has been another emergency. The defenders of our  maritime borders cannot utilize liquid radioactive waste, the  inevitable by-product of nuclear submarine fleet operations. At  any moment the coastline and all its inhabitants could take a  drink of that waste. As they expanded the nuclear might of the  Pacific Fleet military experts gave no thought to safe means of  utilizing wastes and disassembling decommissioned submarines.  Local residents' health and very lives were not taken into  account.    Many very beautiful bays and gulfs along the Russian Pacific  coast have long been inaccessible to people. They are literally  occupied by military units. Crammed beyond all measure with  military equipment, unique natural sites are a depressing sight.  In some places decommissioned submarines have been sitting at  anchor, aging, for years. Yet experts warn that decommissioned  submarines should be decontaminated and components utilized  immediately. Everything that presents a danger should be  disassembled without delay and disposed of properly. After time  has passed it is not only difficult to carry out such  operations, but, depending on the technology, sometimes  impossible. If, of course, the appropriate safety procedures are  taken...    The creation of the Pacific Fleet, the largest and most  powerful in the world, cost our country a tremendous amount. Now  more substantial expenditures will be required to halt the  destructive effect of this monster on our lives. Thus far the  Russian Government neither sees nor hears this problem at all.    But the Americans have responded. Watching with alarm the  Russian Far East, their troubled neighbor in the Pacific region,  they have now become seriously worried. The Bablock-Wilcox  Company, which specializes in supplying nuclear energy equipment  to the U.S. Navy, has expressed a willingness to provide our  navy with the most modern technology for the neutralization of  radioactive wastes and utilization of nuclear submarines. Donald  Ray, a company representative who visited Vladivostok a few days  ago, reported that the U.S. Government, which supports the  Bablock-Wilcox initiative, plans to allocate $10 million to  implement it. Japanese specialists are also working on a program  to help Russia set up special storage facilities for its nuclear  materials.    Our military circles have always been very wary of advice  from outsiders, particularly when it comes to foreign advisors,  and they react very negatively to any interference in the area  of their interests. However, today it appears that there is no  other option than to cooperate with anyone who expresses a  desire to help.    Russia's eastern shore is in great distress. It would appear  that it is there that humanity has come to the final frontier,  beyond which there lies nothing.</p>

			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Germany's steel groups seek to ease coal pact NEGOTIATIONS have begun which could radically change an agreement committing German steel producers to buy all their coking coal from high-price domestic producers. Thyssen, Krupp-Hoesch, Mannesmann and Preussag, Germany's largest steel-makers, are discussing with Ruhrkohle, which produces 80 per cent of the country's coking coal, a partial lifting of a 1991 contract compelling them to buy from domestic sources. The talks follow a Duisburg court ruling allowing Klockner-Werke, the steel-maker recently rescued from bankruptcy, to use imported coke, which is 30 per cent cheaper, for 30 per cent of its needs. Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch argue that the ruling effectively invalidates the purchasing agreement which sought to ensure the survival and gradual restructuring of the heavily-subsidised German mines by 2005. 'We cannot accept that a competitor is allowed to buy cheaper coal and stand by doing nothing,' a Thyssen official said. Ruhrkohle, whose unsold stocks of coal and coke rose by 3.5m tonnes last year because of declining orders from the recession-hit steel industry, said the negotiations could jeopardise a further 2m tonnes of coal a year. Klockner-Werke won backing in June from its creditors, including the European Commission, for a debt write-off scheme despite warnings by other steel-makers that it would affect the entire German steel and coal industry. Steel industry sources said the solution might be for Ruhrkohle to keep its monopoly but to sell 30 per cent of its output at import prices. Such a move could give a large boost to the competitiveness of German steel-makers, which complain that the system puts them at a disadvantage against foreign producers. Thyssen, the largest company, produces half its own coke, buying the rest from Ruhrkohle. But Krupp-Hoesch, the newly-merged steel giant, will shortly rely entirely on coke from Ruhrkohle after it closes its coking plant in Rheinhausen later this month. An official at Ruhrkohle, which is owned by steel and utilities groups, warned that lower prices would accelerate the closing of mines and loss of jobs. It is already planning 20,000 redundancies in the next two years after cutting 7,300 jobs in 1992. 'We are all in the red. We have to find a common solution to get out of the crisis,' he said. Talks this year on the mines' future and their financing have already proved fruitless.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: UK property When Mr George Soros decided last June to invest in UK commercial property, such was the American financier's reputation that the sector rose 6 per cent in a single day. Yesterday, when he pulled out, it fell just 1 per cent. Mr Soros argued the decision was based on asset allocation: with interest rates moving up the opportunities for sharp increases in asset values were likely to be limited. However, the move probably says more about how Mr Soros' property fund has traded than about prospects for UK property per se. Followers of Mr Soros are not used to seeing their shares trading at a discount to net assets. Despite the sector's muted fall, the decision is clearly a setback for British Land, the company with which Mr Soros had formed the joint venture. Its disappointment is likely to be motivated less by yesterday's 3 per cent drop in its share price than the loss of Mr Soros' magic at opening bankers' doors. Mr Soros' 'long-term investment' was supposed to run until 2004 but lasted just 18 months. By spending Pounds 142m to acquire its joint-venture partner, British Land has raised its gearing to more than 85 per cent. Interest cover is still comfortable. But the rise increases the risk of a rights issue if British Land wants to buy Stanhope Properties and its 50 per cent stake in Broadgate Properties. That fear, rather than the loss of Mr Soros, probably accounted for yesterday's share price fall.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Equity Issues: Enquirer/Star Group offer AN OFFERING in the US market last week gave a fresh twist to the existing equity-linked structure and could prove to be an attractive alternative to straight equity issues and convertible debt. Enquirer/Star Group, which publishes the National Enquirer and other US publications, launched a Dollars 135m offer of zero coupon notes with warrants to buy 4.86m shares of the company's common stock. The structure, designed by Salomon Brothers, provides a similar pattern of returns for investors as Low Yield Option Notes (Lyons). Both structures have tax advantages for investors, but also offer cheaper funding for issuers as the warrants are treated as paid-in capital and a greater portion of the implied interest is tax-deductible. While the Lyons structure typically includes a put option, allowing investors to demand early redemption of principal after five years, the Enquirer/Star Group notes have a five-year maturity. The company is buying warrants from Boston Venture, a venture capital group which owns an equity stake in the company, and then selling similar warrants to investors at a slightly higher price. As a result, the venture capital group is able to sell off its stake at a higher price. The deal, which closes later this week, is two-and-a-half times oversubscribed, according to Salomon Brothers.</p>

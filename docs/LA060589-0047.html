The 2:34  p.m. quake was measured at a magnitude of 4.5 and the epicenter was pinpointed  23 miles south of Barstow in the Lucerne Valley area, said Robert Finn of  Caltech. "I felt it here in Pasadena," said Finn, whose office is more than 70  miles from the epicenter. The temblor was also felt in Victorville, Big Bear  City and Lake Arrowhead.  </P></p>

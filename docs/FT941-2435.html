			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Observer: Going for a song If ICI's first joint venture in mainland China - a Pounds 15m paint factory  -is not a success, blame the astrologers and not ICI chairman Sir Denys Henderson. Its opening was dictated by a soothsayer who figured March 18 was the day which would provide the proud owners with the maximum amount of good fortune. As an extra precaution, ICI laid on 60 lion dancers to frighten away any lingering evil spirits. However, the highlight of the opening ceremony was the premiere of the ICI song, specially composed by Chen Shuliu of the Guangzhou conservatory, with vocals by Miss Zhu, a police lady, backed by the brass band of the local People's Liberation Army unit. Sir Denys was particularly moved by a bit in the song which compared ICI to China's three great river systems - the Yellow river, Yangtze river and the Pearl river.</p>

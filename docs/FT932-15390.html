			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Canada's provinces get the borrowing habit: Capital markets are concerned at ever-rising deficits WOOD GUNDY, the Canadian securities firm, arranges regular conference calls to bring clients up to date on economic trends. The speakers at two briefings earlier this month, however, were not Wood Gundy's own economists but the finance ministers of the provinces of Newfoundland and New Brunswick. Their presence is evidence that the 10 provinces' priority these days is to impress international capital markets, rather than woo voters with lower taxes or expanded public services. The reason is summed up by Mr Bill Jones, director of capital markets in Saskatchewan: 'More and more investors have some concerns about what is happening to the provincial credit situation.' The capital markets' influence has been evident since the start of the annual provincial budget season in mid-March. Of the five provinces which have tabled budgets so far, four (Saskatchewan, Newfoundland, Manitoba and New Brunswick) have included spending cuts. Although Newfoundland's Liberal government faces an election next month, the budget included cuts in civil service pay, a commitment not to build any new schools and delays in construction of medical clinics. 'Once upon a time it was possible to do a budget with election goodies. We didn't have that luxury,' the finance minister, Mr Winston Baker, said. In Saskatchewan, the provincial sales tax was raised from 8 to 9 per cent. Spending on education will be trimmed by 4 per cent, and the days of free dental care for schoolchildren are over. The government promised to eliminate the provincial deficit, totalling almost CDollars 600m (Pounds 314m) in the year to March 31 1993, within the next four years. Similar measures are expected when the other provinces table their 1993/94 budgets over the next two months. Quebec has already asked its civil servants to accept a two-year pay freeze. Ontario's Social-Democrat government, faced with a jump in its deficit from CDollars 10bn to as much as CDollars 17bn, is trying to persuade trade unions to accept pay cuts or face lay-offs. Canada's ratio of federal and provincial debt to GDP has soared from 54 per cent in 1981 to 92 per cent last year. While the provinces accounted for less than 10 per cent of the total in the early 1980s, they now make up about 41 per cent. Their combined borrowing requirements exceeded that of the federal government for the first time in the 1991/92 fiscal year. The recession is only partly to blame for the deterioration. Growth in corporate and personal tax revenues has slowed in line with the overall economy. On the other side of the equation, demands have grown for higher spending, especially on welfare. But Mr Stephen Dafoe, associate director at Standard &amp; Poor's, the New York rating agency, warns that 'there is a substantial component of these deficits which will not go away once economic growth resumes'. The drop in Canada's annual inflation rate to about 2 per cent means that governments cannot rely on higher prices to produce growth in sales taxes, or rising wages to push individual taxpayers into higher tax brackets. Furthermore, companies' efforts to contain the size of their workforces could hold down revenues from the payroll taxes which fund some provinces' healthcare budgets. The new-found enthusiasm for fiscal austerity reflects a growing public awareness of the implications of a rising debt burden. Mr John Crow, governor of the Bank of Canada, last month identified public-sector debt as a drag on economic recovery. He said that a disciplined approach to public finances 'needs to continue if Canada is to generate the increased savings to finance adequately its investment needs'. Furthermore, investors in Canadian provincial bonds are demanding higher interest rates relative to other borrowers. Ontario, whose credit rating has been cut twice in the past two years, was able to sell its long-term bonds in the mid-1980s at yields of 40 basis points, or 40/100ths of a percentage point, above comparable Canadian government issues. Those bonds now trade at a 'spread' of 92-93 basis points. S&amp;P has four provinces - Alberta, New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec - on 'negative outlook', which implies another possible downgrade within the next year or so. While the most visible belt-tightening in the budgets consists of cuts to specific programmes and higher taxes, each level of government is trying to force the toughest decisions on to the next level down. Provincial treasurers complain loudly about cuts in transfer payments from the federal government in Ottawa. The provinces, in turn, are putting the squeeze on local authorities. Ontario, for instance, plans to raise its transfers to municipalities, hospitals and schools by 2 per cent in the year to March 31 1994, but to take back the entire increase the following year. Mr Ted Carmichael, senior economist at Burns Fry in Toronto, says that Canada's tax competitiveness for foreign investors could be eroded as municipalities are forced to push up property taxes, which are not sensitive to corporate profitability or personal income. How long the ardour for austerity will last is open to question. Last year's combined provincial deficit of CDollars 25bn was a quarter higher than original projections. The federal government has consistently failed to meet its deficit-reduction targets over the past eight years. This year's deficit, estimated at CDollars 34-CDollars 35bn, will be almost the same as it was in the year after the Conservative government came to office in 1985. Economists believe that the only way to make a meaningful dent in budget deficits is to overhaul some of the cornerstones of Canada's social security net, such as generous welfare payments and the government-funded healthcare system. Healthcare makes up about a third of provincial spending. Some provinces are inching towards fundamental reforms, such as introducing user fees for medical services and linking welfare payments to job training. The federal government last year eliminated cash 'family allowances' paid to upper-income taxpayers. Ottawa is also eager to gain tighter control over the provinces' budget-making process. But even in the present climate of restraint, any tampering with health and social security benefits or provincial powers carries enormous political risks. Mr Dafoe says that 'one may wish to be optimistic, but political realities sometimes do not allow measures to be taken which achieve substantial results.'</p>

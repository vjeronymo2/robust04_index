Noting that the new year address of the great comrade  President Kim Il-song indicates in detail the way of building  socialism and reunifying Korea, he said Mozambique holds that  Korea should be reunified according to the confederacy formula  and 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation  advanced by the president.    There is no other way but to carry the confederacy formula  into effect for the reunification of Korea, he stressed, adding  that the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula must be solved  through DPRK- USA talks.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Gummer starts debate on environmental planning Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, yesterday launched a debate on how Britain's man-made environment can be improved. In a speech which officials said could influence planning guidelines, he emphasised the part quality should play in developing towns and communities. His speech to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors was accompanied by a discussion document, Quality in Town and Country, which contains a questionnaire. Responses will furnish material for a conference Mr Gummer will organise in the autumn. That, in turn, will provide the basis for policy decisions. Mr Gummer said quality set the tone for communities, and could bring benefits, such as a stronger sense of belonging by local people and businesses, and greater economic vitality. It could also lead to better and more viable buildings, and breathe life into town centres. 'While we need new development, we yearn for buildings which will raise our rights, not dash our hopes,' he says in the document's preface. Environmentalists welcomed Mr Gummer's initiative as further evidence of a policy shift in the Department of the Environment which they say is seeking to move development away from the countryside and back into town centres. Recent planning guidelines issued by the department to local authorities discourage out-of-town developments which are seen as increasing traffic pollution by requiring people to travel. Officials stress that Mr Gummer wants to take the debate beyond the design of buildings to include the layout of communities, creation of successful town centres and preservation of heritage, and to accommodate other policy areas, particularly transport and housing. Apart from the atmospheric effects of better quality, he wants to stress the business benefits - better buildings last longer and are more adaptable, and well-planned towns are more economically sustainable. The initiative is being presented as a further step in the direction of sustainable development to which the UK committed itself at the Rio Earth Summit two years ago.</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEA ADVISORY PANEL OKS GRANTS TO 2 CONTROVERSIAL GALLERIES;  </P> <P> ARTS: BUT THE COUNCIL PUTS OFF FEDERAL FUNDING FOR TWO PERFORMERS WHO EXPLORE  SEXUAL TABOOS AND ARE TARGETS OF CONSERVATIVES IN THE OBSCENITY DEBATE.  </P> <P> The advisory council of the National Endowment for the Arts voted to approve  $155,000 in grants Saturday to two art galleries that sparked an ongoing  obscenity debate last year, while postponing a decision on funding for two  controversial performance artists in a new dispute over conflict of interest by  NEA grant reviewers.  </P> <P> However, the actions by the National Council on the Arts appeared to have  fallen far short of the panel's apparent goal of mollifying NEA critics, both  on the political right and among artists and arts sympathizers.  </P> <P> Top staff aides to two key conservative congressmen said any benefit was  effectively offset by a new focus on longstanding problems of conflict of  interest in NEA grant-making.  </P> <P> Observers from the offices of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) and Rep. Dick  Armey (R-Texas) monitored the NEA meeting throughout the day.  </P> <P> The council delayed voting on federal grants for the two New York performance  artists, Karen Finley and Holly Hughes, until their work is reconsidered by a  new panel of their peers. The vote to ask the peer panel to reconsider the  applications was 10 to 6.  </P> <P> Technically, the council voted to require a brand new grant review for five  questioned grants, including those for Finley and Hughes. The new review will  not be completed until November -- long after the final expected vote on NEA  bills in Congress this year.  </P> <P> David Chambers, a Yale School of Drama professor and chairman of the NEA's top  theater program policy panel, charged that NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer  wanted to "corral anything that might be construed as controversial."  </P> <P> Council member Harvey Lichtenstein, director of the Brooklyn Academy of Music,  delivered an impassioned defense of Finley, a lightning rod of conservative  criticism. "There is no way that one can comprehend art by reading about it,"  Lichtenstein said of the controversy, which has been fanned by racy  descriptions of Finley's stage technique in the press.  </P> <P> "The only way to experience art is face-to-face," he said. "Yes, she smears  chocolate on her body. Yes, she puts gelatin in her bra. It was not obscene. It  was funny. She was professional. She was adept."  </P> <P> Artists and gay rights groups immediately accused the arts agency of  manufacturing a "bogus" excuse to sidestep funding for Finley and Hughes.  </P> <P> An official of one of the art galleries that received new funding said the  actions of the NEA advisory board -- on which Frohnmayer has the final say --  represented a "mixed message" to artists and the nation.  </P> <P> Votes on the grants came during a tumultuous, daylong meeting here in which gay  rights and arts freedom demonstrators disrupted the gathering, carrying signs  and chanting: "NEA do your part! We demand more homo art!"  </P> <P> More than a dozen demonstrators were removed by police, but no charges were  filed. About 250 people marched outside.  </P> <P> Frohnmayer had little better luck in keeping peace on the council as factions  clashed repeatedly. At one point, arts council member Phyllis Berney asked  Susan Lubowsky, the NEA official explaining one of the grant proposals, "Is  there an artist in this particular group who will immediately inflame the  public?"  </P> <P> A flustered Lubowsky answered no, but Frohnmayer disclosed that he had  personally screened the work of 10 artists to be included in the Awards in the  Visual Arts show, apparently to make sure the selections were devoid of  controversial work.  </P> <P> A total of $80,000 went to the Institute for Contemporary Art at the University  of Pennsylvania, which last year organized a show of work by the late  photographer Robert Mapplethorpe that resulted in the obscenity prosecution of  a Cincinnati gallery. The show opened to new controversy in Boston last week.  </P> <P> The vote reversed a decision taken three months ago, in which the council  withheld the money in an earlier ill-fated attempt to placate congressional  opponents of the arts agency. The National Council on the Arts has advisory  power within the arts endowment. Its votes are not binding on Frohnmayer, but  are almost never set aside.  </P> <P> Another $75,000 was voted for the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in  Winston-Salem, N.C., for the 1990 edition of an touring art show. Last year's  show was a center of controversy because it included a photograph of a crucifix  immersed in urine.  </P> <P> Judith Tannenbaum, assistant director of the Institute for Contemporary Art,  said the mix of grant votes by the 24-member presidentially appointed arts  council "leaves it really ambiguous" in terms of what political or artistic  message -- and to whom -- the NEA was attempting to send.  </P> <P> The conflict-of-interest issue led to the vote to ask a reconsideration of five  of 52 grants proposed for funding in an NEA program that specializes in  cutting-edge work. The action had been closely watched because Finley and  Hughes were recommended for funding despite an earlier move by Frohnmayer to  cancel grants to the two women and to California performance artists Tim Miller  and John Fleck.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, The Times reported that the five new grants were involved in a  conflict-of-interest situation long troublesome to the NEA -- in which grant  review panel members are simultaneously also applicants for money. Frohnmayer  acknowledged Friday that the situation needed correction and announced a new  policy curtailing the practice.  </P> <P> Hughes had been proposed for a $15,000 grant through New York's Downtown Art  Co. for a production called "No Trace of the Blond," in which grant panel  member Ellen Sebastian is a collaborator. Finley was involved in a grant under  which she and musician Jerry Hunt -- a grant panel member -- would create a new  production.  </P> <P> Hughes, a lesbian artist who attended Saturday's arts council meeting,  contended the decision to defer action on grants for her and Finley "is a bogus  thing. They (Frohnmayer and the NEA) are looking for a reason because they do  not want to fund openly lesbian, gay art or art that deals with sexual  politics."  </P> <P> Staff writer Don Shannon contributed to this story.  </P></p>

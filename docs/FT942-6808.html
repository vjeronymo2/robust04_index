			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Conference on stability skips Balkan problems The European Union yesterday got its new 'conference on stability' in eastern Europe and the Baltics under way, at the price of setting aside contentious Balkan issues, including disputes between Greece and Albania and Italy and Slovenia. Two regional round tables dealing with central European and Baltic issues would be convened 'at the earliest opportunity' by the EU, as part of 'a new impetus' agreed by the foreign ministers and officials from more than 40 participating countries, whose aim is to settle ethnic and border disputes before the former communist states enter the Union. The general consensus was reached despite rumbling disagreements. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, said Russia, which sees itself as the protector of the rights of ethnic Russians, was awaiting full details of the composition and scope of the Baltic round table before deciding. Slovenia, which aspires to EU membership, was struck off the list of full participants at the insistence of the new Italian government. Rome's refusal to discuss border issues with its Slav neighbours was criticised by Mr Lojze Peterle, Slovenia's foreign minister, but he agreed to continue bilateral talks. At the closing session Albania's foreign minister, Mr Alfred Serreqi, attacked the Greek government for 'dangerous and unacceptable manipulation' of the Greek minority in Albania. But Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greece's European affairs minister, used his position as EU president and conference chairman to overrule the Albanian complaint.</p>

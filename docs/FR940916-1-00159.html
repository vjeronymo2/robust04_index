			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Any special weight distribution that would require special train handling procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The number and location of cars whose brakes are cut out.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The distance that the train has travelled since its last Class 1 brake system test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) If a Class 1 brake system test is required prior to the next crew change point, the location at which that test shall be performed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) A record of train configuration changes since the last Class 1 test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Any train brake system problems encountered by the previous crew.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A railroad shall communicate this information to a train crew coming on duty in accordance with the procedures developed in paragraph (a) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;232.805  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Train brake system monitoring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) A railroad shall develop, implement, and make available to FRA upon request written procedures requiring its engineers to monitor the performance of the train brake system enroute. At a minimum, the engineer shall:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) On trains equipped with an air flow indicator or a two-way end-of-train device, frequently monitor the brake pipe pressure gradient, the air flow rate to the brake pipe and the response of the rear car to service brake applications. If unusual changes occur, the engineer shall investigate the cause.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) On trains equipped with dynamic brakes, monitor the amperage produced or any other indicators of dynamic brake performance when the dynamic brake is applied. If the amperage produced indicates a less than fully functional dynamic brake, the engineer shall use appropriate train handling procedures that compensate for the reduced dynamic brake performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) On trains equipped with wheel-temperature sensors, brake application force sensors, brake pad/shoe thickness sensors, or other technology that monitors performance of the train brake system, the output of the sensors shall be displayed in the cab of the controlling locomotive and monitored by the engineer. If the sensors detect a train brake system problem, the engineer shall take the corrective action required in the railroad's written procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Any problems uncovered by train brake system monitoring shall be reported by the train information handling procedures described in &sect;232.803.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;232.807  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Air brakes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The automatic air brake shall not be depended upon to hold equipment standing on a grade (including a locomotive, cars, or train whether a locomotive is attached or detached from the cars or train). A sufficient number of handbrakes shall be applied to hold such equipment before the air brakes may be released, and the handbrakes shall not be released until it is known that the air brake system is properly charged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A railroad shall set the maximum main reservoir working pressure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The maximum brake pipe pressure shall not be greater than 15 psi less than the air compressor governor starting or loading pressure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;232.809  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Tread brakes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Tread brakes shall be operated so that all continuous-drag braking applications limit the average brake horsepower (Bhp) input per wheel to the following amounts:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) 20 Bhp or less for equipment with 28-inch diameter wheels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) 25 Bhp or less for equipment with 33-inch diameter wheels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) 30 Bhp or less for equipment with 36-inch diameter wheels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) 35 Bhp or less for equipment with 38-inch diameter wheels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) 40 Bhp or less for equipment with 40-inch diameter wheels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Tread brakes shall be operated so that all non-emergency stop braking applications limit the average brake horsepower input per wheel to the following amounts:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) 80 Bhp or less for equipment with 28-inch diameter wheels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) 100 BHp or less for equipment with 33-inch diameter wheels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) 120 Bhp or less for equipment with 36-inch diameter wheels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) 140 Bhp or less for equipment with 38-inch diameter wheels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) 160 Bhp or less for equipment with 40-inch diameter wheels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;232.811  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Dynamic brakes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) A railroad operating a train with a brake system that includes dynamic, blended, or other forms of non-friction (tread or disc) brakes shall develop, implement, and make available to FRA upon request written operating rules governing safe train handling procedures using these non-friction brakes under all operating conditions, which shall be tailored to the specific equipment and territory of the railroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A railroad's operating rules shall be based on the ability of friction brakes alone to safely stop the train under all operating conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The operating rules may provide that a train may continue to operate to the next point where a Class 1 test is required after an enroute failure of the dynamic or other non-friction component of the train brake system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;232.813  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Two-way end-of-train devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) A railroad shall calibrate a two-way end-of-train device in accordance with manufacturer's specifications annually.

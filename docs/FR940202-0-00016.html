			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. OTS Transition Provision for PMSRs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed transition provision would permit grandfathered PMSRs that ``run-off'' to be replaced without loss of grandfathered status if certain criteria are satisfied. Many commenters agreed with the proposed transition provisions for PMSRs. Several commenters recommended that the grandfathering provisions become effective as of January 28, 1991 (the effective date of the FDIC's PMSR rule, 12 CFR 325.5) rather than February 9, 1990 (the date of publication of the FDIC PMSR proposal for that rule) or on the effective date of this regulation. One commenter suggested that the OTS consider allowing large servicers to replace PMSR run-offs to minimize economic loss to institutions from depletion of assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule retains the February 9, 1990, grandfathering date. This grandfathering date was used in the FDIC's PMSR rule, which was applicable to both savings associations and state nonmember banks until the enactment of section 475 in FDICIA. The OTS believes that no distinction between large and small servicers is warranted. The OTS has, however, retained the discretion to extend, on a case-by-case basis, grandfathered treatment to all or some of an association's newly acquired PMSRs if purchased to replace grandfathered PMSRs that have prepaid or otherwise run off. This approach is designed to mitigate harm to associations from precipitous drops in the level of their PMSR portfolios. Because mortgage servicing is a business that has relatively high fixed costs, its profitability is highly sensitive to achieving and maintaining a certain volume of servicing. This transition treatment will only be available if the OTS determines that: (1) The association is phasing down PMSRs as a percentage of capital at an acceptable rate, and (2) such treatment would be consistent with the association's safe and sound operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. CDI Treatment and Grandfathering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS has previously allowed certain CDIs to be included in assets and capital provided that they are conservatively valued and meet the three-part test articulated in section 567.5(a)(2)(ii). The OTS is concerned that excluding all CDIs from capital might impose an artificial regulatory barrier to sound mergers and acquisitions. The proposed uniform interagency proposal specifically excluded CDIs from qualifying intangible assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eleven commenters objected to the proposed treatment of CDIs and argued that CDIs should be treated as qualifying intangible assets. One commenter urged the OTS to apply the three-part test to CDIs, with periodic reviews of CDIs and continuous evaluations of CDI amortization. Another commenter proposed that the set of qualifying intangibles be expanded to include CDIs, and that CDIs and PCCRs be subjected to the sublimit of 25 percent of core capital, and that CDIs should only be deducted from capital for undercapitalized institutions. One commenter questioned the inclusion of the three-part test in the regulation if PMSRs and PCCRs are the only acceptable qualifying intangibles. Another commenter recommended that CDIs existing at the time the proposal is finalized be grandfathered as a component of core capital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To minimize confusion, all the banking agencies agreed to delete the three-part test from their capital regulations and guidelines. Although the three criteria are no longer part of the agencies' regulations and guidelines, they may be used in the future to determine whether other intangibles should be added to the definition of qualifying intangible assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the interest of interagency uniformity, the OTS is changing its current policy on CDIs and will henceforth no longer treat CDIs as qualifying intangibles. The OTS is also rescinding Thrift Bulletin No. 38&hyph;1 regarding CDIs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OTS, however, will grandfather CDIs that result from prior transactions or that will arise from transactions that are under firm contract as of the effective date of this rule. Nongrandfathered CDIs shall be deducted from assets and capital in computing core capital. No CDIs or PCCRs are included in tangible capital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters suggested that CDIs should not be subject to the requirements for annual and quarterly market valuations, quarterly determinations of book value, and value limitations set forth in 12 CFR 567.12(d), (e), and (f), respectively. They also said that these assets should be recorded in accordance with GAAP. In response to those comments, the OTS is modifying its treatment of grandfathered CDIs to require associations to apply GAAP. The OTS, however, will require associations to use credible and supportable assumptions in applying GAAP to CDIs not deducted from assets and capital. Valuing CDIs depends upon assumptions regarding interest rates for alternative funding, costs other than interest associated with the core deposit base, the decay rate for an acquired customer base, and a discount rate. The amortization rate should be adjusted each year for changes in experienced and expected decay in the acquired customer base. Typically, the decay rate in the customer base is greater in the early years. The OTS may restrict an association's inclusion of grandfathered CDIs in capital if the OTS determines that the association is not using prudent valuation assumptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

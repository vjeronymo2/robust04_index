			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (13): Draining the economy - Privatisation, few concrete achievements SLOW PROGRESS in the privatisation programme is probably the chief criticism of the government's economic policy. Parastatal reform has been on the agenda since the late 1980s but concrete achievements are few. These include the sale of 30 per cent of the shares in the state-owned Kenya Commercial Bank, and measures to restructure Kenya Airways, including the retrenchment of 1,000 employees. State-owned enterprise looms large in the Kenya economy, with an 11 per cent share of gross domestic product. There are 255 commercially-oriented enterprises, with the state having a majority shareholding in more than half of them. The largest single activity is manufacturing, where the public sector accounts for about one-third of national output. Some 60 per cent of the parastatals are engaged in manufacturing and mining, especially food and beverages; 18 per cent in distribution, and 15 per cent in finance. Average wages in parastatals are roughly twice the national average, though the national figure is biased downwards by low incomes in agriculture. Productivity levels are estimated to be significantly lower in state-owned than in privately-owned businesses, implying that the country would benefit substantially from privatisation. The public sector is a drain on the economy in two other vital respects: Parastatal losses account for approximately 20 per cent of the budget deficit, while their borrowings make up 17 per cent of Kenya's foreign debt. Government borrowing to sustain state enterprise has contributed to rapid inflation and higher interest rates than would otherwise have been necessary. Critics say the important weaknesses of the government's reform policy have been the absence both of a coherent overall strategy and of political commitment. This has changed. In April last year the Cabinet approved a parastatal reform programme, and in the July budget, plans were announced to divest 139 state-owned companies while cutting back on financial support to the sector. In mid-year, Maxwell Stamp consultants concluded a study of Kenya Posts and Telecommunications and will provide technical assistance for restructuring. A high level Parastatal Reform Programme Committee (PRPC) has been created, and a new post at permanent secretary rank in the president's office to oversee parastatal reform. At the Paris donor's meeting in December, the government tabled a detailed action plan of measures to be introduced during 1992 and provided a checklist of benchmarks against which they can measure the pace of reform. Parastatals have been classified into three groups: strategic, non-strategic and regulatory. Strategic enterprises such as Kenya Railways and the Ports Authority are being restructured with the aim of improving productivity. Non-strategic parastatals are to be divested 'in an orderly and transparent manner'. Many of the latter could - indeed should - have been sold off already. One reason this has not happened is that they are owned by state-owned financial institutions, established as venture capital operations, but which have become conglomerate holding companies. They are only too happy to have successful privately-managed companies in their portfolios to compensate for loss-makers. In spite of this, the government says 32 investments have been divested or are in the process of being sold off, while 14 have been liquidated and 22 classified as 'consistent loss makers on the verge of bankruptcy'. Independent valuations are being prepared for a number of companies in which existing joint-venture partners have shown an interest in buying equity, including Eveready Batteries, Firestone and Grindlays Bank International. Shares in 10 companies - including East Africa Oxygen, East African Portland Cement and BAT Development - are to be sold off through the Nairobi stock exchange by the end of the year, while competitive bids are to be sought for three other companies - Kenya Film, the Milling Corporation of Kenya and Kenya Cashew Nuts. Government shareholdings in a third list of nine enterprises, including CMB Packaging, East African Match and Grindlays Bank International, are to be sold following discussions with existing shareholders. A good deal of the criticism of the pace of privatisation fails to take account of the familiar constraints that exist in a developing economy - a shallow capital market with a weak stock exchange; a reluctance to sell 'the family jewels' to foreigners and, more specifically, to Kenyan Asians whose economic clout is resented. The government action plan shows just how much highly technical preparatory work must be done before companies are sold off, and the skills just are not readily available. Kenya, which has been such a haven for donors in the past, will become happy hunting ground for international consulting groups with expertise in corporate restructuring and privatisation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Japan-U.S. economic consultations are to face a  major hurdle this week, with the vice ministerial-level meeting  on automobiles and auto parts -- the issue of most concern in  the economic framework talks -- to be held in Tokyo for four  days from 11 January.    Jeffrey Garten, U.S. under secretary of commerce, who  represents the U.S. Government, wants to meet with top  executives of major auto manufacturers like Toyota Motor  Corporation while in Japan, in order to talk directly with the  industry on the question of buying U.S.-made parts--the question  on which government-level talks are making no headway. The  Japanese Government, on the other hand, wants to reaffirm its  position of not adopting any plans on procuring U.S.-made parts  for 1995 and thereafter.    Meanwhile, in the area of construction, while the deadline  for the U.S. Government deciding whether to retaliate against  Japan or not is drawing near to 20 January, informal  working-level talks have started in Tokyo, and the Japanese  Government will make final efforts to prevent eventual  retaliation.    Under Secretary Garten will meet with Japanese Government  officials like Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice minister for  international trade and industry, in the formal talks, but has  also asked to meet with people like Tatsuro Toyoda, president of  Toyota Motor, and Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of Honda Motor  Company. He claims the primary purpose of the meeting is to  hear auto industry views, but it is possible he will personally  ask the industry to expand the purchase of U.S.-made products.  Specifically, the United States is hopeful that Japan's plan of  buying "about $19 billion in 1994" will be continued into 1995  and thereafter.    On the contrary, the Japanese Government is poised to reject  continued setting of such a purchase plan in the vice  ministerial-level meeting. Even on the question of setting  objective criteria as a way of measuring the extent of market  liberalization, the government will persist in the position:  "Criteria that can lead to agreeing on targets cannot be  accepted" (to quote an official of the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry).    In fact, Under Secretary of State Spero, who is one of the  U.S. officials in charge of the framework talks, arrived before  Under Secretary of Commerce Garten; and during her 10-12 January  stay, is due to meet with people from political and business  circles like Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of  Economic Organizations of Japan [Keidanren], as well as Deputy  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hatoyama. In the meetings, she is  expected to urge facilitation of the framework talks, while  calling for prompt action to stimulate the economy.    Some people interpret this position of U.S. officials  wanting  to deal directly with Japanese industry, as a "revelation of  mistrust in Japanese bureaucrats," and government offices like  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Finance are becoming  alarmed.    One goal in the economic framework talks is to enable the  Japan-U.S. summit--to be held in Washington on 11 February--to  announce an agreement on the three top priority areas of  automobiles and auto parts, insurance, and government  procurements. Both the Japanese and U.S. Governments agree that  "by all means, we must come to a successful conclusion" (to  quote an official of the Foreign Ministry), but, so far, not  much progress has been made even though only one month is left  before the summit.</p>

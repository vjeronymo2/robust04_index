Shashkin; UDC 621.37/39:534]    [Abstract] When developing dispersion delay lines (DDL) on  surface acoustic waves (SAW) with 90 reflecting structures,  in order to obtain amplitude-frequency characteristic of a  specified form, a weighing is used by changing the position of  individual reflecting elements. This method is called a phase  weighing method. The method is based on lowering the amplitude  of the reflected wave by shifting two adjoining elements into  opposite directions. In this study, the phase weighing method  was used for constructing DDL with slanted reflecting structures  made with grooves. A diagram of such DDL using a SAW with  inclined reflecting structures is provided. Two types of DDL  made with YZ- LiNbO[.sup]3[/] were constructed and their  parameters and functioning is described. Interdigital  transducers with equidistant electrodes were employed for the  DDL. The first type transducer contained four pairs of digits  and the second type contained ten pairs. The amplitude-frequency  characteristics and the shape of the compressed pulse at the  ouput of both types of the DDL are shown in graphs. It was  demonstrated that the method of phase weighing is very effective  for obtaining the DDL amplitude-frequency characteristic of a  specified configuration.

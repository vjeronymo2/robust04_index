			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Nairobi, 21 Apr (AFP) -- The UN Assistance  Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) confirmed Thursday [21 April] that  rebel forces had captured the northern town of Byumba, as  fighting and ethnic killing continued in the east African  nation. The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) had announced the  capture of Byumba, about 35 kilometers (20 miles) north of the  capital Kigali, the Mutura area in the northeast and part of the  eastern Buganza area in radio reports. Pro-rebel Radio Muhabura  also claimed that the rebels had made gains in Kigali and  surrounded the northwestern town of Ruhengeri, where it said  government troops could be "flushed out any time."    A UNAMIR spokesman, contacted by telephone from Nairobi,  said  he could confirm the Byumba capture but there was not enough  information to comment on the other claims. "Yes, I can confirm  (Byumba), I have seen the reports of our observers," he said,  adding that there had been sporadic artillery and small arms  fire in Kigali Thursday morning in the eastern part of the city.  The spokesman, who asked not to be identified by name, said  sporadic small arms and mortar fire were continuing in the  eastern party of the capital Thursday.    The official Rwandan Army admitted earlier this week that a  column of around 1,000 RPF reinforcements passing through the  Byumba region had managed to link up with the 600 RPF soldiers  stationed in Kigali under the terms of an earlier peace  agreement.

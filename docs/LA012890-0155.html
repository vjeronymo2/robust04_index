			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> While many Orange County residents will be firmly entrenched in front of a  television set today to watch the Super Bowl (kickoff is set for 2 p.m.),  members of the Vietnamese community will be celebrating their New Year in the  streets of Westminster. The Tet Festival, which began Saturday, features  exhibits, entertainment and ethnic food.  </P> <P> There will be carnival rides, dancing and a fashion show as well.  </P> <P> This year's event ushers in "The Year of the Horse," and about 250,000 people  are expected to attend. Officials say it is not unusual for celebrants in  Vietnam to take the whole month off to usher in the new year. The local  festival's purpose, they say, is threefold: to remind young Vietnamese people  of their heritage, to share the Vietnamese culture with the Western community  and to bring tourists to the Little Saigon section of Westminster.  </P> <P> The festival is from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. today on Bolsa Avenue, between Magnolia  and Brookhurst streets. The event is free and open to the public.  </P></p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / International Company News: Cartel body rejects ZF takeover of GM division THE German Federal Cartel Office has rejected the planned takeover of General Motors' Allison transmission division by Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen, the German automotive supplier, Reuter reports from Berlin. The takeover would have created a leading business worldwide in terms of its range, technological competence and its service and sales network, the office said. It added that ZF was a leading international supplier of drive, steering and wheel technology with group turnover of almost DM6bn (Dollars 3.7bn), while Allison's domestic sales made up only 1 per cent of its total turnover of more than Dollars 800m. With the strong market position of ZF and the already high degree of concentration, any further amalgamation would have represented a considerable deterioration in competition, the office maintained. It said ZF had already announced it would appeal. Dr Klaus Bleyer, chief executive, of ZF, said the deal promoted 'ZF's long-term strategy of providing world-class powertrain products to a global customer base'.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Japanese banking Yesterday's call from Japan's banks for a further dose of deregulation does not indicate mass conversion to free-market economics. But it does say a fair amount about the tight conditions in which the banks find themselves. Ironically, one of the problems is the liberalisation last month of deposit rates. Banks are now free to compete for deposits, with the result that funding costs are set to increase sharply. On top of this comes the effect of rising interest rates: traditionally, Japanese banks find they have to raise savings rates faster than they are able to put up lending rates. Moreover, with most corporations still busy paying off debt, banks have little hope of expanding their loan books. The banks' reaction has been to urge the ministry of finance to enact 80 separate deregulatory measures. Some, such as the extension of the maximum period for certificates of deposit, are designed to give them greater freedom in how they raise funds. Others would allow them to move into higher margin businesses such as selling insurance and investment trusts. The cautious ministry may well be tempted to respond to the banks' pleas with half-measures. But half-measures could merely store up trouble, as the ministry's deregulation of deposits shows. Some group or other will feel disadvantaged and press for more liberalisation to compensate. Whether it likes it or not, the ministry may eventually find itself driven to accept full-blooded deregulation.</p>

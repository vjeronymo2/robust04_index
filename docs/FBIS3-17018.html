			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ramazan Abdulatipov, deputy chairman of the </F> Russian Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council: "Accord  Has To Be the Expression of the Will of Specific Social Forces"]    [Text] The attempts to sign some kind of document on  social accord here, in Moscow, will at best mean reconciliation  among the branches of power. There have already been such  attempts, and they came to nothing. As someone who has studied  sociology, I consider that an accord, if it is possible, has to  be the expression of the will of the specific social, political,  and national forces which exist in society. Otherwise you can  sign documents, you can even get on friendly terms with one  another, but it won't bring accord because society itself will  be endlessly upset by conflict. A mechanism therefore has to be  found whereby this will may be expressed and formalized. I  would think we need to three to five statewide priorities around  which everyone could and must be united. Outside of those  priorities, you may argue and counter each other all you like,  but these three to five positions designed to preserve the  state, implement reforms, and avoid local or large-scale civil  clashes must be acknowledged by everyone.    Eveyone talks about accord today, but the word is given  different meanings. And everyone wants his understanding of it  to be adopted. Therefore what is actually often involved here  is not the securing of accord but a struggle to secure one's own  position. We need to stop fighting for our own position and try  to find expression for the will of the people to that  accord. I think that the president's Message, where there is an  attempt to give priority to strengthening the Russian state  system, could be a basis for this. The government program could  be a basis. And the memorandum adopted by the State Duma and  the Federation Council appeal likewise.    I have proposed before and do so now that there be convened  an assembly of the peoples and citizens of Russia of which  well-known figures from politics and culture, deputies,  representatives of national movements, representatives of the  regions, trade unions, and so forth will be members. And a  memorandum, a charter of national accord, which will define  priorities enabling civil peace to be maintained in the country  could be adopted as the basis of all the documents I have cited.</p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA FREEWAY  </P> <P> Less than a year ago, we Malibu commuters predicted daily traffic jams of great  magnitude and inconvenience. We knew, that when Caltrans started widening the  Ventura Freeway, thousands of Valley motorists would jam Pacific Coast Highway  and cause interminable traffic delays.  </P> <P> We were wrong!  </P> <P> In actuality, the PCH traffic is moving very nicely as construction continues  on the Ventura Freeway.  </P> <P> We thank you, Caltrans, for a great job of planning and execution.  </P> <P> GEARY STEFFEN  </P> <P> Malibu Township Council  </P></p>

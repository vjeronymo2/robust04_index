			<p>BFN     [Text] Rafah, 11 Jun (MENA)--Major General 'Abd-al-Raziq  al-Majayidah, commander of the Palestinian National Security  Forces, left Rafah today for the self-rule areas at the  instructions of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat to acquaint  himself with the security situation, the deployment of the  security forces in vital areas and at important installations,  and to prepare for the arrival in Jericho of 'Arafat and the  rest of the civilian Authority members.    Maj. Gen. al-Majayidah stressed the need for the donor  nations to provide funds to help the security forces perform  their duties and establish security and stability in the  self-rule areas and help the civilian departments to provide  utilities and infrastructure projects.    Economic experts estimate that the civilian authorities will  need approximately $25 million per month to cover the current  costs, in addition to the costs of building installations in the  initial stage of establishing a Palestinian state.    Meanwhile, 600 more personnel of the Palestinian National  Security Forces will arrive in Rafah this evening in preparation  for entry into the Gaza Strip tomorrow.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague June 10 (CTK) -- Tomas Jezek resigned today  from his position as chairman of the National Property Fund  (FNM), Privatisation Minister Jiri Skalicky told CTK. The  fund's presidium has named First Deputy Privatisation Minister  Roman Ceska the new chairman. Jezek's official reason was the  presumed legal incompatibility of the positions of FNM chairman  and chairman of the parliamentary Budget Committee, he said.    Jezek told CTK that he decided to resign "because of  untiring  attempts on the part of some FNM Presidium members, particularly  its chairman (Jiri Skalicky)" to get him to step down, and also  "in the interest of restoring normal working conditions at the  National Property Fund," which have recently been seriously  disrupted by "continuous attacks" on his person.    He added that his decision had also been influenced by the  fact that a proposal for a law on conflicts of interests has  been submitted to parliament under which, Jezek said, "I would  have had to put an end to my activities in the fund in the near  future anyway." The decision was facilitated also by the fact  that the privatisation process is "drawing to a close," he added.    The FNM Presidium today also decided to dismiss FNM  Vice-Chairmen Jan Princ and Jindrich Kapoun for failure to  fulfill duties towards the Presidium as members of the Executive  Committee, Skalicky reported.    Presidium members agreed that in order to carry out approved  privatisation projects more efficiently, the original system of  close cooperation between the fund and the Privatisation  Ministry should be reinstated, he continued. The Presidium  asked the new chairman to propose candidates to replace the  dismissed members of the Executive Committee at the next  Presidium session.    Karel Ledvinka, vice-chairman of the Civic Democratic  Alliance (ODA), told CTK that ODA had unanimously approved two  months ago a statement in which they recommended to Jezek that  if he was forced to make a decision "he should give priority to  his parliamentary mandate." ODA leaders believe that "with his  wisdom and range of knowledge (Jezek) would be most valuable as  chairman of the Budget Committee -- one of the most important  parliamentary committees," Ledvinka said. He added that the  final decision, however, rested entirely with Jezek alone.</p>

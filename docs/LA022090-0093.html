			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO CONSIDER MEDFLY PROPOSAL  </P> <P> The City Council tonight will take up a proposed resolution asking the state to  consider methods other than aerial pesticide spraying to eradicate the  Mediterranean fruit fly.  </P> <P> As proposed, the resolution stops short of asking the state to stop spraying  the area with malathion, as several other Orange County cities in the fruit fly  spraying zone have done.  </P> <P> Council members considered the resolution at a meeting earlier this month, but  action on it was postponed because they wanted more time to review it.  </P> <P> Councilman Don Bankhead suggested that the resolution be changed to take a  stronger stand against aerial spraying.  </P> <P> "Until the state has proven to us beyond a reasonable doubt . . . that  (malathion) is not hazardous to our health, the spraying should be postponed,"  he said.  </P> <P> Councilman Richard C. Ackerman said he supports the aerial spraying and would  vote against the resolution.  </P> <P> Fullerton resident Randall Toler, chairman of a local political organization  called the Green Party, asked the council in January to adopt a resolution  opposing the spraying.TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

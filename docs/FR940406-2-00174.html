In addition &sect;35.107 of the ADA regulations (28 CFR part 35) requires that a public entity that employs 50 or more persons shall designate at least one employee to coordinate its efforts to comply with the ADA, including investigation of any complaint alleging its noncompliance or alleging any prohibited actions. Such persons are frequently identified as ``ADA Coordinators'' by State or local governments. According to the most recent (1987) report of the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately 7,665 counties, municipalities, and townships that have 50 or more full-time employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title II requires public entities to evaluate their current services, policies, and practices to identify and correct any that are not consistent with the requirements of Title II. State and local ADA Coordinators and government policymakers are responsible for ensuring that the self-evaluations are carried out. To ensure that these self-evaluations are appropriately carried out and the necessary changes made, State and local ADA Coordinators and government policymakers need information and training about the requirements of the ADA and policy developments in the field.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Priority  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An ADA training project for State and local ADA coordinators and policymakers shall_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify and select for direct training State and local ADA coordinators and government policymakers from every Federal Region of the country, including those from urban, rural, and suburban areas, and ensuring the broad representation of local governments where a majority of the citizens are from minority backgrounds;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify and select for training organizations whose members are policymakers in State and local government with responsibilities for complying with the ADA;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Develop a strategy and a schedule for directly training State and local ADA coordinators and policymakers as well as the membership and staff of selected organizations using a variety of approaches including, but not limited to, on-site training, regional, State, and local meetings, teleconferences, and audioconferences;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Utilizing existing federally-approved materials to the maximum extent appropriate, develop an array of training materials and activities that vary in length and content in order to accommodate the information and scheduling needs of selected coordinators and organizations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provide training to selected State and local ADA coordinators, policymakers and members of organizations on the responsibilities of State and local governments under Title II of the ADA and in order to assist State and local governments to undertake their self-evaluation plans and make the changes needed to comply with the ADA;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To the maximum extent possible, utilize as trainers those individuals with disabilities who have been trained as trainers by a NIDRR, EEOC, or DOJ technical assistance or training project;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For the length of the project provide selected coordinators, policymakers and organizations with quarterly ADA information updates, before and after training, regarding legal and policy developments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Priority 5: ADA Training for Hispanics With Rights and Duties Under the ADA Whose Proficiency in English Is Limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Hispanic population in the U.S. totals approximately 22 million people, or 9.0 percent of the population. By the year 2010, the Hispanic population is expected to become the second-largest racial/ethnic group (National Council of La Raza Census Information Center, Hispanic Population Factsheet, November 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Welsh initiative to be extended THE GOVERNMENT is extending its so-called Valleys Initiative by a further five years until 1998. Announcing the move in the Commons yesterday, Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, said it would result in more than Pounds 1bn being pumped into those parts of south Wales worst affected by the departure of heavy industry. It was unclear whether any of the promised funds would constitute new money that would not have been spent if the programme had not been extended. But Mr Hunt said Mr Bruce Millan, the EC regional policy commissioner, had agreed to talks about targeting the valleys as a special area for EC purposes. Any EC funds flowing to the region as a result of such talks would be additional. Public funding under the initiative during the five years which ended on Wednesday totalled about Pounds 770m. Hailing the 'extensive' achievements of the programme since it was initiated, Mr Hunt signalled his intention to move away from centrally managed projects towards schemes driven by local communities. He said the programme's extension would be marked by 'a distinct change in style'. He was encouraged by the establishment of a valleys' forum in an effort to give a 'unified voice' to regional organisations. Among a string of individual projects, Mr Hunt said that more than Pounds 9m would be invested over five years in new community hospitals at Ebbw Vale and Torfaen. Priority would be given to developing improved transport links between this area and Cardiff Bay. An 'urban village' is to be developed on the site of the Ebbw Vale national garden festival. Mr Paul Murphy, Labour Welsh spokesman, said MPs would need to examine the plans in 'great detail' to see how much new money was involved. His theme was developed by Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader and MP for Islwyn, who said Mr Hunt's statement was in many respects 'a re-announcement of other re-announcements'.</p>

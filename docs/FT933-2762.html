			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Contract agreed at Ford FORD Motor and the United Auto Workers union in the US yesterday announced tentative agreement on a three-year labour contract. This paves the way for what may be tense contract negotiations between the union and troubled General Motors. The UAW chose Ford as its first target in its contract negotiations with each of the big three Detroit motor manufacturers this autumn. The union will now try to impose the contract pattern reached with the target company on the other two big motor manufacturers, Chrysler and GM.</p>

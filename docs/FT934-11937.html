			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Bosnia mini-state proposal alive, says mediator THE GENEVA proposal to divide Bosnia into three ethnic mini-states is still alive, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, UN mediator, said yesterday. However, he added that a new London peace conference on the Balkans was unlikely to get under way this year. Such a conference was premature in the absence of a western vision for the Balkans, on the one hand, and continuing clashes in Bosnia on the other. Mr Stoltenberg's pessimism was echoed yesterday at the United Nations. Mr Joe Sills, spokesman for Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, said there had to be careful preparation as well as the backing of both the European Community and the Security Council. There would also have to be considerable advance towards agreement 'because you don't go in with everything still pending, hoping it will be solved at the conference', Mr Sills said. Struggling to inject new momentum into the peace process, Mr Stoltenberg and Lord Owen, his EC counterpart, appear to have opted for back-room discussions between the warring parties. In the absence of formal peace talks, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, has sought to legitimise Serbia's dominant military position in Bosnia. Mr Milosevic appears convinced that a peace agreement, made before any new conference, would formalise his 'victory' and hasten the lifting of United Nations sanctions against Serbia. The sanctions, imposed 17 months ago, coupled with two years of war, have devastated Serbia's economy. Yesterday, a government official in Belgrade revealed that the monthly inflation rate for October for the rump Yugoslavia totalled a record high of 1,896 per cent. 'This means that the inflation rate for the last 12 months totalled 20m per cent,' the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted Ms Mirjana Rankovic, assistant director general of the federal bureau of statistics, as saying. She said the daily inflation rate for October totalled 10.5 per cent and was the worst in the world since the second world war. Ms Rankovic said the inflation rate was boosted mainly by the soaring costs of services which increased by 2,896 per cent over September. The head of the bureau of statistics, Mr Dragutin Grupkovic, said last week all other economic trends in Yugoslavia would deteriorate dramatically by the end of the year. Statistical data showed that the country's gross domestic product would not exceed Dollars 12bn, less than one third of last year's figure, he said.</p>

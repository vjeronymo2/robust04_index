			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Provisions of the Interim Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The minimum laboratory testing fee was reduced from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $17.10 to $8.55. The original minimum fee published on August 9,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993, was based on current commodity product grading and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection fees which specify a minimum one-half hour charge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, some laboratory analyses applying to dairy product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grading can be performed within a one-quarter hour and therefore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would incur a corresponding $8.55 fee. The laboratory tests with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a revised one-quarter hour charge are listed as follows: (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Titratable acidity, (2) density or specific gravity, (3) scorched  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particles, (4) net weight per can, and (5) flavor. Analysis time includes the allotted periods for sample tracking, reagent and standard solution preparation, sample preparation and laboratory bench analysis, cleanup, analytical result determination and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretation with supervisory review, and the time for issuing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a test report. The individual laboratory test fee determinations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this rule must necessarily include the length of time spent on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests performed for quality control, quality assurance, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proficiency testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The schedules of consolidated fees and charges for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single analyte testings were established in the rule published on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August 9, 1993, based on the reasoning that there is, in general,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparable complexity of procedures and similar methodology for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different commodities and their products. However, some standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods or tests for the examination of dairy products have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dissimilar process for testing a given analyte, shorter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, decreased complexity of reagent and materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation, reduced analyst manipulations with samples and their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derivatives, fewer measurements, and/or a lower degree of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretation required. Consequently, these dairy tests are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less complex and would justify a reduction of the fee. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory fees for dairy products that were lowered in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim final rule because the tests are less complex are as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows: (1) Fat (cheese), (2) fat (dairy products except cheese), (3) salt titration, (4) peroxide value, (5) free fatty acid, (6) solubility index, (7) whey protein nitrogen, (8) vitamin A (dry milk products), (9) alkalinity of ash, (10) antibiotic, (11) complete Kohman, (12) direct microscopic clump count, (13) proteolytic count, (14) coliform, and (15)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Step 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Discussion of Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the issuance of the interim final rule on May 10, 1994, only one response was received from another agency within the Department (the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service). That response persuaded the Agricultural Marketing Service to reconsider its fee for flavor in the fee schedule in Table 3 of the earlier rule (58 FR 42408&hyph;42448) of August 9, 1993. The response stated that the flavor test fee is too high for testing flavors in dairy products and that a reduction of the flavor analysis fee for dairy products from a three-quarter hour charge to a one-quarter hour charge or lower be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The flavor test charge of three-quarter hour or $25.65 was not specifically directed to dairy products nor modified with the interim final rule issuance. Our records show that 8,900 flavor tests of dairy products were conducted in the Science Division Midwestern Laboratory during Fiscal Year 1993. There was only a limited number of additional flavor testings of dairy products by the Resident Dairy Graders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency agrees with the respondent's recommendation regarding the dairy flavor test fee. Therefore, the flavor test for dairy products in Table 3 is set at the recommended minimum one-quarter hour charge or corresponding $8.55 fee. Flavor tests for other products will remain at the three-quarter hour charge or $25.65. The one-quarter hour charge is adequate for the dairy flavor test since a battery of other laboratory tests are usually performed in conjunction with this sensory analysis which involve the same preliminary sample preparation steps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Effective Date of Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is found that good cause that exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The interim final rule provided a comment period, and the only comment received was from an agency within the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) That comment persuaded the Science Division to lower the dairy flavor test fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) For the benefit of those using the test, the lower fee should become effective immediately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Lists of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 58  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Food grades and standards, Dairy products, Food labeling, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 91  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commodities, Fees and charges, Laboratories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 93  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Citrus fruits, Fruit juices, Fruits, Laboratories, Nuts,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vegetable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 94  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eggs and egg products, Laboratories, Poultry and poultry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

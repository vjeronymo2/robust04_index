			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Arts: Not Weill done In the long list of Kurt Weill works demanding revival, the anti-war satire Johnny Johnson stands near the top. As his first completely American music-theatre piece it occupies a special place in his output; for its heartfelt conviction it deserves a sympathetic staging. Alas, Thursday's eagerly-anticipated production by Trinity College of Music's company A Moveable Feast fell far short of the mark. The naive directness of Johnny Johnson, premiered on Broadway in 1936, makes it a child of its time. Weill had settled in New York the year before as a refugee from Nazi Germany, and yet he found it in him to espouse the pacifist message - the soldier Johnny tries to halt the first world war by dosing its generals with laughing gas - of his librettist Paul Green. This performance at the Rudolf Steiner Theatre was billed as the 'British premiere', perhaps because previous airings in London have been less than complete. There were cuts here too, though they were not to blame for the evening's lack of impact. Nothing of the score's pungency came across under the American conductor Rhonda Kess. She seemed content to beat time listlessly, and the 12-piece band responded with caution: all the numbers had a sameness about them. Kess was also credited with the stage direction, though there was little to be seen. Her production relied on slapstick humour and hammy accents rather than mad-comic intensity. Pamela Glynn's minimal designs included flags, and maps of Flanders and France in the shape of headstones. At least Dawn Kellogg's costumes were effective. The student performers deserved better guidance than they got. Johnny (Sean Sweeney) was miscast - he may have little to sing, but the poignant 'Johnny's Song' needs a strong voice. Lianne-Marie Skriniar was touching as Johnny's sweetheart Minnie-Belle, and David Watters turned in an effective cameo as the Cowboy in the trenches. Johnny Johnson still awaits a serious revival. Oddly, this production was funded by the Weill Foundation.</p>

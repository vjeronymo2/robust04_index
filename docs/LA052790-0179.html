			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: BONDS NOT AS RISK-FREE AS THEY MAY APPEAR  </P> <P> The modern investment world, like the world of the ancient Greeks, has its  share of myths, one of which asserts that bonds and the mutual funds that  invest in them aren't very risky.  </P> <P> Actually, bond funds and other types of fixed-income securities can be quite  perilous. In certain cases, they can be more volatile than stocks.  </P> <P> That might surprise some people. Many bond fund shareholders aren't aware of,  or choose to ignore, the downside potential of their portfolios.  </P> <P> Usually, however, the market won't let them turn a blind eye forever. "You can  tell people about risk, but until they feel it in their wallet, they might not  recognize it," says Robert Rodriguez, portfolio manager of the FPA New Income  Fund in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> What's needed is an understanding of the types of risks that investors assume  when they put money into a bond fund. There are several varieties of dangers,  and they don't apply to all categories of fixed-income portfolios to the same  degree.  </P> <P> Take credit risk, perhaps the most obvious type of danger. This measures a  borrower's ability to pay back principal when due and make all interest  payments on schedule. In other words, it estimates how likely an issuer would  be to default on its debts.  </P> <P> Several rating services evaluate the financial strength of corporations and  municipalities (state and local governments) and rate their bonds accordingly.  Standard &amp; Poor's, for example, ranks bonds from AAA down to D (for issues  in default). Anything below BBB is considered speculative, "junk" or  "high-yield" debt. Why high-yield? Because riskier issuers must offer a higher  interest rate on their bonds to entice investors to buy them.  </P> <P> Just keep in mind that higher yields won't necessarily translate into superior  total returns. When bonds prices fall, for whatever reason, that can more than  offset the interest income received, resulting in a net loss for the holder.  </P> <P> That's been happening lately to junk bond mutual funds, many of which have  fallen flat on their faces despite paying double-digit yields. "Many fund  investors look too closely at yield when they should be focusing on total  return instead," notes Dave Schulz, manager of the Milwaukee-based Newton  Income Fund.  </P> <P> For all practical purposes, Treasury bonds and other debt issues directly  backed by Washington carry no risk of default.  </P> <P> But it doesn't mean these bonds are necessarily "safe." Some people assume that  government securities and the funds that hold them can't drop in price. Not so.  All bonds, even Treasuries, fluctuate according to interest rate movements.  Picture a seesaw with interest rates on one seat and bond prices on the other.  When one goes up, the other goes down.  </P> <P> Individual bonds, and thus bond funds, carry different amounts of interest rate  risk. Several factors come into play, especially time remaining until a bond  matures. That is, long-term bonds drop more sharply than short-term ones when  there's an increase in the general level of rates.  </P> <P> The Benham fund group of Mountain View, Calif., provides an example. When  market interest rates rise by 1 percentage point, a one-year Treasury will drop  in value by roughly 1%, a 10-year Treasury will decline by 6.5% or so and a  30-year will tumble 10%. But if rates ease by one percentage point, the reverse  would happen: Prices would climb by about the same magnitude.  </P> <P> When shopping for fixed-income funds, inquire about the "average maturity,"  expressed in years, of the bonds held. The annual report may list this  information, or you can check with a representative of the fund company.  </P> <P> You might also ask about the portfolio's "duration," a more accurate measure of  interest rate risk, Schulz says. Trying to calculate duration can get  complicated, so just keep in mind that lower numbers represent less volatility.  Newton Income, for example, has a duration of 3, which indicates that the  fund's price would rise or fall by a modest 3% or so if rates changed by one  percentage point, Schulz says.  </P> <P> Portfolios with relatively long average maturities of, say, 20 years or more  will expose you to greater interest rate risk, for better or worse. Short-term  funds, which hold bonds coming due within a year or two, offer the most price  stability. The trade-off, of course, is that short-term funds usually pay lower  yields and don't rise as much during a bond market rally.  </P> <P> Credit and interest rate risk are the big ones. But bond fund investors face  additional dangers. These include:  </P> <P> * Currency risk. Portfolios that hold foreign debt securities usually slip in  value if the U.S. dollar rises. Conversely, a declining greenback tends to push  up the prices of international bonds and bond funds.  </P> <P> Ironically, many advisers recommend having some exposure to foreign bonds,  because this can increase your overall diversification and profit potential.  Think of it this way: If you don't have any foreign holdings, you're  essentially betting that the U.S. bond market will post the best returns in the  world in any given year. That rarely happens.  </P> <P> * "Call" risk. This is the threat that a bond might be redeemed by the issuer  before maturity. In return for having to surrender the bond, the holder  typically receives a payment that includes a slight premium to the face value.  </P> <P> Is this bad? It can be, because issuers usually call bonds only after interest  rates have dropped, allowing them to replace costly debt with bonds paying  lower rates.  </P> <P> Corporate bonds that face possible calls in the near future might not  appreciate much in a bond market rally. "You don't get the same upside price  movement on corporates as with governments, which generally aren't callable,"  says George Stasen, chief operating officer of the Rushmore group in Bethesda,  Md., which offers a mutual fund that holds nothing but Treasury bonds.  </P> <P> In fact, governments as a group have slightly outperformed higher-rated  corporate bonds on a total-return basis from 1972 on, Stasen says, citing  numbers supplied by Shearson Lehman Hutton. That's odd, because corporates  carry credit risk and thus should offer higher returns to compensate investors.  Stasen attributes this anomaly to the fact that corporates, unlike Treasuries  and many other government issues, can be called away, depriving investors of  market profits.  </P> <P> Certain municipal bonds also face call risk. In fact, some observers estimate  that 20% to 40% of the current supply of munis could be retired prematurely by  the mid-1990s. If so, that might cause problems for investors in tax-free bond  funds. A broker can tell you whether a specific bond has call provisions, but  it's harder to size up an entire mutual fund.  </P> <P> Clearly, the bond market isn't monolithic; different types of debt carry  different degrees of risk. "There's a lot to be said for the flexibility to  move between fixed-income sectors," says Rodriguez, who can do so in the FPA  New Income Fund. "Few people realize that when they invest in a specific type  of bond fund, they're really investing in a narrow sector portfolio."  </P> <P> That's a good argument for holding a couple of types of bond funds, or at least  one that can move around as the risk-return trade-off changes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BOND RISK  </P> <P> What makes some bond funds more risky than others? Usually, the more volatile  portfolios hold a large proportion of long-term bonds, lower-rated issues or a  combination of the two.  </P> <P> The following table lists some of the lowest- and highest-risk bond funds  around, as identified by Mutual Fund Values, a publication of Morningstar Inc.  in Chicago. Significantly, portfolios in the latter group tend to have more  erratic long-term returns. However, this doesn't mean volatile fixed-income  funds necessarily make less suitable investments -- that depends on each  person's tolerance for risk.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LOWER-RISK FUNDS  </P> <P> Name: Smith Barney Income Return (800) 544-7835  </P> <P> Types of Bonds Held: Governments, top-rated corporates  </P> <P> Five-Year Total Return: +49%  </P> <P> Sales Charge: 1.25%  </P> <P> Minimum Investment: $10,000  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: T.

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Imro registration system changes Imro, the self-regulating body for the fund management industry, yesterday issued a consultation document proposing rules that require individuals employed by member firms to register individually with it. The system is aimed at identifying individuals who are either incompetent or who have been dismissed by their employer for wrongdoing, and preventing them from finding employment with another firm. 'Imro believes that investors will be better protected against wrongdoing and incompetence and that members too will benefit through the identification and, where necessary, removal of individuals who cannot meet the required standards,' the body said. The document, which invites comment by February 25, describes the mechanisms by which individual registration will be introduced and the changes needed. Imro said it was 'aware of the need to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy and costs and will introduce the system with the minimum amount of complexity and paperwork'.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Consumer borrowing up: Credit demand strongest since 1990 - Money supply reflects growth in spending CONSUMERS are shaking off debt fears and borrowing more from building societies, retailers and on credit cards, official statistics indicated yesterday. Credit business figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that consumers borrowed a net Pounds 225m in August, the highest figure since July 1991. It compares with Pounds 204m in July. Net lending to consumers has been rising erratically since August last year. However, the figures account for only about 10 per cent of total consumer borrowing as they do not include bank overdrafts or mortgages. Nonetheless, they are a useful indication of willingness to borrow for goods that include cars. In the three months to August, consumers borrowed a net Pounds 642m compared with Pounds 508m in the previous three months. The seasonally-adjusted figures suggest demand for credit is stronger now than at any time since the end of 1990. It is still weaker than in 1989 and 1990 when quarterly net lending figures were as high as Pounds 900m. In August much of the increase in net lending was generated by finance houses, responsible for many car loans and hire purchase agreements. Consumers borrowed a net Pounds 298m from finance houses, the highest amount since March 1989. It compares with Pounds 189m in July. Consumers borrowed a net Pounds 16m of unsecured loans from building societies in August, compared with Pounds 6m in July. They repaid a net Pounds 89m on Visa and Mastercard credit cards. This compares with net borrowing of Pounds 9m in July. Much of the pick-up in demand for credit since the beginning of the year has been in finance houses. Credit card and building society components have been more sluggish. The amount of new credit advanced to consumers rose to Pounds 4.68bn in August, up from Pounds 4.46bn in July. In the three months to August, new credit advanced to consumers rose to Pounds 13.83bn from Pounds 13.35bn in the previous three months. A rise in new credit advanced by finance houses accounted for most of the increase.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>   [Text] A large number of our country's pilgrims have  returned to Iran during the past few days after their pilgrimage  to the house of God. Even though our countries' pilgrims were  not allowed by the Saudi regime to carry out their  political-religious ceremony of the disavowal of pagans, their  self-restraint and the meaningless silence of the pilgrims from  Iran and the other Islamic countries were the best ways to  awaken the Muslims of the world.    Saudi Arabia's prevention of the Ibrahimite ceremony of the  disavowal of pagans and the silence that spread during the Hajj  ceremonies because of it will undoubtedly have their impact.  The non-Iranian pilgrims will ask themselves the reason for the  police atmosphere that ruled the ceremonies and the policy of  intimidating the pilgrims.    Despite the claim that it would not disrupt the pilgrims'  programs, the Saudi Government did create problems. After  returning to Tehran, the representative of the supreme leader  and the head of the Iranian pilgrims referred to the siege on  his mission and stated that this act by Saudi Arabia upset the  performance of the Hajj rites by the pilgrims. He added that  members of the mission were even prevented from entering Medina,  contrary to the agreement that had been reached.    The unfavorable atmosphere that upset the Hajj ceremonies  shows the weakness of the Saudi Government in managing the holy  shrines, and the news about this will undoubtedly not have good  consequences for the unfit custodian of the house of God. The  message from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia during this year's Hajj  and his unity-breaking remarks put an end to many doubts and  revealed the face of the major mentors of this regime, who  undoubtedly have a long record of plotting against the Muslims  in the region and in the world of Islam.    With the exposure of this behavior, the world of Islam will  ask itself whose hands the house of God is in and what meaning  this resistance against religious-political ceremonies and the  expression of disgust toward America and Israel will have. In  other words, the irresponsible acts by the Saudi Government  further disgraces those who have diverted from the true path in  Islamic society and doubles the brightness of the front of  justice. The repercussions that the obstructionist acts by the  Saudi police will have will not be very favorable, even in Saudi  society, and everyone will realize why the Saudi regime feared  the disavowal of pagans ceremony.    In view of regional developments and the compromise trend in  the Middle East, Islamic nations are facing more serious threats  and plots that will not only hold the perpetrators of discordant  acts answerable to history but will also list their acts among  the Muslims of the world as contrary to Islamic interests.</p>

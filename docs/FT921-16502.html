			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Technology: Height of fashion on the ski slopes - Worth Watching SKI wear is high fashion, and even the smallest item has to be carefully chosen. For those who even pay attention to their ski bindings the flashiest pair this year will almost undoubtedly come from Salomon, of Annecy. It has adopted a sublimation printing process, developed by fellow French company OTI, to decorate the mini clamps which hold boot to ski. The bindings are made from Du Pont's Delrin acetal resin. Decorative ink patterns are applied to the surface of the polymer at high temperatures - up to 300 deg C. This means that the ink completely penetrates the material so that the image is indelible. Contacts: Saloman: France, 50 65 414 41.  OTI: France, 50 52 10 10. Du Pont: UK, 0442 218500.</p>

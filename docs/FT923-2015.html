			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Housing market holds its breath AT 9 o'clock on Wednesday morning Abbey National launched a 10.5 per cent fixed-rate mortgage scheme offering to freeze payments until the end of the century. Six hours later the offer was sold out and closed. All the funds allocated for the scheme were used up in six hours, according to Abbey National. People who received their letters the following day missed out  - or did they? Customers who signed up for the Abbey offer, which must have looked a snip when base rates appeared set to rise to 15 per cent on Thursday, must now be wondering if they have got such a good deal. Mortgage lenders, instead of putting up rates, are now saying that they might even come down by 1 or 2 percentage points by Christmas. It has been that kind of week for home owners  - from despair, to relief, to hope, in less than two days. People who rang estate agents on Wednesday to pull out of a house purchase will this weekend be reconsidering whether to reopen the deal, try to renegotiate a lower price, start renting, or give up altogether and emigrate. Unfortunately, there is no clear answer to the conundrum. That will depend on which economic policies the government adopts in the wake of sterling's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism. There is no question what those who make their living from buying and selling houses want the chancellor to do: cut interest rates and then cut them again. Mr David Holliday, president of the House Builders Federation, says: 'The needs of the domestic economy must now be put first, and that means further reductions in interest rates from 10 per cent to 8 per cent or less.' Most builders, estate agents and, no doubt, many homeowners would be prepared to pay the price of higher inflation in return for letting sterling float and getting lower interest rates. The worst scenario for them will be if the government, in its pursuit of lower inflation, continues to maintain high real interest rates while letting the pound float. House prices and sales would continue to drift and recovery would be delayed for even longer. The market, meanwhile, remains flat on its back. Builders say that sales in September, even before this week's currency crisis, had been desperate. ECC, the world's biggest producer of china clay, this month announced a Pounds 13m provision, mostly to cover falling prices in its depressed UK housebuilding business. Mr Andrew Teare, its chief executive, says: 'It is every bit as bad as you could imagine it to be.' The events of this week will have pushed confidence even lower. 'I cannot see anybody wanting to rush out and buy a home at the moment,' says Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation. He says lower interest rates will not be enough on their own to kick-start the housing market. He wants the government to end stamp duty on house sales and raise the ceiling for mortgage tax relief. It is going to take a long time for confidence to return to the housing market, even assuming that interest rates come down. For a start, there will be a large backlog of repossessed homes to shift before the market can get anywhere near back to normality. People will also have to be convinced that they will not lose their job in a still weak British economy before going out and buying a new home; and the shock to home owners of watching their house price fall below the value of their mortgage is likely to blight the market for some time. House prices in southern England and East Anglia have fallen by between 25 per cent and 30 per cent on average since 1988-89. Even assuming that prices rise at an average 5 per cent a year from 1993, people who bought in the late 1980s will have to wait until next century to get their money back. Of course, prices could rise faster if inflation was allowed to let rip again, but there is no sign that the government has abandoned its aim of reducing inflation through monetary discipline. It is also worth remembering that the bottom of the last housing cycle was in 1981 and that it was not until the mid to late 1980s that prices really began to take off again. All those thoughts will be crowding the minds of people vacillating this weekend over whether to complete that house purchase after all. Whichever way the government jumps, a rise in sales is unlikely to start before next year. Even then, volumes will have to increase substantially before prices start recovering. History may show that the housing recovery began with Britain's withdrawal from the ERM, but it is going to be a very long haul back.</p>

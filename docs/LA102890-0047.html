			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS  </P> <P> With prices climbing both in the United States and overseas, American travelers  are looking for bargains as never before. To encourage visitors, British Travel  Associates has listed 50 hotels in London at rates of $50 or less per person.  The schedule goes into effect Thursday. Includes breakfast, taxes, service.  These hotels are in central London. Near underground/bus stops. Rooms must be  booked a minimum of 20 days before departure from the United States. Minimum  stays: three nights.  </P> <P> Contact British Travel Associates, P.O. Box 299, Elkton, Va. 22827, (800)  327-6097.  </P> <P> At Home in London: Four years ago, Londoner Maggie Dobson began enlisting a  network of families (Kensington to Kew Gardens) to serve as bed and breakfast  hosts in London after friends from abroad "despaired of finding a good place to  stay in London without breaking the bank." Her list has grown to 60 families.  Hosts include a banker, an attorney, a jeweler, journalists, an interior  designer. Dobson steers guests to homes that appeal to personal requests. And  for something totally different, she'll book you onto a houseboat moored on the  Thames. Rates at these B&amp;Bs starting in January will begin at 18 single  (about $36), 36 double, including booking fees, the usual full English  breakfast.  </P> <P> Brochures from the British Tourist Authority, 350 S. Figueroa St., Suite 450,  Los Angeles 90071, (213) 628-3525, or by writing to Dobson c/o At Home in  London, 70 Black Lion Lane, London W6 9BE, England.  </P> <P> Passports: While the number of Americans who will be traveling overseas in '91  is anyone's guess, Sakae M. Hawley of the U.S. Passport Agency is encouraging  travelers to apply for documents early. Her office gets crowded after Jan. 1.  Long lines, long waits. Busy hours are noontime/late afternoon. Apply at the  U.S. Passport Agency, 11000 Wilshire Blvd., 13th Floor, West Los Angeles.  Hours: 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Applications are available at  county courthouses, post offices. You'll need proof of citizenship, a driver's  license, birth certificate, a couple of passport photos measuring two inches  square.  </P> <P> For recorded instructions, call (213) 575-7070.  </P> <P> Roman Holiday: I continue to get inquiries about my favorite pension in Rome,  the Scalinata di Spagna. Lorraine Adams of Fontana is the latest caller. Says  she lost the address. Write to Scalinata di Spagna, Piazza Trinita dei Monte  17, 00187, Rome, Italy. The Scalinata is at the top of the Spanish Steps,  directly across the piazza from the Hassler Hotel. Ten rooms. An excellent  location, especially for shoppers. Several of Rome's finest clothing stores do  business in this area. American Express operates an office at the bottom of the  Spanish Steps. A number of good restaurants nearby. Ask the proprietors of the  Scalinata for restaurant/shopping recommendations. (Be sure to visit the roof  garden. Stunning views of the city.) The Scalinata is within walking distance  of Piazza Navonna, Rome's loveliest square, as well as St. Peter's, other  attractions.  </P> <P> San Francisco: A glowing report from Kristin Schwarz of Villa Park about the  Juliana Hotel in San Francisco: "On a recent trip, the Juliana provided all the  extras to make my business trip more like a mini-vacation -- things like a  lighted makeup mirror and coffee makers in the room. Even limousine service to  the Financial District. The hotel has a warm, homey feel -- all the charm of a  B&amp;B with the pluses of a hotel. I have a new home away from home." Schwarz  calls the Juliana the "perfect businesswoman's hotel."  </P> <P> I checked it out by telephone. It's 1 1/2 blocks off Union Square, a block from  Chinatown and a block from the Powell Street cable car that runs to Fisherman's  Wharf. Rates: $107 single/double, $135 for junior suites. Corporate rates:  $95/$125, including complimentary wine each evening, continental breakfast.  </P> <P> The Juliana Hotel, 590 Bush St., San Francisco 94108.

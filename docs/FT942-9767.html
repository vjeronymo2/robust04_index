			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bridge Oil rejects ADollars 294m bid Bridge Oil, the Sydney-based oil and gas company, yesterday described as 'totally inadequate' a ADollars 294m (USDollars 211.5m) cash bid from Parker &amp; Parsley, the Texan oil independent. It recommended shareholders not to sell their holdings while directors examined all options. The board's rejection was widely expected, given that Mr Robert Strauss, the company chairman, had earlier this month told shareholders that a proper valuation of the company's US properties would imply a net asset backing for the company of more than ADollars 1 a share. Parker &amp; Parsley, which launched its offer on Wednesday, is bidding only 70 cents a share. On the stock market, Bridge shares - which were already standing ahead of the Parker &amp; Parsley offer price by Wednesday night - rose by a further 1 cent to 73 cents. There has been speculation that Parker &amp; Parsley will be obliged to raise its bid, or that other interested suitors may enter the fight. In launching the bid, Parker &amp; Parsley said its stake amounted to 4.2 per cent of its target's equity. Bridge's exploration and production operations are split between Australia and south-east Asia, and the US - with the Australian activities centred on the Cooper, Surat and Carnavon Basins, and the US interests spanning five states. Expansion-minded US oil independents have shown growing interest in Australian oil and gas producers.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Apple restructuring will cut 2,500 jobs within a year APPLE Computer, which last month appointed a new chief executive, is to cut 2,500 jobs, reducing its workforce by more than 15 per cent, and carry out a broad restructuring over the next year. Yesterday's announcement confirms widespread speculation that the US personal computer company would make severe cutbacks to reduce costs and boost flagging profit margins as competition intensifies. Apple will take charges to cover the costs of redundancies in the current quarter although it provided no estimate of the amount. Analysts, however, calculate the charges could be well over Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) and result in a loss for the quarter. Most of the redundancies will occur this month. The company provided no details of its restructuring plans which it said would be revealed later this month. Apple is expected to report its third-quarter earnings next week. Mr Michael Spindler, Apple's new chief executive, who took over from Mr John Sculley last month, was unavailable for comment on his first decisive action. Mr Sculley, who remains Apple chairman, is on sabbatical. However, the restructuring is expected to affect all divisions of the company and the company's administrative operations may be particularly vulnerable. Last month, Mr Sculley warned that Apple's earnings in the second half of fiscal 1993 would fall below last year's levels. He said the company would take 'aggressive' actions to boost sales and 'appropriate' actions to create earnings growth. Apple's main problem is that its line of Macintosh desktop computers is no longer gaining market share in spite of aggressive price-cutting. The company faces intensifying competition from standard PCs based on Intel chips running Microsoft's Windows software. Mr Spindler's appointment is widely seen as a move to focus Apple's top management more directly on its current problems. Mr Sculley had shown greater interest in building new business opportunities for Apple in the emerging field of multi-media communications. Later this summer, Apple is expected to introduce 'Newton' its long-awaited 'personal digital assistant', a pocket-sized device.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Peta Firth] </F>   [Text] Beijing's publication yesterday of a white paper on  intellectual property protection has been dismissed as a  whitewash. XINHUA, the official China news agency, yesterday  announced the publication of the white paper-just two weeks  ahead of a United States deadline, after which China faces a  Special 301 investigation and possible trade sanctions. The  Business Software Alliance (BSA) fears the white paper is merely  propaganda and has urged the U.S. to go ahead with its Special  301 action.    The white paper concentrates on underlining the measures  Beijing has already taken to protect copyright on the mainland.  It also admits that education is needed because "some portions  of the population, have a rather incomplete understanding of  intellectual property rights". The paper also said mainland  authorities were encouraging "invention and other forms of  creation" to alleviate the need to pirate goods.    However, the BSA and an official from the Hong Kong  government's Intellectual Property Department both said  yesterday the mainland authorities were slow to take up offers  of advice on how to implement the laws or educate the  population. Vice-president of the BSA Stephanie Mitchell, said  the Chinese were insincere in their attempts to stamp out  piracy, and that the BSA had offered Chinese officials and  judges training, in how to recognise and deal with copyright  infringement. There was also a BSA offer of technical  assistance on how to prove, for example, a software program is  pirated, she said. The offers were first made some months ago  and have been repeated on an "on going basis".    As yet there had been no response from the Chinese side, Ms  Mitchell said. There had been no tangible progress in cutting  piracy on the mainland despite the passing of the new  Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), Ms Mitchell said. Recent  raids on shops selling counterfeit goods were orchestrated by  the propaganda division of the Chinese Communist Party, she  claimed. It was "disheartening" that the judiciary and  government IPR departments were still failing to deal with the  problem, Ms Mitchell said. Beijing had also failed to come up  with any prosecutions for any of the cases filed by the BSA with  the state Intellectual Property Tribunal, she said: "They have  been terribly slow in processing the cases. We have seen no  practical results."    The number of cases of copyright infringement continues  unabated despite high profile raids on some shops.</p>

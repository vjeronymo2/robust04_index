			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CAPRIATI AND NAVRATILOVA WIN, WILL MEET IN FINAL  </P> <P> American teen-ager Jennifer Capriati continued to live up to her billing  Saturday by reaching her second final in only her third tournament since  turning professional last month.  </P> <P> The unseeded 14-year-old overwhelmed sixth-seeded Natalia Zvereva of the Soviet  Union, 6-0, 6-4, in 57 minutes to earn a shot at Martina Navratilova, who is 19  years older than Capriati, in the final of the $500,000 Family Circle Magazine  Cup at Hilton Head Island, S.C.  </P> <P> Navratilova, seeded first and a three-time champion in the tournament,  eliminated unseeded Regina Rajchrtova of Czechoslovakia, 6-4, 6-3, without  losing a service game.  </P> <P> "I always dreamed I would get to the finals of a pro tournament playing  Martina. I'm really happy. She's a legend," said Capriati, who lost in her  first final appearance to third-ranked Gabriela Sabatini last month.  </P> <P> Capriati raced through the first set against the 14th-ranked Zvereva in 17  minutes by rushing the net and repeatedly scoring with volley winners.  </P> <P> Zvereva finally held serve in the second game of the second set and managed to  break Capriati in the fifth game to lead 3-2.  </P> <P> Capriati won the next three games to go up, 5-3, and after dropping her serve  in the ninth game, she broke Zvereva to close out her victory.  </P> <P> Navratilova was unable to go to her usual attacking game on the slow, green  clay and instead relied on nearly error-free shot-making to control points on  her serve.  </P> <P> Third-seeded Christo van Rensburg of South Africa defeated David Pate, 6-7  (2-7), 6-3, 7-5, to advance to the final of a $250,000 tournament in Orlando,  Fla.  </P> <P> In today's final, van Rensberg will play top-seeded Brad Gilbert, who defeated  qualifier MaliVai Washington, 6-2, 7-5.  </P> <P> Gilbert has a 4-0 record against van Rensburg.  </P> <P> Van Rensburg broke Pate in the 11th game of the third set when Pate netted a  forehand volley.  </P> <P> Andre Chesnokov defeated Andre Agassi, 6-4, 6-7 (7-4), 6-2, as part of the  Forum Tennis challenge.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: BRITISH HUMOR RANKLES THE HOITY-TOITY IN N.Y.  </P> <P> "IF YOU would succeed, you must not be too good," goes the Italian proverb.  </P> <P> The British are very different from us Americans. Yes, they are. I am not  writing this to poke fun at them, either -- I wouldn't want to insult people I  like and admire, such as Nigel Dempster of the London Daily Mail, or Anna  Wintour of Vogue, or Tina Brown of Vanity Fair.  </P> <P> The two top editor ladies tossed a very nice party last week at 150 Wooster  Street in New York for their gossip columnist pal, Nigel, who is in the Big  Apple to promote his book on the late Tina Onassis, "Heiress." But I am writing  this to point out that sometimes, when it comes to British and American mores,  never the twain shall meet.  </P> <P> On the party night, Wintour and Brown had invited a gang of Class A talents and  literary "Masters of the Universe." As you've no doubt read, the urbane and  polished Dempster stood up to toast his glamorous hostesses and in so doing, he  introduced a male friend, who he said had "murdered Christina Onassis" and then  another, who had "taken her virginity." When this didn't draw such a big yuk  from the barbaric Americans on hand, Nigel repeated some of it. There were  embarrassed titters.  </P> <P> One lady left the room for the bar. Numbers of others came up to me after to  protest Nigel's bad manners. (I guess I AM responsible for the behavior of all  my naughty fellows. At least I figure when one IS a gossip columnist going to a  gala for another gossip columnist, one shouldn't act too hoity-toity.) I tried  to explain that all this was just the English manner of fun and games. Twitting  one's friends insultingly, writing about the aristocracy in the most awful way,  expressing the unexpressable -- all as a joke.  </P> <P> It was macho Brit time for Nigel and his friends. But it still didn't sit well  with the New York gaggle of editors, writers, publishers and what-have-you. New  York is perhaps too fraught -- and perhaps too hypocritical to "get real." Most  of the folks on hand didn't even know the late Tina Onassis, but after all, she  IS tragically dead at a young age. To make fun of her seemed a bit much, some  said.  </P> <P> Incidentally, Dempster's book is bang-up and first-rate, head and shoulders  above his rather, but oh-so-British, juvenile after-dinner remarks. But then,  Americans are so supersensitive. After all, most of us have never had titles to  protect us.  </P> <P> IRVING LAZAR has tossed another thunderbolt and brought another talent onto the  writing scene. He got close to a million bucks from Putnam for a book to be  written by Barbara Sinatra, to be titled, "The Luckiest Girl in the World/Life  With Frank Sinatra."  </P> <P> The beautiful blond Mrs. S. has done yeoman work for battered and abused  children and maybe she will throw caution to the winds when she sits down at  her word processor to tell us what it is like to live cheek by jowl with  Himself.  </P> <P> LENORE HERSHEY, the veteran one-time editor of the Ladies Home Journal, decided  she would enter Esquire's short story contest, open to one and all, sponsored  by Absolut vodka. Well, out of 1,400 entries, Lenore won with her steamy and  sexy tale of political romance that she titled "Absolut Discretion." You can  read this in the December issue while Lenore sits, proud as a peacock and  gloating over all those whippersnappers she beat to the finish line.  </P></p>

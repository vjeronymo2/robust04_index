The central issue  of their talks with all the political parties so far was the  rights of minorities in Romania. Our special correspondent  Judit Laszlo reports from Bucharest:    [Laszlo] The Democratic Party, led by former Prime Minister  Petre Roman, considers itself a social democratic party, though  a liberal one in economic matters. Therefore its program is  similar to the SZDSZ's program, Gabor Kuncze, parliamentary  deputy group leader of the SZDSZ, said. Minority rights have  also been on the agenda of their talks with Petre Roman. It is  Romania's primary interest to guarantee minority rights and to  avoid ethnic conflicts, the former Romanian prime minister said.    Senate President Oliviu Gherman also met the SZDSZ  delegation. He promised that Romanian legislation will, in the  near future, ratify the readmission agreement and agreements  concluded by the two countries on avoiding double taxation and  on the protection of investments. The issue of establishing a  Hungarian university is also on the agenda. The Romanian  negotiating party accepted the need for it but drew attention to  the difficulties of its realization, Kuncze said. He told the  chairman of the Senate that it would be desirable if Hungarians  in Romania could peacefully celebrate 15 March [anniversary of  the Hungarian revolution and war of independence in 1848]. A  Romanian extremist leader has recently called this celebration  an anti-Romanian action.    There was great understanding on political matters between  the Young Liberals--a party of the Civic Alliance--and the  SZDSZ, particularly with regard to the situation of Hungarians.  The leaders of the Romanian opposition expressed their views  that Romania's democratic future depends directly on a  responsible policy by the leadership of the Hungarian Democratic  Union of Romania [HDUR] and, last but not least, on the  statements of the Hungarian Government in power. The liberal  parties would also like HDUR not to monopolize the protection of  minorities. At the same time, other parties should also  undertake this issue. The SZDSZ delegation has agreed with this  idea.</p>

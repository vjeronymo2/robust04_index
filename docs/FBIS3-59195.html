			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Bonn/Karlsruhe (DPA) -- According to German  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, the UN mission in Somalia has  "gone awry." He admitted this at an FDP [Free Democratic Party]  function in Karlsruhe yesterday evening. He emphasized,  however, that 32 countries have attempted "to resolve this  terrible situation." One thing has been achieved after all:  "There is no more starvation there."    The Defense Ministry announced today that Chief of Staff  Klaus Naumann will open a dam south of Beledweyne on Sunday [30  January]. This is the last large project implemented with  German humanitarian aid provided by the support unit in Somalia.  [passage omitted]    The general will stay in Somalia until Tuesday. He is due to  meet high-ranking UN officials in Mogadishu. [passage omitted]    Kinkel defended UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  against recent criticism. Ghali is an "immensely committed man,  but far too much is asked of him." After the end of the  East-West conflict, the United Nations is no longer in a  position financially, organizationally, and regarding the  available manpower, to handle all problems of the modern world,  ranging from environmental to population problems. "We should  not criticize Butrus-Ghali, but support him," Kinkel said.</p>

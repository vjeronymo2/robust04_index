Comrade Li Changchun and Comrade Ma Zhongchen also discussed  with them specific ways and means of deepening reform and  fulfilling this year's economic tasks.    The forum was presided over by provincial vice Governor Fan  Qinchen and attended by Song Zhaosu, Zhang Honghua, Zhang  Shiying, Yu Jiahua, Yao Zhongmin, and some other provincial  leaders.    At the forum, city mayors and prefectural commissioners from  Nanyang Prefecture, Zhumadian Prefecture, Xinyang Prefecture,  Zhengzhou City, Luoyang City, Kaifeng City, and some other  cities and prefectures spoke one after another and reported  their work. They said that they were greatly encouraged by those  new reform measures promulgated by the state in 1994 but felt  greater pressure on their work at the same time. They pledged  to turn such pressure into a motivating force and make a success  of their work in 1994.    At the forum, provincial party committee Secretary Li  Changchun emphatically called for clearly viewing the situation,  bracing up, and developing the province's current good  situation. He said: The year 1994 will be an extraordinary  year in which we will be confronted with opportunities,  challenges, hopes, and difficulties. Successfully carrying out  work in 1994 will lay a solid foundation for us to attain the  strategic goal of raising Henan's gross national product to a  level higher than the country's average and lowering Henan's  population growth rate to a level lower than the country's  average by the end of the 1990's as well as achieve a  comparatively well-off standard of living at an earlier date.    This year, we should unswervingly adhere to the guiding  ideology of continually putting forth new ideas, grasping each  and every excellent opportunity, deepening reform, expanding  opening up, and accelerating development. We should also  properly handle relations between reform, development, and  stability, should regard development as the central task, reform  as the motive force, and stability as the basis, and should  firmly concentrate on these three aspects of work.    Speaking of development, Li Changchun noted: At present, we  are being confronted with the major contradiction of slow-paced  development, this being incompatible with the country's overall  development. In view of this situation, we should try to  acquire a thorough understanding of a series of propositions  made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, such as "development is the last  word" [fazhan cai shi ying daoli 4099 1455 2088 2508 4289 6670  3810], among others. We should firmly aim at the above-mentioned  strategic goal and strive to raise Henan's gross national  product to a level higher than the country's average and lower  Henan's population growth rate to a level lower than the  country's average on the basis of an optimized economic  structure and increased economic efficiency.    Li Changchun also called for implementing this strategic  goal  to the letter throughout the province by developing famous-brand  products, focusing on key economic areas, making energetic  efforts to obtain more state investment, overseas investment,  and domestic investment, and accelerating Henan's overall  development.    Speaking of reform, Li Changchun pointed out: We should  consider reform a powerful motive force behind economic growth.  Henan's practice over the past few years has fully proven that,  as long as local leaders follow a clear-cut train of thought in  the course of reform, economic development is bound to  accelerate in local areas. Reform is a shortcut which will  enable us to narrow the economic gap between Henan and the rest  of the country. Therefore, party committees and governments at  all levels in Henan should concentrate sufficient efforts on  studying reform, should promote development by virtue of reform,  should promote opening up by dint of development, and should  blaze a new trail in the course of development.    Speaking of stability, Li Changchun maintained: On one hand,  we should not simply try to maintain stability for the sake of  stability and should not refrain from speeding up reform; while,  on the other, we should understand that, along with the gradual  deepening of reform, we will surely come across new situations  and new problems. Thus, we should first try to perfect a social  security system by focusing on developing insurance businesses  tailored to the needs of elderly and unemployed people at  present, should provide proper assistance to staff and workers  of closed or partially closed enterprises, should provide proper  assistance to retired enterprise personnel, should tackle the  problem of the payment of teachers' wages, and should enable the  broad masses of the people to spend a happy Lunar New Year  Festival.</p>

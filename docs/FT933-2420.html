			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead Shareholders in Spring Ram await Wednesday's announcement of its interim results with a sense of foreboding. New chairman Roger Regan is likely to have ordered a harsh scrutiny of the troubled kitchens and bathrooms group's fortunes after being brought in by institutions following three profits warnings and a share price collapse. Analysts do not know what figures to expect, but will really be seeking reassurance that there are no black holes in the accounts of the fallen stock market favourite. Tesco, the UK's second biggest grocery retailer, is expected on Tuesday to announce a 6 per cent increase in interim profits from Pounds 253m to about Pounds 268m. The figures are expected to do little to improve market sentiment on Tesco, especially as its announcement could well be followed by further pessimistic observations from Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda about saturation in the UK food market, at that group's annual meeting on Wednesday. William Morrison Supermarkets, the supermarket chain based in the north and Scotland, reports on Thursday and is expected to lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 36.2m last time to between Pounds 43m and Pounds 45m this. The dividend is likely to be lifted from 0.16p to between 0.19p and 0.2p. MAI, the financial services group which reports annual profits on Monday, is expected to unveil a 9 per cent increase to about Pounds 78m at the pre-tax level. Shareholders are expected to be rewarded with a 10 per cent rise in the dividend to 6.6p. Hays, the business services group, is expected on Tuesday to report full-year profits of about Pounds 66m. Analysts had been going for up to Pounds 75m until the interim results in March, which were at the bottom end of expectations. Analysts are undecided about Thursday's half-year pre-tax results for Guinness, the brewing company, and have given forecasts of between Pounds 305m and Pounds 338m, against Pounds 353m, for the six months to June 30. A dividend of about 3.7p (3.35p) is expected. The market will be looking for progress in the company's Spanish beer operations and will be checking the size of any currency gain.</p>

The delegations were headed  by: on the Ukrainian side, Colonel General Ivan Oliynyk, deputy  defense minister of Ukraine and chief of armaments; on the  Kazakh side Major General Alibek Isymov, chief of the General  Staff of Kazakhstan's Armed Forces. The prospects for extending  cooperation and implementing agreements made at the level of the  countries' government delegations at the beginning of 1994 were  discussed.    A document was signed on the results of the meeting in  Almaty, in which the sides noted great interest in extending  contacts between the military departments of the two countries  on a wide range of issues. The principles of mutual respect and  mutual confidence are to be laid down in the foundations of  these relations. The Ukrainian side showed readiness for  military-technical and scientific cooperation in elaborating new  types of technology, modernizing armaments already in existence,  and developing the missile and space possibilities of the two  countries. The Kazakh side is interested in more intensive use  of the repair base in the interests of Kazakhstan's armed  forces. It is planned to finalize and make specific the nature  of mutual settlements and to study the possibility of  eliminating existing debts in the near future. As participants  of the meeting asserted, this type of bilateral contact  corresponds to the bilateral obligations and desires of both  Ukraine and Kazakhstan not to suppress the interests of a single  third country.</p>

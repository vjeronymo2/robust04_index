			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar commented this  morning on his recent trip:    [Begin Aranibar recording] I recently attended a meeting in  Paraguay of foreign ministers of the Urupabol [Permanent Joint  Commission of Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia]. The meeting was  held on 24 and 25 June in Asuncion, Paraguay. A joint  declaration will be released to the media. I would like to  point out two aspects: The meeting was the first effort of  countries of least development, like landlocked Paraguay and  Bolivia, to coordinate an exchange of views and eventually  develop mutually beneficial actions. The three countries  expressed their support for the efforts by the Fonplata [River  Plate Basin Development Fund] to improve its financial  conditions and thus contribute to the development of the three  countries. The three foreign ministers confirmed their full  support for the continuation of the Fonplata Permanent  Secretariat in Sucre, Bolivia. This issue created concern among  institutions and the Civic Committee of the Chuquisaca  Department which lead to a commitment by the Foreign Ministry  and the government to maintain the permanent secretariat  headquarters in Sucre. The declaration contains support by  Uruguay and Paraguay for the continuation of the permanent  secretariat headquarters in Sucre, Bolivia. [end recording]    That was Foreign Minister Aranibar's comments on his recent  trip to Paraguay to attend the Urupabol meeting.</p>

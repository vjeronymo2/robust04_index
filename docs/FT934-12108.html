			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Sir Richard Dobson: tough BAT team player: Obituary SIR Richard Dobson, former president of BAT Industries and former chairman of British Leyland, has died aged 79 after a career at the forefront of post-war British business. He joined BAT from Cambridge University in 1935. The company posted him to China where he remained until the outbreak of the second world war, during which he served in the Royal Air Force in the Middle East, Burma and Italy. On his return to BAT in 1946 he rose swiftly through the ranks. He was appointed to the board in 1955, became vice-chairman in 1968 and was made chairman in 1970, a post he held until 1976. Knighted that year, he was president until 1979. It was as chairman that his particular skills came to the attention of British Leyland. He was a tough team player in a diversifying multi-national group facing increasing pressure from the anti-smoking lobby. Sir Richard remained an unrepentant smoker of both pipes and cigarettes. British Leyland was at that time a state-owned company in all but name. So the appointment of a keen advocate of private enterprise attracted considerable publicity. But that was nothing compared with the controversy that surrounded his enforced departure only 18 months later. In a speech to a businessmen's supper club in September 1977, Sir Richard referred to 'wogs' as the recipients of BL bribes, and called trade unions 'bastards'. The leftwing son of a club member taped his remarks, and a Marxist journal called Socialist Challenge printed them. The Labour government found the ensuing scandal too hard to pass off as simply embarrassing. Sir Richard resigned. Sir Richard was also on the board of Exxon from 1975-84. He is survived by his wife Betty and one stepdaughter.</p>

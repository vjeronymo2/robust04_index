			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The prime minister said today that he expects  constitutional rights to be respected during the general strike  scheduled for tomorrow, with the right to work being respected  as well as the right to strike. Felipe Gonzalez added that the  day after the general strike, the government's policy will  remain the same as it is today. The prime minister made these  remarks at the end of a news conference he held with Finnish  Prime Minister Esko Aho at the Moncloa. Over to Pedro Fernandez  Cespedes.    [Cespedes] Good afternoon. Hours before the general strike,  Felipe Gonzalez has repeated his willingness to hold a dialogue  with the representatives of the social parties, with an open  mind. He will have the same attitude on the day after the  strike. This led Felipe Gonzalez to say that the strike does  not make sense. However, he also underlined that he cannot agree  to a bilateral negotiation -- that is to say a negotiation  [between government and trade unions] which would exclude  employers -- nor will he agree to withdraw the reform.    [Begin Gonzalez recording] We agree to change the result of  an agreement between the social parties. But we are not willing  -- and I will say it now and I will state it clearly -- to give  in to pressure that will harm the interests of our country, the  interests as we understand them to be, and as they are seen by  the majority of parliament. [end recording]    [Cespedes] According to the prime minister, the government  believes it has taken the necessary measures to guarantee both  the right to strike and the right to work, freely and without  coercion. Felipe Gonzalez hopes that everyone's behavior will  make this possible.</p>

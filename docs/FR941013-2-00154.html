Since that time, we have held intensive discussions with the Government of Japan to resolve the identified discriminatory practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sanctions were scheduled to go into effect on September 30, 1994. On October 1, 1994, the United States reached an agreement with the Government of Japan relating to procurement of telecommunications and medical technology goods and services, which will address the discrimination identified by the United States. The procurement measures to be implemented by the Government of Japan and an accompanying exchange of letters between the United States and Japan represent a significant change in Japanese Government practices in the procurement of telecommunications and medical technology goods and services and address all the major U.S. concerns in these sectors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the President of the United States by Presidential Determination No. 94&hyph;52 of September 29, 1994, I have determined that implementation of the agreement with Japan will eliminate the discrimination identified under Title VII and therefore terminated sanctions effective September 30, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 4, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Michael Kantor, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> United States Trade Representative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25352 Filed 10&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3190&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

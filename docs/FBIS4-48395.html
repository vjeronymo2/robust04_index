			<p>BFN     [Text] The proceedings of the first augmented consultative  council of the Rapid Intervention Police [RIP] ended in Luanda  yesterday. During the three-day meeting, participants examined  ways to improve the RIP's organizational and operational system.  The participants also examined [words indistinct], corruption  and self-image.    At the end of the meeting, the participants expressed  concern  over the operational situation because of the large-scale  actions carried out by the enemy against RIP's positions,  localities, and strategic targets; and the increasing crime rate  in the main cities, particularly Luanda. Deputy Police  Commissioner Bartolomeu Kifofo said the RIP's work is  commendable, despite some difficulties faced.    [Begin Kifofo recording] We know it is not easy to work  under  the present conditions. We do not, however, have another way  out, dear comrades. Over the past two years, we have been able  to overcome major difficulties. Today, we can say with pride  that, despite some failures because of lack of material  conditions, we have on the whole fulfilled our mission. [end  recording]</p>

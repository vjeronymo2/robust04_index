			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "Xinjiang News" </F> program]    [Text] Abulaiti Abudurexiti, chairman of the regional  government, yesterday afternoon presided over the 25th executive  meeting of the Eighth Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional  People's Government. The meeting transmitted the guidelines of  the State Council meeting on anticorruption and heard reports on  the state of the anticorruption struggle launched in this region  since August. The meeting also put forward specific demands for  anticorruption efforts in various government departments this  year.    Zhou Shengtao, member of the Standing Committee of the  regional party committee and secretary of the regional  commission for discipline inspection; Yusufu Aisha, vice  chairman of the regional government; and other leading comrades  attended the meeting.    Chairman Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: Since the major policy  decision made by the party Central Committee last August on  launching the anticorruption struggle, governments at various  levels in the autonomous region have attached great importance  to launching the struggle and have promptly made arrangements in  line with the central guidelines. We have achieved initial good  results in the anticorruption struggle. However, we must also  realize that the progress of our anticorruption struggle still  cannot keep up with the expectations of the broad masses. The  problem of the unhealthy tendencies of various trades and  professions has not been fundamentally solved, and the people  are still making complaints. This shows that the anticorruption  task is still very heavy, and so we must further strengthen our  leadership over the task.    Abulaiti Abudurexiti pointed out: We must further deepen the  anticorruption work this year and grasp the work in a solid  manner. First, we must continue to implement the five provisions  put forward by the party Central Committee last year to ensure  honesty in performing official duties by cadres at and above the  county, department, and bureau level. Second, we must implement  the five new provisions put forward by the party Central  Committee this year. A small number of leading comrades who have  not seriously carried out self-examination must take the  initiative to check their own behavior this year. Those who  have found irregularities but have not corrected the situation  must make corrections in a prompt manner.    Abulaiti Abudurexiti emphatically said: The key for leading  cadres' practicing self-discipline and being honest lies in  raising their consciousness. They should take lead in  implementing the first and second of the five provisions put  forward by the party Central Committee. They should adopt  effective measures to ensure honesty in performing official  duties in light of the existing problems. On the issue of  investigating and handling cases of violating law and  discipline, we must lay stress on investigating and handling  cases of violating law and discipline by cadres of leading  organs and judicial, administrative, and economic management  departments. We should let the masses see that we are resolved  to seriously solve the problem and realize the determination and  strength of our party and government in punishing corruption.    In conclusion, Abulaiti Abudurexiti asked leading cadres at  various levels to carry forward the fine traditions of the  party, be faithful public servants for the people, foster news  customs of being honest in performing their official duties,  create a good social environment, and make new contributions to  accelerating the pace of reform and opening up and to promoting  the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy.</p>

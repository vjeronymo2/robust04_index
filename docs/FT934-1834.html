			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Fledgling group aims to lift MAS  -Financial problems have dogged the airline In the early 1990s Malaysia Airlines (MAS) surprised the aviation world by announcing a multi-billion dollar aircraft purchase programme, at a time when the storm clouds of an industry recession were already gathering. As part of of its present five-year development plan, MAS has orders for 72 aircraft costing a total of MDollars 10.6bn (USDollars 4.16bn). Yesterday it was announced that another substantial tranche of shares previously held by the government would be transferred to the private sector. MAS clearly hopes the deal will pave the way to making the airline a leading international and regional carrier. 'We want to turn MAS into one of the super excellent airlines in the world in terms of schedules and services,' says Mr Kamaruddin Ahmad, MAS's managing director. But it is far from clear whether MAS's new controllers will be able to realise those ambitions and transform the flagging financial fortunes of one of south-east Asia's biggest carriers. With less government control, MAS could become a leaner, more market-oriented organisation. But there are worries about the viability of a deal which will see MAS pass into the hands of a group of investors with little experience of international airlines. There are also concerns about the financial health of what is one of the world's fastest-growing carriers. MAS began as Malaysian Airlines before the second world war. In the 1960s, it was known as Malaysia-Singapore Airlines. In the early 1970s, the organisation was split into MAS and Singapore Airlines (SIA). While SIA has become one of the world's most financially successful carriers, MAS has struggled to achieve profits, even though it carries more passengers than its neighbour and competitor. In 1992-93, MAS had pre-tax profits of MDollars 157m, less than half the MDollars 372m forecast when the airline raised USDollars 700m at the end of 1992 in what was Malaysia's biggest rights issue. Moreover, the profit included MDollars 337m from aircraft sales. If this had been stripped out, MAS would have recorded a loss of MDollars 180m. A 20 per cent increase in domestic fares together with a restructuring have so far failed to produce results. Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 1993 were MDollars 6.4m, a 96 per cent drop on the year-earlier period. While MAS points out that it is performing well compared with many other airlines, analysts say the carrier should be doing better, given that it is based in a region which is the world's fastest expanding passenger market. The International Air Transport Association says passenger traffic in south-east Asia is growing by more than 9 per cent a year, compared with less than 4 per cent in Europe and 5 per cent in North America. MAS's overall load factor, an important performance indicator, has dropped from 66 per cent in 1991-92 to 63 per cent in 1992-93. Too much capacity has been added on some routes while there is not enough on others. 'Bad planning and government interference have been the main problems at MAS,' says one analyst. 'The expansion plan was overly ambitious and timed over too short a period, causing considerable funding problems. 'Then the government has pushed MAS into opening routes to places like Mexico City and Johannesburg - more for political than commercial reasons. It also only recently allowed it to increase fares on loss-making domestic routes. A wholesale sort-out is urgently needed, including big cuts in staff numbers.' Malaysia Helicopter Services (MHS), the company that is acquiring the MAS shares, is a relatively small group involved in support services for the oil and gas industries. It has a stake in Pelangi Air, a small Malaysian carrier, and has been offered a share in a proposed second Malaysian carrier. MHS also recently announced that it was taking a 25 per cent stake in World Airways, the US passenger and cargo carrier, for Dollars 27.4m. But the company has little experience of the international airline business and there are doubts about its capacity to handle an airline of the size and complexity of MAS. There is also the question of just how independent of the government MAS's new controllers will be. MHS is known to have close connections to senior figures in government. One of the company's backers is said to be Mr Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister who is one of Malaysia's richest men and treasurer of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the country's dominant political party. Industry observers fear the government is being too hasty in taking advantage of the high MAS share price to sell its stake. 'The government will be ridding itself of what has become a financially troubled company', said one airline analyst. 'But the question is how much benefit will MAS get out of the exercise? I still think there are going to be troubled times ahead.'</p>

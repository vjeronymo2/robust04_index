			<p>BFN     [Text] REUTER reported tonight that President Glavkos  Kliridhis has said he will resign and proclaim presidential  elections at end of October if the UN Security Council decides  to continue talks on the confidence-building measures [CBM's].  REUTER added that President Kliridhis outlines this position in  letters to U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime  Minister John Major.    According to the letters, copies of which REUTER claims to  have obtained, President Kliridhis notes that the new president,  who would be free from the committments Mr. Kliridhis has  undertaken, would have to decide on the CBM's issue.    Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis announced today  that  President Kliridhis sent letters to President Clinton and Prime  Minister John Major. Mr. Kasoulidhis said that the letters aim  at promoting our side's positions and pointed out that the  United States and Britain are the two powers who recently moved  in the direction of continuing the CBM's process.    In a statement to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation]  tonight, the government spokesman reiterated his statement from  yesterday saying he does not know of President Kliridhis'  intention to resign and added that he is not aware of the  content of the letters.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 26 (CNA) -- Given that more and more  local industries have moved production lines to Southeast Asia,  the government has decided to strengthen its ties with civilian  trade groups there in a bid to offer better protection for  Taiwan investors in the region.    Economics Minister P.K. Chiang, who just returned from  Penang, Malaysia, where on Saturday [23 April] he attended the  first meeting of the Council of Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce  in Asia, said his ministry will do its best to push for the  signing of bilateral investment guarantee pacts and agreements  to avoid double taxation with every Southeast Asian country. It  will also seek to set up formal channels of dialogue and  communication with governments there.    The Economics Ministry estimated that at least 3,200  production lines of local manufacturers have been relocated in  Southeast Asian countries. Two-way trade between Taiwan and  those countries reached US$6.62 billion in the first quarter of  the year, a 9.3 percent increase over the same period last year.    According to statistics released by the cabinet-level  Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the number of ethnic  Chinese in Southeast Asia has surpassed 30 million, which  accounts for 86 percent of the total number of overseas Chinese.    In view of the huge number of ethnic Chinese in the region,  Chiang urged both state and Koumintang run enterprises to invest  in Southeast Asia to match the government's "southern strategy,"  which encourages local business people to invest in Southeast  Asia rather than in Mainland China.    THE ECONOMIST, a British news magazine, recently reported  that the economic strength of ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia  is of vital importance to the region. Ethnic Chinese in  Malaysia only make up one third of the total population there,  but they hold nearly 50 percent of listed stock shares.    Likewise, the Chinese minority in Indonesia accounts for  only  3 percent of the total population, but owns 70 percent of all  companies in the country. Except for the petroleum industry and  state-owned corporations, ethnic Chinese control about 50  percent of Indonesia's economy, the magazine said.    In Thailand, Chinese make up 12 percent of the population,  but control as much as 90 percent of the entire country's  capital. Fifty percent of Thailand's financial and banking  institutions are also under control of ethnic Chinese.    Given the prevailing economic strength of ethnic Chinese in  Southeast Asia, the government has begun paying attention to its  relations with ethnic Chinese population there while trying to  sell its "southern strategy."    In an effort to build warm relations between Taiwan  investors  and ethnic Chinese businessmen, Mainland Affairs Council  Chairman Huang Kun-hui and his deputy, Kao Koong-lian, will soon  visit countries in Southeast Asia to promote the southern policy.    By explaining the government's position and its strategies,  Huang and Kao hope to start a formula under which Taiwan  enterprises and ethnic Chinese communities in those countries  can break into the mainland Chinese market hand in hand.    The Mainland Affairs Council and the Economics Ministry will  also draw up new plans to jointly encourage more local  investments in southeast Asia.    Chiang said the government's southern strategy was not  designed to curb Taiwan investments in Mainland China, but is  meant to offer an alternative for Taiwan industries keen to  expand into overseas markets.</p>

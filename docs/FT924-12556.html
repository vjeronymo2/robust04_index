			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Unidanmark set to raise annual loss to DKr4bn UNIDANMARK, Denmark's second largest banking group, is heading for a DKr4bn (Dollars 700m) loss this year, more than double the 1991 DKr1.7bn deficit. The bank is raising supplementary capital from Danish institutional investors to prevent its capital adequacy ratio from falling below the country's minimum 10 per cent level at the end of the year. It also will cut staff by 1,700, or 22 per cent, over two years as part of a programme to save DKr750m by the end of 1994. As part of a new business strategy, the bank will withdraw from most of its international banking operations. 'We shall become a slightly smaller bank with a lower risk profile,' Mr Hugo Schroder, chairman of the supervisory board, said. The cost-cutting follows soaring loss provisions at the bank, which are expected to exceed last year's DKr5.4bn. The increase in provisions reflects, among other things, foreign exchange losses by customers over recent weeks. The bank's own losses on its securities portfolio and foreign exchange have increased by about DKr700m to DKr1bn since the half year, said the bank. But basic financial earnings remained satisfactory, although lower than expected, said Mr Thorleif Krarup, chief executive, brought in to run the bank in August. The bank has received promises from institutional investors, including pension funds, mortgage finance institute Nykredit and insurance company Trygg to subscribe DKr1.1bn in supplementary capital, which is being raised through a bond issue carrying an interest rate of 1.5 percentage points over the corresponding government bond. Further support will be sought up to a maximum of DKr3bn. The bank said it would remain in the red in 1993, but cost-reductions should result in a small profit in 1994.</p>

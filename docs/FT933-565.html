			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (2): Small gems from South Africa / Industry THE LAST EMPIRE by Stefan Kanfer Farrar Straus Giroux Dollars 25, 409 pages I WONDER whether this book is really necessary. It purports, in the words of its sub-title, to tell the tale of 'De Beers, Diamonds and the World'. In effect it is a re-treading of the familiar story of the mining miracle of South Africa, from the discovery of diamonds in 1869 through to the sage old age of Harry Oppenheimer. Inevitably, The Last Empire falls into two halves: first, the rumbustious early days of the Randlords, and second, the post-First War years, dominated, as still today, by the Oppenheimer family. The snag is that there is no shortage of perfectly good general books on the entire period: Geoffrey Wheatcroft's elegant The Randlords, for example, has just been re-issued in Britain in paperback (Weidenfeld, Pounds 9.99); there are a dozen biographies of Cecil Rhodes and plenty of books about the diamond industry; and the Oppenheimers - Ernest, Harry and now Nicky - have not been allowed to blush unseen. Still, you cannot have too much of a good thing, and the story has always been one of the best. Mr Kanfer is a veteran of Time magazine and he tells it with an eye to the newcomer. The tone of voice tends to the racey, sometimes to Hollywood ('the sunstruck country lay sleeping in the Middle Ages') - apparently he used to be a showbiz writer - and occasionally he can be acute ('In the looking-glass politics of South Africa, a conservative Christian multimillionaire (Harry Oppenheimer) born in Johannesburg was portrayed as a conniving English Jew. And his party, which for half a century had kept black labour available, cheap and docile, was maligned as a group of irresponsible radicals . . . '). All the same, it's a bit worrying that after four years' research he insists on inserting a non-existent hyphen into Anglo American and that he still cannot spell Afrikaner (or Mahdi). We are given all the usual stories about the pioneer generation: Barney Barnato, Louis Cohen, J B Robinson, Alfred Beit, Cecil Rhodes, et al. (There was a nice first exchange between the latter pair. Said Beit: 'I intend to control the whole diamond output before I am much older.' 'That's funny,' replied Rhodes, 'I have made up my mind to do the same. We had better join hands.' Which they did.) Ernest Oppenheimer rightly dominates the story of the second generation. He arrived in Kimberley, a German Jew, at the end of the Boer War in 1902 just as the vicious anti-semitic caricature of 'Hoggenheimer' - imported from a London musical called 'The Girl from Kay's' - was introduced to South Africa. 'Hoggenheimer' was to feature in South Africa's politics for the rest of the century: the similarity of the names was accidental, unfortunate and irresistible to the Afrikaners. By 1914 Ernest had established himself, only to be driven out of Kimberley, and out of the country, by anti-German hysteria. He returned, went for gold, and the rest is the story of Anglo American. Thirty years later Prime Minister D F Malan abused Ernest's son Harry for exercising 'a greater influence than any man in South Africa has ever had'. If Mr Kanfer has a particular theme it is the underlying role of Jews - and, by extension, of anti-semitism - in the development of South Africa's diamonds and precious metals. For many centuries, of course, there had been a Jewish affinity for, and expertise in, diamonds. Mediaeval jewellers' guilds admitted Hebrews, diamonds were traditionally the most effective way to carry and protect wealth in dangerous times, and from the earliest days in Kimberley there was a visible Jewish presence. But, as Mr Kanfer points out, it is far too easy for anti-semites to assume that you can spot a Jew by his name. Of the Randlords, for example, Hermann Eckstein was son of a Lutheran pastor, Julius Wernher was a German Protestant, Alfred Beit was Christian. He might have added that Harry Oppenheimer, though Jewish by birth, is today a practising Anglican and that his father was baptised after losing his wife, his son, his nephew and his brother-in-law in an appalling series of tragedies. (The ironic gloss to the long-standing anti-semitism of the South African Right is that the National Party government for years enjoyed a close, and semi-secret, relationship with Israel). This book ends in 1992 with De Beers cutting its dividend, but warnings of 'crisis ahead' are never developed in a detail which would have anything to say to the more professional reader. Nor is anything insightful offered us about Anglo's future course. The Empire is troubled, we are assured. Well, if you consider what is going on in South Africa at present, you would hardly expect them to be enjoying, in Cecil Rhodes' wonderful phrase, 'three days at the seaside'.</p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Rush to buy holidays as sales surge continues THOMSON, THE UK's biggest tour operator, yesterday estimated that holidaymakers spent about Pounds 75m in the first three days of this week on summer bookings - about 50 per cent up on the same period last year. The holiday rush, stimulated by price cuts and special offers, was accompanied by further brisk business in the sales yesterday. Mr Charles Newbold, Thomson's managing director, said: 'Clearly consumer confidence is now returning to the high street.' Thomson, which expects total holiday bookings to reach Pounds 150m this weekend, has doubled the size of its Skytours brochure, offering 200,000 additional holidays in Spain, Greece and the Canaries. Thomas Cook confirmed the early surge in demand. Bookings through its 340 travel agencies were 50 per cent ahead of last year. 'We have had a very good few days since Christmas,' it said. Retailers reported an improvement on last year's start of the January sales. Mr Robin Cannon, marketing director of Allied-Maples, said: 'It has been a good day for us. The momentum has been maintained since Monday and augurs well for the weekend. Carpet sales have been particularly buoyant.' Lillywhites, the London sports store, reported business was 'a lot better' than in last year's sale. Mr Steve Forbes, merchandise manager, said: 'For the Christmas/New Year period as a whole, sales are 41 per cent ahead of our forecasts and 140 per cent up on last year, when the redevelopment of the store disrupted business.' Gieves &amp; Hawkes, the Savile Row tailor, said it had fewer customers yesterday than earlier in the week, but it was 'very pleased with the results. The Christmas period this year has certainly been better than a year ago.' Mr Malcolm Busby, retail director of Daks-Simpson, said trading yesterday had been 'quite brisk'. He added: 'Christmas got off to a slow start but over the last two weeks business has been very much better than last year.' The sale at Austin Reed's Regent Street store in London yesterday attracted slightly more customers than last year. Mr Michael Tiffin, merchandise director, said: 'There are noticeably more tourists among the shoppers.' It had been a good week for the company's 34 shops throughout the country, Mr Tiffin added. 'We are very pleased with the results.' The John Lewis Partnership reported yesterday that its department stores had increased sales by 0.7 per cent in the week to December 19, the last full week before Christmas.</p>

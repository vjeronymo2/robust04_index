			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at  0217 GMT on 4 April carries a report by correspondent Yan  Khutaranskiy stating that Sverdlovsk-44, a previously secret  town in the middle Urals, is to be renamed Novouralsk. Instead  of defense industry products, the town has gone over to  supplying goods for nuclear power stations at home and abroad.  In an interview, Leonid Penskikh, head of the town's  administration, complained that bureaucrats forced this name on  the town's residents who wanted it to be called Verkhnevinsk as  it is located on the river Neva. He described the communal and  sports facilities currently being built in the town and stressed  that all the enterprises in the town are still operating.</p>

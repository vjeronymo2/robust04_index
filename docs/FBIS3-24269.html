			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Viktor Zorin, Federal </F> Counterintelligence Service chief, by unidentified  correspondent; place and date not given: "A New Old Boss"]    [Text] In an edict dated 4 February, the president  appointed 23 candidates to the most important positions in the  FSK [Federal Counterintelligence Service]. Almost all the  highest-ranking officials of the former MB [Ministry of  Security] have undergone recertification.    One of the key departments in the new service's  structure is the counterintelligence operations directorate. The  official appointed as this directorate's chief is Lieutenant  General Viktor Mikhaylovich Zorin, who held an analogous  position in the MB. We asked Viktor Mikhaylovich to comment on  the current changes in the security organs.    [Zorin] Speaking of reforming the special services in  general, our foreign colleagues, including the Americans, are  continuously in a process of reform, albeit perhaps not as  cardinal as ours. The process of reform is underway in the  intelligence directorate of the U.S. Department of Defense; a  number of CIA services are being reoriented.    As to our reform, it is a logical extension of what began in  1991. Or, if we dismiss all ideological coatings, we can  probably even speak of 1989, when the Fifth (ideological)  Department of the USSR KGB was disbanded.    The current reform is aimed at transforming us into a  special  service. This means first and foremost removing from the FSK  system punitive, repressive functions. We no longer have an  investigative department. Inquiry remains--this is a necessary  procedure. Neither do we have places of incarceration  anymore--the investigative detention facility in Lefortovo has  been transferred to the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs].    [Question] As applied to your directorate--how was the old  structure different from the one being formed now?    [Zorin] The name of our directorate has changed--it is now  closer to what we actually do. Instead of a counterintelligence  directorate it became the counterintelligence operations  directorate. Because our main function is working against  foreign special services on the territory of Russia and their  stations, the conduct of operations to frustrate intelligence  actions. For instance, the directorate of counterintelligence  support for strategic objects is to a great extent "object-based  counterintelligence," whose main function is protection of the  latter.    In line with the changes in main tasks, corresponding  structural changes took place. A number of departments and lines  have been reduced; some have been strengthened.    [Question] American reforms probably also are associated  with  our new conditions in Russia?    [Zorin] We have information that Russia remains a priority  target for American special services. They demonstrate that they  have reduced their activities on the territory of Russia and are  not conducting agent operations--sort of keeping their  gentlemen's promise. But this does not at all mean that their  work has been curtailed.    Nontraditional methods and sources are being widely used, in  the form of various kind of firms, commissions, foundations,  including informational. If you read the questionnaires that are  being published you can see that with skillful processing you  can get excellent intelligence information that sometimes cannot  be obtained through agents.    Western special services use the territories of contiguous  states, including former Soviet republics and socialist  countries. Cooperation with the special services of the latter  has helped us lately to keep an eye on foreign intelligence  services. And they are today, to use military language, a  beachhead.    The direct contacts we have with representatives of foreign  intelligence services permit us to remove some issues in a  civilized manner. Although in this respect we also have  problems. For instance, a foreign state officially declares a  representative of its intelligence service on the territory of  Russia. Protecting him to an even greater extent by refusing  similar status for our representative.    [Question] You no longer have an investigations department.  Have you not lost the main tool of your work?    [Zorin] Our main work is operations. Investigation is the  concluding part of our efforts; now the procuracy will do this.    [Question] Who is now directly involved in exposing spies?    [Zorin] Operations services. They are also, as a rule, the  ones who detain them. With the procurator's sanction, of course.  And then we help him, if the investigation requires it.    [Question] How did your certification go?    [Zorin] There was a goodwill atmosphere in the commission.  The questions covered a person's professional qualities, his  work experience, and a certain part of political views. I think,  though, that for counterintelligence the latter did not play a  major role. Especially keeping in mind that this was less  relevant for our directorate's staff: We were not involved in  political surveillance.    [Question] Did the interview resemble an exam?    [Zorin] To a certain extent, yes. I was told to come at a  certain time, so I came. The personnel department chief came out  and invited me in. I entered and saw that in the center was Oleg  Lobov. We exchanged greetings; I was offered a seat: How are you  doing? How is work? What problems are there in the directorate?  Sergey Adamovich Kovalev (the president's adviser on human  rights--D.Kh.) asked: "I see you have worked in many places,  have you not?" I said: "Sergey Adamovich, I understand your  question. You want to know whether I have worked in the fifth  line? No, I have not. I began in Checheno-Ingushetia; then Orel  Oblast, graduate study, the former Committee. Always in  counterintelligence, including at secret plants. But sometimes I  happened to run into political issues." Then Vladimir  Arsenyevich Rubanov (Lobov's deputy--D.Kh.) asked about the  problem of diplomatic security, whether there is a law. One of  our directorate's functions is to ensure the security of our  citizens abroad. I say: "There is no law, but we have submitted  a proposal on how to solve this problem." All in all, the  conversation lasted about half an hour.    [Question] Was the decision made on the spot?    [Zorin] No, the decision was announced later and affirmed by  presidential edict.    [Question] Now you have to conduct recertification of your  directorate's staff. How are you going to go about it?    [Zorin] We have organized a commission and included in it  the  most authoritative people, mainly top officials, as well as  personnel department staff. The commission will work according  to a statute that has been drafted in keeping with the  president's edict. The subjects of evaluation will be  professional qualities, work results, and moral qualities.    [Question] So you will be evaluating "how many spies a  person  has caught"?    [Zorin] Not just that. In counterintelligence, arresting a  spy is far from the only, and not always the best, result. We  know from history that on the threshold of the war with Germany  the British did not arrest a single German agent. When the war  started, they took them all at the same time, leaving only one  or two. And German intelligence basically did not score any  serious successes in England during the entire war.    [Question] Is the possibility of getting rid of undesirable  staff members during certification ruled out?    [Zorin] There is a law on military service. It regulates the  procedures for discharge from service. All actions of the  commission fall clearly within the boundaries of the law.  Otherwise these days you will face endless litigation.    [Question] Can a discharged person turn to the court?    [Zorin] This is his right as a citizen.    [Question] Do you believe that in the future, decades from  now, the functions of counterintelligence will die out?    [Zorin] Way back in the institute we all memorized that this  could possibly happen when the function of the state dies out.  Then probably there will be no counterintelligence.  Historically, as soon as a conflict situation arises, there is  immediately a need for countering intelligence.  Counterintelligence existed under Ivan the Terrible, and Peter  the Great--the famous Romodanovskiy. In principle, the system of  questioning at the border, travel documents, already had a  counterintelligence function.    In tsarist Russia, by the way, counterintelligence was quite  sophisticated. And the Germans' failures in the beginning of the  first world war, especially at sea, to a certain extent could be  traced to the fact that Russian counterintelligence outplayed  them.    I believe that today counterintelligence emerges and is  present wherever there is threat to Russia's security, wherever  intelligence activities are conducted.    The same correspondent may ask openly: "How many ballistic  missiles do you have in such and such oblast?" We probably  should not condemn him for this.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Russian miners call off coal stoppage: Threat to Yeltsin poll hopes averted Russian coalminers last night called off a strike which had threatened to undermine President Boris Yeltsin's election campaign in the last days before the poll. Interfax news agency said that union leaders from the Arctic coal basin of Vorkuta had signed a peace deal with the government and had agreed to resume work today. Earlier yesterday the strike had spread across three regions when the 30,000 Vorkuta miners were joined by thousands of workers in the Urals and in northern Siberia. The Independent Miners' Union called out its members to protest against non-payment of wages and over a range of other complaints. Strikers also demanded a government reshuffle by Mr Yeltsin, who faces parliamentary elections on December 12 and has traditionally enjoyed strong support among miners. Ahead of last night's peace deal, miners in the main Russian coalfield of the Kuzbass were considering joining the strike today, according to Mr Sultan Mamedov, deputy president of the Independent Miners' Union. The strikers, who had produced a list of 25 demands, were most aggrieved over long delays in wages payments and in the rapidly worsening situation in the coalfields - as rail tariffs for coal carriage soar, increasing the indebtedness of the pits and the insecurity of the miners. The government has recently proposed a programme of closures of more than 40 pits nationwide, including four of the 13 in Vorkuta, an area almost wholly dependent on the mines. A new finance and industry group has been established and charged by Mr Yeltsin with the task of 'furthering the reconstruction of the Russian economy, accelerating scientific and technical progress and raising the export and competitive potential of Russian enterprises'. Mr Yeltsin's decree establishing the group also orders the state committees for industrial policy and for property to set up two 'experimental' financial-industrial groups - an apparent attempt to create large industrial holdings with their own banks and investment houses along Japanese lines, a route which is favoured by many industrialists. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister, has been admitted to hospital for treatment of a kidney ailment. His press spokesman said his condition was not serious and he would be back at work soon.</p>

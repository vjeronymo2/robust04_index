			<p>BFN     [Text] One year has passed since our country and the United  States announced their joint statement confirming the  prohibition of using armed forces -- including nuclear weapons  -- or posing a threat by them; the mutual respect for their  sovereignty; and the nonintervention into each other's internal  affairs.    Over this period, the United States has not kept, even a  little, the principles of the joint statement. Instead, it has  been the subject of ridicule and denouncement by the people  throughout the world because of their intentional aggravation of  tensions on the Korean peninsula.    Up to date since the DPRK-U.S. joint statement was issued,  approximately 150 countries throughout the world and a great  many international and regional organizations have held rallies  and demonstrations to urge the United States to sincerely  implement the principles agreed upon by the two sides of the  DPRK and the United States. Also, they have severely denounced  the treacherous act of the United States by releasing  statements, press statements, and articles.</p>

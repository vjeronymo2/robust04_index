			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: KPMG Peat Marwick income up less than 1% KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, yesterday reported fee income in the UK up by less than 1 per cent to Pounds 492m in the 12 months to September 30. In an indication of the effects of the recession, it cut the number of partners by 9 to 594 during the year, and the number of professional staff by 382 to 6,301. Administrative and support staff fell slightly to 2,053, and it has reduced its offices from 45 to 43. Mr Colin Sharman, senior partner elect, said: 'I am satisfied that we have done a good job against a hard economic background.' Like other accountancy firms, KPMG refuses to disclose any information about its profits. Mr Sharman said: 'We are happy with our profitability. We are not suffering badly and we are not coining it.' KPMG reported income from corporate recovery and insolvency work down 4 per cent to Pounds 53.5m. Mr Sharman said that reflected a decline in the number of insolvencies, and a number of large appointments the firm could not take on for fear of triggering potential conflicts of interest. Corporate finance income rose by nearly 21 per cent to Pounds 64.6m, reflecting flotations and government privatisation and reorganisation work. Income from tax advisory work rose by 2 per cent to Pounds 103.9m, including boosts from fees for Inland Revenue investigations, value added tax advice and tax work related to corporate finance. Management consulting income fell by more than 7 per cent to Pounds 72.1m, and revenues from audit and accounting work were down more than 1 per cent to Pounds 197.7m. Mr Sharman said that since the year-end, the prospects for the firm's billings were still 'spotty', with continued pressure on audit income but some further signs of recovery in corporate finance work.</p>

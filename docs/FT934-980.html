			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Clinton woos environmentalists: Washington seeks support in Congress for Gatt accord The Clinton Administration yesterday continued to woo the US environmental lobby in the hope of attracting support from some of the more conservative organisations for Congressional approval of the Uruguay Round package. 'We are struggling not to oppose the Round,' said Mr David Schorr, trade policy specialist for the World Wildlife Fund, 'but we are disappointed with insufficient concrete progress in the Round.' The National Wildlife Federation, one of the largest environmental groups, joined with the WWF and four other environmental groups to support the North American Free Trade Agreement. But the NWF lost no time in condemning the Round. On December 15 Mr Jay Hair, NWF president, said Gatt was not prepared for the 21st century. 'Instead of retooling for today's challenges, the negotiators have held on to yesterday's obsolete approaches.' To US environmentalists one of the more disheartening results was failure to agree to more transparency and public participation in Gatt's settlement panels. The formation of public panels was agreed, but proceedings will still be closed to outside observers. Some hint problems in the current pact can be corrected in negotiations to be continued until the ministerial declaration on April 15. They praise the Clinton Administration for linking trade with environmental protection but say it was unable to overcome an entrenched bias in Geneva which considers trade liberalisation the goal to be achieved rather than a tool for creating and distributing wealth. In a future work programme to be negotiated, Mr Schorr is hoping for 'an agenda that contemplates actual reform.' He would like the establishment of a permanent body which 'places environmental issues at the core of the world trading organisation.' Mr Kantor is clearly listening. The administration, he said, will seek 'new initiatives in the environment' as well as in competition policy and also in worker rights.' Whatever he offers will not be enough for some environmentalists, particularly those which opposed Nafta. But he he can bring on board those who hope to see in Gatt the same convergence occurring in the US between economists, who recognise the desirability of environmental protection, and environmentalists, who understand the need to create wealth to pay for it.</p>

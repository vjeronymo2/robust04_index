			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Guarding the D-Mark comes before the EMS: The thinking in Frankfurt HOPES had been rising for days that the Bundesbank might yesterday have provided a modest fillip for European business confidence and at least token support for the wobbling European Monetary System. But the German central bank does not make policy decisions based on hopes. And as guardian of the anchor currency in the European Monetary System, the credibility of its commitment to D-Mark stability is ultimately just as important as the system itself. Disappointed but not surprised, German economists agreed that domestic monetary conditions would have to show concrete signs of improving before the central bank could proceed with cuts in its key discount interest rate. 'I did not expect them to do anything, not at what was probably the worst possible moment,' said Mr Dieter Beier at Berliner Bank. Money supply was growing at 7.1 per cent. Year-on-year inflation was now 4.3 per cent. 'These are dreadful figures, and all we have is hopes that they will improve,' he added. The Bundesbank has set targets for annual money supply growth rates this year to be retained within a band ranging from 4.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent, and inflation to be ground down to 2 per cent. Yesterday, once again, external expectations crashed against the internal constraints governing the guardians of the German currency. And the only consolation available was what the savings bank association described as 'a very narrow' easing, comprising a 0.5 percentage point cut in the Lombard rate and a fixed rate of 6.95 per cent for next week's securities repurchase tender, unchanged from this week's rate. The so-called repo rate had dropped decisively in recent weeks, and this week's cut from 7.15 per cent had been taken as a sign that the Bundesbank wanted to help, said Mr Uwe Angenendt, an economist at BHF Bank. This showed in the restoration of relative peace within the EMS after Wednesday's repo announcement. Most observers had read this move, together with tensions within the EMS, recent upbeat speeches from Bundesbankers, and the widely acknowledged need for a confidence-boosting change to help lift the German economy off the floor of recession, as a signal that the discount rate would also come down. But as so often in the past, economists' sense of timing was out of synchronisation with that of the central bank. Meanwhile, hopes remain unaltered that by the end of the year the internationally sensitive discount rate, which governs short-term lending rates of greatest concern to other EC economies, will be down from 6.75 per cent today to 6 per cent or even lower. But the pace of the decline and the size of the steps depend entirely on Germany's internal monetary and inflationary developments. At the same time, Mr Beier points out, German industry, which makes more than 70 per cent of its borrowings on longer terms, is enjoying the effects of real capital market rates of 2 per cent - a record low, he says.</p>

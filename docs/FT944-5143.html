			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Emerging Markets: Dollar still the focus for traders - Currencies The resurgent dollar will be the focus of attention this week after breaking through the Y100 level last Friday for the first time in two months. The dollar recovered from about Y96 and DM1.50 when the Fed intervened to support it at the beginning of November. The dollar's recent rise appears to have been driven by higher US interest rates and improved sentiment, based on the greater credibility of the Federal Reserve recently. Some investors also believe that the shift in power towards the Republicans has changed the outlook for US policy, in a way which will benefit US assets and the dollar. A strong jobs report on Friday served only to bolster the expectation of higher interest rates. This week there are no important statistical releases to watch. Instead, the focus will be on the publication of the Fed's beige book - which sets out the economic backdrop to the policy-making FOMC meeting on December 20 - and congressional testimony from Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed. In the UK, markets will be watching the monthly monetary meeting on Wednesday, which could result in a further rise in interest rates. The balance of opinion favours the Bank of England waiting for the new year. An early tightening would be well received by markets, making UK assets and sterling more attractive. The Bundesbank council meets on Thursday, with the expectation that rates will be left unchanged. Dollar strength, and fears of a further cut in German rates, have caused D-Mark weakness recently. The market will also be watching the lira, amid renewed talk of Italy re-entering the exchange rate mechanism. An agreement between unions and government on pensions last week helped the lira, but political uncertainty remains a constraint.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BILL SEEKS TO FORCE NAVY TO LEASE LAND TO SAN FRANCISCO  </P> <P> A measure passed shortly before Congress adjourned last weekend seeks to force  the Navy to lease half of Hunters Point Naval Shipyard to the city of San  Francisco -- over the Navy's objection and to its apparent surprise.  </P> <P> Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said Thursday that she sponsored the brief  amendment to the massive Defense Authorization Act partly in an attempt to end  an effort by the Navy to evict 300 artists and small business operators who  have been leasing studio and work space at the shipyard.  </P> <P> "Now, we just have to make the Navy do it," Pelosi said. Her measure will  require the Navy to enter into negotiations with the city for a 30-year lease  on at least 260 acres of shipyard land. The amendment says the deal must be  struck within a year.  </P> <P> In a written statement to the House Armed Services Committee, the Navy  expressed its opposition to Pelosi's amendment, noting that such a lease "could  preempt" other uses that are "now under review."  </P> <P> "We certainly haven't designated any property for lease. We're still looking at  the legislation," said Randal A. Friedman, a Navy employee in charge of  coordinating the restoration of naval bases slated for closure in the Bay Area.  </P> <P> Artists and business owners, ranging from painting contractors to a mushroom  farmer, set up shop and studios in space leased from the Navy after it  abandoned barracks and most other buildings at Hunters Point in the 1970s.  </P> <P> The Navy began trying to evict the tenants in the mid-1980s when it had hopes  of basing a flotilla of warships at Hunters Point, which is at the southern end  of San Francisco. The home-porting scheme was abandoned, although the Navy  maintained its position that it wanted the commercial tenants out.  </P> <P> The Navy continues to operate repair facilities at the shipyard, and has  embarked on a major cleanup of toxins that were dumped and spilled over the  decades. Pelosi's amendment allows the Navy to continue its ship-maintenance  operations at the base.  </P> <P> "It is a major breakthrough in bringing the Navy to the table to sit with us  and plan what is going to happen on almost 300 acres of Navy property," Mayor  Art Agnos said at the press conference.  </P> <P> Agnos said that he expects ship repairs to continue at the shipyard and that  the amendment will "protect the artists and provide other economic development  opportunities" to his city.  </P></p>

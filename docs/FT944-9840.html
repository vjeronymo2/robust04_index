			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Safety row USAir has allowed jets to leave gates without enough fuel at least nine times and once used a jet for 13 days despite a dangerous crack on its wing flap, the New York Times reported at the weekend. Despite assurances from USAir and federal officials, a two-month review of the airline showed numerous safety and training problems, it said. In one incident, the pilots of a Washington-to-Boston flight did not check to see if the aircraft had enough fuel. When forced to land at La Guardia airport, New York, they lied and radioed the control tower that they had to land because of engine trouble. Afterwards, the captain admitted there had been no engine trouble. On September 8 a USAir Boeing 737 crashed near Pittsburgh international airport, killing all 132 aboard. Last July a USAir jet crashed in Charlotte, North Carolina, in a thunderstorm, killing 37 of 57 people aboard. USAir executives told the newspaper the accidents were not connected and there was no reason to draw negative conclusions about safety.</p>

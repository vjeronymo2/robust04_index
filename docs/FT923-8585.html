			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Tuskar shares suspended at 1p SHARES IN Tuskar Resources were yesterday suspended at 1p after the Dublin-based oil and gas company announced the disposal of its last asset. The USM-quoted company is selling its remaining 36 per cent rights in a Colombian oil field to Coplex Resources, the Australian exploration company which failed in a recommended bid for Tuskar. Coplex will pay for the stake by issuing to Tuskar 11m shares, worth ADollars 7.15m (Pounds 2.76m) at yesterday's price of 65 cents, next August. Coplex bought 54 per cent of the Colombian field from Tuskar in April. The terms of that transaction have been changed and Tuskar will now be paid mainly in cash. Following the various deals, Tuskar's stake in Coplex will be between 7.2 per cent and 14.4 per cent, depending on the amount of shares issued. Mr Neil O'Donoghue, Tuskar chairman, said the company could not afford to fund its share of investment in Colombia. 'We could have been drilled out of the contract,' he said. The disposal leaves Tuskar with about Pounds 1m in cash and the future payment of Coplex shares or cash. Mr O'Donoghue rejected criticism from shareholders that the company was selling assets to Coplex soon after its bid approach had been rejected. In May Coplex withdrew its all-share bid after receiving only 47.6 per cent acceptances. He said Tuskar had been unable to raise bank finance and shareholders had not appeared keen to invest further.</p>

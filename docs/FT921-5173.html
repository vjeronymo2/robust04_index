			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Nervous close after an erratic session FEWER heavyweight UK companies reported results yesterday and the London stock market proved unwilling to respond to Wall Street's overnight advance to new peaks. With their appetite for deals checked by the withdrawal on Tuesday of a series of trades in banking stocks, equity traders inclined towards caution. The stock market was unsettled by a sharp fall in UK government bonds. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew told clients that Britain's Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) was now 'set on an unsustainable course' and that taxation might have to rise in the medium term if PSBR is to be reduced to more acceptable levels. The FT-SE Index closed 7.0 down at 2,558.4, having turned back as Wall Street showed a fall of 2.46 on the Dow in early trading. Earlier, the Footsie had twice crept into plus territory, as well as falling 6.4 at mid-morning under the sway of sharp movements in some component stocks. The most notable was Reuters, the global business communications agency, which fell heavily after disclosing problems with the testing of its Globex system for trading financial futures; the fall in Reuters shares represented a loss of 1.1 on the Footsie. The shares were strongly bought last week on optimism ahead of the Globex tests. The financial sector, which has provided much of the market's activity over the past fortnight, as the banks and insurance companies have reported results, was in a calmer mood. There was some activity in food shares, both manufacturing and retail, after Cadbury Schweppes reported progress. Food retailers were unsettled by reports that a large block of Sainsbury shares was on offer. Seaq volume edged higher to record 529.5m shares compared with 523.2m in the previous session. However, traders believed that retail, or customer, business in equities was lower yesterday than on Tuesday when it was worth a total of Pounds 1.1bn, a return to favourable business levels from the point of view of the London marketmaking firms. A substantial boost to trading volume came in very late dealings yesterday when a substantial non-protected programme was reported on the trading screens. Under the changes introduced on February 24, non-protected deals have become significantly more visible; the changes were prompted by complaints by traders that reporting of large deals was often held back until the end of the day. While many of the large investment funds have already begun to reduce activity in the stock market ahead of next Tuesday's Budget speech, strategists continued to assess the wider outlook. Lazard Investors commented that while global activity in equities remains weak, there are the first signs of revival in the US economy. It added that falling inflation and lower bond yields favour the UK and European equity markets, and looked for opportunities to increase exposure to the UK stock market. Nomura Research Institute, however, believes that the time may not yet be ripe for a switch from the US to the UK equity markets. Constraints on sterling and UK interest rates, together with the near term political risk, are the reasons given for holding back on the US-UK switch.</p>

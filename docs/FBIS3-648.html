Mr Botha said the intention was that the force would be  prepared to maintain law and order and to protect SA citizens  and their interests. He said the SA ambassador in the  Bophuthatswana capital had not been able to make contact with  Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope or any of his ministers.  With the outbreak of attacks and looting on Thursday, South  African interests were being seriously threatened.    Information that right wing elements were on their way to  Mmabatho had also reached the SA government. "Against this  background the president, after consultation with relevant  minsiters and security forces, decided that a component of the  SA army should take up a position in the grounds of the SA  embassy in Mmabatho during (Thursday) night.    "The objective of this deployement is first to ensure that  the SA representattvies and their families be protected against  possible attack of any kind. Secondly it is the intention that  the component should be on hand to maintain law and order and to  protect SA citizens and their interests should the situation  deteriorate."    Mr Botha said the government would not hesitate to take  similar steps in any other of the republic's nominally  independent states.    The Transitional Executive Council was being kept informed  of  developments, he said.</p>

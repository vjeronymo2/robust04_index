			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed RHR/MPN: "Enlargement: Dehaene Welcomes </F> European Parliament's Approval"]    [Text] Brussels, 4 May (BELGA) -- Prime Minister Jean-Luc  Dehaene immediately expressed his satisfaction following the  European Parliament's (EP) approval, on Wednesday [4 May]  afternoon, of the Accession Treaties to the European Union (EU)  for Sweden, Finland, Austria, and Norway.    "This approval marks a major step along the road to rapid  and  effective EU membership for these countries. By the vote of the  representatives directly elected by European citizens, the EP  has thus shown that the Union is effectively opening up to such  an enlargement. In so doing, Europe is giving a very clear  signal to the citizens of Sweden, Finland, Austria, and Norway,  confirming that they are welcome within the Union," the Belgian  leader stated in a communique.    "The Belgian Government, which had made EU enlargement one  of  the priorities of its presidency, would like to thank the EP for  having voted on enlargement at this opportune moment."</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: French insurer turns in annual profits up 23% AXA, the French insurance group, has reported a 23 per cent rise in net profits last yearto FFr3.35bn (Dollars 560m) The group, including the former Compagnie du Midi but not the Normandy mutual companies which are its ultimate owners, said insurance premium income rose by 8 per cent to FFr39.4bn, with gross revenue from banking and financial services rising 25 per cent to FFr7.1bn. Direct earnings from Axa's insurance activity dropped, while the group benefited from capital gains on the sales of some of the substantial industrial stakes held by the former Midi, including Brasseries et Glacieres Internationales, the African brewing group, and Garonor, the huge road transport deport north of Paris. Mr Claude Bebear, Axa's chairman, is still looking at a number of possible acquisitions in the US insurance market after the collapse last year of his proposed Dollars 4.5bntakeover of Farmers Group, which lapsed when Sir James Goldsmith's Hoylake consortium failed in its bid for Farmers' parent, BAT Industries.</p>

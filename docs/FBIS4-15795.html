			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Besik Urigashvili: "Expectations for Summer </F> Vacation Season in Abkhazia Somewhat Premature Even in Light of  Diplomatic Victories"]    [Text] Tbilisi -- The outbreak of optimistic forecasts  brought about by the signing of the Georgian-Abkhazian  agreements should not overshadow the real obstacles in the way  of finally settling the conflict. Boris Pastukhov, personal  representative of Russia's president and deputy foreign  minister, believes that there may be a repeat of the Abkhazian  tragedy unless resolute actions are taken by Russia and the  United Nations. Other equally important elements should be  considered in the current alignment of forces.    Despite the start of the summer vacation season in Abkhazia,  which has been widely advertised by the mass media, every  sensible person realizes that there will be no season. And the  statement that sunworshippers on the beach at Pitsunda and tour  buses on the road to Lake Ritsa will be protected by riflemen is  simply laughable if, of course, you forget how much blood and  tragedy is behind all this.    However, you cannot forget. Nor do the agreements that have  been signed bring oblivion either. Whereas you can somehow  understand naive working people nostalgic for the sunshine of  Gagra, you cannot understand those who call themselves  politicians.  <H5>  Country Cornered </H5>   A different -- gloomy and cheerless -- picture arises behind  the glossy advertising mirage. Even a cursory analysis of the  situation provides convincing evidence that a fresh bloodbath is  inevitable if the peacemaking process breaks down once and for  all (once again, you cannot forget that the agreements on  Abkhazia have been wrecked six times).    Following Georgian leader Shevardnadze's recent visit to New  York, where the Security Council, having given him a sympathetic  hearing, effectively then refused to carry out a peacekeeping  operation under its auspices in Abkhazia, the bulk of the  Georgian public, primarily refugees from there, questioned the  head of state's foreign policy course and his efforts to settle  the conflict peacefully.    There is drama behind Shevardnadze's reserved response to  the  new agreements. "Unless we unravel the Abkhazian knot, our  country has no future," that is the opinion of Nodar Natadze,  Shevardnadze's political adversary, extremely radical leader of  the Georgian People's Front, and a parliamentary deputy, an  opinion shared by virtually all Georgian politicians and public  figures today regardless of their views.    "The point is not only that Georgia has lost a considerable  part of its age-old territory and living space," Givi Lominadze,  former Abkhazian minister of internal affairs and now chairman  of the Committee for the State of Emergency in Western Georgia,  said. "If the Abkhazian problem is not settled, I have  difficulty picturing a solution not only to the political but  also primarily to the economic crisis. After all, the most  convenient and virtually the only rail and road routes linking  Georgia and Russia, routes that are crucial and vitally  important, pass through Abkhazia. Everyone has now forgotten  that it was the threat to these routes, a noose around Georgia's  neck, that made it necessary to take emergency measures to  protect them in August 1992. Separatist leaders in Abkhazia and  their patrons in Russia used this as an excuse for war. Now  that control of the routes has been lost we are threatened with  being totally cut off."    According to statistics, the average wage in Georgia is  around 20 U.S. cents. Notwithstanding what are virtually world  prices for essentials, barring bread. The birth rate is falling  disastrously. All industry is virtually at a standstill.  People spent the whole of last winter without heat and light.  The crime rate is still threateningly high. And as a result in  the last six months alone, according to various estimates,  between 500,000 and 800,000 people, over one-third of them  ethnic Georgians, moreover, have left the country. Some 99  percent of the emigres, regardless of ethnic origin, are not  leaving the country on political grounds.    Mafia clans are infiltrating top state spheres. According to  Igor Georgadze, head of the Georgian security service, the drugs  mafia has stepped up its activity of late.    "We have information from which it emerges that Georgia is  already one of the main transit routes for the international  drugs mafia. Drugs going West via Georgia mainly come from  Azerbaijan, Central Asia, and the North Caucasus. Severe  pressure from local clans, which often operate via structures of  authority, and, paradoxically enough, the conflict in Abkhazia,  which diverts our best forces, are preventing us from  effectively resisting this. Deprived of firm foundations the  authorities are sometimes forced to close their eyes to the  human detritus in their corridors where incompetence goes hand  in hand with unscrupulousness."  <H5>  On the Other Side of the Inguri River </H5>   The way is barred to your correspondent. However, the way is  not barred to information crossing the Inguri River via informal  communications channels, the press, and eyewitnesses who  disagree with the Gudauta regime.    The simple formula of "the Abkhazian people's great victory  over the Georgian aggressor" prevails in the mass consciousness  there today, acting as an ideological foundation for mass purges  and the deportation of the Georgian people. However, the  euphoria of victory is giving way increasingly noticeably to a  sobering up process. North Caucasus "volunteers" are demanding  payment -- homes, apartments, plots of land. Their demands are  being bolstered by weapons. Banditry, robbery, and looting --  the accompaniments of "victory" -- are keeping pace with the  exacerbating struggle for power between family and mafia  structures.    Winning the war and relying on powerful allies outside  Abkhazia enable Vladislav Ardzinba to take a politically radical  and uncompromising approach. However, his Abkhazian opponents  believe that this policy is fatal for the Abkhazian people.    One of them, who once held a fairly high position in the  Abkhazian political establishment, told me:    "He is bound to realize that this is a Pyrrhic victory but,  being a charismatic leader, he is continuing to sail on the tide  of events. However, in the course of the war the Abkhazians  have already lost over one-third of their gene pool. A people  numbering just 80,000 is threatened with physical degeneration.  Moreover it is clear that Georgia will never put up with the  loss of Abkhazia."    In the opinion of my interlocutor, a crucial factor in the  Abkhazian military success is the domestic political situation  in Russia and in Georgia itself at the time the conflict started.    "Were it not for Gamsakhurdia and Russia's equivocal policy,  I don't know how it all would have ended," he said.    Nevertheless Ardzinba still has firm support -- the enemy  image in the shape of Georgia completely holds sway in the mass  consciousness. However, Abkhazia's leaders, perfectly well  aware of the danger they are in, are trying to take preventive  security measures. This is illustrated by the escalation of  military operations in Abkhazia's Svanetia at the end of March.    This operation, which Abkhazian sources themselves admit was  planned in advance, was allegedly aimed against Georgian  subversive groups. However, it is well known that the current  Abkhazian leadership is holding talks with regard to driving a  six-kilometer road tunnel to directly link Abkhazia and the  North Caucasus. With its commissioning Abkhazia would obtain a  direct outlet to the North Caucasus bypassing Krasnodar Kray.  One small point is causing problems however: This route lies  through villages in the Kodorskoye Gorge where the Svanetians  live and which are controlled by their people's militia.    After the agreement was signed 4 April, these people  communicated the following from their positions: "Are we now  outlawed then? Are we, the defenders of our own homes and  villages, not entitled to live in our own homeland?" -- these  questions in one form or another are being asked by virtually  all refugees, most of whom have taken part in the fighting and  very many of whom have died.  <H5>  Another War? </H5>   Imagine a crowd of thousands of refugees among whom amputees  predominate. Shaking their arm stumps they are yelling: "We  have all fought! Fought for our land! Who is not allowing us  to go home?" In the opinion of these people, and you cannot  help but take it into account, the agreements signed in Moscow  do not resolve the problem of a peace settlement in Abkhazia.  And the vaguer the prospects of such a settlement, the stronger  the militarist sentiments. The most radical section of the  refugees from Abkhazia has formed the Abkhazian Liberation  Union. Its leader Boris Kakubava believes:    "Neither the United Nations nor Russia nor the Lord are  helping us. I do not know of a single case of territory being  returned by means of talks. We have one option -- to get our  homes back with weapons in hand."    Needless to say, by no means everyone hews to such radical  positions, but there is tremendous skepticism regarding the  chance of resolving the problem through talks. And although the  most farsighted politicians are still banking on Russia, the  following view does prevail: Until the political squabbling in  Russia has subsided, one should not expect salvation.  Ultimately, many people think that the Abkhazian problem will  be resolved as Russia wants.    A great deal was done in Moscow to ensure that talks resumed  between the Georgians and Abkhazians. "Some kind of progress at  least" has been made thanks to Russia's efforts. Staggering  progress in terms of the negotiating table. But it looks  extremely shaky in the eyes of yesterday's shepherds and tea  growers, unwilling war veterans, whose road home is barred today.</p>

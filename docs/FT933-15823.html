			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Jobs: Immeasurable waste of human talent - How selecting people by paper qualifications can exclude those best fitted for the work RECRUITERS the world over should occasionally raise their glass to the memory of Heinrich Weber, saying 'there but for the grace of God . . .' While Weber never made much of a name in his chosen field of science, he is notable for a historic achievement. As head of the physics department at the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule at Zurich in 1900, he took the lead in ensuring that of all his departing students who aspired to a full-time academic appointment, only one had his every application rejected. That student was called Albert Einstein. What distinguishes Weber from today's recruiters, of course, is not that he turned down an extremely able candidate. The present lot probably do likewise time and again. The difference is just that, in their case, the world rarely if ever comes to hear of it. And one of the reasons is that young people aren't even allowed to start in most types of well regarded work unless they have a certificate testifying to success in academic examinations. More and more the minimum stipulation for entry is that they must be graduates, which remains the case regardless of wholesale graduate unemployment. While the possession of a degree might not be enough to win desirable jobs on offer, anybody who lacked one would simply never be considered. Accordingly, most large employers nowadays would themselves turn down the 21-year-old Einstein. Quite apart from the fact that he studied at a technical college as opposed to a pukka university, what he emerged with was not a degree, but a non-graduate teacher's qualification. The explanation for such daftness no doubt partly lies in the typically defensive attitude of company recruiters, which is probably the result of personnel managers' rarely having much political clout in their outfit. Although they draw up the short-lists of candidates, which one to appoint is usually decided by the boss the person will directly work for. Hence when recruits turn out well, the deciding bosses are apt to claim the credit. Alas they don't seem nearly as keen to take the blame when appointments go wrong. Instead, it gets saddled on the recruitment staff, who could well end up in the dole queue unless they have a good excuse handy. Being aware that every appointment is a risk, and knowing there are few better excuses than being able to point to a failed recruit's impressive paper qualifications, they tend to exclude from their shortlists any contender without conventionally approved certificates. But, to the Job's column's mind, a deeper reason for the daftness is widespread blindness, and seemingly not solely in Britain, to the distinction I wrote about two weeks ago. It is the distinction between the sort of knowledge required for success in academic exams on the one hand, and the type needed to do skilled work on the other. As some of you present today may have been missing from the congregation a fortnight back, I had better once again summarise the difference between the two varieties of knowledge. The exam-passing sort consists of two main elements. The first is factual-type knowledge: knowing that something is so. The other is scientific-style explanations of certain phenomena: knowing why they are so. Both of them might be lumped together as knowing about the topic in question. The ability to do skilled work, however, depends decisively on knowing how - which I contend is not the same thing at all. True, not everybody agrees with me, as protests from a dozen or so readers show. Although only one goes as far as to call the distinction 'casuistic nonsense', most of them think that it does not apply to the type of skilled work which they consider most important to humanity: the type centrally dependent on the use of the mind. In their view, such work is done by a two-stage process. First know-thats and know-whys of the sort developed by exam-focused education are used to think out what needs to be done, drawing up a step-by-step intellectual plan of the action needed. Stage two is to carry out the plan in practice. Well, up to a point. I wouldn't deny that some forms of mentally centred work can be done in that way. No doubt they include aspects of the occupations with which some of the protesters identify themselves: the law, financial management, and in one instance corporate strategy. But I feel sure that the same clearly does not apply in the case of most kinds of such work, and especially not those requiring innovative talents. Moreover, besides being untrue of the bulk of skilled jobs in industry and commerce, it does not apply to top-rank academic research work. As evidence, I would cite the responses of some hundreds of expert people I have questioned over the years on how they do their job. As well as assorted managers and specialist staff in business, they include academic researchers ranging across varied sciences, engineering, economics, psychology and - yea  -even unto philosophy. With no more than a handful of exceptions, they denied they worked by first intellectually planning what they were going to do, and then acting in line with the mental blue-print. Their actual ways of operating were far less clear-cut. Their typical first explanation was simply: 'I do it by feel'. Even after reflecting, most could say nothing clearer than that the thinking involved in their job is somehow embedded in the doing, and cannot be separated from it. Far from being classifiable neatly into know-thats and know-whys, their skill depended on knowing something-else-besides, an intuitive faculty they could often express only by invoking the senses - an 'eye' for this, a 'nose' for that . . . a feel. What is abundantly clear, however, is that know-how differs from know-about. And oddly enough, recalling the example of Einstein, the contrast was best depicted by a physicist, John Adkins of Cambridge University. Just as the bachelor-level degrees based on know-that and know-why are no longer enough to win a desirable job, he thinks, they aren't a sufficient grounding for academic research work in the subject concerned. Even of the people so good at learning about physics as to gain first-class honours, for instance, only a minority go on to do physics with any significant result. By the reverse token, does he think there could be people with the talent to do physics, but short on ability to learn about it? 'I'd certainly say so. The things that are needed to get a good degree are not the same things that are needed for success in research. A good memory is less important, for example, whereas the patience to perform repetitive tasks with vigilance and fine accuracy is much more so. First-class honours graduates often find them too boring to bear, but they are essential to preparing the mind for research.' There seems no reason, he adds, why people should be unable to become physicists by starting with an apprenticeship in such routine procedures, and acquiring the necessary know-about as they go along. The only trouble, of course, is that such talents will never have the chance to be developed as long as educational conventions insist that exam-passing, no matter how inessential, must come first.</p>

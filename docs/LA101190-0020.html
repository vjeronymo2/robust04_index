			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> BUSH DIDN'T LEARN FROM THE MASTER: REAGAN;  </P> <P> IN COMBAT, AS IN POLITICS, THE TROOPS MUST HAVE A COMMANDER WILLING TO FIGHT.  </P> <P> What good is it having a Republican President when he caves in to demands by  Democrats and allows them to write a new budget in committees controlled by  their party? We can count on the "Bush budget" resembling a Michael Dukakis  budget, with the twin monsters of higher taxes and higher spending imposed on a  population tired of both.  </P> <P> As he watches his popularity decline, (a Times Mirror poll showed it dropping  from a high of 76% in August to 55% this week), Bush might consider a lesson  from Abraham Lincoln: "If once you forfeit the confidence of your fellow  citizens, you can never regain their respect and esteem." Addressing the nation  on television last week, Bush said: "This is the first time in my presidency  that I have made an appeal like this to you, the American people. Tell your  congressmen and senators you support this (budget) agreement."  </P> <P> The calls came in, but they were calls of protest, and this is where Bush's  strategy, so different from Ronald Reagan's, proved flawed. The  pro-abortionists who were to be attracted into the new Republican "big tent"  didn't rush to help the President.  </P> <P> Reaganite conservatives who had supported Bush because he talked tough on  crime, gun control, reduced government and other issues dear to their hearts  did not respond either, except in derision. Conservative fund-raiser Richard  Viguerie, who is persona non grata at the Bush White House, denounced the  now-defunct budget agreement in a letter to GOP maverick Rep. Newt Gingrich of  Georgia: "The conservative movement is the adversary of anyone, in Congress or  the White House, who would skewer the American people with higher taxes. We  will not affiliate ourselves with tax collectors for the welfare state."  </P> <P> Sen. William Armstrong (R-Colo.) told me that "by trying to avoid  confrontation, President Bush undermined his own leadership potential.  Confrontation is what Ronald Reagan did effectively. Reagan didn't avoid  confrontation, he sought it."  </P> <P> In combat, as in politics, the troops must have a commander willing to fight.  But time and time again, the President seemed to take tough stands, only to  negotiate away a winning position when he faced strong opposition. Instead of  blaming Congress for the impasse and calling on the people to help him, as  Reagan did, Bush backpedals and invites his ideological enemies in for coffee.  </P> <P> Many conservatives believe Bush abandoned a core set of principles necessary to  win their support. Public disapproval of Congress is so high that a popular  President ought to be able to make political chopped liver out of its members.  Properly conducted, an anti-Congress campaign by the President could benefit  Republican conservatives and perhaps win back a majority in one or both houses.  Failure to launch such a campaign means that Bush will be set upon by the  anti-government angel of death about to swoop down on all of Washington.  </P></p>

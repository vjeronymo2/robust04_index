			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Bank of Portugal attacks OECD report THE Bank of Portugal has dismissed Portuguese inflation forecasts made by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its latest report on the economy as inaccurate and 'unhelpful'. Mr Jose Alberto Tavares Moreira, bank governor, said the OECD's forecast of 10.5 per cent inflation for 1992 was 'clearly nonsense and imprudent' at a time when the government is locked into conflict with public sector unions over this year's annual pay awards. 'This will create problems internally. It is the net contribution of the OECD in these negotiations and confused state of affairs,' he said. The government hopes to keep inflation at 8 per cent this year, down from 11.4 per cent in 1991. Mr Tavares Moreira admitted it might be difficult to meet that target, but said price rises would remain clearly below 9.5 per cent this year. In line with its target, the government announced just over a week ago that it was imposing an 8 per cent pay settlement for public administration employees. This angered public sector trade unions which have called a one-day national strike for tomorrow in protest. Mr Tavares Moreira said it was likely the government would not be able to reach a formal agreement with the unions over wages this year, but that no agreement would be better than one allowing excessive wage rises. He also criticised an OECD suggestion to allow the escudo to appreciate freely against other currencies. 'We think this would be extremely dangerous for the economy and would jeopardise restructuring efforts in many sectors. The OECD suggestion that we should completely free the exchange rate is unacceptable and goes too far.' Mr Tavares Moreira, also indirectly criticised the government's 1992 budget which envisages cutting the budget deficit from above 6.5 per cent of GDP to 5.2 per cent this year. This is to be achieved mainly by increasing revenues while current expenditures are set to rise by about 36 per cent. 'It falls short of our expectations,' he said. The bank has made control of inflation through high interest rates its main priority, but he said there was no intention to tighten monetary policy any further.</p>

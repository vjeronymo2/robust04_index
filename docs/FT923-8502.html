			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Calmer trading TRADE in the short-dated sterling futures and cash markets had a calmer tone yesterday after the pound stabilised on the foreign exchanges and most of the shortage forecast by the Bank of England was removed in the morning. After losing around two pfennigs against the D-Mark in the last week, the pound had a more relaxed tone on the foreign exchanges yesterday, closing up a  1/4 of a pfennig at DM2.8275. This pushed the front month contracts up in the sterling futures market. The September contract closed up 6 basis points from its opening level, at 89.70. The December contract closed up 5 basis points from its opening level at 89.78. Both prices are far from discounting a cut in UK base rates in the short term. Uncertainty about the currency still hangs over the markets, especially with a spate of UK indicators due in the latter part of the week, several of which may underline continued weakness in the economy. The tone in the cash markets was brighter, although most rates closed unchanged on Friday's levels. The Pounds 1.1bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England was removed quickly, easing the tone of trading. Dealers feel no pressure to hold onto bills at the moment, as there is no expectation of a cut in base rates which would increase the capital value of the assets on their books. One-month money closed unchanged at 10 1/16 per cent on the offered side. Three-month money was also unchanged at 10 1/4 per cent offered, but the 1-year closed down  1/16 per cent at 10 3/8 per cent. The Bank of England purchased Band 1 and 2 bills at the established rate of 9 7/8 per cent and the repurchase agreement (repo) at 9 15/16 per cent. In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 305m in Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 337m in Band 2 bank bills and Pounds 300m in the repo. In the afternoon, the Bank revised the shortage down to Pounds 1bn and provided late assistance of around Pounds 45m. In the German money markets, call money rates were still just under the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate, reflecting the tightness of the market seen since the start of the month. In Italy, the central bank's 'repo' rate was again set at 14.21 per cent.</p>

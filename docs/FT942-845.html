			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Turn-out high for Ukraine election Ukrainians turned out in large numbers yesterday for their first post-independence presidential election. Preliminary results are not expected until later today, but most observers expect top contenders, President Leonid Kravchuk and Mr Leonid Kuchma, the former prime minister, to face each other in run-offs on July 10. Opinion polls on the eve of the elections suggest that Mr Kravchuk has made a near miraculous transformation, from the man who destroyed Ukraine's economy, to the only leader who can guarantee the country's stability. 'I know that nothing has changed for the better under Kravchuk, things have got worse,' said Mrs Yulia Sokol, a 40-year- old engineer who cast her ballot for the incumbent in central Kiev. 'The most important thing is to keep the peace.' Manipulating state television with his considerable political skill, Mr Kravchuk in recent weeks seems to have successfully reshaped the national debate. Now, instead of being about repairing the economy, it is about maintaining national independence and stability. Even Mr Kuchma, who was the clear front-runner until very recently, has been forced on the defensive. As former director of the Soviet Union's largest nuclear missile plant, Mr Kuchma comes from the heart of the old regime and has advocated closer ties with Russia. However, campaigning in central Ukraine on the eve of the elections, Mr Kuchma was forced to tone down his pro-Russian rhetoric. The need to defend his Ukrainian credentials has diluted his image as a strong man who can impose law and order and revive the Ukrainian economy. The most likely result is that Mr Kravchuk and Mr Kuchma win the bulk of the votes, but neither an outright majority. Under Ukrainian election law if no candidate wins more than 50 per cent of the vote in the first round, the top two compete in a second round. Analysts are wary of making predictions. Following the surprisingly strong showing of a firebrand outsider in last week's presidential poll in Belarus, Ukraine's traditionally quiescent neighbour, some pundits warn an upset is possible here as well. If Ukrainians defy the predictions, their votes could go in two very different directions: the hardline socialist candidate and chairman of parliament, Mr Oleksandr Moroz, or Mr Volodymyr Lanoviy, a reform-minded economist and former cabinet minister. These outsiders, and Mr Kuchma, could be the beneficiaries of a protest vote.</p>

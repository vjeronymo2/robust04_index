			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Manfred Kanther by </F> Roderich Reifenrath, Ferdos Forudastan, and Axel Vornbaeumen;  place and date not given: "Making Extremists of All Shades  Ineffective"]    [Text] [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Mr. Kanther, what has  happened to the issues of internal security? Christian  Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU], Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], and Social Democratic Party  of Germany [SPD] announced that they would put it at the top of  the list of election campaign priorities. Nevertheless,  internal security is in the background of public discussion.    [Kanther] Not at all. We are not just complaining loudly but  are doing practical work in the coalition. The point is success  in the matter and not headlines. You can see that the issue is  very important if you look at what we have achieved: The  circumstances surrounding the antiterrorist action in Bad  Kleinen have been clarified; we have presented a 1994 anticrime  law; we have worked out the concepts for a law dealing with the  Federal Office of Criminal Investigations and the Federal Border  Police; the asylum problem has improved; the violent Workers  Party of Kurdistan (PKK) has been banned; and the program for  internal security has been adopted together with the laender.  This is how I want to work.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Nevertheless, as a political issue  internal security is not playing a big role. Is something true  about the accusation being expressed secretly by some CDU/CSU  politicians that Manfred Kanther does not really want to  distinguish himself from the FDP and the SPD, that you are not  interested in sharpening the conservative profile of the CDU/CSU?    [Kanther] First, according to all polls, internal security  is  at the top of the list of issues in which citizens are  interested, right behind economic issues. Second, I am pursuing  a practical policy in which results are important, not some  quarrel. We can be satisfied with the results of our work after  nine months of my term of office; this sharpens the CDU/CSU  profile regarding achievements -- and this is the important  thing.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Is it so difficult to distinguish  oneself from the SPD? Basically, their domestic policy concepts  are no longer really so different from yours.    [Kanther] I deny that. The SPD has indeed concurrently  adopted a different attitude toward issues of internal security  than in the past. The party leaders in particular are now  realizing that crime, foreigners, and asylum are questions that  are important to citizens and that it is impossible to make  progress with the empty phrases used in the 1980's. However, it  is still open whether the SPD is really determined to put its  narrow party congress decisions into practice at the appropriate  time. They will have ample opportunity to prove that in the  Bundestag, when a vote is taken on the aforementioned draft laws.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] In other words: Regarding questions  of internal security there is no longer the more liberal SPD on  the one side and the more conservative CDU/CSU on the other?    [Kanther] It is good that the SPD has come closer to the  government in the fields of combating crime or asylum. In this  way we can work more efficiently, and the Federal Government and  the laender, the majority of which are ruled by the SPD and are  largely responsible for the police and judiciary, have an easier  time cooperating.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Has the SPD not already overtaken  you? In contrast to the CDU and the CSU the party demands that  assets are to be seized already when the owner cannot refute the  suspicion that they have been acquired illegally.    [Kanther] I think that this SPD demand is untenable in a  constitutional state. It ignores the principle that the state  must prove that a citizen is guilty and not the citizen that he  is innocent. Rejection of this idea is unanimous among the  experts. After all, the SPD's proposal smells strongly of  election campaign. Only a few months ago did we make money  laundering a punishable offense. There has been practically no  experience yet with the new fine on assets and the so-called  expanded forfeiture. Thus, it would be wrong to create new  regulations before the newly introduced regulations have been  tested.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] You and the CDU/CSU constantly speak  of "exploding crime statistics," the "kraken of crime, which is  stretching its arms out to everything." Of course, many crimes  are committed. Nevertheless, it seems that the CDU/CSU is  fanning fears to improve the social climate for ever stricter  laws. Why else would you present the development of crime as  worse than it actually is?    [Kanther] It is an indisputable fact that more and more  crimes are committed, and that they have reached a point that is  unacceptable. We are not exaggerating anything; but we must  accept reality and react with clear measures.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] The crime statics do not justify  your  drastic perspective. The number of registered crimes during the  first half of 1993 rose by 3.4 percent; during the same period  in 1992 we had an increase of 9.6 percent. This slower rate of  increase is certainly not a reason to sound the all clear, but  it should be reason enough not to continue frightening the many  worried people with new depictions of the apocalypse, should it  not?    [Kanther] I read the statistics differently. For instance, I  see that crime has skyrocketed in the new laender.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] This is primarily due to the fact  that up to the period after the fall of the Wall, police there  hardly kept any crime statistics and that the readiness of the  east Germans to complain about crimes was negligible for a long  time. Anyone who ignores all this pursues a "dubious and  completely unnecessary dramatization," according to the renowned  criminologist Christian Pfeiffer from Hamburg. Does this  accusation concern you?    [Kanther] Not at all. Unfortunately, crime is not declining  but rising. There are still those who whitewash a bad situation  and who often do not want to admit their own political errors.  In addition, the point is not just the development of  statistics. What the people feel is equally important, the  feeling of safety and insecurity is conveyed at a broad level,  primarily by the media.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Liberal lawyers criticize the "1994  Anticrime Law" as much too restrictive; your own people think it  is too moderate. Mr. Werthebach, the president of the Federal  Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV], for  instance, complains that in the future, his office will be  permitted to keep an eye only on political extremism and not  organized crime. What do you say?    [Kanther] The BfV is sufficiently busy with left-wing  extremism and right-wing extremism and violence of foreigners in  the FRG, in particular since it does not have that much  personnel. Therefore, I do not see any reason to expand its  competence to cover organized crime. The is the business of the  police, which must be better equipped for that.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] In this year's Constitutional  Protection Report you also did not classify the Republikaner as  right-wing extremist. Is the examination of this issue so  difficult because, among other things, the statements of some  Republikaner are barely different from those of some CDU/CSU or  SPD politicians?    [Kanther] As interior minister I have the duty to examine  the  issue of classification very carefully from the juridical point  of view, because a decision must hold up in court. So far, it  has not been possible to prove that the Republikaner have a  basic aggressive-militant attitude against the Constitution. In  addition, there is not sufficient evidence that the party  leadership tolerates or promotes political or criminal  perpetrators in their own ranks. On the contrary. Many party  functionaries have long restrained themselves verbally so that  they cannot be attacked. Just because one feels like throwing  up when one hears Mr. Schoenhuber's ranting, one cannot classify  the Republikaner as extremist or ban them. This is the field of  political conflict, which FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU has been  demanding for 20 years in the struggle against political  left-wing extremists in many different disguises.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Bavaria's minister-president warns  against the "penetration of society by other races" and  "lecherous niggers"; a CDU mayor states that, in order to  balance the city budget, "a few rich Jews" would have "to be  killed"; an SPD group chairman suggests a solution to the asylum  problem: Make short work of it, grab them by the head and the  collar and throw them out. And so on and so forth. Did you not  classify the Republikaner as extremist because it is a political  problem to measure them by their words, which are strongly  similar to those of some CDU and SPD politicians?    [Kanther] I consider such a question detestable and,  therefore, I am not going to answer it. Back to the matter at  hand: I can classify a party as extremist or ban it only if  there is enough proof available. Imagine what would happen if  the Republikaner sued against the classification as right-wing  extremist and were to win: This would be a self-inflicted wound  for democracy. However, I would also like to mention somebody  else who bears responsible in connection with right-wing  extremism: the media. In my view, coverage of the Republikaner  is excessive. One constantly hears and reads what Mr.  Schoenhuber said. However, only a few newspapers or television  stations ask what is behind the empty phrases of the  Republikaner chairman. One hears practically nothing about what  the party suggests for the protection of internal security, for  the solution of economic problems, and that it does not offer  serious concepts for anything.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Does that meant that the media are  to  be blamed for the success of the Republikaner? Should one keep  silent about the rightists?    [Kanther] This would be completely wrong. However,  journalists, too, must be aware of what their reports are doing.  There is a narrow edge between necessary coverage and constant  repetition of identical facts, which may then be transformed  into free propaganda. There is no panacea for that. I think  that many people in the media are not sufficiently aware of this  sensitive situation.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Are the politicians of the CDU/CSU,  FDP, and SPD sufficiently aware of how they have to deal with  the right-wing radicals and right-wing extremists? We feel that  the established parties tend toward adjusting toward the  political right because they fear to lose voters. And we are  also thinking of the endless discussions about joint television  appearances and panel discussions with the Republikaner.    [Kanther] The latter must be decided in each individual  case.  One thing quite clear, however: The democratic parties must  never give the impression that we are cooperating with the  Republikaner. The Hesse CDU, for instance, did not conclude one  single agreement with the Republikaner on personnel decisions  after the local elections in March 1993. However, the  democratic parties must not make themselves dependent on what  the Republikaner think. If the CDU or SPD were never again to  initiate local policy without the approval of the Republikaner,  the traditional parties would have to give up their work. This  would be an absurd logic. By the way: At the local level one  usually cannot deal with the radicals regarding material issues,  because they are mostly either absent or lazy, uninformed, and  torn by strife. In Hesse local policy there would be the  opportunity to publicly deal with the Republikaner through  motions on specific issues. This has not occurred because the  Republikaner have not participated. It is important to explain  this complete ineffectiveness to their voters.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Even if the Republikaner were not in  some parliaments or did not have good prospects of entering a  few more, we would nevertheless have to live with a certain  potential for a basic right-wing extremist attitude in society  and with right-wing extremists. How much right-wing extremism  can a state such as the FRG tolerate?    [Kanther] One has to put the question differently: How much  extremism can a fundamentally liberal system afford? I think  this depends on an overall assessment of the danger. We  tolerated DKP [Communist Party of Germany] left-wing extremeists  for 30 years, who were supported by a communist superpower. It  was argued that one has to deal politically with these groups  and persons. This also applies to dealing with right-wing  extremism. Even if right-wing extremism were to decline to .01  percent, one would still have to live with these madmen, just as  we live with the leftist madmen. The task consists in making  political extremists of all shades completely ineffective  politically. However, there is an additional danger that  emanates from the right-wing extremists: Because of German  history, it is viewed much more strongly by other countries and  harms our international image. This is another central reason  for me to deal with right-wing extremists.</p>

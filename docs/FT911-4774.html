			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Germany boosts relief effort in northern Iraq THE German government yesterday agreed a sharp increase in aid for Kurdish refugees in the area around northern Iraq, with a total of DM440m (Pounds 146m) now earmarked for a humanitarian operation given all-party support in Bonn. Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the foreign minister, said German hospitals would offer beds for victims of Baghdad's aggression against the Kurdish people. Mr Genscher, who will fly to eastern Anatolia tomorrow to inspect the relief operations, said the lives of 'hundreds of thousands' were at stake. In an unusual display of harmony, the German Bundestag unanimously condemned Iraq's persecution of the Kurdish people as 'attempted genocide'. A motion proposed by the government and opposition supported the use of military force in the region if necessary to dissuade the Baghdad regime from further action against the Kurds. Yesterday's increase in aid to the refugees, agreed at the weekly cabinet meeting, came as the German army sent more helicopters to eastern Turkey for use in supply missions for the displaced population. A total of 20 Bundeswehr helicopters are planned to be in use there later this week. The German government funds will be used to finance help organised by the German Red Cross and other international charity operations. It will also go towards the rescue efforts mounted by the German army.</p>

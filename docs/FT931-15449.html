			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Yeltsin appoints energy minister RUSSIAN PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin has finally filled the vacancy of fuel and energy minister by appointing Mr Yuri Shafranik, the powerful governor of Tyumen, Russia's richest oil-producing region. The president's office said last night that Mr Yeltsin had made the appointment on the recommendation of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, himself deputy prime minister responsible for energy policy until he was elected prime minister last month. The fuel and energy post had been vacant since Mr Vladimir Lopukhin was sacked last June. Mr Chernomyrdin, manager of the Gasprom gas monopoly until he joined the government in June, has made a shrewd choice in that Mr Shafranik had always fiercely defended the right of the regions to determine policy rather than simply follow Moscow's commands. As a poacher turned gamekeeper, Mr Shafranik will have a head start in supervising the country's fragmented oil industry and getting on with the so-called 'oil generals' who run state-owned enterprises whose size rivals the biggest western oil companies. The centralised and more successful gas industry will continue to run itself as a single monopoly concern encompassing gas production in other former Soviet republics. Mr Shafranik's main task will be to try to stem a fall in oil output, which has continued for more than three years, despite preliminary ministry figures showing a 22 per cent increase in lucrative hard currency exports last year to 66.2m tonnes. Mr Andrei Konoplyannik, deputy minister for fuel and energy, said yesterday that production of oil and gas condensate in 1992 had fallen nearly 15 per cent to around 393m tonnes. In contrast, gas production had fallen just 0.5 per cent to 640bn cubic metres. Mr Shafranik will also have to grapple with a complex programme for the limited privatisation of oil enterprises preserving state control of a key Russian source of foreign exchange. The coal industry meanwhile is badly in need of restructuring and a political tinder box. The miners were instrumental in undermining the rulers of the old Soviet Union with political strikes.</p>

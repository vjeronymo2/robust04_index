			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Cubans bullish over UK trade delegation visit A high-level British trade mission to Cuba next week could lead to a 'significant' increase in business and commercial ties with the European Union, to the detriment of US companies, according to Cuban officials. The mission, led by Mr Ian Taylor, the trade and technology minister, will include representatives from the leisure, construction and manufacturing industries, and is the first official visit by a British minister in more than 20 years. The officials said the visit could lead US business to put pressure on their government to relax or remove the 32-year economic embargo before they 'lose all opportunities' for business with and in Cuba. 'We are open for business, and the world is realising this,' said a Cuban government official. 'We have a business climate which is better than that in most other countries of our size and our state of development. We have workers who are highly educated and are eager to work.' The Cuban government is also laying great store by recent changes in economic policy which officials say will attract investments and trade opportunities from Britain and other European countries. They point to the free use of foreign currency on the island, and investment regulations which allow the retention and repatriation of profits, and efforts to encourage private individual and co-operative business ventures. Infrastructural problems and deficiencies in utilities such as power and telecommunications are being mended, they say. The British mission, in Cuba from Monday to Wednesday, will be encouraged to explore business opportunities in the form of joint or wholly-owned ventures in tourism, manufacturing, biotechnology and the marketing of a range of Cuban agricultural exports. 'Fidel (Castro) said recently that if the United States does not end the embargo soon, there will not be even one grain of sand left here for American business,' said the Cuban spokesman. 'The British and other governments and companies which are brave enough to ignore American pressure to reduce economic links with Cuba are getting in on the ground floor.' Aware of concern about the safety of foreign investments, the island's government will negotiate an investment protection treaty with Britain later this year, and will be willing to enter similar agreements with other countries, said government spokesmen.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour warns on social chapter MR JOHN SMITH confirmed yesterday that the Labour leadership would seek to derail the government's legislation implementing the Maastricht Treaty by defeating it over Britain's opt-out from the social chapter, Philip Stephens writes. His comments, published in today's issue of The Times, raised the possibility that an alliance of opposition parties and Tory Euro-sceptics could force the government either to drop ratification or to seek renegotiation of the treaty. Mr Smith insisted that Britain could still ratify the agreement if the government was defeated over the special protocol it negotiated to exclude it from the social provisions of the treaty. He said that other European states would allow the government to drop the opt-out protocol and then press ahead with ratification of the treaty. But that view was flatly rejected both by the government and by the Tory Euro-sceptics who are determined to defeat the treaty. Displaying a rare consensus, ministers and Tory back-bench rebels concurred that if Mr Smith was successful Mr John Major would be unable to ratify Maastricht. Ministers said that Denmark inevitably would take advantage of any renegotiation to seek the inclusion in a new treaty of the informal opt-outs from Maastricht it secured at last December's Edinburgh summit. In those circumstances the whole process might unravel. Senior Tory party managers acknowledged last night that the House of Commons vote on the social chapter, expected next month, would seriously threaten the government's majority. The Liberal Democrats have up to now indicated that they are prepared to vote with Labour against the government. But Mr Major may be able to rely upon the intense opposition of Tory constituency associations to the social chapter to limit the number of rebels on his own backbenches.</p>

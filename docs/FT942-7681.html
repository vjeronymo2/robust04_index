			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Low foreign take-up in Hungarian bond Foreign investors have taken up less than 1 per cent of eastern Europe's first domestic-currency state bond, a Hungarian government issue aimed at international institutions. Three-year government bonds worth Ft15bn were put on sale but foreign buyers accounted for just Ft104m of demand. Total subscriptions amounted to Ft8.75bn, including applications by Hungarian state-owned institutions. GiroCredit Budapest, the global adviser, said it expected foreign investors to enter the secondary market and maintained that the issue had successfully opened the international market in 'paprika bonds'. Other brokers said that the issue had fallen woefully short of expectations and privately described the sale to foreigners as a 'flop'. US investors in particular have been alarmed by the resurgence of the Hungarian Socialist Party, the former communists, and the prospect of their return to office after the second and decisive round of voting on Sunday. At all events, the paprika bond's aggressive 25 per cent coupon has proved insufficient to offset fears of a devaluation by the next government. Last year the National Bank of Hungary, the central bank which up to now has had sole responsibility for nearly all global borrowing, sold Dollars 4.5bn worth of bonds in dollars, D-marks, yen and other denominations to make Hungary one of the most active international sovereign borrowers. The central bank opposed the issue of a forint bond saying that it would lead to currency speculation. Prior to this issue it blocked the issue of international certificates of the bond, insisting that trading take place in Hungary. The National Bank also changed Hungary's currency basket, giving it a 70 per cent Ecu and 30 per cent dollar component and increased its repo interest rate. These moves were instrumental in upsetting investors' calculations, traders say.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : FRANN SAYS GOODBY TO 'NEWHART' IMAGE AS A JACKIE COLLINS HEROINE  </P> <P> Does Bob Newhart know about this?  </P> <P> For eight seasons, actress Mary Frann played the sweet, sweater-clad wife of  button-down Bob on the CBS comedy series "Newhart."  </P> <P> But she sheds her goody-two-shoes image, her sweaters and a lot more in NBC's  miniseries "Jackie Collins' Lucky/Chances," which airs Sunday-Tuesday at 9 p.m.  on KNBC.  </P> <P> In the six-hour melodrama based on the two Jackie Collins' best-sellers, Frann  plays the sultry Clementine who gives a young man (Vincent Irizarry) is Ph.D in  sex education.  </P> <P> The actress says she's been "real careful" about the projects she has done  since "Newhart" ended in May. "I wanted to do something that would surprise  people," she says. "The public, I think, is far more adaptable than people in  the industry."  </P> <P> Frann jumped at the opportunity to play such a savvy, sexy lady as Clementine.  "I thought it would be outrageous, flamboyant, glamorous," she says. "I wanted  to remind people that I was capable of playing many different roles.  </P> <P>  "She's is a very rich powerful and glamorous socialite in the 1930s," purrs  Frann. "She meets this character who is handsome and rough around the edges and  becomes his tutor. She has her own set of rules. She doesn't care what people  say."  </P> <P> People will probably be saying a lot about Frann's steamy sex scenes with  co-star Irizarry, including one in which she feeds him strawberries dipped in  chocolate. "After we shot three scenes the first day, the next day we had to  close the set," she recalls. "After they saw the dailies, we had 50 extra  people on the set." SUSAN KING  </P></p>

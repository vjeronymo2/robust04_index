			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Carlton threat to sell stake in Meridian Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, has warned Lord Hollick of MAI, the broadcasting and financial services group, that he will sell his 20 per cent stake in Meridian Broadcasting unless minority shareholders get a better deal. Mr Green, it is believed, met Lord Hollick, the MAI chief executive, last week to discuss the issue following MAI's acquisition of Anglia Television. Carlton acquired its stake in Meridian, the ITV company for the south of England, through its acquisition of Central Independent Television. Mr Green is believed to be concerned about the level of information received by shareholders such as Carlton and SelecTV, the independent programme maker which holds a 15 per cent stake in Meridian. Both companies, it is understood, found out about MAI's participation in a consortium to bid for a possible Channel 5 licence when they were sent a press release. Both Carlton and SelecTV also fear that Anglia, acquired by the main MAI company, could become a subsidiary of MAI Broadcasting, itself a subsidiary of MAI, thereby bypassing Meridian. The minority shareholders are worried that any savings flowing from the acquisition will not go to Meridian. MAI said it would not comment on 'anonymous gossip'. Mr Alan McKeown, chief executive of SelecTV, producers of programmes such as Birds of a Feather, believes the company has not received full credit for its role in helping Meridian win its franchise. Meanwhile Carlton is likely to buy out the two 5 per cent minority shareholdings in Carlton Television: The Telegraph group, publishers of the Daily Telegraph, and RCS, the Italian media group. Both would have to put up an additional Pounds 40m each to avoid dilution of their stake in the enlarged television business, something that is considered unlikely.</p>

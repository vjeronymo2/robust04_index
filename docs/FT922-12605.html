			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Survey of Swindon (7): New stimulus for manufacturing - Profile: Honda ANYONE who believes the closure of Swindon's railway workshops was the end of Swindon as a serious manufacturing centre needs to drive around the town's north-eastern bypass. There, dominating the skyline near the village of South Marston is the massive new factory of Honda of the UK Manufacturing (HUM), which is now tooling up for an expansion from engine production into full motor car assembly. Far from having abandoned manufacturing, Swindon has become one of the key participants in the revival of the British motor industry being spearheaded by Japanese motor manufacturers. Last November's announcement by Honda and the Rover Group that they were extending the joint manufacturing relationship which first began in 1979 into the 1990s was particularly good news for the town. It revealed that Honda had decided to produce a second model at Swindon. It also killed off any lingering speculation, in the wake of British Aerospace's reluctant take-over of the British car manufacturer and the more difficult market for motor manufacturers in Europe generally, that Honda might prefer to find a new, more successful partner in continental Europe. That had always looked ears ago, HUM and Rover purchased 20 per cent in each other. Even so, Rover's body pressings plant at Swindon was very glad to have confirmation that it will continue as Honda's main European supplier of metal body panels. Honda's growth in Swindon has been rapid. Spurning the lure of development area grants and incentives, the Japanese motor manufacturer first established a presence near the town in 1985. Like Toyota in Derby, Honda was evidently offered its present 360-acre site  -complete with an old wartime airfield for test driving vehicles - at a price which it could not refuse. The local authority was instrumental in obtaining planning permission. Plans for the engine plant were unveiled in 1987 and that project came on stream in 1989, producing 70,000 units in its first year. Today, the engine plant is producing at the rate of more than 100,000 1.6 litre double overhead cam engines a year, all of which go to Rover's Longbridge assembly plant for installation in Rover's 200 and 400 models and (some 40,000 of them) in the Honda Concerto. The Concerto is assembled by Rover at Longbridge for Honda under sub-contract. The new Swindon assembly plant is due to come on stream this autumn, manufacturing 'Synchro', the code name given to Honda's first range of UK-assembled 2-litre cars for the European market. The initial output of Synchro is to be 50,000 units a year, increasing to 100,000 by the mid-1990s. Production of the second model, a successor to the Concerto, will begin in August 1994. By early 1995, when the assembly plant is due to move to full two-shift working, Honda expects to be employing 2,000 workers, or 'associates' as the company prefers to call them. This figure compares with a total of 753 'associates' employed on the Swindon site at present. Even by Japanese standards, Honda is famous for the very strong emphasis which it places as a company on team work and respect for the individual, Mr Andrew Jones, the plant manager explains. 'Associates' are selected on the basis that they will work and develop together; have never worked in the motor industry before; and that they fully accept the participatory style of working for which Japanese-style manufacturing is famous. With the exception of a few specialist senior engineers and computer personnel, Honda recruits all its staff locally and trains them in-house. Three of the departmental managers began their careers on the shop floor. Mr Jones is proud of what has already been achieved. The productivity of the engine plant is high - 99.88 per cent of engines coming off the assembly line achieve right first time firing. More than 50 teams are working in Quality Circles on ideas which could make it even more productive. Other ideas, already implemented, have saved thousands of pounds annually. 'On July I, 1990, I told staff I was cutting their working week from 39 to 37 hours - a reduction in productive time of 5.1 per cent. I asked them if they could return it in increased productivity - and they did,' Mr Jones said. Given this kind of performance, Honda in Swindon is on course to become a strong player in the European car market of the 1990s. By all accounts car manufacturers in Germany, France and Italy are beginning to worry whether they will be able to compete with the lean production techniques of Japanese-owned motor manufacturing plants being established in the UK. Honda looks well set to compete in other ways. Its location makes good sense in view of the relationship with Rover. It is only two miles from Rover's body and pressings plant in Swindon, 30 miles from Cowley, and 80 miles from Longbridge; and it is within easy reach of Heathrow. It is also close to the M4 and M5 and to the ports of Bristol for imports and Southampton for exports.</p>

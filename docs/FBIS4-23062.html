Kotlyarov; UDC 621.396.61:621.375.026] </F>   [Abstract] The criteria for statistical optimization of the  power engineering of the adaptive sections of wideband  vacuum-tube oscillators not containing automatic load-matching  systems were considered. The operating algorithm of the system  considered was geared toward maximum output power and electronic  efficiency of the terminal section of the transmitter by  establishing the optimum excitation voltage in the vacuum tube's  control grid and optimal plate supply voltage at which the  oscillator's dynamic range is fully utilized. Working  measurements of an actual vacuum tube's electrical operating  modes served as the starting data. First a generalized  mathematical model of the oscillator stage was developed. The  optimal resistance of the vacuum-tube oscillator's load was  calculated. The third stage of the statistical analysis  consisted of a computer simulation of a vacuum-tube oscillator  based on a GU-92B tetrode that was connected in a circuit with a  common cathode and operated in a class B mode for a randomly  mismatched load. The analysis established that the greater the  uncertainty of the impedance of the antenna-feed section of the  transmitter, the higher the the energy gain obtained by adapting  the oscillator's mode to the load mismatch. This design decision  was thus recommended for use when designing items such as  wideband shortwave and ultrashortwave radio transmitters for  mobile equipment with short antennas where frequency  irregularity and time instability of input impedance are both  very significant.

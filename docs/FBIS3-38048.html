But greater openness is required if only to dispel the  rumors  that two islands near Khabarovsk in the Amur River and Bolshoy  Island in the Argun River will soon share the fate of Damanskiy;  that is, they will be transferred to the Chinese.    In actual fact Russia does not intend to give these three  islands away. An informed source has reported that our Border  Troops subunit, military base, and recreation center are located  on the islands near Khabarovsk and that we regard them as  Russian soil. At the same time Moscow is prepared to continue  holding talks on these islands. Because abandoning the talks  could lead only to an escalation of tension. In fact, the same  happened at the time the USSR existed, when M.S. Gorbachev  stated that the problem of the islands had been solved once and  for all. This provoked a strong reaction in Beijing.    Not long before the last round of talks, which ended a few  days ago in the PRC capital, Chinese representatives hinted that  they were prepared to concede Bolshoy Island if Russia took the  same step in relation to the two islands in the Amur. From  Moscow's viewpoint this is an unacceptable idea. Therefore at  the meeting in Beijing all the sides could do was to again  recognize the existence of radical differences and postpone a  solution to the question of the islands to an unspecified time  in the future.    The talks on the line of the border between China and  Tajikistan were also deadlocked. It is a question of control of  part of the Pamir. The scale of the differences is indicated by  the fact that China is laying claim to approximately one-third  of the territory of Gorno-Badakhshan Oblast. But bearing in  mind that this is an area in which Tajik armed opposition forces  are especially active, it will be understood why Beijing is not  trying to force a settlement of this dispute. It too has been  postponed until a better time.    It should not be concluded from the foregoing that the  Beijing meeting ended in failure. Far from it. With the  exception of the islands in the two rivers and the Pamir, the  differences concerning other sectors of the border between the  PRC and the CIS, which is over 7,000 km long, are being  successfully overcome. In the sector to the east of Mongolia a  border line has already been drawn on the map, and on-site  demarcation work is now under way. Nor should complications  arise over the western sector of the Russian-Chinese border,  which is 54 km long.    As regards relations between China and Kazakhstan, a border  agreement between them is expected to be signed this spring,  during Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit to Almaty. In addition,  a source considers it a positive feature that the  representatives of the three Asiatic CIS states are  collaborating closely with Russia and are relying on the  informational material accumulated by our diplomacy. The next  round of talks will take place in one of the CIS states.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> HERE, DEAF CAN BE LIKE THE OTHERS  </P> <P> High school senior Debbie Hughes of Fountain Valley has goals much like other  teen-agers: She wants to go to UC Davis and become a veterinarian.  </P> <P> But for Debbie, pursuing them means traveling the many miles to University High  School in Irvine.  </P> <P> Debbie, who is deaf, is one of 67 Orange County teen-agers enrolled in the  county's only program for the hearing-impaired that allows them to attend  regular classes with their hearing peers.  </P> <P> The students in the program also participate in all the activities that are  part of a regular high school life. Their circumstances are acknowledged but  not considered a problem. They are there to interact as much as possible with  hearing peers. And, like all of the school's students, they are encouraged to  set goals, such as landing part-time jobs or attending college. There are,  however, special workshops for the hearing-impaired students to help them with  any problems.  </P> <P> "They (administrators) make sure that we participate and treat us all the  same," Debbie says.  </P> <P> More than half of the students in the program attend mainstream classes. There  are interpreters for them in these, and also for any of the extracurricular  activities they may be pursuing. The interpreters are present during every  game, practice and meeting.  </P> <P> The school's sports programs and student government have both counted  hearing-impaired students among their participants. This year, though, for the  first time in the history of the program, there is a hearing-impaired student  on the cheerleading squad. Erika Dickson, a junior, said she is pleased with  the acceptance she has received. MARCI HANOVER  </P></p>

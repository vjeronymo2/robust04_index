			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Sport: No question for courts to tackle Two sportsmen sit in a court of law. A judge decides, if, during the course of a game, one of them was guilty of inflicting intentional injury upon the other. It is a strange scenario. It seems inappropriate, almost to the point of absurdity, that the elephantine weight of the judicial process should be brought to bear upon that fleeting rush of blood, that momentary loss of control, that ridiculous clash of wills; that it should be brought to bear upon a 'tackle'. Surely the person who inflicts intentional injury is the thug with the jagged bottle? There might be a few such people on the terraces; but on the pitch? How can the two arenas be in any way compared? Does not the question of guilt or innocence, so clear-cut in the case of the football hooligan, become amorphous and - again - inappropriate when applied to the essentially unreal world of the game? Yet the question has been raised over the past few weeks. Ex-Chelsea player Paul Elliott had his knee and his career wrecked in a tackle by Dean Saunders (then of Liverpool, now of Aston Villa), and took Saunders to court for compensation. In order to receive any money, Elliott had to establish that Saunders' tackle was reckless or dangerous; that he had been going for the man and not the ball. This question, one of the most commonplace in football and snap-judged by referees perhaps every week in the season, had, through the severity of Elliott's injury, become a different question; whether Saunders was guilty or innocent. Yet it is hard to believe that anyone in the case thought of it in that way. Surely Elliott didn't really believe that Saunders was 'guilty' of anything? Surely there was some deliberate, if necessary, obfuscation of the issue; Elliott wanted money, rather than the condemnation of Saunders, but he could not get the first without the second? It was an absurd situation; not because of the claim itself, which Elliott had every right to make, but because of the way in which he had to make it. It wasn't even as if the question of guilt or innocence was easy to judge. Certainly the effects of the tackle were horrific, but one might see any number that look more obviously reckless. This added another level of absurdity to proceedings, as a parade of witnesses passed solemnly thought the court to tell it whether or not they thought Saunders had been going for the ball. The final absurdity came when Mr Justice Drake, having listened to this minutely observed evidence, decided he would, after all and nonetheless, abide by the instant judgment of the match officials. At the time of the collision, the referee had awarded the free kick to Liverpool; and the referee is always right. It is interesting to imagine what would have happened had the tackle been completely indefensible. In the Elliott case, the question of whether or not a sportsman can be adjudged guilty in a court of law, for a misdemeanour committed on a playing field, was obscured by the attention given to whether or not Dean Saunders was guilty of 'anything'. Everybody was absorbed in the little intricacies of what had happened two years ago. Nobody had to address the larger muddle that is happening now. Sport was let off the hook by the fact that Elliott's case rested more on the dreadful effects of the tackle than on the tackle itself. What might happen if a clearer case was brought, in which no evidence could be given in favour of the sportsman who inflicted the injury? Another question would still remain; that of intent. It is hard enough to say what motivates any sudden assault, and it would be almost impossible to prove what lay within the impassioned convulsions that shake team sport. Even that of Van der Bergh, the South African rugby player whose studs ripped Jon Callard's head to shreds, could probably defend himself by saying that in the heat of the moment he lost all consciousness of the fact that he was walking around somebody's eye. And Dean Saunders: even if his tackle on Paul Elliott had looked as wild as the one in which Paul Gascoigne wrecked his own knee, who could ever prove that there was intent behind it to harm another player? It is an accusation which, again, is inappropriate. That is where guilt in the law court and guilt on the playing field become two different things. Sportsmen want to win; that desire can lead them to do things which are sometimes stupid, and sometimes that stupidity can have serious consequences. But the intention behind a sportsmen's actions is so confused by aggression - the dangerous commodity with which he is always dealing - that he himself would scarcely be able to analyse it. If the aggression is badly directed, then he is playing bad sport. If it is directed to a more deliberate, more sinister purpose, then he is not playing sport at all.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Just minutes ago, the National Assembly of the  People's Government [ANPP] concluded its session for today. The  debates will continue tomorrow. During today's session,  Commander in Chief Fidel Castro said that the economic measures  will be harsh and reiterated the desire to find solutions.    [Begin Castro recording] We are not only talking about  restructuring our finances; we are talking about revaluating our  currency, revaluating the wages of our workers, and revaluating  the peso. Those are truly very important things. Those are  decisive factors. I believe our inclination should be to take  the measures that are necessary -- whatever measures are  necessary. [applause] [end recording]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timken, however, believes that the Department should continue to adjust for home-market price increases, by using Koyo's ``positive'' price adjustments, as these data constitute the best information on the record concerning price increases during the periods of review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo states that the Department correctly accepted Koyo's home-market billing adjustments as direct selling expenses. Koyo argues that Timken's reliance on  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Torrington <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is misplaced because, although the CIT stated that the Department should not include billing adjustments for out-of-scope merchandise, the CIT proposed an alternative methodology whereby billing adjustments for in-scope merchandise can be calculated by identifying the ratio of in-scope merchandise to total sales to which these billing adjustments apply, and applying that ratio to total billing adjustments ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Torrington <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1578&hyph;79). Koyo maintains that the Department has verified and accepted Koyo's methodology in previously completed TRB reviews ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1990/91 and 1991/92 TRBs; Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished, from Japan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 57 FR 4951 (February 11, 1992))( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> TRBs I <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo concludes that the Department properly treated Koyo's home-market PSPAs as direct selling expenses. Koyo adds that if the Department contemplates rejecting Koyo's billing adjustments, it must, at a minimum, re-open the administrative record to allow Koyo to resubmit information that conforms to any new standard the Department may use in lieu of the standard prevailing in 1991 when Koyo submitted its consolidated response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : We disagree in part with Timken and Koyo. For these review periods, Koyo pooled all debit and credit notes associated with the PSPAs and rebates of each customer and allocated the amounts over the total purchases ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , in-scope and out-of-scope merchandise) of each customer. In our supplemental questionnaire we asked Koyo to demonstrate how each price adjustment was linked to each transaction. Koyo only provided a computer printout showing price adjustments by customer code. The price adjustments were divided by the customer's total purchases during each POR. Since Koyo's records during the PORs did not reveal the exact nature of the price adjustments, we have not treated these expenses as direct selling expenses. Nor have we limited the adjustments to only positive values, as Timken suggests, because the use of only positive values would distort the information submitted by Koyo. Therefore, we have classified Koyo's PSPAs and rebates as indirect, rather than direct, expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 12:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Koyo states that the CIT held in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 810 F.Supp. 1287, 1292 (CIT 1993) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Koyo Seiko <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and in numerous other cases that the antidumping statute requires the Department to make a circumstance-of-sale (COS) adjustment to FMV for U.S. direct selling expenses. Koyo cites as examples  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NSK Ltd.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No. 92&hyph;03&hyph;00158, Slip Op. 93&hyph;216 (CIT Nov. 18, 1993), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NTN Bearing Corp. of America  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No. 91&hyph;08&hyph;00576, Slip Op. 93&hyph;56 (CIT April 21, 1993)). Given such clear and consistent instruction from the CIT, Koyo argues that the Department, for these final results, must adjust for U.S. direct selling expenses by adding these expenses to FMV, rather than by subtracting them from USP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSK argues that the Department's treatment of U.S. direct selling expenses as adjustments to USP was contrary to law and judicial precedent. NSK argues that U.S. direct selling expenses are properly treated as upward adjustments to FMV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken counters that the law requires Customs to collect the full amount of the difference between USP and FMV, and if an improper denominator is used in calculating the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad valorem <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  appraisement rate, respondents will escape collection of the full amount of duties. Timken asserts that in order for Customs to apply appraisement rates to the entries subject to these reviews, the Department should calculate the percentage rates on the basis of entered value. If this is done, Timken claims there will be no difference in the rates calculated regardless of whether the expenses are subtracted from USP or added to FMV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, Timken notes that the Department has declined to follow the decisions cited by NSK and Koyo ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1990/91 and 1991/92 TRBs <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), on the grounds that an appeal of the underlying issue is pending in other TRB litigation. Therefore, Timken states that the Department should continue to deduct direct selling expenses from USP rather than add them to FMV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (20): Choose the place, then the route - School fees INDEPENDENT EDUCATION has a reputation for being elitist. High fees, which are increasing ahead of the rate of inflation, could make this even worse. Meanwhile, falling interest rates have forced parents to take a slightly higher level of risk if they want to plan ahead. But forward-planning can still bring independent education within the range of many families who feel that will give their children an advantage. School fees can become an even bigger financial commitment than a house purchase, which justifies making a special, ear-marked plan. But financial considerations should not be allowed to dictate the choice of school - one of the most important decisions a family ever makes. If you want to send your child to a big city single-sex day school - and FT surveys continually suggest that these provide the best value for money - you will have less of a problem meeting fees than you would with a famous boarding school. Once you have chosen a school, or produced a short list, contact bursars to find out what the current fees are and for an estimate of what they could be in future. Remember that you are aiming for a fixed commitment at a set time, and that securing more than the fees would be There is no point in saving more than you need. While you will probably need a disciplined plan to reach the target, it does not follow either that financial providers should impose extra discipline on you through punitive and inflexible charges, or that all your money should be put into one investment. Pre-packaged 'school fees plans' do not necessarily offer decent value for money. Your tax position is also of crucial importance in deciding which schemes make most sense - for example, if one partner is a non-taxpayer, they should use up their income tax allowance in a deposit account before trying anything more technical. Once these principles are in place, there are three routes to paying school fees, which will depend on your capital resources, and on the length of time before your child starts at school: From capital. Those able to pay fees with a lump sum have a broad range of opportunities. The classic solution is the educational trust. Funds in an educational trust can be invested tax-free, provided they are used to pay school fees - no specific school or pupil need be named. Life offices offer these trusts, accepting a fixed lump sum and then guaranteeing a certain level of fees through a series of annuities commencing at a certain point. But this can be expensive, as the guarantees are costly to fund - particularly now that gilt yields have come down. Thus advisers suggest they should only be used for part of fees, and should be restricted to 40 per cent taxpayers who have used up both their personal income tax allowances and their annual CGT allowance. Products ahead of them in the queue include personal equity plans, Tessas (tax-exempt special savings accounts) and zero-dividend shares of investment trusts, which offer a fixed return taxed as capital gains (useful for those who do not pay capital gains tax). Those certain of the school their child will attend might ask about 'composition schemes' where you pay a lump sum in advance, at a level which usually saves you money compared with paying fees as they arise. Such schemes are not transferable, which is the big disadvantage. From income. This is the way most people have to do it, and the traditional recommended method is the with-profits endowment. But the 'sum assured' will never be enough to pay school fees on its own. Other vehicles include Pep savings schemes, which are more flexible and tax-efficient, and a range of cash-based schemes, such as Tessas and National Savings. Of the latter, Children's Bonus Bonds have been designed specifically for saving on behalf of children. You could also buy a friendly society bond on behalf of your child - this is inflexible, but savings of Pounds 18 per month can be kept in a totally tax-free environment for the child, provided you keep paying in the money for 10 years. Equity-based products make more sense if there is still a long time to go before the child starts school. Cash-backed investments should take a larger share of the portfolio if the first day at school is nearer. From a Loan. This is only to be recommended if the start of the child's independent education is imminent, and there is no other way of paying for it. Probably the best loan scheme available is offered by Isis (the Independent Schools' Information Service) in conjunction with advisers Claremont Savile and the Halifax building society. This allows you to draw down the loan as and when you need it to pay fees, so you do not need to take all the debt up front as with a mortgage. Halifax has made no stipulations about how you repay the loan, so you can save towards it using any investment vehicle you like.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / DTI reopens Blue Arrow inquiry: NatWest wins chance to counter allegations over conduct at first hearing THE Department of Trade and Industry has reopened its inquiry into the Blue Arrow affair to investigate the roles in the scandal played by the senior management of National Westminster Bank. The appointment of DTI inspectors, announced yesterday by Mr Peter Lilley, the trade secretary, followed a call earlier this week by Lord Alexander, NatWest chairman, for such an inquiry. Lord Alexander's request was in response to allegations during the recent Blue Arrow trial and subsequently repeated in last week's Economist magazine. It was alleged that the bank and its chief executive, Mr Tom Frost, had misled the inspectors in the first inquiry and deliberately concealed documents from them. NatWest and Mr Tom Frost deny the allegations and asked for the DTI investigation in an attempt to clear their names. The inspectors appointed are Mr Michael Crystal QC and Mr David Spence, an accountant with Grant Thornton - who both conducted the first DTI inquiry into Blue Arrow - and Mr Victor Temple, a barrister. A DTI official said the inspectors would 'cast their net widely', although they would be looking in particular at evidence relating to the involvement of senior NatWest executives in the Blue Arrow rights issue which came out in the recent Blue Arrow trial. The DTI said that in launching the second inquiry it was responding in part to Lord Alexander's request. 'NatWest's request was the catalyst for the new inquiry', said an official. However, he pointed out that the investigation had been ordered under Section 432 of the Companies Act, which suggests that the department is taking into account other sources of information as well as the request from Lord Alexander. A section 432 inquiry is made when the DTI has reason to believe that wrongdoing has taken place worthy of investigation. Inquiries at the request of a company are brought under section 431 of the Act. The DTI said it was unlikely that NatWest would be asked to pay for the inquiry. Lord Alexander welcomed Mr Lilley's announcement. 'The bank will co-operate fully with the inspectors and I look forward to a speedy resolution of the inquiry,' he said. However, the DTI said the new inquiry was likely to last for 'months'. Mr Frost, who is expected to retire next year, will stay in his post as chief executive. NatWest said it was 'complete nonsense' to suggest that Mr Frost should stand down during the inquiry. During the year-long trial, a barrister acting for one of the defendants said a draft memo on NatWest's involvement in the Blue Arrow deal, containing handwritten notes made by Mr Frost, had not been submitted to the DTI inspectors. Separately Mr Hugh Hudson, the NatWest inspector who carried out the bank's internal inquiry into the affair, said during the trial that he felt 'let down' by Mr Frost and by Sir Philip Wilkinson, the former deputy chairman, for not supplying him with relevant documents. The new inquiry could mean the recalling of many of the witnesses who gave evidence to both the original inquiry and the trial. The Bank of England said it did not regard the new inquiry as a problem. 'We will supply the inspectors with all our papers, which we did the last time,' it said.</p>

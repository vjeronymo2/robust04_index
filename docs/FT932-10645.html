			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: General Re falls in first quarter GENERAL RE, the largest US reinsurer, recorded after-tax profits of Dollars 160.6m in the first quarter to end-March, sharply down on the Dollars 207.8m in the same period of 1992. Realised investment gains were significantly higher this time, at Dollars 53.8m, compared with Dollars 38.1m. However, the 1992 figure was lifted by a Dollars 61m surplus, which represented the cumulative effect of accounting rule changes. General Re said the underwriting loss stood at Dollars 38.9m, against Dollars 38.5m a year earlier. After-tax income without realised gains stood at Dollars 124.7m, up from Dollars 116.5m a year earlier. Written premium growth stood at 4.7 per cent in the first quarter, but the company said the full year would surpass this.</p>

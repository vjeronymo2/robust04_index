			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary" by Cuban Ambassador to Uruguay Manuel Aguilera </F> de la Paz]    [Text] The editorial published by this newspaper on 6 April  entitled "The Cuban Foreign Minister's Surprising Remarks"  includes the following:    "Havana has cunningly devised a well-orchestrated attempt to  present the U.S. boycott as a `blockade,' an `embargo,' or a  sort of `sanitary cordon' that is virtually driving Cuba to  famine. It should be clearly asserted that this is not the case.  The United States has placed Cuba under a trade boycott, thus  severing all U.S. trade relations with this island. In the eyes  of any stalwart supporter of Castro's regime, this ought to be  simply a welcome gesture of consistency on the part of the  United States."    This remark is really surprising, particularly considering  that in 1992 and again in 1993 the UN General Assembly approved  important resolutions on the "need to end the economic,  commercial, and financial blockade imposed by the United States  against Cuba," by an overwhelming majority that included  Uruguay's vote.    The blockade also has been condemned by the Nonaligned  Countries Movement, the Ibero-American summit meeting in Bahia,  UNESCO, and many other international organizations and events.    Cuba has submitted numerous proofs of the extraterritorial  nature of the blockade, that is, on the obstinate manner in  which the United States violates international law and the  freedom of trade it pretends to impose worldwide.    This evidence shows how successive U.S. administrations  placed obstacles and tried to prevent other countries from  trading or carrying out financial operations with the island.  The United States used pressure and threats--such as the  exclusion of those countries from U.S. trade and financing  programs, the suspension of U.S. credits, the blockade of  assistance by international financial organizations, and the  prohibition to export and import products to and from the United  States, etc.--to hinder trade with Cuba.    Today Cuba is introducing important economic changes and is  opening its doors to foreign investors, but eight of every 10  individuals interested in doing mutually profitable business  with Cuban companies withdraw due to threats and pressures  against them.    There are many other aberrant elements in the blockade, such  as the U.S. prohibition to import goods containing even the most  minimal quantity of Cuban components or raw materials, or the  prohibition affecting companies of any country from exporting  goods to Cuba containing U.S. components or raw materials. This  is a particularly sensitive point because it includes medicine  and food.    The United States also prevents the main international  financial institutions--such as the IMF, the World Bank, and the  Inter-American Development Bank--from granting loans and  assistance to Cuba.    If this were not enough, when socialism collapsed in East  Europe Cuba suddenly lost 85 percent of its economic and trade  partners, but the United States strengthened its blockade and  broadened the blockade's international application with the  sadly known Torricelli Law forbidding U.S. subsidiaries around  the world from trading with Cuba. The law also gives powers to  the president to impose sanctions on any country giving  assistance to Cuba and forbidding ships that trade with the  island from entering U.S. ports.    These extraterritorial demands are so grotesque that the EC  and Canada, among other countries, rejected them vigorously.    I did not want to refer to the blockade's effect on my  people. It has caused us damage estimated at more than $40  billion and provoked great scarcities and suffering, thus  revealing its criminal, cruel, and inhuman nature. But what  offends Cubans most is that it is unfair, illegal, immoral, and  unjustifiable because it pursues the objective of isolating  Cuba, obtaining its surrender by hunger, and imposing on her the  political, social, and economic order that U.S. authorities  consider most adequate and convenient to their interests.</p>

Minister Hofbauer had not consulted this  step with him, and he personally learned about it only from the  press.    According to Roman Kovac, the Slovak Government has for some  time had objections to the legal purity of the contract with the  RFE, as well as to the nature of its broadcasts. "We do have  serious reservations about the very small number of listeners of  this radio station, which uses one of the best radio  frequencies, reaching practically into Slovakia's every  village," Roman Kovac stressed. He does not perceive this  decision as a matter that would interfere with the plurality of  views, but he believes that it is not good to resort to such a  sharp step without previous consultations. However, he did not  rule out that, following the reassessment of all of the aspects,  the final verdict could be similar to that pronounced by Roman  Hofbauer.</p>

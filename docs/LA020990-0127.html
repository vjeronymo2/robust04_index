			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA;  </P> <P> CITY TO INSTALL TWO RADAR SPEED SIGNS  </P> <P> Signs that automatically display the speeds of passing drivers and the speed  limit will be installed at two sites in the city.  </P> <P> The movable radar signs, which are expected to be up for about six weeks, will  be used in connection with police surveillance to decrease drivers' speeds.  </P> <P> The City Council this week agreed to spend $14,000 for the equipment.  </P> <P> Councilman Irwin M. Fried said when he once passed such a sign, "the first  thing I did was check my speed. The second thing I did was check the speed  limit on the street. The third thing I did was check to see if there were any  police cars around, and the fourth thing I did was I definitely slowed down."  </P> <P> The council has not yet decided where the trailers will be placed.  </P></p>

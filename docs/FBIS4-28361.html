			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hokkaido University Professor Jiro Yamaguchi: </F> "Good Opportunity To Demolish MOF's Superior Position; Diet To  Raise Question"]    [Text] 1. Political instability increases dependency on the  bureaucracy for policy formation. Political initiative is  indispensable to reform bureaucratic control.    2. The prominent power of the MOF [Ministry of Finance]  bureaucrats regarding recent policy formation stands out. Today,  however, when the people's awareness concerning burdens and  benefits has matured, it can also be said that an opportunity  has come to demolish the past superiority of the MOF bureaucrats.    3. The relationships of regulation, cooperation, and  separation are necessary between policy and administration, and  system reform for these purposes is expected from the new  government.  <H5>  "Personifiers of National Interest" a Myth </H5>   The Hosokawa administration ended in an unexpected demise,  and the political world rushed feverishly into the second act of  its reorganization. Politicians tend to relish rebellions, and  they cannot help bouncing around like fish taking to water  during such an upheaval. However, it is highly questionable  whether the alignment changes among the political parties and  the politicians will actually lead to a change in Japan's  politics. The reason is that the point of how to escape from  bureaucratic control and to realize politics led by the  political parties is missing from today's axial issue of  reorganization of the parties.    In Japan's politics, the ruling party represents, instead of  an entity that embodies a doctrine, nothing more than a position  of monopoly access to the budget or authority in the hands of  the bureaucracy. The more the political parties compete with  each other and the longer the political vacuum is prolonged, the  greater the government's actual dependency on the bureaucracy  becomes. If the current drama of political party reorganization  fails to recharge political energy for the purpose of taking  command of the bureaucracy and ends as a tempest in a teacup  called Nagata-cho, the road to political reform must be deemed  to be far.    Following the change of administrations, there is a strong  impression of the MOF's mounting impact on policy formation. The  greatest barrier in an attempt to convert from bureaucratic  control to political party politics is probably how to change  this point.    During the past dozen or more years as the emergence of the  "zoku" Diet members became conspicuous, instead of examining the  need for individual annual spending programs, the MOF  bureaucrats have manipulated such symbols as the "cumulative  rise of national debts" or the "welfare revenue sources in an  aging society," and have devoted their efforts toward the  suppression of social expectation levels vis-a-vis policy  benefits.    A strategy existed of coexisting with interests politics on  the one hand, and forcing declining benefits and rising burdens  onto the general population on the other. With the change in  administrations, not only did the pressures of interests  politics weaken, but also as public opinion polls at the time of  the uproar over the people's welfare tax indicated, the majority  of the people have begun to think that an increase in the tax  burden is unavoidable if it is for the sake of stable social  security. It may perhaps be said to be a time for the  bureaucrats to rejoice.    However, such an environmental change has the potential to  destroy the MOF bureaucrats' own position of superiority. First  is the limitation to the debate on sound finance. The soundness  of finance is not a value per se, but a prerequisite condition  for coping with an important policy task.    As long as the people display a determination to pay taxes,  they have a legitimate right to demand an expansion of necessary  policy measures and a reduction of unnecessary measures. In the  first place, the authority of the MOF bureaucrats was permitted  to rule in a political atmosphere of lesser burdens and greater  benefits.    Second, there is the timid posture of the MOF bureaucrats  regarding a reexamination of the existing annual spending  structure. In addition to securing tax revenues, the  rationalization of annual expenditures is indispensable for  sound finance. However, the MOF bureaucrats have avoided any  restructuring of annual spending that takes time and effort  politically. Moreover, they have committed the contradiction of  investing profits from the sales of NTT [Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corporation] stocks, which should have been applied  toward national bond redemption, instead toward such  insignificant public service projects as resort development. The  myth that "MOF bureaucrats personify the national interest"  could probably be demolished by questioning such contradictions  from the side of politics.    Thus bureaucratic control that seemed to be strengthened at  first glance is not rock-firm at all. A break from bureaucratic  control becomes possible by the people and the politicians  shouldering the real costs of sustaining a welfare state on the  one hand, and making clear their intentions concerning policy  objectives on the other. Also, the bureaucrats should thus  prepare a scenario that includes a plurality of policy measures,  and the people should choose from them. Such is the inherent  arrangement of democratic politics in action.  <H5>  Point Out Problems Which Are Invisible From Within </H5>   Amid the present vortex of political party reorganization,  terms like "normal nation" and "social democratic liberal" are  being bandied about. However, without any viewpoint on the kind  of apparatus that will be formed to implement policy decisions,  such polemics remain mere symbols without content. Major policy  tasks change at intervals of 20 to 30 years, and a  reorganization of the political structure itself is demanded in  order to accurately respond to such changes.    In fact, examples in Europe and the United States show that  integration and abolition (reorganization) of central government  agencies is not so rare, and it is common for a new  administration to firmly implement the scrap-and-build process  of the agencies.    In this sense the strong continuity of Japan's central  government agencies may be regarded as exceptional. It is also a  reflection of the long-term continuity of one-party rule on the  side of politics, and the lack of concern among the political  leaders regarding a structuring of the administrative apparatus.  Speaking of creating new politics, it should be the  responsibility of the politicians to indicate a medium-term  vision, first of all, on what problems they will grapple with  and with what kind of administrative organization.    A debate on the posture of the bureaucrats often ends in a  simple attack on the bureaucrats due to anger against  bureaucratism. However, both the administrative organization and  policy were initially formed because of social demand, and it is  a delicate question as to whether it is pathological or  physiological for the bureaucrats to work diligently at their  stations and to defend their organizations and budgets. As our  experience as individuals proves, it is difficult for us to  objectively evaluate our own work.    When policy implemented by bureaucrats with a subjectively  noble sense of purpose loses its significance amid the eral and  environmental changes, and when no one within the existing  division-of-labor system notices the important problems that  have newly arisen, it is not the responsibility of the  bureaucrats themselves but the responsibility of politics to  point out such problems. It is a great misfortune for Japan's  bureaucrats that all others are virtually nonexistent.  Consequently, reform of bureaucratic control is inseparably  linked to improvement of competence on the side of politics.  <H5>  Bona Fide Administration With Command Power Necessary </H5>   The proper relations between politics and administration are  divided into the three categories of regulation, cooperation and  separation. Regulation exists when the political leaders are in  command over the bureaucracy and they check the efficiency and  integrity of administration on behalf of the people. Cooperation  exists when the response by the politicians to the people's will  and the specialized competence of the buraucrats blend together  smoothly. Separation means the rule that the authority and  financial resources held by the administrative organs are not  used to cultivate the power of specific parties or factions.    In Japan, the long postwar rule by the LDP [Liberal  Democratic Party] overlapped with the history of the  bureaucrats' position of superiority, and the relationship  between politics and administration became complicated.    For example, as the "zoku" Dietmen phenomenon indicates,  relations between the ruling party and the bureaucracy became  intimate and, as a result, the abuses of the bureaucracy such as  sectionalism and conservatism moved parallel to the ruling party  side. In addition, the cabinet and the ruling party lost their  power of leadership and coordination. Also, subsidies and the  licensing authority were used to broaden support for the ruling  party, resulting in a series of corruption scandals.    Consequently, a restructuring of the relations between  politics and administration based on the three criteria is  urgently necessary. In order to give concrete form to  regulation, it is first necessary to strengthen the cabinet as a  reservoir of political energy. In Japan, there are numerous  cases where the big boss of the ruling party such as  Representative Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  devotes himself to party affairs without necessarily becoming a  member of the cabinet himself. However, this is a problem from  the standpoint of the purpose of the parliamentary cabinet  system. First of all, the leading politicians must be convened  within the cabinet and a system must be established to lead the  bureaucracy.    In Japan's previous cabinets, the ministerial posts were  offered to the ruling party's politicians as concessions, and it  was natural for the cabinet members to be taken lightly by the  bureaucrats. It is also important to provide information equally  to the Diet members of both the opposition and the ruling party,  and thus facilitate checks by the Diet.    In order to promote smooth cooperation between politics and  administration, it is important to reexamine the practices of  the Diet and the government offices which have wasted the  inherent capabilities of the bureaucrats.    For example, when the Diet is in session, a great many  bureaucrats are kept extremely busy drafting interpellations to  the Diet members and replies by the cabinet members. If the Diet  deliberations are enhanced by debates of quality content between  the politicians, the bureaucrats should be able to devote  themselves to their inherent duties of policy planning.    The abuse of personnel authority seen in the reshuffle of  bureau directors at MITI [Ministry of International Trade and  Industry] goes against cooperation.    In order to maintain separation between politics and  administration, it is necessary to strictly observe the recently  enacted administrative procedures act and to coordinate  interests in administration with fairness. Also, enacting a  freedom-of-information act and enhancing transparency in policy  planning and its implementation process will serve to prevent  corruption.    It is also urgently necessary to promote business orders  based on fair competition through an improved bidding system.  Regarding these points, the self-proclaimed pro-reform group of  politicians should aggressively submit problems from the Diet  side and take the initiative for concrete system reform.    In any case, in order to reexamine the relations between  politics and administration, a reform of awareness is  indispensable for the politicians who have considered it their  supreme proposition to gain access to administrative budgets and  authority. It is hoped that, instead of being engrossed in a  power game without any ideology, they will grapple with reform  with an awareness as members of the same legislative branch of  government.</p>

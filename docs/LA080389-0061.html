			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The new program to provide condoms for inmates at San Francisco County Jail has  produced a lot of controversy but -- so far -- no takers. "Anything that is new  is viewed with suspicion and distrust," said Sheriff Mike Hennessey. "I think  they are taking a wait-and-see attitude." Critics of the program contend that  the AIDS counselors who are providing the condoms could be aiding or abetting  sex between inmates, which is a felony. Advocates say the condoms will help  prevent the spread of the fatal disease.  </P></p>

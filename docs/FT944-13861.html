			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Canada sends 400-strong trade mission to China The rivalry among industrial countries to promote commercial ties with China will reach a new pitch next month when Mr Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, leads a mission of almost 400 business leaders, politicians and officials to Beijing. The mission's ambitious scope is partly designed to deflect business criticism that Ottawa has been slower than many other western governments to recognise China's commercial potential. Canadian exports to China, totalling CDollars 1.7bn (Dollars 1.25bn) in 1993, have stagnated in recent years. But imports have risen rapidly, reaching CDollars 3.1bn last year. Companies represented on the mission range from banks, law firms and securities dealers, to metal producers, retailers and power utilities. Besides Mr Chretien, the mission will include the premiers of nine of Canada's ten provinces. The only absentee will be Mr Jacques Parizeau, who heads the newly elected separatist government in Quebec. The group will be in Beijing and Shanghai from November 6 to 10. It will also visit Hong Kong and Vietnam. According to one organiser, the mission will be used to announce 35-40 trade and investment deals worth about CDollars 1bn, all at an 'advanced' stage of negotiations. The two governments are expected to sign a nuclear co-operation agreement. Atomic Energy of Canada hopes the accord will be a 'door-opener' for sales of its Candu heavy-water reactors. There is also to be a progress report on a venture between American Barrick Resources, the Toronto-based gold producer, Power Corporation, the Montreal investment holding company, and the China National Gold Corporation to accelerate development of the gold-mining industry. The Barrick-Power partnership has begun a pre-feasibility study of a deposit in Liaoning province, and is discussing further projects.</p>

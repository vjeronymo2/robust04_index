			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / People: Bowtell's fast-stream Ann Bowtell has been appointed First Civil Service Commissioner, responsible for selection to the senior civil service and for the fast-stream entry programme. Bowtell, 54, is the first woman to be appointed to the post. A graduate of Girton College, Cambridge, Bowtell was herself a fast-stream trainee, joining the National Assistance Board in 1960. Her career in the department of health and social security (which replaced the NAB) has been largely in policy, personnel and resource management. She is currently deputy secretary at the department of health, where she is the principal establishment and finance officer. Bowtell is particularly well-qualified to help the civil service achieve its aim of attracting more women to its top ranks, and retaining them after they start families. A mother of four, she continued to work part-time while her children were young. She replaces John Holroyd, who was recently appointed Prime Minister's appointments secretary, with responsibility for church appointments and some special academic jobs. Bowtell will be replaced at the health department by Joe Pilling, 47, the former director-general of the Prison Service. Pilling won respect for his work at the prison service, and had been expected to continue in charge when it achieved executive agency status this year. However, the home secretary selected an outsider, Derek Lewis, former chief executive of Granada Group.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Construction orders rise fuels hopes of recovery Construction orders rose sharply during the three months to the end of October, according to figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment. The figures suggest that a more broadly based recovery than previously thought is under way in the industry. The value of construction orders rose to Pounds 16.31bn during the first 10 months of this year, a 9.5 per cent advance on the corresponding period in 1992. During the latest three months, new work increased in every area of construction compared with the corresponding period last year when investment fell sharply after the UK decision to quit the European exchange-rate mechanism. Among the most encouraging three-month figures were rises of 20 per cent and 11 per cent in private industrial and commercial orders. Contractors hope private sector spending on homes, factories, warehouses, shops and offices will increase to compensate for reduced public investment in social housing, roads and local authorities announced in last month's Budget. Overall, the value of orders at constant 1985 prices rose by 18 per cent during August, September, and October, compared with the same three months last year. Orders were also 9 per cent higher than during May, June and July this year. The biggest rises were in housing, where public sector orders, mostly from housing associations, were 33 per cent up on last year. Private housing orders during the same period rose 26 per cent. Builders welcomed the increases but said the improvement would need to be sustained if the industry were to make a full recovery. The National Council of Building Material Producers, one of the industry's chief forecasting bodies, last week halved its projections for growth next year from 1 per cent to 0.5 per cent, blaming public sector spending cuts. The council, which represents more than 2,000 companies with a combined annual turnover of more than Pounds 30bn, said yesterday there had been a bunching of private sector orders during the three months to the end of October. That was because of the ending of capital allowances for industrial building as well as a rush to qualify for construction-related Business Expansion Schemes due to end this month.</p>

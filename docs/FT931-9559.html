			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / 1,630 UK Leyland Daf jobs cut NEARLY one third of Leyland Daf's 5,500 UK workforce were made redundant yesterday. The rest could also lose their jobs shortly if leading components suppliers continue to delay their deliveries, the receivers of the collapsed vehicle maker warned. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, backed a call to the suppliers by the receivers, who have not restarted production since being called in last week. Although the receivers have assured suppliers they will be paid, Leyland Daf could neither pay its creditors from before its collapse nor meet contractual redundancy obligations. Outside the UK plants yesterday, there were angry scenes as workers contemplated the terms of their redundancies. Report, Page 5</p>

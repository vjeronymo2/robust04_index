			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Recovery in car sales slackens The pace of recovery in western Europe's new car market slowed for the second successive month in August. The 4.7 per cent sales increase over the same month last year compares with monthly rises of up to 13 per cent in the first half of this year, according to ACEA, the European automobile manufacturers association, Reuter reports from Brussels. However France, Spain and Scandinavia defied the trend. Registrations showed the sharpest percentage gain in Denmark, where they rose 69.7 per cent, and Spain, where they were up 34.5 per cent. Britain had the most registrations with 452,600, a 2.8 per cent increase. The worst performances were in Portugal, where registrations fell 11.9 per cent; the Netherlands, down 8.9 per cent; Belgium and Luxembourg, down 4.7 per cent; and Germany, down 4.1 per cent. Germany still had the second highest number of registrations, at 201,800, followed by France with 147,500. French registrations rose 18.8 per cent compared with a year earlier. In separate figures, ACEA said Ford had the largest share of new registrations with 14.7 per cent. Volkswagen was second with 12.7 per cent, followed by General Motors at 12.6 per cent. Japanese manufacturers captured 12.5 per cent of the market, ACEA said. Fiat had the largest percentage increase in registrations, up 22.1 per cent from August 1993.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 West European New Car Registrations*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Aug         % Chg                            1994        yr-on-yr  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UK                        452,600        +2.8 Germany                   201,800        -4.1 France                    147,500       +18.8 Italy                      71,200        +0.4 Spain                      64,000       +34.5 Netherlands                26,700        -8.9 Belgium &amp; Luxembourg       24,200        -4.7 Austria                    17,600        -2.8 Switzerland                17,300        +8.8 Portugal                   14,800       -11.9 Denmark                    11,200       +69.7 Sweden                      8,800       +12.8 Greece                      7,900       +17.9 Norway                      6,200       +29.2 Finland                     5,200       +30.0 Ireland                     4,200       +10.5 Total market            1,081,200        +4.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Provisional figures.

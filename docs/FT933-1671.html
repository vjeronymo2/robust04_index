			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / French football team stripped of league title Olympique Marseille, already barred from defending their European Cup crown, suffered another blow yesterday when French soccer authorities stripped them of their league title for their role in a bribery scandal, Reuter reports from Paris. French Football Federation president Jean Fournet-Fayard said: 'We had to take sanctions in this affair, which has seriously harmed the morality of our sport.' Fifa, world soccer's governing body, had threatened to suspend France from international competitions unless sanctions were taken by today to end the saga in which three Valenciennes players said they were offered money by Marseille to throw a league match.</p>

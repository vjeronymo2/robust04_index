			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 21 May (MENA) -- Former Sudanese Prime  Minister al-Sadiq al-Mahdi has criticized the present political  practices in Sudan, calling for democratic elections to let the  Sudanese people decide who will govern them.    In his 'Id al-Adha sermon at the al-Ansar Mosque in  (?Udinbawi), Omdurman, today al-Mahdi said that the situation in  Sudan is the worst it has ever been, noting that he will take  serious action to restore democracy in the country.    Al-Mahdi pointed out that the government-appointed  parliament  does not fit into this category because it is appointed by the  authority that is supposed to be accountable to it.    He criticized the government's economic policies,  particularly the profit-sharing system, which he described as  the most repulsive crime ever against the Sudanese economy.    The former prime minister criticized the government's  management of alms and its establishment of the Alms Department,  saying that most of the money is being spent on the employees of  that department.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Bundesbank fails to bolster ERM: Decision to leave discount rate unchanged prompts heavy selling of weak currencies THE future of European economic co-operation was thrown into doubt last night after a token cut in interest rates by Germany's Bundesbank failed to meet demands from across the continent for easier borrowing conditions to assist recovery. The decision by the Bundesbank council to cut its Lombard rate by half a percentage point, while leaving its more important discount rate unchanged, provoked a fresh wave of selling of weak currencies in the crisis-prone European exchange rate mechanism. Equity and bond prices rose sharply across the continent on expectations that the strain would force an early dissolution of the ERM, so paving the way for lower borrowing rates. The Bundesbank said it was continuing its policy of cautious cuts. The Lombard rate, representing the Bundesbank's ceiling to German money market rates, was reduced to 7.75 per cent. The discount rate, the floor rate at which it finances the banking system, was left at 6.75 per cent. Although given a guarded welcome by German government ministers, the move was dismissed as technical by many private sector economists. It was interpreted as signalling the Bundesbank's preoccupation with worryingly high domestic inflationary pressures. The decision was greeted with dismay by senior officials at the European Commission, because it might open fresh divisions between Germany and other EC members who may accuse the country of putting its own interests above those of Europe. 'It's war,' said one senior official close to Mr Jacques Delors, president of the Commission. The events sparked the biggest strains in international currency markets since the pound left the ERM last September. A wave of selling of the French and Belgian francs, Danish krone, Portuguese escudo and Spanish peseta prompted the Bundesbank and other European central banks to spend an estimated DM15bn (Pounds 5.8bn) in buying the currencies, mainly for D-Marks, to increase their value. Despite these moves, the five currencies were last night close to their ERM floors leaving only three ERM currencies, those of the Netherlands, Ireland, and Germany, unscathed. Last night, Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, met Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, Bank of France governor, and Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, treasury director, to discuss the franc. France is under particular pressure to cut interest rates because of a serious recession and high unemployment. Officials in Spain, whose currency has already been devalued three times during a year of almost perpetual ERM strains, put a brave face on the day's developments. A civil servant in Madrid said the government would defend the peseta's parity. 'Realignment (within the ERM) is not a hypothesis that we are working on,' he said. The French franc closed in London at FFr3.417 against the D-Mark in Europe, a 1.2-centime fall on the day, after intervention by the Bank of France and the Bundesbank. It slipped as low as FFr3.4262 in early US trading, but recovered to FFr3.4105 at the close. It was at FFr3.4157 in early Tokyo trade. Its ERM floor is FFr3.4305. The krone was also badly hit in European trading, falling below its ERM floor against the Dutch guilder at one stage. By the close of trading it was at DKr3.39 to the D-Mark, fractionally above its ERM floor. The Belgian franc, among the most closely tied currencies to the D-Mark, was also trading close to its ERM floor in the US. The peseta and the escudo both fell against the D-Mark despite substantial intervention from their central banks. In US trading, the peseta was just above its ERM floor against the German currency at Pta82.24. The dollar and sterling were boosted by the ERM crisis. Sterling closed in London 1 pfennig up on the day at DM2.5775, despite strong speculation of a UK base rate cut, and firmed slightly in New York to DM2.579. The dollar reached its highest level against the D-Mark for two years, closing in London at DM1.7345, up nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs, firming to DM1.7395 in New York. The decision by the Bundesbank council, in its last meeting until August 26, effectively blocks significant monetary easing across Europe for the next month while other ERM currencies remain tied to the D-Mark. It sparked market expectations that other recession-hit nations in the ERM would find this restriction too much to stomach, and so follow the lead of Britain and Italy last year by quitting the system. French equity investors supported this theory, pushing up share prices by 2.3 per cent to the highest level since May 1992. Dutch and Spanish share indices rose by more than 1.5 per cent, while in London the FT-SE 100 index gained 33.4 to close at 2,917.6, a four-month high. On bond markets, German, French and Spanish government securities all moved up, while UK gilts gained half a point.

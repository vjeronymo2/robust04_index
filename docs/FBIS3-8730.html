For many months he has been trying to  mediate peace treaties between inimical parties in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. He is one of the most competent people to  estimate, based on his own experience, the progress in the  efforts at putting an end to the war in former Yugoslavia.  Stoltenberg gave an interview to MLADA FRONTA DNES on this  subject.    [Palata] Mr. Stoltenberg, how do you evaluate the most  recent peace agreement concluded between Zagreb and the Bosnian  Muslims and Croats in Washington?    [Stoltenberg] The Washington treaty is an interesting and  important step in the right direction. I believe that the  Muslims and Croats have embarked on the right road. They  selected the correct time for this, and the document they signed  is a very good basis for the peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Palata] Has the end of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina come  any closer after the signing of the treaty?    [Stoltenberg] I hope so. It seems to me that a new  situation has arisen.    Lord Owen and I have worked long and hard toward our goal,  toward which the peace efforts must be aimed. Now, this may  have succeeded, let us hope.    The European Union took the initiative before Christmas.  Now, the United States and Russia have also joined in. I do  not believe that it would be possible to arrive at the final  goal without the European Union, Washington, and Moscow  cooperating together.    [Palata] Does the treaty between the Croats and Muslims mean  the end of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state?    [Stoltenberg] No, certainly not.    [Palata] Do you still believe that it would be possible to  reestablish the country within its former borders?    [Stoltenberg] Yes. No peace efforts can solve everything,  however. For a long time we have been failing to find a  solution without imposing an ultimatum. We have nine  theoretical models here, which look different in the field and  different when you view them from a negotiating table. They  cannot be implemented without an agreement between the parties  at war. We cannot force people to live together. Look at the  Middle East. Despite the treaties that have been concluded, the  situation still depends on whether certain people are able to  live together.    [Stoltenberg] Does the Geneva Peace Plan of the European  Union have any importance after the agreement has been signed in  Washington?    [Palata] The Washington agreement is a basis for fulfilling  the action plan. When you look simultaneously at the plan and  at the agreement concluded in the U.S. capital you will see that  they are based on the same principle. Moreover, the European  Union has participated actively in drafting the Muslim-Croatian  treaty.</p>

According to the Ashanti regional  director of health services, Dr. J. K. Amofa, a total of 300  buruli ulcer cases were recorded in eight districts in the  region last year.

Dr. Amofa said in an interview at Tentokrom that whereas  last  year, a monthly average of between 40 and 50 new cases of the  disease were reported at health institutions, this year this has  dropped to a monthly average of between eight and 10 new cases.  He said the medical intervention have been able to successfully  stabilize the situation in the Kwabre, Effidua-Sekyere, and  Atwima Districts, where no new cases have been reported. The  only problem area now is Ashanti Akim North, where about 30  cases have been recorded. Dr. Amofa said the early diagnosis of  the disease and the removal of the preulcerative nodules in the  victims through excision have contributed to the drastic  reduction in the incidence of the disease. Between August last  year and March this year, medical doctors removed preulcerative  nodules from 48 victims at the Tentokrom buruli ulcer dressing  station alone.

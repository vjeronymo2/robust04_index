			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dieter Schulte, chairman of the Federation </F> of German Trade Unions, by Martin Kempe and Ulrike Fuessel in  Berlin; date not given: "The Money Is There"]    [Text] [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Mr. Schulte, do you still  think that full employment can be achieved through economic  growth?    [Schulte] We know from experience that a beginning economic  growth does not immediately create more jobs. In my view we  will not return to the classic form of full employment in the  near future. At the same time, we know that almost every  community, every city is putting off a number of projects  because they simply do not have the funds. These investments  must be made now. We call on the political and business  community to shift the money that is spent on unemployment and  the resulting problems to a temporary employment policy with  state orders. One must also think twice about spending billions  of German marks in Hermes export guarantees instead of providing  more money for badly needed public orders.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] What are the tasks that you have in  mind?    [Schulte] Nursing sick people, kindergartens. We are  speaking of the traffic collapse or of traffic chaos. Everybody  wants to modernize the infrastructure and further extend the  networks, but we are not making any progress. In the cities and  communities the water supply and sewage systems must be renewed.  The money is there. It only has to be shifted to the right  place.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] What comes to your mind when you  hear the slogan of limits to growth?    [Schulte] I think that we will have to change our way of  thinking. Industrial production will no longer grow in the FRG.  Industrial developments will reach their limits. Employment  will, thus, necessarily have to shift toward the sector of  public services. I am not only referring to services people can  claim and cannot do without, but also services in other areas  near the economy.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] What is the trade unions'  contribution to reducing mass unemployment?    [Schulte] The wage agreements intended to secure jobs are a  contribution that must not be underestimated. The effects of  shorter working hours had been disputed for a long time. So it  is a success that such models have, at least temporarily,  stopped the increase in unemployment. Moreover we demand that  those shoulders that can carry more must do so. The funds must  then be used specifically, for example for investment programs  in eastern Germany. If we manage to reduce by half the number  of unemployed by the year 2000, which is a challenge for all of  Europe, then this is a great objective. At the same time, we  must answer the question how we will deal until then with the  people who have no jobs and no chances ever to get one again.  We must build job bridges...    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] ....to the second labor market?    [Schulte] I am not speaking of the second labor market. The  question of a second labor market, that is to say one of  inferior value, is not what comes to my mind first. After all,  this leads to an inner detachment from one's employment and also  from the trade unions. This is why I reject this term. We will  have to find promising forms of employment that stand on a solid  financial basis.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Can you imagine a strategy of  shorter working hours and redistribution of work that goes  beyond the Volkswagen scheme?    [Schulte] No. I think that the schemes of shorter working  hours in this classic form, for example the shorter working week  at Volkswagen, have, at least for the time being, reached their  limit. However, one will have to try out other schemes, also  part-time work. Most companies have not given a moment's  thought to how they could sensibly introduce part-time work.  Yet, even part-time work will only solve one part of the  problem. Employees will not accept it if they are forced to,  but only when it fits the personal plans for their lives.  Moreover, one has to find regulations to prevent people from  suffering disadvantages later in life. Still, it might lead to  more possibilities for flexibility.    [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Your vision of work mainly refers to  gainful employment. Yet there is a lot of work necessary in  society that has to be done privately or without pay. Would it  not be interesting to link these two spheres and rethink the  structures of our society?    [Schulte] There is enough work. Whether it can be paid  depends on the readiness to provide money for it. Some 15-20  years ago, we set ourselves the objective to use some time of  one's working life for education. Today this issue is no longer  on the agenda, because people do not even use the available  possibilities. If we really want to focus on work again then we  must pay more attention again to such points.</p>

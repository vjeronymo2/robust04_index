			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Travel: Let the blossom times roll - Japan's flower parties intrigue Christopher McCooey Flower viewing parties do not exactly sound like riotous assemblies of good-natured drunks, but in Japan that is invariably what they are. Each spring, when the pink blossoms explode in the branches of the cherry trees, the Japanese gather underneath them to enjoy both the flowers and themselves. Purists may talk aesthetically about the cherry blossoms being the essence of the Japanese spirit, the epitome of bushido, the spiritual code of the samurai. Indeed, the cherry blossoms' brief life of emphemeral beauty reflects purity and simplicity, which are considered traditional Japanese values. Just as the blossoms fall in their prime, so did the loyal samurai, who did not hesitate to give, or even take, his own life, even in his prime. Today some people, from the emperor and the prime minister down, still hold parties to appreciate the form and colour of cherry blossom as a symbol of the Japanese spirit, but for the vast majority the cherry blossom parties are just an excuse for a good time. For the average salaryman and office lady, the parties are a necessary pressure valve, a collective release of frustrations and inhibitions that are a product of Japan's tightly controlled, conformist economic and social systems. Cherry blossom viewing parties were already established as annual events in the reign of Emperor Saga (809-823). This Imperial Court custom probably derived from the more ancient agricultural practice of taking food and sake into the fields during the religious festivals that marked the beginning of spring farm activity. In the Heian period (794-1185) flower viewing held an important place in literature, dance and the fine arts. Prior to this, Japan's culture had been heavily influenced by China, and the flashier peony and the stronger coloured plum blossoms were more often painted and alluded to in the arts. But during the Heian period the cherry came to be intimately identified with Japanese culture, so much so that the word hana (flower) became a synonym for sakura (cherry). Not only was the flower appreciated but also the wood. It was used for building, carving and for wood block printing. The tree of the genus Prunus and the family Rosaceae is native to Japan and grows wild all over the country. Many of the flowering cherries that grow around the world are from Japanese stock. There is a long tradition of outings by family and friends to view the blossoms in Tokyo. Thousands flock to popular places such as Ueno Park, Yasukuni Shrine and the Chidorigafuchi Moat with its dramatic backdrop of pine trees atop the massive stone wall of the Imperial Palace. For the most popular places, juniors are sent by their company seniors to stake out pitches under the trees for the after-work party. During the daytime, parties of retired folk, housewives and students make up the first shift. From the time the first trees start to blossom in the southern island of Kyushu sometime in March, the cherry blossom front moves north and east. Radio and TV stations broadcast daily reports of the front's progress and companies, families and groups of friends plan their parties for the few days (usually only one or two) when the blossoms are at their stunning best. Cherry blossom stories and photos are run by the media: the man in Osaka who looked up and up at the blossoms, lost his balance, fell into a ditch and broke his neck; the 100 tons of garbage collected after one evening in Ueno Park. Obnoxious drunks are handled with humour or ignored. Fights are rare, although one reveller who was drunk stabbed a person to death in Nagoya's Tsurumai park a few years ago. Generally the revellers regulate their own behaviour and the police keep a low profile. After the parties are over vagrants find rich pickings in the half-eaten picnics that are stacked neatly for collection as trash. In March and April, parks, shrines and public places with cherry trees resemble convention sites for well-dressed winos as the normally restrained Japanese noisily eat and drink, sing and dance under the pink canopy. It is an amazing sight as red-faced salary men - their shoes off but neatly arranged at the side (even on a debauch the Japanese are orderly) - prance and parade in drunken abandon on mats and sheets of cardboard. The karaoke, literally translated as 'empty orchestra', blares out for each group. The person with the microphone howls tunelessly while his colleagues urge him on to greater ignominy. People are expected to make fools of themselves. Even the company boss will do a turn and sing a bawdy song. 'How long are you in Japan?' asks the delightful drunk who drags you into his circle of friends. 'How about Japanese rice wine? You must enjoy in Japan.' Indeed, the visitor who has a strong liver could do no better than follow the cherry blossom front as it unfolds across the country. In this Mardi Gras atmosphere a new face to the Japanese may be seen - a face flushed with alcohol but still warm and friendly. Totally uninhibited, the Japanese go daft every silly season - every time the cherries blossom.</p>

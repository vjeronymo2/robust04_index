			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Mines could cut coal prices, MPs told AT LEAST half the UK pits earmarked for possible closure are capable of producing coal at cheaper prices than those tentatively agreed between British Coal and electricity generators, a consultancy advising the government told MPs yesterday. Mr Ronald Lewis, of the John T Boyd consultancy, told MPs an investigation of 28 pits earlier this year demonstrated that within three or four years they could produce coal at an average of Pounds 1.33p a gigajoule and that this could fall to Pounds 1.15. Mr Lewis also backed changes to an 84-year-old law that restricts miners' underground shifts to 7 1/2 hours. He said this was necessary partly because of the time miners often needed to travel long distances to coalfaces, especially in the north-east of England. Any move to change the law would be strongly opposed by the unions. Mr Peter McNestry, general secretary of the Nacods pit deputies union, said yesterday that longer hours would significantly increase the dangers of working in mines. British Coal has tentatively agreed contracts with the two main generators in England and Wales by which it would sell coal at Pounds 1.50. Mr Lewis said 15 or 16 of 31 pits earmarked for closure would be be able to reach the Pounds 1.33. Yesterday's revelations will increase concern that the pit closure programme is being implemented too hastily. Nonetheless the question of finding a market for the coal will have to be addressed. Mr Lewis said: 'When you look at the future of British collieries it is not a question of whether there will be 50 or 40. It is a case of 40 or less.' Mr Lewis also disclosed to the Trade and Industry Committee inquiry into energy policy that Boyd has been asked by the government to rank 21 pits whose future is under review in order of viability. The consultancy has not been asked by the government to consider 10 other pits which British Coal has said will close but which are subject to 90-day consultation procedures, an omission that surprised some MPs. Boyd has asked for and been given government approval to look at the 19 remaining British Coal pits always scheduled to remain open, because it wanted to see 'if they represented the best', Mr Lewis said. In other evidence the Coalfield Communities Campaign said the market for coal in the electricity sector could be sustained at 70m tonnes a year or more throughout the 1990s. Within the framework they suggested, no electricity supply option, including nuclear, would be closed off. Power station coal imports could continue though at a lesser level than present. CCC's 'modest changes' would enable all pits to stay open and would reduce the costs of electricity to consumers by Pounds 400m a year.</p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RED SOX RALLY IN 8TH INNING TO BEAT ORIOLES  </P> <P> Mike Greenwell hit a two-run homer as the Boston Red Sox rallied for five runs  in the eighth inning today to beat the Baltimore Orioles 6-4.  </P> <P> The Orioles scored two runs in the ninth but fell short in their bid to win  consecutive games on the road for the first time since August, 1987.  </P> <P> Ellis Burks led off the Boston eighth with a triple off Brian Holton, 1-2, who  replaced starter Jose Bautista at the start of the seventh. Greenwell then hit  his fourth homer of the season, a 420-foot blast into the bleachers in right  center.  </P> <P> Jim Rice followed with a single that extended his hitting streak to 11 games.  Danny Heep singled one out later, sending pinch runner Randy Kutcher to third  and knocking Holton out of the game.  </P> <P> Reliever Mark Williamson then walked Jody Reed and Rick Cerone to force in a  run. Williamson was replaced by Kevin Hickey, who struck out Wade Boggs before  giving up a two-run single to Marty Barrett that gave Boston a 6-2 lead.  </P> <P> The Orioles opened the ninth with three consecutive singles off Lee Smith, 1-1,  who replaced starter Wes Gardner in the eighth. The third single, by Randy  Milligan, drove in Cal Ripken and made it 6-3.  </P> <P> Bob Stanley relieved Smith and got Francisco Melendez on a fielder's choice  before pinch-hitter Jim Traber made it 6-4 with a sacrifice fly.  </P> <P> Stanley then earned his second save by retiring Rene Gonzales on a game-ending  fielder's choice. Gardner went seven innings, allowing four hits and matching  his career high with eight strikeouts.  </P> <P> Boston took a 1-0 lead in the first on a double by Barrett, a pair of walks and  a sacrifice fly by Rice.  </P></p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Progress seen in world settlement systems says G30 THE settlement systems of stock markets around the world have come a long way since the 1987 crash first provoked concern about their effectiveness, according to a report issued yesterday by the Group of 30, the Washington-based think tank. However, ambitious targets for the standardisation of settlement arrangements, set by G30 and due to be completed by the end of this year, have still not been met by many leading financial centres. It was in March 1989 that a G30 steering committee, led by Mr John Reed, chairman of Citicorp, set its far-reaching targets. These included recommendations that all trades should be settled three days after they have taken place (known in the jargon as T+3), that each country should have a central securities depositary and that settlement systems should achieve delivery-versus-payment (DVP) - that is, stocks and cash should be transferred simultaneously. A target date of the end of 1992 was set for all three of these recommendations. So far, though, they have been met in full by only a handful of investment centres. Of 34 countries reporting in G30's latest annual survey of international settlement arrangements, for example, 10 have achieved T+3 or are in the process of changing to such a system, while nine are on shorter settlement cycles. Attainment of other targets is more difficult to establish. Most countries claim to have achieved DVP, though this may not mean that cash and shares are transferred free of any claim or recourse. 'Against that stern test, quite a lot will fail,' says Mr David Holland, consultant to the G30 settlement initiative. The group's latest status reports on settlement systems reveal both the advances that have been made in a number of countries this year, as well as some of the weaknesses that still exist. France and Sweden, for example, have both made the move to T+3, while Hong Kong has launched a centralised securities depositary based on book-entry transfer. The UK remains among those that are further behind, though its planned paperless settlement system, Taurus, is tipped to be completed next year. The London stock exchange said yesterday that 100 listed companies had passed the amendments to their articles of association to transfer to Taurus. This signals growing acceptance of the system in the corporate world. Others to lag on some aspects of the G30 recommendations include the US, which has yet to make the switch to T+3. Concern in some quarters of the securities industry about whether such a short settlement period is suited to retail investment has helped to stall the move. In spite of this, the G30 can claim credit for focusing attention on the inadequacy of settlement arrangements and giving momentum to developments in a number of financial centres. Its involvement came after the 1987 crash, which brought home to the securities markets the extra risks involved with the slowness and inefficiency of settlement systems. 'The accounts of recent developments . . . make it quite clear that the momentum of reform is being maintained,' say Lord Richardson of Duntisbourne, former governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, in an introduction to the G30 report. 'The general direction is unmistakable. Rolling settlement is replacing account settlement; settlement periods are shortening; securities are being immobilised or dematerialised in central securities depositories to facilitate transfers by book entry; and there is a particularly welcome emphasis on improving DVP procedures.'

This is at a time when  the residents of Kabul face growing problems in connection with  obtaining food.    In the meantime, the warring sides in Afghanistan have  rejected rumors that an official cease-fire has been announced  in Kabul. One official from Rabbani's faction said: The current  cease-fire is a result of bad weather, snow, and the month of  Ramadan and it is not, in any way, an official cease-fire.</p>

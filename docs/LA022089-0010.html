			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURNING POINT IN STATE;  </P> <P> NEW ACTIVISM STIRRING IN GOP, DEMOCRATIC PARTIES  </P> <P> A week and a world apart, California's Democratic and Republican parties  convened here this month and peered around the corner at a turning point in  their history.  </P> <P> What greeted them in their back-to-back conventions were the stirrings of new  political activism for the 1990s.  </P> <P> Republicans saw it in a demonstration of abruptly changing visions.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian, who is leaving the office in 1990, gave his party the  same kind of speech that has been the trademark of much of his Administration:  a detailed blast at crime that overpowered his bare mention of education,  transportation and the environment.  </P> <P> "Our tough-on-crime policies have been highly successful in putting lawbreakers  behind bars," he told conventioneers Sunday morning. "Because of tougher laws  and tougher judges, the number of inmates in our state prisons has more than  doubled since we took office."  </P> <P> Many Republicans here were clearly restless with this theme, however, as  evidenced by their restrained applause for the governor's remarks.  </P> <P> Just the night before, by contrast, their enthusiasm flowed freely when U.S.  Sen. Pete Wilson announced that he would run for governor next year and  outlined an agenda that emphasized quality-of-life concerns.  </P> <P> He declared there was no saying "no" to tackling transportation, health care,  AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, child care, school dropouts, clean air and water and  more. He used words like "innovative" and "aggressive" and said the GOP must  now stand as the party that believes "environmental health and economic health  are mutually dependent, not mutually exclusive."  </P> <P> For anyone who missed the sharp transition in tone from the outgoing governor  to the incoming GOP gubernatorial front-runner, Wilson's handlers were on hand  to help.  </P> <P> "It was amazing, wasn't it?" said one inner-circle Wilson booster at the  convention's end. "Pete's challenge is going to be to avoid the memory of this  one-note crime stuff and present himself as a tough but compassionate  quality-of-life champion."  </P> <P> For Democrats, whose convention occurred the previous weekend in the same civic  hall, the new promise of activism was visible everywhere.  </P> <P> Just as the Republicans turned to Wilson for strength in the 1990 campaign, the  Democrats went back to former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. for his  excitement and his pledge to capture the imagination of Californians who have  dropped out of politics.  </P> <P> "It's the job of a political party to mobilize the millions and millions of  non-voters, and that's what I intend to do," said Brown on the occasion of his  election as chairman of the California Democratic Party.  </P> <P> As the stars of the two conventions, Wilson and Brown found themselves  competing as in the old days.  </P> <P> Back in 1982, Brown was trying to save his national political career and Wilson  was trying to launch his in their race for the U.S. Senate.  </P> <P> Wilson won. Now, Brown is trying to emerge again, and Wilson hopes to become  the most dominant politician in the state since Ronald Reagan by winning the  governorship and appointing his successor to the Senate.  </P> <P> Brown said he will run for no public office during 1990 or 1992, but even so,  he managed -- at least at the convention -- to dwarf the Democratic Party's  field of gubernatorial hopefuls.  </P> <P> Those hopefuls were in step with Brown, however, in their vision of an activist  era.  </P> <P> "Today we reaffirm our belief that California is ready to move again," said  candidate for governor and Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp. His speech to the  Democrats was sprinkled with words like "restore" and "revive" and "recapture"  and "reclaim."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Starting to Revolt'  </P> <P> State Controller Gray Davis, an exploratory candidate for governor, put it this  way to the Democrats: "Without leadership in Sacramento, it's no wonder we had  50 measures on the ballot. People are starting to revolt against that kind of  stand-still politics."  </P> <P> At this stage, 21 months from the election, both parties are still obviously  struggling with their lineups for the 1990 statewide races.  </P> <P> For the Republicans, Wilson's decision to run for governor after just being  reelected to the Senate last November has dramatically narrowed the field in  that race.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates wants to stay in as a law-and-order  candidate, but GOP glamour contender Peter V. Ueberroth sent a strong signal  over the weekend that he was losing interest.  </P> <P> When asked what he would do when he retires as commissioner of baseball March  31, Ueberroth told a New York Times sports columnist: "Straight answer? I don't  know. I won't start looking until I finish this job. I hope to stay in New York  and make a living."  </P> <P> Before Wilson jumped into the race, Ueberroth said he would return to Southern  California and might be interested in running for governor.  </P> <P> The lesser offices of lieutenant governor, attorney general and others have  been a problem for the Republicans in past elections. Often they have fielded  incomplete or weak slates. But party leaders vow to do better in 1990.  </P> <P> State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) was among the first to obtain an audience  with Wilson at the convention to discuss the remainder of the ticket. Seymour  emerged and said he was "very seriously looking at the lieutenant  governorship."  </P> <P> Sen. William Campbell (R- Hacienda Heights) said he was weighing his prospects  for the same office.  </P> <P> More than a half a dozen other officeholders were openly campaigning for  consideration for a spot somewhere in the GOP statewide slate.  </P> <P> Democrats, because of intense early competition at the top of the ticket and  Brown's dominant profile, spent much of their convention talking about how to  win the governorship.  </P> <P> Besides Van de Kamp and Davis, the party has potential candidates in former San  Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein and Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, the man Wilson  beat last year in the Senate election.  </P> <P> For lesser offices, Secretary of State March Fong Eu has indicated her desire  to stay in place, and Brown's sister, Kathleen, is well along in a campaign to  challenge Republican state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes.  </P> <P> The extra interest in this year's conventions reflects significant changes in  law and in political trends. These potentially increase the importance of party  organizations, which have been sideline players for most of the century.  </P> <P> Voter-approved political reforms now limit candidate fund-raising, so parties  will be called on for help by office seekers. At the same time, organizers of  both parties say that the ground game of California politics -- voter  registration and get-out-the vote drives -- is becoming increasingly important.  </P> <P> Some things, however, are unchanging about California's two parties.  </P> <P> The Democrats stayed at the union-organized Holiday Inn. Many delegates arrived  from around the state by bus. Their schedule kept them at the convention hall  from early morning until late at night.  </P> <P> The Republicans crossed union pickets to stay at the non-union Hyatt Capitol  Park. Most long-distance delegates came by airplane, and the convention program  lasted barely longer than the raucous hospitality suite receptions.  </P> <P> Republican political consultants and staffers proudly wore their gold Rolex  wristwatches. Jerry Brown, though, left his at home and wore an inexpensive  black digital.  </P></p>

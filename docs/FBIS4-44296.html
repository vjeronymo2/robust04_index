			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Van Mierlo Sticks to `Purple' After </F> Failed Round of Talks"]    [Excerpt] D66 [Democrats 66] leader Van Mierlo still wants  to form a "purple" coalition [comprising the PvdA (Labor Party),  the VVD (People's Party for Freedom and Democracy), and D66].  He does not see any credible possibility of forming any other  majority coalition. "I want to return to the `purple' option,"  Van Mierlo stated on Monday evening [27 June] after his news  conference on the failure of the current round of talks to form  a "purple" coalition. The D66 leader accepts that the position  he has taken greatly increases the likelihood of a minority  coalition.    Van Mierlo asserted that it was VVD leader Bolkestein who  had  rendered impossible the option of a center-right cabinet in  which D66 would be willing to participate. Bolkestein is  demanding more interference in the budget and social security  than D66 and the PvdA are ready to accept.    According to Van Mierlo, the "purple" coalition-to-be had  already come a long way. He believes that only a coalition with  a new composition will be able to withstand the burden of 18  billion guilders in spending cuts. "A center-right coalition is  not in a position to produce such a package without causing a  lot of damage."    In mid-May, Van Mierlo, who with his 24 seats is  indispensable to a majority coalition, described a center-left  coalition with the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] as "lacking  credibility." Yesterday evening, he restated this view. "How  could the CDA and the PvdA after some four years in government  and a severe election defeat credibly claim that they are going  to pursue a totally different policy? Can you ask parties to do  that? I mean, you can always forgive, but that is no basis on  which to form a government."    Van Mierlo says: "I still see the only way of arriving at a  majority cabinet as being with a `purple' coalition." Van  Mierlo admitted that putting together a coalition at this point  in time would serve no purpose. VVD leader Bolkestein also  rejected the idea of such an attempt. Van Mierlo now hopes that  it will become clear in the course of the following weeks that a  majority coalition between the PvdA, the VVD, and D66 is the  only possibility. "But I recognize the danger that others will  form a minority government in the meantime," the D66 leader  stated. Today, the leaders of all parties must again consult  the Queen. At the beginning of May, the PvdA had said that  their second option after a "purple" coalition would be a  center-left government, while the VVD opted for a center-right  government. In recent weeks, Bolkestein has often repeated that  he would prefer to join the opposition ranks if the new  government was not committed to a firm policy. The CDA probably  wants an "informer" [a politician appointed by the Crown to  assess the feasibility of the various coalitions] to look at the  possibility of a government comprising the CDA, the VVD, and D66.    With the exception of "informer" Van Ardenne (VVD), VVD  leader Bolkestein yesterday drew the blame from all concerned  for the present failure. Bolkestein: "That leaves me cold."  He strongly denied that he had laid new proposals on the table.  He said that earlier in the negotiations he had already  described cutbacks on, among other things, defense and  infrastructure, as unjustified and unacceptable.    The VVD leader was unwilling to accept a proposal by PvdA  leader Kok to find a creative solution to these budget problems  on a year-to-year basis. Kok: "A slight fall in the rate of  the dollar would cause the same problems." Bolkestein: "It  would have been a time bomb under the next government. I want  nothing to do with it."    Rather than this, the VVD leader wanted increased  intervention in welfare payments, which was not acceptable to  the PvdA. Kok: "This was obviously necessary to relieve the  state budget and people on welfare are always there to be  penalized. Bolkestein should have known that with such a  proposal for social policy he would be going beyond the limits  of what is a fair balance."    Bolkestein: "What was laid on the table now was the core of  a government agreement for a fourth Lubbers government without  any substantial measures. I am not going to sign up to that."    Van Mierlo: "Even if this government is able to save 18  billion guilders? I must say that it is not the point. The old  cliches are back again."    Van Mierlo: "It is a great disappointment. Bolkestein  wanted everything, and immediately. It is of course crazy not  to bring any creativity to the process."    Yesterday afternoon, Crown "informers" De Vries (PvdA), Van  Ardenne (VVD), and Vis (D66) relinquished their mandate after it  became clear on Sunday afternoon [26 June] that negotiations for  a "purple" coalition had come stuck on Bolkestein's objections  to a provisional accord on the main lines of a social, economic,  and financial policy. The effects of this accord had been  calculated by the Central Plan Bureau (CPB).    The results were positively received by the PvdA and D66  "informers." De Vries: "I thought on Saturday evening when the  CPB figures arrived: That looks good." The growth in jobs  would be as much as 117,000 or even 140,000 in a more optimistic  version. Two-thirds of the job growth would be in the market  sector. These results do not vary very much from the VVD  election program.    The relationship between the employed and the unemployed  would improve, from around 86 unemployed to less than 85  unemployed for every 100 employed. The fall in purchase power,  the sensitive point for the PvdA, would remain limited. Neither  those on minimum or average wages, with the exception of civil  servants, would have to contribute anything. [passage omitted]</p>

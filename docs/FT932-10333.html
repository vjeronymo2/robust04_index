			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / US irritation grows over Europe's Bosnian stance AFTER a week of intensive discussions between Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, and European governments, the Clinton administration appears to be little nearer a decision on what to do in Bosnia-Hercegovina. On Friday, after meeting leaders of the European Community in Washington, President Bill Clinton was at pains to argue that there remained no more than 'some disagreement around the edges' between the US and Europe over the conflict. But some administration officials appear frustrated by what they see as a willingness in European capitals to delay taking action against Bosnian Serbs. This is coupled with irritation at Europe's perceived ambivalence over US leadership: European governments want Mr Clinton to take the lead, but they do not like the direction he wants to lead them in. Senator Richard Lugar, the senior Republican on the Senate foreign relations committee, said: 'They may prefer that Serbia simply finishes the war, end the war out there, and that it not be extended by rearming the Bosnians. I think we have a different view and our view, I believe, must prevail.' Ambivalence, however, is just as widespread in Washington as in London or Paris. Congress is deeply split over the issue and a long way from embracing even limited US military involvement, such as air strikes, while opinion is divided within the administration. 'It appears to me the president is as confused as we are,' said Senator Howard Metzenbaum, a Democrat from Ohio. Although Mr Clinton appears determined to act, he shows signs of annoyance that Bosnia is distracting him from his promise to 'focus on the economy like a laser beam'. He would evidently prefer some swift and limited action that would permit him to return his attention to domestic issues. Mr Clinton said on Friday that if he were to ask for congressional approval for the use of air power in Bosnia, he would lay out 'very clear tactical objectives' which would have 'a beginning, a middle and an end'. Beyond the general promise that the US will not be sucked into an endless engagement, as it was in Vietnam, Washington takes this to mean a short US air campaign intended to freeze the conflict until Bosnian Moslems can be given heavy weapons to defend themselves. The use of US ground troops remains, however, ruled out - although there is some lingering embarrassment in Washington that this refusal is hard to justify if Serbian actions do, in fact, represent a genocide comparable to that of Nazi Germany. While some members of Congress are now beginning to consider troop deployments, although they are still heavily outnumbered, popular opinion remains strongly opposed not only to the use of ground troops but also to air strikes.</p>

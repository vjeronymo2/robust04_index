			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Lib Dems urge shift on ERM AN EARLY move for sterling to the narrow bands of the exchange rate mechanism, perhaps at a lower central rate than the current level, was suggested yesterday by the Liberal Democrats as part of a package to relieve the plight of the pound. Mr Alan Beith, the party's Treasury spokesman, attacked Labour's stance on the state of the economy, saying that the basis for the European co-ordination which it had been calling for would not exist before the French referendum on Maastricht. He agreed with Mr Peter Shore, a former Labour cabinet minister, that Labour was really calling for devaluation in saying that it opposed any rise in interest rates whatever happened to the pound. He urged Mr John Major, the prime minister, to take a tougher line with the Tory backbench MPs who were broadcasting their views that there should be a cut in interest rates to help the domestic economy. He warned that the prospects of a rise in interest rates would continue to grow unless Mr Major found ways of improving confidence in the UK economy, such as selective intervention to help the construction industry. Mr Beith said that the criterion for any realignment within the ERM must be that it would result in greater confidence in sterling. He argued that although a move for sterling to the narrow bands below the central rate would appear to be devaluation, provided it were coupled with independence for the Bank of England on interest rates and a British commitment to European monetary union it could still lead to enhanced rather than reduced confidence in sterling.</p>

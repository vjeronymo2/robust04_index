			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLIDAY INNS DANCED THE TAX-AVOIDANCE TWO-STEP  </P> <P> If you sell something for a billion dollars more than it cost, you have to  shell out big capital gains taxes to Uncle Sam, right? Wrong. Wrong, that is,  if you're the guys running Holiday Inns.  </P> <P> Holiday Corp., the Memphis-based hotel and casino company, is selling Holiday  Inns to a British beer company for $2.225 billion -- about a billion dollars  more than the Inns' value for tax purposes -- and plans to pay not a single  penny of capital gains tax.  </P> <P> How has the "nation's inn keeper" become the nation's tax avoider? Watch as  Holiday dances its way through the tax code, saving itself a $350-million  capital gains bill.  </P> <P> Instead of getting a $2.225-billion check and turning Holiday Inns over to the  buyer, a British brewing company called Bass PLC, Holiday is doing what the tax  whizzes call a Morris Trust transaction, but which really is a Tax Avoidance  Two-Step. (Morris Trust was the defendant in a lawsuit that the Internal  Revenue Service brought and lost in an attempt to have this type of thing  declared a taxable transaction.)  </P> <P> How do you dance the two-step? Easy, provided you have good tax guidance, some  first-rate paper shufflers and a buyer willing to issue stock rather than pay  cash for the assets that you're selling. You simply do the planned sale in two  separate transactions.  </P> <P> In Step 1 of the Tax-Avoidance Two-Step, you take the assets that you want to  keep, set up a new corporation to hold them, and give the shares in the new  corporation to your current shareholders. That's a tax-free distribution, and  no one owes any tax on it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Details Are Everything  </P> <P> In Step 2, you take what's left of your company -- which now owns only the  assets that you want to sell -- and sell it in exchange for shares in the  buyer's company. By getting shares rather than cash, you have a tax-free,  stock-for-stock exchange.  </P> <P> Thus, when the dust settles, you've unloaded the asset that you wanted to sell,  and your stockholders still own the assets that you want to keep. The only  difference between doing the deal this way and doing it the regular old boring  way is that your stockholders hold two pieces of paper (the shares of the new  company that you gave them, and shares of the acquirer) instead of one, and you  didn't pay capital gains tax on the asset sale.  </P> <P> In this type of deal, details are everything.  </P> <P> Don't think for a minute that Holiday Corp. is the only corporation in the  United States smart enough to squeeze through this loophole. Just last month,  Tyler Corp. of Dallas finished a Tax Avoidance Two-Step that was so neatly done  that almost no one but compulsive document readers, tax freaks and frustrated  IRS auditors realized that the company had done a tax-free distribution and a  stock-for-stock exchange rather than a sale of assets.  </P> <P> Here's how it went. First, Tyler set up a new corporation called Tyler Two Inc.  into which it put all its assets except for the Reliance Universal division,  which makes coatings. Akzo N.V., a Dutch conglomerate, then bought the old  Tyler -- in other words, Reliance Universal -- by forking over $105 million of  Akzo stock and assuming the $165 million of debt on old Tyler's books. Value of  the deal to Tyler shareholders: $270 million. Book value of the assets Akzo  bought: $90 million. Capital gains tax saved: $65 million (my estimate; Tyler  won't provide a number).  </P> <P> And as soon as the sale to Akzo was completed, Tyler Two changed its name to --  guess what? -- Tyler Corp. So everything is as it was, except that Tyler has  successfully done the two-step and avoided a big tax bill.  </P> <P> Can Holiday Corp. and Tyler Corp. really save all this money just by doing a  little extra paper shuffling? And can it possibly be legal? Yes and yes.  </P> <P> "The Morris Trust-type of deal is the only way left to break up a company  totally tax-free since the repeal of the General Utilities Doctrine," says  Robert Willens, Shearson Lehman Hutton's resident tax genius in New York. The  General Utilities Doctrine, which expired at the end of 1987, gave corporations  a complicated way to indefinitely put off paying tax on sales of acquired  assets.  </P> <P> Willens, who came upon the Tyler deal about the time that a Texas arbitrager  called up raving about how smart the Tyler people are, says Tyler pulled off "a  classic Morris Trust deal, an absolute beauty."  </P> <P> Gilbert Bloom, the national director of corporate tax for Peat Marwick Main,  the big accounting firm, predicts that the Tyler -- and Holiday-type  transactions could become more popular now that the 1986 tax reform act has  wiped out the General Utilities Doctrine and other corporate tax dodges. "The  ability to defer a gain on that gain (on an asset sale) is ever-present for  anyone who is willing to do something different," Bloom says.  </P> <P> Considering the high visibility of the Holiday deal -- it's not every day that  an American institution is sold to a British beer company -- some spoilsport in  Congress is probably going to figure out that the Morris Trust loophole is  costing the Treasury big bucks. If nature then takes its course, someone in  Washington will draw up tax legislation trying to overturn the Morris Trust  decision. That will be good public policy, and will send legions of corporate  tax types out looking for a new dodge.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Tax Avoidance Two-Step goes on. And the shareholders of Holiday  Corp. and Tyler Corp. ought to give their companies' tax planners a big fat  bonus for being so imaginative and smart.  </P></p>

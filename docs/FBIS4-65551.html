			<p>BFN     [Text] The diplomatic stalemate is such in the Bosnia  conflict that France is having doubts about its considerable  contribution to operations aiming at keeping a peace which is so  uncertain. Should we talk of a withdrawal of French UN troops  or a redeployment? A nuance emerged between Defense Minister  Francois Leotard and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. The nuance  has now disappeared, but what seems to be certain is the fact  that there will be fewer French UN peacekeepers in Bosnia.  Philippe Harrouard reports:    [Harrouard] Things are now clear: France will concentrate  its UN troops round Sarajevo. At the same time, it will bring  home 1,000 men posted in Glina, in Krajina. This number  corresponds to that of the extra troops sent provisionally last  March at UN request. This means that we are back to the  original figure.    As for the battalion in Bihac -- that is, 1,500 men -- it  will be withdrawn only if the peace plan which the belligerents  have been invited to negotiate does not succeed. Therefore,  there is no disagreement -- or there is no disagreement any  more, as we originally believed was the case:    [Begin Leotard recording] It is very natural for diplomats  to  use diplomatic jargon and for the defense minister to use a  language which is more military; it is totally normal. There is  no basic difference, no basic disagreement, I repeat, there is  none.    All these decisions were taken by the prime minister, with  the consent of the president, and they were submitted to the  United Nations as what France intended to do, which is the  normal procedure. We told the United Nations about the  battalion in Glina, and we are telling them about the battalion  in Bihac. [end recording]    [Harrouard] Right now, there are 6,858 French soldiers in  the  former Yugoslavia, including 5,000 in Bosnia. Eighteen French  UN soldiers have lost their lives.</p>

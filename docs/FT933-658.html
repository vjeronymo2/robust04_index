			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / First BCCI conviction as Akbar admits Dollars 745m fraud THE FIRST criminal conviction over the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International was secured yesterday when Mr Syed Ali Akbar, the former head of the bank's Treasury division, admitted 16 charges of false accounting involving more than Dollars 745m (Pounds 484m) of depositors' misused money. The case, brought by Britain's Serious Fraud Office, marks the first success for authorities in Britain, the US and Abu Dhabi which are now trying to bring a series of prosecutions concerning alleged frauds in the bank's handling of clients' funds. The only previous case to come to court - the trial in New York of US lawyer Mr Robert Altman - ended in his acquittal in August. Presenting the case for the SFO, Mr Timothy Langdale QC told an Old Bailey judge that the charges Mr Akbar had admitted to were only sample ones. The amount of depositors' money misused by BCCI officials was now thought to total Pounds 1.3bn, he said. The Treasury department which Mr Akbar had controlled was responsible for some 60 per cent of the bogus transactions used to conceal the bank's insolvency and to create the impression of profitability, he said. Mr Akbar reported directly to BCCI's two most senior figures - Mr Agha Hassan Abedi, its chairman and founder, and Mr Swaleh Naqvi, its chief executive. However, his department was the 'engine room' of the bank and he was the 'chief engineer' behind the frauds, Mr Langdale said. Mr Akbar is to be sentenced later today. He has already spent more than two years in jails in France and the UK. He was arrested in France after fleeing Britain soon after being released from prison after serving an 18 month sentence for laundering drug money.

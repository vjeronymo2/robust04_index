			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTORATION COST SOARS FOR BRIDGE;  </P> <P> CONSTRUCTION: BIDS ARE ABOUT $6 MILLION HIGHER THAN ESTIMATED TO REPAIR  CRUMBLING CONCRETE ON THE COLORADO STREET SPAN IN PASADENA.  </P> <P> Restoring the 77-year-old Colorado Street Bridge in Pasadena will cost $26.3  million, almost $6 million more than expected when the bridge was closed last  year, city engineers say.  </P> <P> "Some of the work being done is unique," said Alan Charmatz, a principal  engineer with Pasadena's Public Works Department. "Nobody's ever attempted to  restore a historic, concrete arched bridge at the same time as an earthquake  retrofit."  </P> <P> The higher price tag arose after two construction bids were returned in July,  both higher than budgeted for the project, he said.  </P> <P> The project will take 2 1/2 years to complete once work begins, possibly later  this year, Charmatz said. The soonest the bridge could be reopened is mid-1993.  </P> <P> When the project was proposed in 1988, it was estimated at $15.8 million. With  $12.7 million from the Federal Highway Administration, the city expected to  make up the difference.  </P> <P> But public works officials were unpleasantly surprised in May, 1989, when  engineering consultants De Leuw Cather &amp; Co. of Pasadena completed design  drawings with a new estimate of $20.4 million.  </P> <P> Faced with the shortfall, city officials scurried to find other money and got  $3.7 million from the county Department of Transportation.  </P> <P> The city then advertised for bids. Kiewit Pacific Co. of Santa Fe Springs said  it could do the work for $21.7 million, and Steve P. Rados of Santa Ana  estimated $23.2 million. Neither bid included $2.6 million for a project  contingency fund and $2 million for construction engineering costs to oversee  the project, both of which were in the $20.4-million estimate, Charmatz said.  </P> <P> City staff members and the consultant reviewed the project to determine whether  the job could be cut back but concluded that it could not be, Charmatz said.  </P> <P> The frail and crumbling Colorado Street Bridge was considered an advanced  engineering feat, the highest concrete bridge in the world, when it opened in  1913. It was saved from demolition in 1951 after a community letter-writing  campaign and has become one of Pasadena's most visible landmarks.  </P> <P> Under the rehabilitation project, the bridge will be brought up to earthquake  safety standards. Concrete surrounding the bridge's 11 arches will be stripped  away from the first level of steel reinforcing bars and repoured.  </P> <P> The historically accurate restoration will include replacing the concrete urns  that once lined the bridge and refurbishing 48 lampposts along its sides.  </P> <P> All the work will be done within a restricted area to minimize the impact on  the Arroyo Seco park below, Charmatz said.  </P> <P> Because of the novel work and conditions, the contractors submitted higher than  usual bids to protect themselves from unforeseen costs, Charmatz said.  </P> <P> Fewer contractors submitted bids than expected, he added, because of the  passage in June of Proposition 111, a state gasoline tax that will fund  government construction projects statewide. With more routine work anticipated,  developers shied away from the complex Pasadena bridge job, Charmatz said.  </P> <P> City Engineer Dave Barnhart is now asking for an additional $3.8 million from  the county. He also hopes to reduce construction engineering costs by about  $900,000, Charmatz said. The city would then have to provide the additional  money.  </P></p>

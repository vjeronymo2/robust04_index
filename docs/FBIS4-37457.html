			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hagay Huberman] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has pushed the peace  issue down low in his order of priorities and he is now focusing  much more on social issues, a senior government official close  to the prime minister told HATZOFE.    That is why the prime minister decided to put himself in  charge of the small team negotiating with Ramon's Ram faction in  the Histadrut, together with 'Uzi Bar'am and Hayim Haberfeld.    According to the same source, Rabin feels that by evacuating  the Gaza Strip -- which in practice is not in our hands despite  the erroneous "autonomy" title -- he has won the most points he  can gain in public support on that issue -- and he must now slow  down on peace if he does not want to lose the "points" he has  won.    "Rabin is starting to tire of the exhausting negotiations  with the PLO and has decided at this stage to hold up the  process until the situation in Jericho and Gaza stabilizes.  Rabin's current agenda is devoted to dealing with issues like  the Histadrut and its sick fund; the economic situation; the  cost-of-living index; housing, and other social issues."    According to the same source, Rabin apparently fears that  poor handling of those issues will lose the next elections for  Labor even if he can point to political successes, therefore his  day is mainly devoted to social issues. The Prime Minister's  Office feels that due to 'Arafat's pronouncements, public  support for an ongoing political move, including the transfer of  all the areas of Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip to the  Palestinians, is much lower than for leaving the Gaza Strip,  which most Israelis, even those identified with the right wing,  supported.</p>

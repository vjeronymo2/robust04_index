			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Red boxes open to the public BARROW &amp; Hepburn, which has manufactured ministerial dispatch boxes and leather goods since 1780, is to move into retailing by opening a shop in London's West End. 'It has taken us 212 years to make up our minds,' said Mr Brian Miller, managing director. The shop in Bury Street will sell a range of luggage, attache cases, belts and wallets. Replicas of the famous red dispatch boxes will also be on sale, but they will not have the royal cipher or the security lock. The London-based company makes more than 150 boxes a year for ministers, although output 'depends on how heavy the ministers have been with them', Mr Miller says. 'The creation of the Ministry of National Heritage was fun. That resulted in an order for 12 new boxes,' he added. The company also makes boxes for judiciary and the royal family. The Queen has purple boxes, the Queen Mother deep blue, and the Prince of Wales green. Another company product is the sheepskin purses used by the Queen to distribute largesse on Maunday Thursday. The design has been unchanged since 1210. The purses are a steadily growing business because the Queen gives away as many purses as she has years. This year the company made 264: two each for the 66 men and 66 women who received the Queen's money.</p>

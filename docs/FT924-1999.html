			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Move to common formats in the securities industry EUROPE's securities industry is poised to take a further step towards automation and greater efficiency. A steering group of institutional investors and banks, due to meet first on January 15, has been formed to promote common formats for the delivery of securities information between the groups. This relatively unfashionable sector of the securities industry still relies heavily on paper-based confirmation systems. The standard message formats will be based upon work done in the US by the Industry Standardisation for Institutional Trade Communications (ISITC) committee, and will consider the needs of European-based cross-border fund managers and custodians. A preliminary meeting in London last week attracted representatives from more than 40 institutions - mostly UK fund managers and banks - and the major US-based global custodians. One result was to clear up initial misunderstandings about the possible duplication of efforts with Europe's Electronic Trade Confirmation (ETC) project, said Mr Sean Quinn of Chase Manhattan Bank. ETC is designed to link investors and brokers and help them confirm trades automatically. 'Fund managers actively involved in ETC user group advisory boards were represented at the meeting, underlying the complementary nature of the two initiatives,' said Mr Quinn. 'This is a good example of competitors putting their competitive positions aside to move the industry forward.' A representative of SWIFT, which earlier agreed to allow fund managers to join it, will advise the steering committee. Agreeing standard formats should reduce errors and failed trades, and contain costs, said Mr Otello Sturino of State Street Bank, adding that the ambitions and timetable which are emerging for ISITC are aggressive. 'If we can ratify message types in the first quarter of 1993 we can establish pilot groups of managers and custodians to exchange information in the ISITC format. If this is successful in Europe in 1993, the Pacific Rim will be the last missing piece.'</p>

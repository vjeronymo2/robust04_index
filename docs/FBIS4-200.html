			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Lansana Conte in Conakry </F> on 2 April--live or recorded]    [Text] Fellow Guineans, 10 years ago our valiant soldiers  came to power by making a certain number of promises to you.  The most important of these promises was the commitment made to  endow our country with democratic institutions so our people can  choose their representatives. This year, on the eve of 3 April  1994, I address you with particular delight. The 19 December  1993 multiparty presidential elections constitute one of the  most important accomplishments of the democratization process in  our country.    Of course, one cannot talk about these elections without  paying tribute to the whole country and without mentioning 3  April 1984. This date was an historical turning point when all  the sons of the country came together to form a united, strong,  and prosperous Guinea. This turning point also enabled us to  open up to the outside world, establish individual and  collective freedoms, prepare for economic liberalism, adopt a  constitution, and create all the constitutional institutions,  all the things that are indispensable for the establishment of a  country where the rule of law prevails. Like 28 September 1958,  3 April 1984 is a milestone in the glorious history of our  country. That is why I pay glowing tribute to all those who,  either known or unknown, contributed to the accomplishment of  this permament task, particularly the members of the Military  Committee of National Redress and our valiant Army who were able  to bring Guineans together to fight against the challenges of  the moment.    Dear countrymen, I have already said the real winner of the  presidential election of December 1993 remains the people. My  wish is that Guineans would use this victory to improve  democracy building in the country. This means each and everyone  should contribute his part to regular legislative elections in  the future and for all to respect the laws and republican  institutions. Furthermore, I am pleased with the detente which  characterizes the current political and social scene. Credit  must go to all the nation's politicians for this important  achievement. This victory should also serve as an impetus to  the socioeconomic development of the country, which is  undoubtedly one of the conditions for the survival of democracy.  I call on all sons and daughters of the country to view the  first five-year term of office of the Third Republic as an  example of the profound change possible within the appropriate  institutional framework. We must create the basis for the  genuine revival of the national economy, work toward integrated  development, and modernize through a change of attitude and  behavior. It is clear the subregional, regional, and  international economic atmosphere is difficult, but I have  confidence in the creative and fighting spirit of Guineans.    In regard to economic growth, I consider energy and  communication infrastructure essential for a real economic take  off. That is why sustained efforts have been directed and will  continue to be directed toward these priorities. I am pleased  to inform you, dear countrymen, that negotiations with financial  backers have been successful and the construction of the  Garafiri Dam will begin by the end of this year. The  reorganization of the energy and post and telecommunications  sectors should soon help improve the operations of these  services. Road construction projects under way on some of our  highways should be multiplied to take the country out of its  isolated situation. I remain convinced that the cornerstone of  our development rests with the farmer. It is therefore  appropriate to intensify the policy of agricultural development  and support the village water supply program which is beneficial  to our people in the rural areas.    One of our major social problems now is unemployment. I  therefore call on the creative ability of Guineans for the  exploitation of the private sector. When this sector is  harmoniously coordinates with government's efforts it can  generate employment within the framework of national solidarity.  It is at this cost that we can achieve a more balanced society.    Fellow Guineans, achieving this large-scale program requires  huge resources. Unfortunately, we are poor. Therefore, the  thing to do is to judiciously use existing resources while  seeing to the sound management of government property.    Furthermore, by maintaining and improving our country's  relations with international financial institutions and friendly  countries, on the basis of already secured confidence, we can  count on the support required for our economic recovery. It is  understood that all external contributions should essentially be  acquired to supplement our own efforts.    Meanwhile, the policies pursued so far in developing the  education and health infrastructure has helped to achieve  results considered exemplary on the continent. These policies  should be resolutely continued and reinforced. To enable our  women and youth to fully fulfill their roles in building up the  country, it is important to reactivate their organizations at  all levels. The same goes for labor unions, whose function  should be adapted to the new situation.    Fellow Guineans, in being confronted with all sorts of  challenges, African states have no other options than to join  their resources within the framework of subregional groupings,  or even larger ones. It is this profound conviction which makes  me say that backing subregional integration will be one of the  guidelines of our African policy.    Concerning the Liberian conflict, the Guinean people's  efforts remain fruitful. In fact, the recent installation of  institutions which are expected to lead to the democratic  elections called for by all Liberians has proved that our  people's views are correct.    South Africa is preparing for its first multiracial  elections, and their success will sanction an end to the  apartheid system. In the Middle East, our desire to always  strive for the defense of justice and the people's legitimate  rights has always dictated our position of principle. This  stand has always inspired our unflinching support for the  Palestinian people's just cause. The progress made in seeking  solutions to the Israel-PLO conflict comforts us. To contribute  to the peace process which has been initiated, we will bring the  necessary changes to our policy to back and favor the  establishment of a constructive dialogue between the  protagonists. But we will do this without any shady deals, and  by making sure that justice has prevailed. In the same vein, it  is noted that the former Yugoslavian crisis continues. But  recent efforts by the United Nations and Europe give us hope.    Dear countrymen, our road is long and inevitably strewn with  obstacles. However, the future is bright. While wishing you a  happy anniversary, I call on you to set to work to make the  first five-year plan the plan for all and sundry. But this  should be done in a spirit of sound emulation, equity,  tolerance, and peace.    Long live the Republic!</p>

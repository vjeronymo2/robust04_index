			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Finsbury Smaller Finsbury Smaller Companies Trust is raising some Pounds 10m before expenses through a placing and open offers, fully underwritten by SG Warburg Securities. The directors believed that the UK economic recovery was gradually underway and that shares in smaller companies were likely to outperform those of larger companies. A placing and open offer of C ordinary shares will raise Pounds 7.5m, of which Pounds 1.5m can be subscribed in the open offer by ordinary holders. A further Pounds 2.5m will come from an open offer of C preference shares to zero dividend preference holders, who can apply for any amount. The C ordinary and preference will convert into ordinary and zero dividend shares on or before December 31 1993. Shareholders can apply for shares on the basis of a money amount rather than a specified number of shares. Dealings in the new shares are expected to start on July 13.</p>

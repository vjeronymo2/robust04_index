			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> BILINGUAL TEACHER SHORTAGE FELT  </P> <P> Simi Valley school officials said Tuesday that a statewide shortage of  bilingual teachers will force them to hire instructors lacking proficient  Spanish and language development skills.  </P> <P> The district needs to hire two new teachers before September to cope with an  increasing number of students with limited English skills and to meet the  requirements of a state-mandated plan on bilingual education, officials said.  </P> <P> "I know we will be able to fill the positions, but they will have to be  teachers who are in training," said Robert Isenberg, director of special  programs and testing.  </P> <P> "All are credentialed teachers, and all of them have an aide in the classroom  who speaks Spanish. The program will be able to continue, but there is no doubt  that a teacher who is not trained in language development cannot be as  effective as a teacher who is," he said.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the Simi Valley Board of Education voted unanimously to submit a  plan to the state that calls for 14 bilingual teachers, two more than are now  on the payroll. Teachers hired over the summer who do not have a bilingual  credential will receive training from the district, Isenberg said.  </P> <P> A total of 627 students with limited English skills are expected in the  district this fall, an increase of 127 over last year, officials said. Of  those, 212 will enter elementary bilingual classes and 173 will enter secondary  bilingual classes. The rest will enroll in traditional classes, at their  parents' request.

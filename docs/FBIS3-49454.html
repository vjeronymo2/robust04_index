			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dawid Warszawski: "Winners of the Consolation </F> Prize"]    [Text] NATO membership has become a key issue for us. But  we know that not only do we have no prospect of joining NATO  either today or in the foreseeable future, we have no reason to  expect anyone to ever tell us when we can join NATO and under  what terms. The decision due to be made at the NATO summit will  be a disaster for Polish diplomacy. Could it have been avoided?    In a certain sense, no. Once Poland had formally announced  its desire to join NATO, and especially once Russia had  expressed its objection to this, it has not been possible to  back down. The postcommunist coalition government could  certainly not have withdraw Poland's bid to join, for the  significance of such a volte-face would have been obvious. But  should Poland have made such an effort to join?  <H5>  What We Wanted </H5>   For Poland, NATO membership would have been a triple  success.  Symbolically, it would have satisfied our pro-Western ambitions  and permitted an exceptionally favorable integration with the  most important political and military structure of the West.    But most of all, it would have guaranteed us a degree of  security that our country has never known. Our NATO bid was  brought on by fears of a possible repetition of our recent  negative past, and no one can say that these fears are not  justified. It is enough to consider the danger of reemerging  Russian expansionism. The conclusion was automatic -- Poland  simply had to apply for NATO membership.  <H5>  Why Did They Not Want Us? </H5>   But it is Poland's thirst for security guarantees that made  NATO reject our bid. Considering a possible expansion of NATO,  its members asked themselves whether accepting Poland or any  other former eastern bloc country to their ranks would increase  their security.    The answer had to be no, on account of the genuine threat to  Poland from Russia. Out of all the countries of Central Europe,  only the Czechs were graded for membership differently, which  would explain their ostentatious departure from Visegrad  solidarity. In the event of a Russian attack on Poland, NATO  would have to help Poland as a member country, otherwise the  principle of collective security would cease to exist, and hence  NATO itself would become defunct. Why should NATO risk  accepting us?  <H5>  Fear of Russia and Russia's Fears </H5>   Poland's response to this question is obvious. If Poland  remains outside NATO, Russian extremists might be tempted to  attack it, and it would certainly encourage instability in a  strategically key part of Europe. NATO agrees with this view,  but insists that such an eventuality is less of a risk than the  issue of security guarantees to Poland. The British guarantees  made to Poland in 1939 are quickly brought to mind in this  regard. Western historians have denounced these guarantees as  particularly irresponsible.    What is more, NATO views the Russian opposition to its  expansion not as an impermissible case of Russian interference,  which is what Warsaw thinks, but as as a justifiable expression  of Russia's concern for its own security. Let is leave aside  the problem of whether or not Poland's NATO entry would  strengthen [Russian Liberal Democratic Party leader]  Zhirinovskiy's position (as Strobe Talbott, the new pro-Russian  U.S. secretary of state, claims it would), or whether, on the  contrary, it would force the Russian extremists to think again  (as our Foreign Ministry rather naively believes).    The point is that Russia is and will remain for a long time  NATO's only potential adversary in Europe, and it cannot fail to  react in a hostile manner to the prospect of moving the line of  potential confrontation several hundred kilometers closer to its  border. This strategic consideration is important. Because of  it, Germany was the only NATO country to support our application  to join, for in the event of our joining NATO, the line of  confrontation would no longer correspond to the eastern German  border.    NATO has no reason to antagonize Russia, especially at a  time  of imperial fever. But even a democratic Russia would have to  oppose our membership of NATO. At the thought of an eastward  shift of the NATO border, any Moscow government would react just  like President Reagan reacted in the 1980's to the threat of an  expansion of communism in Central America. NATO is prone to  accept the Russian point of view.  <H5>  Vain Hopes </H5>   So it is hard to understand why so much hope was attached in  Warsaw to just one statement from President Yeltsin, whereby  Russia had no objection to our efforts to join NATO. After all,  it was clear that whatever Yeltsin might say, Russia's  geopolitical interests would not change.    Poland's NATO membership would bring it a host of troubles  but no tangible advantages. Why did we expect NATO to accept  us? It was a mistake to make a formal application to join,  especially when this application was justified by a threat to  Poland -- in other words, a threat to NATO. The fact that  others made this mistake at the same time as us makes no  difference. It is Poland, not, for instance Hungary, that is  the basic object of the Central European contest of strength.  Those who think they might move the West by referring to noble  principles and past services rendered should talk to the  president of Bosnia.  <H5>  Stakes Too High? </H5>   It is not out of the question that if we had not applied for  full membership, we might have been able to negotiate quite a  good unilateral deal that might not have contained any security  guarantees, but it might have permitted political integration.  In the meantime, the "Partnership for Peace" proposal is all  that we are being invited to.    NATO is addressing these mainly rhetorical proposals of  cooperation to all the countries of the former Soviet bloc,  suggesting to them that NATO might eventually turn into  something more concrete. As far as the "partnership" proposal  is concerned, it means that NATO will care for the security of  independent Poland as much as it will care for the independence  of Kyrgyzstan. If I were from Kyrgyzstan, I might be pleased to  hear it.    By hastily playing for high stakes, we have risked losing.  Henceforth, we can only expect a part of the kitty --  association with the Western European Union. Most probably, all  that awaits us is the "Partnership for Peace" proposal -- in  other words, the community of consolation prize winners.</p>

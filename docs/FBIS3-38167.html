			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpts] Meeting the press in Istanbul today, Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller said the latest economic decisions were  made because the Turkish lira had been revalued too much during  the past five years. This also widened the gap between exports  and imports, she said, adding that it would have been wrong to  keep the foreign exchange rate low through artificially high  interest rates. She stressed that it would not be valid to  implement authoritarian measures in a free market economy and  that keeping the economy under forcible control would mean  running a dictated economy.    [Begin Ciller recording] [passage omitted] The rate of  exchange may fluctuate. The important thing, however, is the  revenue on the Turkish lira. I have always said this. Those  who invested in the Turkish lira in 1991-93 profited more than  those who invested in foreign exchange. For example, those who  invested in Treasury bonds last year received 89 percent, while  those who invested in the U.S. dollar received 71 percent. In  other words, those who bought government bonds gained some 18 to  20 points more than the others. Our people seem to be  calculating their profits on a daily basis. One cannot do that.  The government bonds with the shortest term are three-month  bonds. You must invest for three to six months, and you must  compare the price after six months. You must not make daily  calculations. The rate of exchange fluctuates; the stock market  goes up and down. I have always said and will continue to say  this: If you want a risk-free and high-yield investment under  the present conditions, you must invest in state bonds. [end  recording] [passage omitted]    The prime minister pointed out that the adjustment of the  rate of exchange will not have a great effect on the rate of  inflation, because 25 percent of all goods are imported. Thus,  she added, the devaluation will be reflected in the yearly rate  of inflation as 3 to 4 percent. Therefore, nobody should think  that a great wave of price hikes is coming, she stressed.    [Begin Ciller recording] If the economy could be repaired in  one or two days, we would have done it. If it were so easy, we  would have done it. Was the situation not the same in June? A  certain period of time is needed to repair the economy; 1994  will be a year of repairs; 1995 will be a better year; 1996 is  the election year, and it will be much better. If this house  has collapsed, then we will repair it. We need a certain period  of time: 1994 will be that time, the year of repairs. [end  recording] [passage omitted]    Ciller said the regional countries were not informed about  the time and date of the air operation into northern Iraq, but  were repeatedly alerted to the fact that terrorists were being  trained in the Zhalah camp and that it was providing the  terrorists with logistic support. She stressed that the Zhalah  camp is 110 km from the border and 550 km from the area where  the planes took off.    [Begin Ciller recording] While extending humanitarian aid to  Kurdish leaders Barzani and Talabani, and while negotiating  within the framework of our cooperation, we repeatedly alerted  them. We said we are continuing with our aid, but that we have  certain ideas. Talabani told me that the area in question is  not under his control. The operation was prepared very well  over months. When the state decided that it was time to carry it  out, I made the political decision. Those who claim the  operation was linked to the devaluation do not know the first  thing about how the state mechanism works. [passage omitted]    In addition to the peace process between Israel and 'Arafat,  the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] issue has also been  included in the U.S. Middle East policy. This is extremely  important. The United States has also agreed in principle to  follow this issue at the State Department level. In other  words: 1. This is the first time the United States is including  the PKK in its Middle East policy; 2. The United States has  instructed the State Department to follow this issue. This is  extremely important. [end recording]    Replying to a question, Ciller said that she is going to  Bosnia-Herzegovina because this is a humanitarian and not a  Muslim-Christian issue. Asked to comment on reports that the  United Nations will not do much to safeguard her security in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ciller said:    [Begin Ciller recording] [passage omitted] If I have a duty  to perform, I will do it regardless. That is not our problem;  it is a UN problem. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 14 (XINHUA) -- More bananas,  litchis, longan and mangoes were grown in Guangdong last year  than in any other Chinese province -- and for the previous five  years, too.    That little-known fact is part of the outcome of the  province's farmers turning to produce for which there is strong  market demand.    They have been doing that for the past 14 years, and now the  market-oriented agriculture in south China's Guangdong Province  has attained full development. The agricultural structure has  been greatly rationalized.    Last year, agricultural output of Guangdong topped 88.6  billion yuan (about 15.3 billion U.S. dollars at the 1993  exchange rate), with a growth of 3.5 percent over the previous  year. Average income of local farmers has also increased by a  large margin.    Through the export of agricultural products, Guangdong  earned  2.1 billion U.S. dollars last year.    The province has taken a lead in doing away with unified  purchase and sale of agriculture products and has lifted price  controls on all the main products, encouraging farmers to adjust  their activities to market demands.    To increase farming profits, the sown area of improved  varieties of rice and cash crops has been greatly expanded.    Highly efficient and profitable agricultural sectors  including breeding of aquatic products, animal husbandry and  forestry have developed into pillars of the rural economy,  together with farming.    Output value of aquatic products in 1993 accounted for  one-fourth of the province's total produced by agriculture.  Deep-sea fishing has also boomed, with the number of pelagic  fishing boats in operation making up a third of China's total.    Guangdong's output of meat last year reached 2.6 million  tons, holding the country's third position, and turning the  province into a large producer of meat from having been a large  consumer.    Five thousand large, intensive and highly modernized  production centers for fruit, flowers and vegetables have  mushroomed all over the province, creating tremendous profits  for it.    Improved processing abilities of various agricultural  products and the establishment of multi-layered retail and  wholesale markets have also played an important role in boosting  local agriculture.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Government's view on collieries backed: Reports into the future of the coal industry THE thick set of reports which the Department of Trade and Industry issued yesterday will make depressing reading for the coal lobby. The independent consultants hired by the DTI to illuminate the debate support in grim detail what the government has claimed all along: that British Coal's present size cannot be justified commercially, and that it will have to undergo deep cuts very quickly if it is to have any worthwhile future. The comfort is that a cost-cutting exercise might save a small number of pits currently listed for closure. As the four reports make clear, British Coal is in a shrinking market where its costs are far above those of foreign competitors. John T. Boyd Company, the US mining engineers which examined the viability of British Coal's pits, commends the corporation for its 234 per cent increase in productivity over the last seven years but points out that Australian and US coal miners are still three to five times more productive. Because British Coal can never hope to match overseas producers - partly for reasons beyond its control such as geology - its future is irrevocably linked to whatever it can secure of the UK market. However Caminus Energy, which was asked to look at future demand for coal in the UK, expects it to fall from 95.2m tonnes in 1991-92 to 71m in 1997-98 at the most, possibly as little as 58.6m. The difference depends on the way energy prices move over the next few years. If they stay high British Coal will be able to retain more of the market, but if they weaken, it will lose out. Caminus says its main rival is natural gas, which provides much cheaper new generating capacity than coal. Faced with this harsh reality, the question is how far British Coal can go in bringing down its costs, because the cheaper the coal it can produce, the greater the share of the market it will command. The reports look at 21 of the 31 pits which British Coal wants to close - the other 10 were listed for immediate closure and are being examined separately. John T. Boyd visited all the pits under review and came up with two possible scenarios. In the first it assumed that working practices are unchanged, but that new technology is introduced and labour reductions are accelerated - a continuation of present trends. In the second it assumed that work practices are improved to create more flexible shifts, and that mining regulations are changed to allow further cuts in manning levels. The differences are striking. In the second scenario British Coal could be producing 13m to 19m tonnes more coal annually by April 1996, depending on the exact cost level. It would, however, have to bring its costs down substantially. UK coal is costed at Pounds 1.51 per gigajoule for the next set of contracts starting in April, against international prices of Pounds 0.90. John T. Boyd assumes prices can be brought down to the Pounds 1.10 to Pounds 1.40 range. The market prospects are assessed by Caminus which also looked at different scenarios. In the first it assumed international fuel prices would be high with coal trading at Pounds 1.21 a gigajoule. In this case sales would be 53.9m tonnes in 1997-98. In the second it priced coal at only Pounds 0.90 a gigajoule, and sales fell to 22.8m tonnes. Although this showed, again, that British Coal will do better in a high-price market, both forecasts are well down on the 85.7m tonnes sold last year. There is a ray of hope here for the miners because the 1997-98 figure includes 42.4m tonnes of coal for the power generators, well above the 30m which British Coal now expects to sell to them. But to achieve this extra 12.4m tonnes everything - the cost savings and the international fuel price - would have to go British Coal's way. Although Caminus does not say what this would mean in terms of pits and jobs saved, the rule of thumb is 1,000 jobs and one pit for every 1m tonnes. All the reports go into how British Coal could cut its costs in some detail. John T. Boyd provides a string of recommendations, including giving the local colliery manager more autonomy, further introduction of new technology, and changes in existing work restrictions and statutes. Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, was asked to look at administrative overheads which, it says, have not fallen in line with cuts at the workplace. It believes British Coal could save Pounds 73.6m to Pounds 107.1m a year by 1996-97 by cutting and simplifying the administrative system. But this would involve the loss of about 3,000 white-collar jobs. Ernst &amp; Young recommended that a small corporate office be retained in central London, with other headquarter services re-located close to a colliery. The number of regional groups should be halved and business systems modernised. PIMS Associates, management consultants, said savings in overheads of Pounds 90m could be achieved if British Coal matched international standards. But its report doubts that it could ever match the best-practice benchmark in the industry of Pounds 75,000 of value added per employee in the next few years. A more realistic level, it says, is a 20 per cent improvement to Pounds 47,000 in three years. The reports are therefore a vindication of the government's aim of cutting back British Coal. Critics will say that they take no account of aid received by other power sources - for example the nuclear levy. But the presumption is that the UK energy business must ultimately stand on its own two feet. MAIN POINTS John T. Boyd: In the context of reduced market size, the general strategy and overall future for each pit announced in October appears reasonable. Significant cost reductions, plus improved safety and productivity, could be achieved by the application of modern technology. Important to address technological and structural problems as soon as possible to achieve cost benefits and a healthy, competitive industry. Past performance is not a reliable measure of future potential as all collieries in the list of 21 would need to achieve substantial improvements in productivity and operating cost. Caminus Energy: UK market for coal set to contract sharply over the next five years, primarily because of reduction in coal use for power generation in England and Wales as new gas-fired plant comes into operation. Gas prices would need to increase to about double the level of existing contracts in real terms for coal to become more economically attractive in new plant.  --------------------------------------------              Pits under threat***  -------------------------------------------- Economic ranking Case 1*                  Projected margin                            pounds per                            gigajoule  -------------------------------------------- 1   Maltby                    0.21 2   Hatfield                  0.15 3   Prince of Wales           0.10 4   Frickley                  0.10 5   Point of Ayr              0.04 6   Bentley                     - 7   Rossington               -0.02 8   Wearmouth                -0.06 9   Calverton                -0.08 10  Kiveton Park             -0.09 11  Bilsthorpe               -0.13 12  Silverdale               -0.11 13  Shirebrook               -0.13 14  Markham                  -0.15 15  Bolsover                 -0.23 16  Clipstone                -0.26 17  Rufford                  -0.28 18  Shariston                -0.38 19  Bevercotes               -0.42 20  Westoe                   -0.52 21  Easington                -0.55  -------------------------------------------- Case 2*                  Projected margin                            pounds per                            gigajoule  -------------------------------------------- 1   Maltby                    0.41 2   Hatfield                  0.35 3   Prince of Wales           0.27 4   Frickley                  0.27 5   Rossington                0.28 6   Point of Ayr              0.18 7   Wearmouth                 0.12 8   Silverdale                0.14 9   Bentley                   0.11 10  Shirebrook                0.08 11  Bilsthorpe                0.04 12  Calverton                 0.02 13  Clipstone                 0.01 14  Kiveton Park             -0.01 15  Rufford                  -0.03 16  Markham                  -0.05 17  Bevercotes               -0.19 18  Shariston                -0.23 19  Bolsover                 -0.38 20  Westoe                   -0.46 21  Easington                -0.55  --------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------    British coal costs and output (in April 1996)  ------------------------------------------------------                        Case 1*        Case 2** Cost level pounds      m tonnes       m tonnes per gigajoule  ------------------------------------------------------ 1.10                       2             15 1.20                      13             32 1.30                      22             41 1.40                      34             47  ------------------------------------------------------ Source: Boyd  ------------------------------------------------------ *** The list does not include 10 mines earmarked by British Coal for early closure *  Case 1 assumes present mining regulations in force ** Case 2 assumes law changes to allow longer shifts and there are compulsory redundancies  ------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Projected British coal sales  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High coal scenario (m tonnes)                        1991/2    93/4    94/5    95/6     96/7    97/8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Power sector            73.0     34.9    41.2    43.6     40.9    42.4 Non-power sector        11.3     10.6    10.7    10.7     10.7    10.6 Exports                  1.4      1.3     1.2     1.1      1.0     1.9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                   85.7     46.8    53.1    55.4     52.6    53.9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Assuming high international fuel prices and 9 gigawatts of combined cycle gas turbine in England &amp; Wales 1997-8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Low coal scenario (m tonnes)                        1991/2    93/4    94/5    95/6     96/7    97/8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Power sector            73.0     10.7    13.6    16.0     16.0    16.3 Non-power sector        11.3      9.1     7.7     6.6      6.3     6.0 Exports                  1.4      1.2     1.0     0.9      0.7     0.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                   85.7     21.0    22.3    19.2     23.0    22.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Assuming low international fuel prices and 12 gigawatts of combined cycle gas turbine  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Caminus Energy  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

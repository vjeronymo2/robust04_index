			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- President Alberto  Fujimori of the Republic of Peru called for better links with  China's civil aviation and other industries here today.    In a meeting with Zhu Yuli, general manager of the Aviation  Industries of China, and Liu Guomin, president of the China  National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation (CATIC),  Fujimori said that Peru and China have cooperated well in this  field, adding that the nine Yun-12 transport planes Peru has  imported from China have been placed into normal operations and  seem fit for Peruvian conditions.    Both fujimori and Zhu agreed that a still greater potential  is yet to be developed in the civil aviation industry and other  economic sectors.    An agreement was recently signed between CATIC and the  relevant Peruvian department on CATIC providing 31 million U.S.  dollars worth of road-building machinery to Peru develop its  infrastructure construction.</p>

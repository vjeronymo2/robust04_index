			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] President Soglo held consultations with  businessmen at the Presidential Palace this morning. The  meeting lasted more than three hours and focused on the effects  of the devaluation on commercial activity. [passage omitted]    Trade unions did not attend this afternoon's scheduled  meeting with President Soglo in protest against the ban on this  morning's briefing rally. [passage omitted]    In a communique issued this afternoon, the trade unions that  have formed the interunion crisis committee said the ban is a  violation of union freedom. The unions and organizers are  basing their argument on a series of factors in an attempt to  prove that they are being muzzled by President Soglo's  government. In concrete terms, they pointed out that the  interior minister's reply to the interunion crisis committee's  letter on this morning's meeting did not in any way question the  holding of the meeting. Besides, the unions maintained that the  holding of a union meeting has never required prior permission  from the authorities.    The interunion crisis committee also protested against the  interior minster's radio statement, which it described as  untrue, and claimed it could lead to confusion. Concerning the  interior minister's radio statement on the 1315 news, the unions  [words indistinct] directed at them. Furthermore, in light of  this offensive, which the unions think is targeted at them, they  are making an urgent appeal to all workers to be on standby to  follow directives and orders from the interunion crisis meeting.  Finally, the unions in question, namely (CSA-Benin), (CGPD),  (RSTB), (CFEB), (PINAD), (SYNTRAPAC), (SYNARES), (SYNCITRACEP)  [expansions unknown], convene their activists for a briefing and  protest meeting at the Cotonou Labor Exchange at 0800 on 1  February.</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> JAPAN;  </P> <P> CHINESE HIJACKER TO BE EXTRADITED  </P> <P> Japan's justice minister ordered the extradition of a Chinese hijacker who said  he commandeered a passenger jet to escape political persecution for his role in  last June's pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tian An Men Square.  Justice Minister Shin Hasegawa ordered prosecutors to turn Zhang Zhenhai, 36,  over to Chinese authorities by May 23 to stand trial for hijacking an Air China  Boeing 747 with 233 people aboard last Dec. 16. Human rights activists  protested the decision, saying Zhang is sure to be tortured and possibly  executed in China.  </P></p>

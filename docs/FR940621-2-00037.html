Box 1492, El Paso, Texas 79978, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;601&hyph;000 a request pursuant to &sect;&sect;157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to construct and operate a delivery point under El Paso's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;435&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> El Paso proposes to construct and operate the Afton Meter Station and approximately 168.2 feet of 12-inch pipeline in Dona Ana County, New Mexico, to permit the firm transportation and delivery of natural gas to the City of Las Cruces, New Mexico, in accordance with a transportation service agreement dated August 15, 1991. El Paso states that Las Cruces seeks to receive gas delivered for its customers from a point on El Paso's existing 26-inch California Line and El Paso's 30-inch California First Loop Line, which would involve constructing dual 6-inch senior orifice-type meter runs, two 6-inch tap and valve assemblies, and appurtenances. It is stated that the service agreement provides for the firm transportation of Las Cruces' full requirements of natural gas to consumers situated within the City of Las Cruces. New Mexico, and its surrounding areas. El Paso states that the total estimated cost of the facilities is $151,600 which would be reimbursed by Las Cruces. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> El Paso explains that this proposal would supersede that proposal authorized in Docket No. CP94&hyph;67&hyph;000 since the parties have determined that the new location for the Afton Meter Station would provide Las Cruces with more flexibility and less capacity constraints in the delivery of its gas. El Paso estimates that, during the third year of operation, the maximum peak day and annual requirements of the Afton Meter Station would be 97,400 Mcf and 14,600,000 Mcf, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=2 --> Lois D.

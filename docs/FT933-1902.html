			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Poland may get left-of-centre government THE prospect of a left-of-centre coalition government in Poland increased yesterday after the Democratic Union, (UD), the mainstream Solidarity party, said it would not join a coalition with either of the two victorious parties with their roots in the communist past. The UD leadership said it was the duty of the two parties that won the election, the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) and the Polish Peasants party (PSL), to form a government. 'These parties have aroused social expectations which cannot be fulfilled, and we don't intend to join such a government,' it said. In response Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the SLD leader, giving his first post-victory press conference, yesterday concluded: 'This means we will have to start talks with the PSL and the Union of Labour (UP) on the possibility of forming a coalition with them.' The UP, led by Mr Ryszard Bugaj, won 7 per cent of the votes and around 42 seats, and although left-wing on many social issues, is deeply anti-communist and unlikely to agree to an alliance which includes the SLD. The SLD, with over 20 per cent of the vote and around 173 seats, and the PSL with over 15 per cent of the vote and around 130 seats, together command a 'constitutional majority' of over two-thirds of the 460 seats in the Polish Sejm, the lower house of parliament. This not only gives them the opportunity to govern in coalition with each other, but also gives them the power to dictate the terms of the new constitution needed to replace the present interim 'Mala Konstytucja', or small constitution. One of the issues to be decided is the future division of powers between the elected president and the parliament. Mr Kwasniewski denied yesterday that the SLD intended immediately to cut powers enjoyed by President Lech Walesa or his term in office, which runs until autumn 1995. But he made clear the SLD would press for a future constitutional model in which the president plays a less active political role, stepping in only when needed as an arbiter. But he added: 'The constitutional question will have to the subject of a broad-based debate in and outside parliament.' Asked about what he had to say to foreign investors Mr Kwasniewski replied, in English, 'Don't worry. Foreign investment is essential if the economy is to be revitalised,' adding that the SLD in government would press the EC for a timetable for Polish entry.</p>

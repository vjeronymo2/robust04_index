			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Hermes bucks trend with doubled earnings HERMES, the French luxury goods group, bucked the downward trend in the troubled luxury industry by almost doubling net profits to FFr54.6m (Dollars 7.1m) in the first half of this year from FFr28.6m in the corresponding period of last year. The group, which is still run by the founding Hermes family but this summer ended more than a century of independence by issuing part of its equity on the Paris second market, said it had benefited in the first half from strong sales of leather and silk products, as well as from a reduction in financial costs. The news of the sharp increase in Hermes' profits comes at a time when other luxury companies are under pressure. Gucci, the Italian leather goods group, is in deep financial difficulty and LVMH, the conglomerate of French businesses, yesterday reported a fall in interim profits. Hermes, by contrast, saw sales rise by 8.2 per cent from FFr1.14bn in the first six months of 1992 to FFr1.23bn at the interim stage this year. Operating profits increased by 44.7 per cent from FFr102.8m to FFr148.8m over the same period. Although the market for Hermes' leather and silk products was buoyant, it did experience difficulties in its perfume and tableware businesses. Hermes' finances have been strengthened by an injection of FFr141m following the flotation. The group yesterday said that it anticipated 'a slight improvement' in sales and profits for the rest of the year. However, it cautioned that the outcome was still uncertain given the volatility of the economic environment and its dependence on the pre-Christmas sales season.</p>

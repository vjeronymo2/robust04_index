			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter An Song-kyu from Panmunjom] </F>   [Text] Before holding the closed-door meeting of the sixth  South-North working-level contact on the morning of 12 March,  delegates from the South and North expressed a strong will for  the success of the talks.    Pak Yong-su, head of the North side's delegate, said:  "Recently, when I met Koreans residing in the United States who  were visiting North Korea, they said that prospects for the  realization of the exchange of special envoys of the South and  North was not that bright. They also said, however, that we  should not be so pessimistic about this matter."    Pak Yong-su continued: "Since I am determined to open a  breakthrough in today's contact, I came here with the  determination to reach an agreement."    In this connection, Song Yong-tae, the South side's senior  delegate, said: "In a news conference after the fifth  South-North contact on 9 March, I said that the sixth round of  contacts will mark a turning point in the success or failure of  the contact." He also proposed: "Even though today is a  Saturday, if we do not reach an agreement in the morning, let us  extend the contact into the afternoon so that we can come to a  conclusion."    The North Korean head delegate Pak Yong-su said: "When  viewing the profound secrets of nature this year--the 49th  anniversary of the `division'-- we are experiencing a rare  phenomena with such a heavy snowfall yesterday. In particular,  a double rainbow appeared at the summit of Chongil peak at Mt  Paektu in mid-February. Our people view this as a sign of  extremely good luck for our nation. We even made a song  entitled, `Reunification Rainbow.' This has become one of the  most popular songs."    In this connection Song Yong-tae responded by saying: "The  slogans and songs on reunification are important, but what is  more important is for us to create practical conditions for  reunification."    The North Korean reporters who entered the House of Peace at  around 0940 for the contact said: "It seems that today, some  kind of important result will be achieved." They expressed deep  interest in the purpose and schedule of U.S. Assistant Secretary  of State Gallucci's visit to South Korea.    The North Korean reporters asked to the last detail and took  notes of the purpose and schedule of Gallucci's visit to South  Korea. When they heard that it was decided between the ROK and  the United States that the third round of DPRK-U.S. high-level  talks will be postponed if the exchange of special envoys does  not take place before 21 March, they showed a somewhat sensitive  response by saying that it is a violation of the agreement  reached between North Korea and the United States.    The delegates of the South-North contact waged a light  verbal  battle on whether to hold the contact openly.    The North Korean head delegate Pak Yong-su said: "People of  the whole nation as well as reporters here have great  expectations in today's contact. How about holding the contact  openly?    In this connection, the South Korean senior delegate Song  Yong-tae insisted on holding the contact behind closed doors by  saying: "Is there a special reason for holding the contact  openly?"    The North Korean head delegate said: "There is no special  reason so let us follow your opinion and hold the contact behind  closed doors." Thus, the contact started behind closed doors at  1015.</p>

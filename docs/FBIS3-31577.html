			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 21 February reports  escalation of combat in the following areas:    A report by the press service of the 3d Corps of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army claims that "Croatian Army aircraft  early yesterday morning shelled Vitez [word indistinct]. An  aircraft and two helicopters flew from the direction of Gornji  Vakuf and fired 12 projectiles [words indistinct]. Afterward,  the aircraft in a low-level flight strafed this settlement.  This air attack by the aggressor's Croatian Army resulted in  enormous material damage." The report here adds an observation  that this attack was carried out while "the international  organizations and public are preoccupied with the NATO  ultimatum" in hope that it will passed "unnoticed."    "In the zone of responsibility of the 4th Corps IKM  [expansion unknown] Konjic the forces of the Croatian Army and  the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] would not cease shelling  Muslim villages. On two occasions last night the ustashas  shelled (?Scipe) in the free Prozor territory from a multiple  rocket launcher. Late last night the Croatian Army air force  was active, too, which in the region of Scipe village dropped  (?four) [word indistinct] bombs. At the time of sending this  dispatch we could not obtain any information about the  consequences of the activity of the ustasha air force and  artillery," a dispatch by the 4th Corps Information Service  reports.    "Again no peace on the free Olovo territory," reports a  correspondent whose name is indistinct. "Yesterday passed in  attacks of the chetnik artillery on the civilian quarters of the  town and settled areas along river Krivaja." She continues to  report that "in the course of the night the infantry arms fire  along the entire front line of [word indistinct] Olovo defenders  has been intensified" and reports that "the morning in the  freedom-loving Olovo started with renewed activity of the enemy  artillery, which is again pounding the lines of our defense with  intensified small arms fire. The lines of defense are stable and  under full control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army fighters."</p>

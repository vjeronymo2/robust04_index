			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'GOOD COPS, BAD COPS' A SMOOTH CAPER  </P> <P> Ray Sharkey as a Boston police captain in a starched blue uniform is an  incredulous image. That's because Sharkey has nailed down the market on feral  con artists. And sure enough, he turns out to be a corrupt cop in NBC's "Good  Cops, Bad Cops" (Sunday at 9 p.m., Channels 4, 36 and 39), a moderately  compelling, fact-based yarn about a group of Boston's finest who pulled off  what may be history's biggest bank heist (some $25 million in cash and jewels).  </P> <P> Ed Asner plays a police official who from the start is wise to Sharkey's  scam-laden character (based on the real-life Gerry Clemente, who from his cell  wrote the book "The Cops Are Robbers," on which scenarist Bill Bleich based his  teleplay).  </P> <P> Director Paul Wendkos and a gritty cast of actors, including bad guys Steve  Railsback and James Keach, dramatize a nervy and literally almost leisurely  three-day bank robbery masterminded by a cool group of Boston policemen over  the Memorial Day weekend in 1980.  </P> <P> They get away with it too. That's the first hour of the show, and it's staged  with enough veracity that, as with so many daring capers, you find yourself  pulling for the gangsters. The last hour is equally arresting and implacable as  the thieves, who know no honor among themselves, of course, fall into the fatal  trap of mutual distrust.  </P> <P> Sharkey's performance, which is convincingly measured instead of merely hyper,  is quite good and it anchors the show. There's no violence as such until the  end, a vermilion moment that unflinchingly lingers on a gunshot victim as he  crawls home a bloody pulp. The scene is unusually graphic but a casebook  example of violence dramatized for the right reasons.  </P> <P> Supporting actors Bobby Kellog (an undercover cop who underscores the pressure  from the Asner character for cops to rat on other cops) and Robert F. Lyons (as  the gang's alarm system magician) earmark the attention to character detail.RAY  LOYND  </P></p>

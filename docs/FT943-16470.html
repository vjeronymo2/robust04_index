			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Observer: Spot the director Early days yet, but stock market players might want to consider Observer's latest stock selection toy. It's called a Paddy Linaker, after the boss of the M&amp;G fund management giant, who steps down at the end of the month. It works on the principle that Linaker is dead set against companies cutting their dividends and would not join the board of a company which he thought might do so. Thus Linaker's joining a board implies it is most unlikely to cut the dividend. So far he has joined the boards of the TSB and Fisons. Admittedly, Fisons shares should have risen on the announcement of Linaker's appointment - not fallen. Maybe that just shows the stock market has got it wrong again. Any more of this contrarian thinking and we'll all be in the soup.</p>

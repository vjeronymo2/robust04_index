			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Battle to sell fighters to Malaysia By Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur LEADING US executives are making a last ditch effort to persuade Malaysia to buy US fighter aircraft. McDonnell Douglas, led by Mr John McDonnell, the company's chief,is in Kuala Lumpur trying to persuade Malaysia to buy F/A-18 multi-role fighters while General Dynamics is trying to sell its F-16 fighters. Executives from Northrop as well as officials from the Pentagon and US air force were also involved in discussions with the Malaysian defence ministry and air force. The other contender for sales of up to Dollars 850m is the Commonwealth of Independent States' Mig-29. The purchase of up to 30 Migs may be imminent. This week Malaysia signed a memorandum of understanding with India on defence co-operation. India has been using Migs for several years and has offered Malaysia maintenance and training support. US officials here insist that the Mig is inferior to both US made fighters. But the CIS is believed to be willing to sell up to date avionics with its fighters, whereas the US is not.</p>

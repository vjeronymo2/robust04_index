"We do not have any facts about the existence of  concentration camps in Tajikistan", Liviu Botha, head of the UN  mission in Tajikistan, told reporters on Wednesday commenting on  corresponding Western mass media reports which claimed that  political prisoners are being kept in three major camps on Tajik  territory.    However, Botha confirmed that he had received the  information  and added that it needs to be thoroughly checked.    He stressed that the Tajik Government agreed to render any  necessary assistance to the UN mission in inspecting the  mentioned areas were the camps are allegedly situated.    Tajik Parliament Speaker Imamali Rakhmonov categorically  denied in an interview to TASS the alleged existence in the  country of concentration camps and of political prisoners.    One of the leaders of the Security Ministry qualified the  reports as "dirty insinuations".    The news also caused open confusion among foreign and  Russian  correspondents accredited in Tajikistan who said they had heard  nothing about any concentration camps.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: No tax on this sale A British lady now aged 71, previously resident and domiciled in England, emigrated to South Africa four years ago. As her son lives there, she has no intention of returning to live permanently in the British Isles. She still owns the house which was her main residence and her principal private residence in the UK. It is let, and she is not considering selling it. She has been told, however, that if she did sell the house now, she would be liable to pay capital gains tax. Is this advice correct? What she has been told is nonsense (so far as we can deduce the relevant facts). You can ease her mind by sending her three free pamphlets which are obtainable from local tax offices: CGT4 (Owner-occupied houses), CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction) and IR20 (Residents and non-residents: liability to tax in the UK). Her UK solicitor, who presumably has acted for her in buying the house, can guide her through the tax labyrinth. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

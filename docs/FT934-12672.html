			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Beijing and US to tackle disputes CHINESE and US officials yesterday announced in Beijing a schedule of talks on four areas of trade conflict, with the aim of winning agreement by the December 31 deadline set by Washington for the opening of China's markets. A trade official in the highest-ranking US delegation to visit China since the 1989 student uprising, said the two countries had to place their relationship 'on a sounder and firmer footing'. In the past few weeks the Clinton administration has complained of China's nuclear proliferation, human rights and trade policies. Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, and other officials have warned they are prepared to remove China's Most Favoured Nation status, which gives it access to tariff benefits. The US action has been aimed at pushing China on a number of fronts well before it is time, in June, to renew its MFN status. If China co-operates, the US has said it is prepared to extend MFN status, which currently requires annual renewal. If China fails to heed US warnings, trade sanctions could go into effect by the end of the year on the dispute over market access. Transparency of trade rules, services, the enforcement of copyrights, trademarks and patents and the transshipment of goods to the US through third party countries are all on the talks agenda.</p>

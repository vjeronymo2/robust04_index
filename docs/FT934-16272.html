			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Shoppers make up for lost time - Judy Dempsey on the enthusiasm for direct selling in eastern Europe Until 1990, eastern Europe was terra incognito for Jonas af Jochnick. As chairman of Oriflame, the Brussels-based cosmetics firm, af Jochnick concentrated on direct selling throughout western Europe, Mexico and Chile. But once the communist regimes collapsed in eastern Europe, he jumped at the opportunity to start selling in a region which had been starved of consumer goods. His first venture was in Poland. Instead of exporting his wares to the country, af Jochnick took a gamble. He bought Karmeila, a Polish cosmetics factory, and has never looked back. In just three years, Oriflame has blossomed in Poland. It now has more than 50,000 sales assistants who spend their time criss-crossing the country, encouraging Poles to buy a wide range of cosmetics without leaving their homes. 'It has been a remarkable development,' said af Jochnick last week at the World Federation of Direct Selling Associations in Berlin. Last year, Oriflame's turnover in Poland and other countries in eastern Europe rose to Pounds 6.4m compared with the previous year's turnover of Pounds 2.7m. Its total turnover was Pounds 83.6m. Oriflame is not the only company penetrating eastern markets in this way. According to Paul Southworth, president of Avon Cosmetics (UK), direct selling in the region has been successful for many reasons. 'This is a brand new market. Look, we are not talking about knocking on people's doors and doing the hard sell, which is often the image associated with direct selling,' he said. 'It has become much more sophisticated. We market the products and services to consumers away from the business premises, primarily in their homes, so that people have time to talk and choose.' Moreover, the likes of Oriflame and Avon reckon consumers do not have the inclination to travel to big cities such as Warsaw, Krakow and Gdansk, where the country's fashionable department stores and boutiques are concentrated. 'We are there on the spot,' says Southworth. WFDSA members agree that the eastern Europe consumer can be put off by the barrage of television and newspaper advertising at a time when most countries are facing high unemployment. Af Jochnick has tried to overcome this problem in three ways. He makes sure the consumer can afford his products - through careful market research. In addition, his staff, mostly women, are hired locally, which means that customers are not intimidated by the thought of a foreigner stealing his or her job. More importantly, the brochures are all in the local language. 'The consumer can see that we are catering to their needs, and that we are giving employment,' explains Southworth. The company already has 20,000 people selling in eastern Germany, and is now targeting Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic and Slovakia. It is even venturing into Latvia, Russia and Ukraine. Avon has about 50,000 on the ground throughout eastern Europe, and a turnover there of about Dollars 75m (compared with worldwide sales last year of Dollars 4bn). Direct selling in eastern Europe has had to overcome a number of obstacles: bureaucracy, a poor infrastructure and conservative values, particularly among men. 'It was difficult at first to capture the male market,' says Southworth. 'Some think cosmetics are just for women. But the younger generation of men is much more open to buying these products. In any case, it's easier when we send a husband-and-wife team out selling. Indeed, then men see how much money women are earning through direct selling, and they want to do it as well.' Af Jochnick suppresses a sigh when he recalls the hassle with Polish customs. 'They really know how to hold up things. The delays in bringing some products into the country and registering them can be very frustrating,' he explains. Sending money in and out of the country through the banking system provokes another sigh, as does the problem of phone lines. Oriflame has about 40 people working full-time in the Budapest office, but it only has two phone lines. 'That's what I call overload,' said af Jochnick.</p>

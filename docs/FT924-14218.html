			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Private View: Bringing the cosmos down to earth - Cosmologist John Barrow discusses life, the universe and the possible existence of a Theory of Everything CAN THE Secret of the Universe be written on the front of a T-shirt? Religious belief is in secular decline in the West, its explanations seemingly exhausted. Now science, having murdered Faith, is accused of failing us in its turn. The bookshops are bursting with competing answers: on one rack religion, psychology and philosophy; on another astrology, mythology and the occult; on a third, particle physics, the human gene, consciousness, the universe, Everything. We are still desperately looking for that whatever-it-is. One of the best guides to the cosmic tour is John Barrow, author of the T-shirt question. He is a 39-year-old cosmologist, professor of astronomy at the University of Sussex, who studies the birth of the universe and the formation of the galaxies. His popular books revolve around questions of the ultimate. Is there a Theory of Everything, a TOE? Or is the grand unified theory, so spectacularly marketed by Stephen Hawking, just wishful thinking? Barrow may not have spectacular answers and his gifts as a scientist I cannot judge. But as a populariser he is uncommonly successful: eclectic, fluent, graphic and clear. His latest contribution, Pi in the Sky, discusses whether mathematics (the form in which the TOE would be revealed) is in some sense real, or whether it is just an uncannily successful device for explaining the world to ourselves. The journey is as interesting as the destination, as Barrow explains why words for 'one' and 'two' so often have different roots from words for 'first' and 'second', or why ancient shepherds could not count sheep. Why should Barrow bother to tell us all this? 'It isn't to spread my name,' he said. 'It's important to get scientific ideas across. I felt other people wouldn't write the books I wanted to read  -so I had to write them myself.' Scientists, he added, were writing their own popularisations these days to explain their ideas to each other as much as to the public. 'So the public are participating in a live dialogue, not just being sold a story.' Is it also because science has become too difficult for non-scientists to explain? 'In the UK popularisation has meant producing little pictures of what things are like - for instance, how quarks are confined in nuclei like balls in a rubber bag. It has come to mean producing analogies. At the turn of the century continentals such as Poincare criticised us for that. But if you look at what real scientists are doing you have to say that what they are producing is analogies - if rather more complex, abstract and high-powered. You might see mathematics as an analogy - or you might regard it as the real thing.' Is physics at a watershed? Is that why there is this desire to produce ordinary-language explanations? 'For some reason there is enormous public interest. It is almost like a substitute religion. The traditional view is that people like to have some transcendent reality, just like they have to have a sense of community in society. Perhaps this hankering after ideas of ultimate truth fits into that category. 'But it can't be the whole story because people with conventional beliefs are interested in these developments in science. One blatantly chauvinistic attitude would be to say these things just are more interesting than anything else on offer.' Barrow is persuasive on a platform but in private is cautious, even monotonous. He is agile physically as he is mentally; he was an 800 metres runner, a former junior national indoor champion who once beat Steve Ovett. It was through athletics that he acquired his unusual fluency and wide knowledge. His seven A levels included classical Greek, religious studies and English, which he read for at home with his philosophy-trained running coach, John Turp, in exchange for instructing Turp in maths and physics. 'So I got used at a very early age to explaining things orally and learning things by explaining them.' There was no science in the family: his father worked for a subsidiary of Joe Lyons, the catering chain. Why did he choose cosmology? 'I can remember from the age of 16 or so wanting to do astrophysics. I was not one of these people who wanted to look through telescopes. What interested me was this issue of mathematics. I remember asking at school: Why is that when we heat this thing up it does what the maths says it will do? How does it know? The prospect of being able to understand a star millions of light years away just by using simple laws of heat and gravity all seemed very neat.' When I asked him about those who accuse science of barren ambition, he replied that specialisation was inevitable: western science had been so fertile precisely because a monotheistic religion had prompted the search for natural laws handed down by a divine lawgiver. Oriental science had been retarded by the application of etiquette and harmony to nature. Like Stephen Hawking before him, Barrow was summoned to Rome to debate cosmology with Vatican theologians. God and science are not in opposition, he said. 'You can think of God as a mathematician or computer programmer, if you like, as lighting the blue touchpaper and retiring. Theologians prefer to think of God as sustaining the world from moment to moment.' It was biologists, not cosmologists, who were most hostile to religion because of the Darwinians' struggle against the church in the last century. 'Cosmologists, I think, appreciate the uncertainty of their subject. They are less confident and strident than biologists, with good reason. They have less data. If you look at their personal views, you will find many more cosmologists with strong religious beliefs than you would ever find biologists.' Are you interested in revealed religion? 'In my Theories of Everything I made the connection with mythological accounts of the world. These in a sense were the first theories of everything. They tried to include everything, leave nothing unknown or inexplicable because it was too frightening. They made huge tapestries into which to interweave more and more facts.' Do you believe in resurrection and redemption? Barrow was evasive. 'There may be a religious perspective that you won't find in a test tube or in an equation: I'm a strong believer that there are complementary ways of looking at the world. 'The scientific approach is different. Take a neon sign, for example. You could explain it in terms of quantum electronics with 100 per cent completeness but you wouldn't want to write down what the sign was actually saying as part of that description. To say that the sign said 'Coca Cola' wouldn't be part of the scientific account.' I asked him to define the limits of science. Are you running out of analogies? Is the world untranslateable now in a way that the Newtonian world of billiard balls was not? Barrow came back to his conundrum about the reality of mathematics. 'Is the world really mathematical or is maths just a way of describing the world? This is the crux of the question. 'Take a computer programme that simulates how galaxies form: load it up with laws of gravity, run it to simulate billions of years, watch the clusters occur. Continuing into the far future you would see stars and planets form; you might see living beings evolve in the computer program which could transmit messages to each other. Practically speaking, they would be conscious but they would have no material existence. What are they? They exist in the programming, in the mathematics. A Platonist would say they exist in every possible sense of the word. 'There is this extraordinary power of mathematics. It doesn't almost work, it works precisely and wonderfully and it works best in those areas such as elementary particle physics that are farthest removed from our everyday experience. So to say we just developed this capacity sounds wrong. Where there is no evolutionary advantage, maths works most persuasively.' Do cosmologists feel they are reaching the limits of what they can assert and convey? 'They certainly might be reaching the end of the observational and experimental road. There are two big constraints here. The first is: suppose a Theory of Everything exists in some form, why should we be able to understand and unravel it, living in 1992 on a planet in the suburbs of the Milky Way? It's an extraordinary anti-Copernican presumption that we should be clever enough to understand this after just a few hundred years of thinking about it. 'The other telling point is that what we can know is conditioned by the evolutionary process, by the necessities of surviving in our environment. As far as we can judge there is no reason why understanding a Theory of Everything is necessary for our survival.' Does it matter if there is a TOE or not? Are you able to say if there is one? 'I'm obviously not in a position to say, but I can speculate. If you look at what scientists do there is almost a presumption that there is. It's grown out of the idea that there is a single lawgiver and a set of laws. What's the alternative, a series of cosmic Berlin walls?' Would the TOE be boring? 'Well, it could turn out to be a necessary truth. There could be one and only one possible mathematical theory in which every piece of the jigsaw puzzle will fit. That's what people hope. The alternative, which to me seems more likely, is that the theory would allow many different types of universe, of which ours is one example. Just as the laws of nature allow many outcomes in which the symmetries of the laws are broken and disguised, the universe itself may be one of these disguised outcomes.' Would it be a testable, useful theory.? 'It might be. But suppose there was a theory and we could find it by some flash of insight, why should we be able to test it or check it? This is a much more significant point. The problem is that theory races way ahead of experiment. We don't have the financial means, the practical means, to test theories about the beginning of the universe. Why should the universe be so constructed that we should be able to test these theories?' So we could end up with several consistent theories and no way of distinguishing which was the right one? 'That's right.' In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Douglas Adams makes the computer, Deep Thought, cough up the answer to the riddle of the universe. It is 42. Deep Thought cannot, of course, supply the question. So, the day we learn there really is a TOE, I doubt I shall feel too excited. I shall wait for John Barrow's book.</p>

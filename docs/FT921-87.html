			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour spending costed at Pounds 27bn LABOUR'S spending pledges would total Pounds 27bn rather than the Pounds 38bn claimed by the Conservatives, according to an analysis by the accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte for The Independent newspaper, Diane Summers writes. Neither party has much room for manoeuvre if targets for public borrowing agreed at the Maastricht summit are to be reached, it finds. 'The fiscal policy aspirations of the two main parties have not caught up with the deterioration in the economy which has occurred over the last two years,' it says. It adds that a Tory government would relax borrowing targets in order to avoid reversing tax cuts.</p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Harmony directors oppose call for EGM DIRECTORS of Harmony Leisure, the loss-making pubs and restaurant group, yesterday urged shareholders to reject a call from challengers to the board to hold an extraordinary general meeting. Executive directors at the USM-quoted company, which reported a loss of Pounds 1.04m in the year to March 31 1991 and a further Pounds 445,000 in the following six months, are facing a challenge from a group which aims 'to return Harmony to profit and to generate enough confidence to raise capital for expansion'. The company has not yet released its 1991-92 results but has promised to do so soon. Shareholders have been urged to requisition an EGM by an 'alternative board' led by Mr Andrew Martyr, a former hotel executive, and Mr Simon Lynch, formerly with Grand Metropolitan. None of the prospective directors in the new team, which also includes Mr Ronald Laden, former chairman of Quaker Oats (Europe), and Mr Simon Smith, a London solicitor, holds any Harmony shares. Mr Stanley Lever, managing director at Harmony, described their proposals as 'opportunistic'. Speaking from France yesterday, he said Mr Martyr had sought a stake in Harmony in 1991. 'But he was unable or unwilling to demonstrate that the necessary resources were available.' Admitting that the company's poor performance had made it a target for potential takeovers, Mr Lever blamed Harmony's problems on its growing debt. 'Borrowings have escalated, largely through interest charges. But I can't see what this group could do to pull it round,' he said. The challengers to the company, which owns 23 pubs and restaurants in London and the south-east, have also proposed a 50 per cent cut in board salaries and performance-related pay for company staff. Mr Lever said their plans would be vigorously opposed and voiced confidence that shareholders would reject the proposals. Harmony shares were unchanged yesterday at 5 1/2 p.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participants supported OSHA's ``presumptive'' approach to identifying asbestos-containing material; in particular, designating only TSI and surfacing ACM for presumptive treatment (see e.g., utility companies such as Southern Cal. Edison, Ex. 162&hyph;4; Con Edison, Ex. 162&hyph;54; Duke Power, Ex. 162&hyph;57; property management companies and associations, e.g., JMB Properties, Ex. 162&hyph;29; trade associations, e.g., O.R.C., Ex. 162&hyph;12; International Council of Shopping Centers, Ex. 162&hyph;58).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the November 1992, OSHA continues to believe that the major advantage of such a regulatory approach is that the materials and buildings/facilities with the greatest risk potential would be automatically targeted for mandatory communication and control procedures, and possible testing. Focusing on high-risk building/facility situations avoids the dilution of resources and attention which might result from requiring broader inspections. Other building/facility areas and material would not be exempt from the standard's control requirements; however, they would not be presumptively considered to contain asbestos. If a building owner or employer has actual knowledge of the asbestos content of materials, they must comply with the protective provisions in the standard. Similarly if there is good cause to know that material is asbestos containing the employer and/or building owner is deemed to know that fact. The current enforcement rules governing ``employer knowledge'' would be applied in a contested case to determine the application of the asbestos standard to other materials or building/facility areas which the employer claims he did not know contained asbestos.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that this presumptive approach allows building/facility owners whose buildings/facilities contain PACM and other employers of employees potentially exposed to PACM flexibility to choose the most cost-effective way to protect employees. They may treat the material as if it contains asbestos and provide appropriate required training to the custodial staff; test the material and rebut the presumptions; or combine strategies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA considered a number of approaches to insure that workers do not become exposed to asbestos unknowingly. As noted in the 1992 notice, one option was clarifying in the preamble to the final rule the current enforcement policy that a prudent building/facility owner or other employer exercising ``due diligence'' is expected to identify certain asbestos-containing materials in his/her building/facility before disturbing them. After reviewing the record, OSHA believes its presumption approach is more protective. ``Due diligence,'' is, in part, a legal defense, invoked by and in order to shelter employers against OSHA citation. Thus in the past, employers who were wrongly informed by building owners about the asbestos content of thermal system insulation successfully argued in some cases that they had exercised ``due diligence.'' OSHA believes that the protection of employees must not depend on the good faith of their employers whose information sources may be defective. By requiring that TSI and troweled- and sprayed-on surfacing material be handled as if they contain asbestos, employees will be protected from the consequences of their employers relying on erroneous information about the most risky asbestos materials. Of course, ``due diligence'' would also require employers to investigate whether other building material about which there was information suggesting asbestos content, was in fact asbestos-containing. A building owner/employer, for other materials, also may presume they are asbestos-containing, label and treat work with them as asbestos work, without testing the material for asbestos content.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another option OSHA considered was requiring a comprehensive AHERA-type (EPA's schools rule) building/facility inspection. AHERA (Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act, 40 CFR 735) requires that all school buildings be visually inspected for asbestos-containing building materials (ACBM) by an EPA-accredited inspector and that inventory of the locations of these materials be maintained. Under AHERA, school maintenance and custodial staff who may encounter ACBM in the course of their work receive at least 2 hours of awareness training, and for staff who conduct activities which disturb ACBM, an additional 14.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

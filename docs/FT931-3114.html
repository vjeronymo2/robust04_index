			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Foremen at Ford strike over cuts FOREMEN at Ford plants in Southampton and at Dagenham, east London, went on strike yesterday in protest at the company's threat of compulsory redundancies, Robert Taylor writes. White-collar unions at Ford are due to meet the management next Tuesday following a ballot vote in support of industrial action. A union official said yesterday that his members were 'champing at the bit' to strike over the compulsory redundancy issue. Last week Ford agreed not to press ahead with compulsory redundancies among its blue-collar workers thanks to improved demand and adjustments to production targets. But the company has refused to withdraw the threat of compulsory redundancies for white-collar employees.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / People: Morton moves, but stays put Clive Morton, currently director of personnel for Northern Electric, has been appointed personnel director for the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, replacing Petter Tweddle, who is retiring. Morton will also become a member of the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group board - a key factor in his decision to accept the job although he has been with Northern Electric, where he was not a board member, for less than two years. His new post, for which he was headhunted, is based at Industrial Power Group's headquarters in Newcastle. This was also an important consideration for the 50-year-old Londoner, who has become one of the best known figures in north-east England's business community since moving to the region in 1986 as director of personnel and administration for Komatsu UK. While with Komatsu, the Japanese-owned earth moving equipment manufacturer, Morton set up the company's plant at Birtley, Tyne and Wear, and also established a reputation as a vociferous champion of Japanese-style management methods. At Northern Electric, he has introduced cultural changes including a move towards a team-working, rather than a sequential, structure, and also negotiated a single agreement with the four trade unions representing employees, in order to increase flexibility and efficiency. He says it is too soon to say what changes he might make at Industrial Power Group, although he will be looking to see whether he could help introduce more world class processes. The decision to leave Northern Electric was very difficult to make, he says, but his new post is a great opportunity to join a major manufacturer and exporter as a board member. He will take up his new position in the next few months.</p>

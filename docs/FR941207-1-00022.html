			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The States of Arizona, Utah, and Colorado list the Mexican spotted owl as a threatened species. Capture, handling, transportation, and take of Mexican spotted owls are regulated by game laws and special licenses for live wildlife. These State laws and licensing requirements regulate hunting, recreation, and scientific investigation. Habitat protection is not provided through State laws and regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service is aware of Mexican spotted owl protection guidelines that have been developed by two Indian nations. The guidelines for the Mescalero Apache Reservation establish a 29 ha (72 acre) buffer zone around active Mexican spotted owl roost or nest sites. No management activities may occur within the buffer zone during the reproductive season. After the reproductive season, the buffer is reduced to a 46-meter (150-foot) radius encompassing 0.66 ha (1.6 acres) around significant roost areas and a 61-meter (200-foot) radius encompassing 1.17 ha (2.9 acres) around nests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Fort Apache Indian Reservation is managed under a conservation plan approved by the Tribal Council. This plan designates two levels of owl protection. The first level protects clusters of owls and their intervening habitat, and the second level focuses on individual owl sites. This management strategy is largely based on a landscape rather than site-by-site approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most Federal agencies have policies to protect State-listed threatened or endangered species, and some agencies also protect species that are candidates for Federal listing. For instance, the NPS Organic Act protects all wildlife on national parks and monuments. However, general policies often do not include standards and guidelines to measure policy success.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to listing, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) provided the only Federal protection for the Mexican spotted owl. Under the provisions of the MBTA, it is unlawful to pursue, hunt, take, capture, or kill in any manner any migratory bird unless permitted by regulations. Although the Mexican spotted owl typically remains in its summer range throughout the year, it is included on the list of birds protected under the MBTA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An interagency agreement for purpose of ensuring population viability of the spotted owl ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Strix occidentalis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), including the Mexican spotted owl, was signed by the Service, BLM, NPS, and Forest Service on August 12, 1988 (U.S. Department of Interior 1988). Under this agreement, each agency agreed to manage its lands to provide owl habitat, to carry out habitat and population inventories sufficient to assess long-term trends, and to carry out research activities sufficient to provide empirical information on the validity of planning assumptions. The degree to which this agreement has been implemented has varied within and among agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific management policies for the Mexican spotted owl have been developed by the BLM in Colorado and New Mexico. The policy in Colorado states, ``In areas with a confirmed nest or roost site, surface management activities will be limited and will be determined on a case by case basis to allow as much flexibility as possible outside of the core area.'' Management policy in New Mexico states that habitat core areas and territories of appropriate size will be established and preserved wherever Mexican spotted owls are found.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Detailed guidelines for Mexican spotted owl management have been developed by the Forest Service Southwest Region. The guidelines were first issued as Mexican spotted owl Interim Directive (ID) No. 1 in June 1989, and reissued as Mexican spotted owl ID No. 2 in June 1990. Utah and Colorado national forests adopted ID No. 2 in 1991. The guidelines expired December 26, 1991, but the Forest Service is continuing to manage under ID No. 2. The IDs require establishment of a Mexican spotted owl MT around each nest or roost site. Each MT (except those on the Gila and Lincoln National Forests) has a core area of 182 ha (450 acres) and an overall size of 810 ha (2,000 acres). Activities within the core area are limited to road construction. Within the MT, activities, including timber harvest, are limited to a maximum of 314 ha (775 acres). The intent of the guidelines is to retain at least 405 ha (1,000 acres) of suitable habitat within the MT after proposed management activities are identified and located. Forest Service estimates indicate that suitable habitat within MTs currently averages 466 ha (1,150 acres) for territories in New Mexico and Arizona. In Utah, MTs encompass 1,340 ha (3,350 acres) with a core of 350 ha (875 acres) (K. Grandison, pers. comm., 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Application of the IDs has not been uniform on all forests. Guidelines on two forests were modified. The core area was reduced in size to 121 ha (300 acres) for the Lincoln National Forest under ID No. 1. Under ID No. 2, a core area of 182 ha (450 acres) was established for all forests but the overall territory size was reduced to 607 ha (1,500 acres) for the Lincoln and Gila National Forests. Both forests have significant Mexican spotted owl populations, which has resulted in conflicts with timber harvest plans. The ID provides no protection for unoccupied suitable Mexican spotted owl habitat, nor does it address forest activities not related to timber harvest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

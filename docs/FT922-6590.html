			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / SEC suggests share change rule FOREIGN investment companies could find it considerably easier to sell their shares in the US under a rule change being considered by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities industry watchdog. In a report yesterday, the SEC's investment management division proposed that some foreign funds should be allowed to offer their shares in the US without having to register with the SEC. In theory, this could cover the likes of British investment trust shares or unit trusts. However, the staff report suggested that these foreign funds would need to demonstrate that regulation in their home country provided a level of investor protection which was 'substantially equivalent' to that provided by the SEC. It also called for attempts to establish 'reciprocity', so that US funds would have access to foreign markets. The recommendation comes as part of a review of the 1940 Investment Company Act, which covers investment management regulation in the US. The SEC has been considering revisions to the rules for the past two years. The report also recommends deregulating sales charges for mutual funds in the US; allowing funds to redeem shares at specific intervals; and exempting from SEC registration funds that are limited to sophisticated investors. In the past, foreign funds have found it difficult to offer shares in the US, without effectively becoming US investment companies. No foreign investment company has registered in the US since 1973. Some of recommendations - including the sale of non-US mutual funds in the US - would require legislative changes. One US lawyer said yesterday that an earlier proposal to allow non-US mutual funds to sell products in the US failed to get through the legislature in 1984. The proposed changes were broadly welcomed by the Investment Company Institute. However, on the issue of 'increased internationalisation', it warned that the proposed legislative changes 'might not provide sufficient protection for US investors investing in foreign funds or effective market access for US funds seeking to offer their shares abroad'.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: It all depends on sterling FT-SE Index: 2,536.7 (-4.9) This column began the year on a bearish tack, suggesting that in the opening months at least the investor would be better off in cash than in UK equities. Given the cheerful mood in the markets this week, the position deserves examination. Since the turn of the year, the FT-SE is up 44 points, or 1.7 per cent. The Dow is up by nearer 3 per cent. Since the US recovery, though not in the least detectable, is now at least feasible, Wall Street may be on to something. The UK's position is more problematic. In the past week, three things have happened to encourage the UK investor. Labour has stumbled over the issue of taxation, the big building societies have cut their mortgage rates and sterling has strengthened against the D-Mark. None of these is exactly conclusive. Labour's reverse should be set in the context of a campaign which still has months to run. The building societies' action could be interpreted either as a forecast of lower interest rates or as a desperate attempt to stimulate trade. And above all, although sterling has been helped by the strength of the dollar, it is still very nearly as low against the D-Mark as at any time since joining the ERM. At yesterday's close of DM2.855, it is 7.7 pfennigs above its absolute D-Mark floor. Given that it has shown itself capable of falling by 4.7 pfennigs in a single day within the last year, that is not much of a cushion. The money market, as the chart shows, has lately abandoned thoughts of a base rate rise. But as the chart also shows, the market has been wrong before: last March, for example. Sterling is not out of the woods yet; and at any serious hint of higher rates, the other bullish factors would go out of the window. Granted all that, there has been a genuine note of optimism about UK equities this week, particularly in the move out of overvalued defensive stocks and into cyclicals and high-yielders. Any market which can push Glaxo down by 8.7 per cent in a week and ICI up by 7.5 per cent believes it has scented real recovery. All the same, cash looks the safer bet for a little while yet.</p>

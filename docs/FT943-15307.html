			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Arts: Caribbean rhythm and blues - A bittersweet myth of love and innocence From Broadway to Birmingham Rep: Once On This Island has opened in the Second City after a year and a half on the Great White Way, following modest off-Broadway beginnings. A bittersweet myth that recounts in Caribbean rhythms and melody the ill-fated love of a peasant girl for one of the mulatto haut monde and how she changes, like Daphne, into a tree that shelters him throughout his life until one day they are reunited. Despite informative, one might say didactic, programme notes on colonialism and slavery, the piece's charm lies in its innocence and apparent absence of preaching. The plot unfolds as a story told to soothe a frightened child in a thunderstorm, the tale of a girl so happy that the gods decide to 'knock some sense in her head'. The all-black cast moves from supernatural to earthy, from historical to modern (the young dude wears a sharp suit, the accident by a pair of headlights; but his father sports an ancien regime cravat and waistcoat). In the production by David Toguri (choreographer) and Gwenda Hughes, ten adults and one child make up a company of markedly individual talents including such established West End and recording favourites as Shezwae Powell and PP Arnold, not to mention Clive Rowe, Mr Snow in the National's Carousel. The result is totally infectious. Lynn Ahrens (book and lyrics) and Stephen Flaherty (music) have kept the show to 90 minutes, without interval, with scarcely any spoken dialogue. The score is mainstream rather than rock, in the tripping syncopations and wistful melodic line of the Afro-Caribbean with a strong French flavour. Poignant waltzes evoke the old Gallic influences, both in a brisk post-Toussaint L'Ouverture history lesson and the society ball where little Ti Moune learns that her beloved is engaged to someone else. A vein of sombre lyricism in the more introspective ballads steers well clear of sentimentality or Lloyd Webbery. The show is something of a triumph for Lorna Brown as Ti Moune, who declares of her creole lover that 'his ancestor once loved a peasant girl; this time he will marry one'. She sets off in search of the impossible on the steep winding ramp of Kendra Ullyart's revolving set, flanked with palms and shanty porches. Alas, this is no road to Oz, merely the other side of the island where she can be a mistress but never a wife. Brown looks 14, has a terrifyingly vulnerable air of wide-eyed wonder and a radiant, heart-touching smile, and can belt out a song with the assurance of someone twice her age. The same careful casting has gone into the rest of the ensemble, whether as trees, frogs, birds, malicious gossips or all-powerful deities - Rowe hisses out a malevolent incitement to murder as a snake-hatted god of death. The magnificently baritonal Sharon D Clark socks a number called 'Mama will provide' to us, resembling a cross between Jessye Norman and Carmen Miranda. Suzanne Packer brings incisive style to the socially acceptable fiancee. Great fun; very touching; only the jinx that traditionally hangs over interval-less shows makes me concerned for its possible West End career.</p>

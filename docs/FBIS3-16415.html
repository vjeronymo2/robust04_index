In an interview with Interfax, he said Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin was also involved in discussion about delays in  adopting this year's budget. Rybkin said although the budget  bill should have been discussed by the Duma in January, the  government would table it only next week. "This means the Duma  will be unable to approve a budget for the second quarter of  this year", he said.    Rybkin said that three possible options of adopting the  budget were discussed. One is a special law. Next, the  suspension of some articles of the law on emergency measures.  And finally, to go on as usual, in which case, he said "we will  need at least two or three months to approve the budget which  means a repeat of the situation of 1992-1993 when Russia had to  survive without a budget".    However, Rybkin declined to say which of the three options  was best. "Sometimes it seems that a short cut is the best  solution. I do not know if that is true. The issue will come  under discussion by the Duma Council today", he said.</p>

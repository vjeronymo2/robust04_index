			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Kiev Ukrayinske Radio First Program in  Ukrainian at 1305 GMT on 14 February carries the live call-in  program "Independence" attended by Supreme Council Chairman Ivan  Plyushch. The program is moderated by Vadym Zadorozhnyy.    At the beginning of the program, Plyushch is asked who is to  blame for the current economic crisis in Ukraine. Plyushch  responds that the reason for the economic plight of Ukraine, as  well as other republics of the former Soviet Union, is the  irrational structure of the production sector: In Ukraine,  about 70 percent of the labor force is employed in the  production of the means of production, while only 30 percent is  involved in consumer production. During 70 years of Soviet  rule, he continues, Ukraine was a supplier of coal from Donbass  and iron from Krivbass for Warsaw Pact countries, while now  Ukraine "has been left alone" not only with the problems of  Donbass and Krivbass, but also with the consequences of the  Chernobyl disaster and a large military-industrial complex.  Plyushch states that these three factors account for over  one-third of Ukraine's budget expenditures. However, he  emphasizes that these expenditures must be made because there  are 1.2 million miners employed in Donbass and "hundreds of  thousands" of workers in Krivbass. As for the  military-industrial complex, the Supreme Council chairman says:  "We do not need such a big Army. However, what are we to do  with those people tomorrow? We started with an Army of 1  million men, now we have reduced that number to 500,000. As a  result, budget allocations to pensioned soldiers are much bigger  than those for regular servicemen."    Asked to name specific measures for overcoming the country's  economic crisis, Plyushch states that the Ukrainian people  should cardinally change production relations and implement  reforms so as to "make a worker master of his own labor."    Commenting on the activity of the Supreme Council, Plyushch  states that the Ukrainian parliament has done a lot to build up  Ukrainian statehood, but contributed little to the  implementation of economic reform.    Asking a question concerning a possible split of the Crimea  from Ukraine following the recent presidential elections on the  peninsula, Plyushch states that Ukraine's territorial integrity  is assured by "all our documents," and Ukraine "will never back  down" in this regard. The Supreme Council chairman goes on to  emphasize that there are no countries which would encroach upon  Ukraine's territorial integrity. He reminds listeners that the  Moscow trilateral declaration by Presidents Clinton, Yeltsin,  and Kravchuk provides for noninterference in internal matters  and asserts that all the sides will cooperate in securing the  territorial integrity of their countries.    Commenting on the remark that the Ukrainian parliament has  done little to support the use of the Ukrainian language on all  levels of state life, Plyushch says that the process of  introducing the Ukrainian language require a great amount of  time and money. As of today, Plyushch claims, Ukraine is not  able to publish a sufficient amount of Ukrainian textbooks and  train a sufficient number of teachers of Ukrainian language.    Asked to explain the "associated membership" of Ukraine in  the CIS economic union and cite concrete results of Ukraine's  participation in this union, Plyushch states that these  questions should be addressed to the government. He also says:  "We have already concluded over 400 various agreements within  the CIS framework, but none of them is working. Is there any  need for such a union?" He states that cooperation between CIS  countries is necessary, but it should be accomplished on the  level of "permanent commissions and committees." Cooperation on  the level of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly is assessed by  him as "pulling one another's leg."    At the end of the program, Supreme Council Chairman Plyushch  is asked to comment on the balance between legislative and  executive power in Ukraine. He states that Ukraine had been  living too long under unified authoritarian rule, both in  czarist and Soviet times. Therefore, he adds, Ukraine needs a  redistribution of power between the legislative, executive, and  judicial branches. He admits that the distribution of power  between legislative and executive bodies has not been  accomplished "very well."</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> PUBLIC FORUM IS PLANNED BY BUILDER  </P> <P> An Anaheim developer who lost a 10-year battle to build a shopping center in  Ojai is hosting a public forum Monday to pitch his latest proposal.  </P> <P> Howard M. Palmer of Ojai Investments Ltd. says he will donate 11.6 acres west  of Nordhoff High School to the city of Ojai if it will approve a 26-lot  subdivision.  </P> <P> The front portion of the 30-acre parcel along Maricopa Highway could be kept  natural or used for a community park, auditorium, recreation center with  swimming pool or large day-care center, Palmer said.  </P> <P> "We will even help capitalize any construction," he said.  </P> <P> The benefits of a park on the west side of town could help offset the  subdivision's traffic impacts, he said.  </P> <P> "The city leaders seem enthused about the idea," Palmer said.  </P> <P> "The Ventura YMCA has expressed interest in operating a center there and about  30% of their users come from Ojai."  </P> <P> City Manager Andy Belknap described himself as more interested than  enthusiastic.  </P> <P> "Like any other project, it will have to go through a screening process to see  if it will work," he said.  </P> <P> Palmer's earlier attempts to develop the site, including a 1986 plan to donate  three acres to a church and build 114 houses with prices of under $100,000, met  with strong community opposition.  </P> <P> His shopping center saga began in 1980 and ended in April after a seven-year  court battle, a 10-day trial and two appellate court rulings.  </P> <P> He had sued the city for $6 million in damages, claiming it delayed his  application. The city eventually was told it did not have to approve the  shopping center.  </P> <P> Now, Palmer said he doesn't want to build any houses or supermarkets. The  mostly half-acre home sites would sell to future builders for about $225,000.  </P> <P> Palmer has advertised Monday's forum, sent letters to 50 nearby property owners  and invited about 30 community leaders.  </P> <P> The meeting will be at 7 p.m. in the Nordhoff High School cafeteria, 1401  Maricopa Highway.

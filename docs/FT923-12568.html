			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Jones Stroud shows rise to Pounds 4.83m PRE-TAX profits of Jones Stroud (Holdings), the manufacturer of accessories and materials for the textiles and electrical industries, advanced by Pounds 341,000 to Pounds 4.83m in the year to March 31. The outcome was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 60.4m to Pounds 65.4m and after a net interest charge of Pounds 147,000 (Pounds 23,000) and exceptional costs of Pounds 609,000 arising from factory closures. Directors said the reorganisation necessitated by the continuing recession had been completed and further factory closures were not expected. There were few signs of any improvement in trading conditions, they added, but action to contain costs should enable profits to be maintained at current levels. The final dividend is again 5p, maintaining the total at 8p, more than twice covered by earnings per share of 18.05p (16.42p).</p>

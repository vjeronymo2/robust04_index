			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial by Mahmud Farshidi] </F>   [Text] Unfortunately, in an unprecedented move on the  pretext of answering the report from the Inquiry Group, the  Voice and Vision organization made political accusations against  the Majles deputies, comparing them to the hypocrite and  Hojjatieh minigroups.    Of course these accusations will be studied and pursued in  due course by the appropriate authorities. The rights of the  Majles deputies must be defended, and they have the same right  as any citizen of the Islamic Republic to express their views on  current national affairs, so that, God forbid, conditions will  not develop where anyone will dare to say that any kind of  opposition to him is equivalent to opposition to the Imam (peace  be upon him) and that his opponents are aligned with America and  Israel.    Of course in the recent past certain people also tried,  under  cover of Imam Khomeyni's (peace be upon him) oppression, to  divert his path and to oppose the vice-regency of the chief  jurisconsult, and they were unable to do so!    Apart from the insults, so far the Voice and Vision  organization has not answered concerning the measures it plans  to take to prevent the repeat of at least four instances which  led to memos from the exalted leader.    So far the management of the Voice and Vision organization  has given no answer concerning what it has done, more than four  years later, to implement the exalted leader's clear order to  prepare a Voice and Vision organization administration bill. His  Holiness gave this order in writing when he appointed Mr.  Mohammad Hashemi chief of the Voice and Vision organization on  6/2/1368 [24 August 1989].    "It is required that a bill on the Voice and Vision  organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran Administration Law  be prepared and submitted to the government and the Majles  quickly for passage through the approval process." According to  the research and investigation report, so far that has not been  done.    In the research and investigation report numerous instances  are cited of the Voice and Vision organization management's  inattention to the organization's charter, and at least eleven  instances of violations of the law are given.    A quick review of the contents of the research and  investigation report reinforces the belief in the reader that  the management of the Voice and Vision organization seems to  think that the organization's independence means their personal  control of the organization, that they think themselves above  all the competent bodies in the government, and that they see no  reason to honor the rights of the other bodies in the Islamic  Republic of Iran. It is perhaps this kind of thinking that  justifies his manner of dealing with the Majles.    Perhaps it was the result of this kind of thinking that made  the National Investigation organization wonder about the Voice  and Vision organization management's failure to follow up with  judicial authorities on the case of the collapse of the  satellite building.    Perhaps it was the result of this kind of thinking that  prompted the Policy Council appointed by the exalted leader to  protest because the measures approved by the council were not  announced to the pertinent units, and consequently were not  enforced. Why doesn't the executive director give reports to the  council every two months, as required by law?    Perhaps it is the result of this kind of thinking that  caused  the organization's security chief to be appointed without the  cooperation and approval of the Ministry of Intelligence.  Perhaps it is because of this kind of thinking that personnel  violations are not collected and a report on them is not given  to the Ministry of Intelligence.    The natural result of such dealings is the suffering,  expulsion, and isolation of Hezbollah forces, the clearest  manifestation of which is the basijis in the Victory Tradition  Group.    Under such circumstances naturally the remnants of the  former  regime in the organization are present and powerful enough that  they are able to keep files on the Hezbollah forces for the  crime of protesting their performance. An individual who  resigned and was arrested because of relations with deviators  was even appointed manager of the Voice and Vision organization  in one of the provinces!    With things like this going on in the Voice and Vision  organization, it is natural that there is little room there for  the growth and authority of 100-percent committed forces in the  critical Voice and Vision organization.    It is certain that a careful follow-up on the report from  the  Majles Inquiry and Investigation Group by the competent  authorities, without any kind of public controversy, will  prevent some people from being deluded by the idea that dealing  with individuals is to be done according to their official  connections and not according to what they have done!</p>

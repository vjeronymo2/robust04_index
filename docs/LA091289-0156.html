			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> U.S. EXTENDS SUGAR IMPORT QUOTA  </P> <P> Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter announced today a nine-month extension  of the current sugar import quota year and an increase of about 860,000 tons in  the amount of foreign sugar that can be imported.  </P> <P> Import quotas are used to protect domestic producers from cheaper foreign sugar  being dumped on the U.S. market.  </P> <P> The original 1989 quota year began Jan. 1 and was to have ended Dec. 31. The  extension lets the quota year run through Sept. 30, 1990.  </P> <P> Yeutter said the change in the quota was "an action independent" of a ruling  earlier this year by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that the U.S.  sugar import quotas are in violation of international trading rules.  </P></p>

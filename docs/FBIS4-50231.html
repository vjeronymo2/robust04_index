			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Legislative Councillor Christine Loh: </F> "Blinkered Visions"]    [Text] Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, told a business audience last week: "There are  those who believe that only when China turns capitalist that  Hong Kong's capitalism can be guaranteed. This is an entirely  wrong concept." With this, I agree.    However, Lu's reasoning is incorrect. Hong Kong people want  to practise capitalism and much more. We also want to enjoy a  system of representative government, human rights and the rule  of law. It is precisely because China has an authoritarian  government and low respect for human rights, and because it  practises rule by man, that people believe that only when the  Chinese government becomes less repressive and more democratic  will Hong Kong's lifestyle and freedoms be guaranteed.    In limiting Hong Kong's desires to capitalism, Lu  misunderstands the territory. Chinese leaders may believe that  making money is all Hong Kong people care about and that it is,  therefore, their reason for wanting to retain the economic  system beyond 1997. But the leaders are wrong. The "one  country, two systems" concept also means our social, cultural  and developing political systems.    Lu said on May 6 there would always be a "handful" who  thought they could "turn Hong Kong into a political city in  order to influence the mainland in the sense of politics". He  warned that Hong Kong would then be of "negative value" to  China. On May 8, Lu clarified that statement to pro-China trade  unionists, saying Hong Kong should not become a base to convert  China to democracy.    Socialism and democracy are, after all, not mutually  exclusive, but Chinese leaders are accustomed to authoritarian  rule. The director really meant that China is hostile to  democracy in Hong Kong because it fears that democracy might  spread. Because of this fear, Beijing sees attitudes towards  democracy in Hong Kong as the dividing line between its friends  and supposed enemies. Those who are outspoken in their support  of democracy have already, in effect, been warned that they will  not he allowed to hold any political office after 1997. They  are accused of being unpatriotic, even subversive.    And perhaps the issue of human rights is also becoming a  measure of loyalty to the motherland. Human rights serve to  define the relationship between the government and the governed,  and to limit the powers of the state over the individual.  Individual rights are dangerous to Beijing because they promote  values which make Hong Kong the "political city" that Chinese  leaders fear. For example, Beijing must find irksome the  continued support for the release of the Ming Pao reporter, Xi  Yang, who was jailed for 12 years for allegedly stealing state  banking secrets.    No doubt China's leaders are also beginning to find  threatening the continued call for a human rights commission in  Hong Kong. Lu said such a body would contravene the Basic Law  because it was not set out in the future mini-constitution.  Perhaps he conveniently forgot that "other special courts" can  be established. Perhaps a rent tribunal might be more  acceptable than a human rights version.    Lu disputes that Hong Kong people even care about politics.  He says that if you ask anyone in the street about their  primary concern, 90 per cent will say their livelihoods. But  the director misses the point. Concerns for housing, welfare,  education, the environment, corruption, law and order, and even  equality of the sexes are highly political issues.    The formulation and implementation of public policy in Hong  Kong is as much about the process as it is about the end  product. People expect to be consulted each step of the way,  and they expect important issues to be publicly debated. Hong  Kong people demanded that the policy-making process should  become more open. Now, they have also insisted on being given  enough information to be able to assess policies and to hold the  executive accountable.    It is against this background that Hong Kong wants a more  representative system of government. And it is this development  that makes Hong Kong a vibrant political city. This is not the  work of a "handful" of people, but of all residents of Hong Kong.    Lu failed to win the hearts and minds of Hong Kong because  Beijing does not want to deal with all these views. China's  united-front strategy cannot cope with opposing views. Until  this changes, Beijing will continue to pretend that only a  "handful" have different ideas about how "one country, two  systems" should work.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE HISPANIC/LATINO DEBATE: THE LANGUAGE IS STILL SEARCHING FOR A TERM THAT  SATISFIES EVERYONE  </P> <P> The word Latino in Spanish means Latin. Latins were a people who lived on the  outskirts of Rome in ancient times.  </P> <P> They eventually came to dominate Rome and as a result spread their language and  culture throughout the empire. This is why a Latino is a Spaniard, a  Portuguese, an Italian, a French person, a Romanian and, if you wish, a Latin  American.  </P> <P> How does the word Latino say you have Indian blood or black blood in you? It  denies it as much as the word Hispanic does!  </P> <P> As for myself, you can classify me as a Mexican, or Chicano, but call me a  Latino only if you are referring to all Latins.  </P> <P> ROBERT SALDIVAR  </P> <P> Pacoima  </P></p>

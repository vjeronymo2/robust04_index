			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates firmer CASH rates in the sterling money market ended slightly firmer yesterday as traders realised that the Bank of England would not be repeating Friday's decision to trim its dealing rates for longer dated bills. There was initial speculation in the market that the Bank would reduce the rates at which it deals in Bands 3 and 4 by  1/32 per cent, gradually signalling a base rate cut. The authorities had used a similar ploy in May to signal the  1/2 per cent cut to 10 per cent. However, the Bank did not invite any offers for longer dated bills yesterday, dealing only in Bands 1 and 2 at the established rate of 9 7/8 per cent, and carrying out repurchase agreements (repos) also at the established rate of 9 15/16 per cent. At least one discount house trader suggested that the Bank had originally set out to signal a cut in rates on Friday, and that it still intends to do so in the not-too-distant future. 'I find it hard to believe that Friday's operation was purely technical,' he said. 'It came the day after the Fed's half per cent cut, which made the Bank of England's cut all the more price sensitive.' If this interpretation is correct, two factors may have forced the Bank to stay its hand. One was the Bank of Italy's decision at the weekend to raise its discount rate by a full percentage point to 13 per cent. The other would have been sterling's weak position at the bottom of the EMS grid. Rates therefore ended the day firmer across the board. 3-month money closed at 9 15/16 per cent from 9 13/16 per cent on Friday night and 6-month money was up at 9 7/8 per cent from 9 13/16 per cent. One trader suggested that the clearing banks deliberately wanted to keep money tight yesterday, having issued a lot of money into the market on Friday on expectation of a base rate cut. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.25bn. In the morning, it purchased Pounds 34m of Band 1 bank bills, and Pounds 200m in repos for resale on 29 July. The Bank then purchased another Pounds 349m in repos. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 198m of Band 1 bank bills and Pounds 199m in Band 2. It provided late assistance of Pounds 45m. Sterling futures dipped sharply as news filtered through that the Bank was not signalling a rate cut. After opening at 90.34, the September contract dipped to a low of 90.24, closing at 90.25.</p>

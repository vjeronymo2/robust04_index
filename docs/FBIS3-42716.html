			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> ["Statement of the Press Office of the President of the </F> Azerbaijan Republic"]    [Text] Opposition newspapers have recently mounted a  wide-ranging campaign of slander, tittle-tattle, and insults,  publishing material full of unsubstantiated accusations.  Ignoring or observing with reluctance the principles of  democracy and violating legal and ethic standards in every  possible way, the opposition newspapers are by their mendacious  and trashy articles engendering among people a decadent mood and  seriously damaging the on-going work on the organization of  military mobilization.    One of these newspapers--525TH GAZETA--which, divorced from  reality completely, aims at sowing panic and fear among the  populace and forcing people living in the border areas to  abandon their homes. In the 20 November issue 525TH GAZETA  writes: "The fate of the other districts awaits Agdzhabedinskiy,  Terterskiy, Bardinskiy, Beylyaganskiy, Gyandzhinskiy,  Khanlarskiy, Gazakhskiy, and Tovuzskiy Rayons." The newspaper  goes on to report some mass exterminations, appalling dangers,  earthquakes, and unknown diseases that will come crashing down  on people.    The intentions of 525TH GAZETA, which fills the pages of the  publication with rumors and information totally unsupported by  any facts, are clear. Could there be a greater provocation in a  country with more than a million refugees, in a country with  devastated cities and villages? What name can we give attempts  to incite people to leave their homes and make them refugees?  Could there be any greater treachery?    It is well known what forces are behind 525TH GAZETA, which  is filling its pages with rumors and giving itself over to  verbal rhetoric, in the race for a sensation sacrificing such  eternal concepts as "Motherland" and "Land." In order to seize  power these forces are espousing the ugliest propaganda methods.    At a meeting with leaders of political parties Geydar  Aliyev,  president of the Azerbaijan Republic, publicly exposed the dirty  intentions of the opposition papers and called on them to embark  on the path of truth. In order to conduct a decisive struggle  against the aggressor and to restore our land, which is under  the heel of the enemy, G.A. Aliyev declared, the news media  should regard it as their main task to support and bolster the  fighting spirit of the people, who have risen to the defense of  their land. Everyone should now be serving this main goal and  calling on the people by intelligent and truthful words for  unity.    The Press Office of the President of the Azerbaijan Republic  expresses an emphatic protest against all publications of a  provocative nature carried in the opposition newspapers,  including 525TH GAZETA.</p>

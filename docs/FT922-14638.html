			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (1): Capital tap turned on - In two years, the financial centres of the world have changed their view of Latin American countries. This has been brought about by economic and political reform as well as a restructuring of bank debt / Examining the prospects for investment in the region THE view of Latin America from the skyscrapers of Wall Street and the City of London has undergone a sea change in only two years. More critically, so have the perceptions of the region's own investors. Inflows of private capital into the region trebled in 1991, according to estimates from Salomon Brothers. An estimated Dollars 40bn flooded in last year, compared with Dollars 13.4bn in 1990 and only Dollars 5bn in 1989. Most of that money flowed into the four biggest economies; 40 per cent of it into Mexico alone. Mexico received Dollars 16.1bn, Venezuela Dollars 4.8bn, Brazil Dollars 11.6bn, Argentina Dollars 5.1bn and Chile Dollars 1.7bn. Much of the influx represents decisions not of foreign investors but of Latin American residents bringing home flight capital sent abroad in the 1970s and 1980s. It is no less significant for that. Some of the incoming money is undoubtedly volatile: parked in high-yielding bank deposits. Nonetheless, an important proportion is more permanent: of the Dollars 15.7bn of new borrowing last year, Dollars 8.5bn was in the form of medium-term debt, and Dollars 2.3bn in term bank lending. Portfolio investment totalled Dollars 6.4bn and direct foreign investment Dollars 10.4bn, Dollars 3.5bn of which directly resulted from privatisation. There is evidence that the scope of the inflows is broadening: governments from economies as diverse as Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru are facing problems neutralising the impact of incoming capital on their money supplies and inflation rates. For many governments, it is the kind of problem they prefer. 'It's better to have a problem with capital inflows than the opposite,' says Mr Andres Bianchi, who recently stepped down as president of Chile's central bank. The flows have been brought about by a confluence of internal and external factors. Falling interest rates, particularly in the US, have reduced the appeal of holding dollars in bank accounts; recession in the first world has dented returns on investments in rich countries. For many investors - private, corporate or institutional - squeezing good returns out of their traditional markets has been tough. That contrasts with their recent experience in Latin America. The region's main stock markets yielded returns of between 48 and 400 per cent last year. In countries such as Argentina and Mexico, investment risk has been reduced by exchange rate policies which fix parities against the dollar or offer more or less certain rates of currency depreciation. This has encouraged inflows to take advantage of high domestic interest rates that are a consequence of the tight monetary policies in many countries. The Brady initiative, launched three years ago amid heavy criticism, has provided a framework for the easing of bank debt burdens for the most heavily indebted countries in the region. In the case of Mexico - which triggered the debt crisis 10 years ago by announcing it could not meet its scheduled payments to banks - it provided only a modest reduction in debt servicing burdens but allowed the injection into the economy of a large dose of confidence, a commodity long in short supply. The predictions that debt forgiveness by banks would close access to new foreign finance have been rapidly belied by the Mexico accord. It has also paved the way for bank debt restructuring agreements with Brazil and Argentina, for both of which outline accords could be in place at any time. None of this would have occurred without the big shifts that have already taken place in economic policy across the region. This has brought government budgets under control in many countries, and has started to lift the burden of inefficient state enterprise from the backs of taxpayers. Privatisation is going ahead apace as the chart in this survey demonstrates. Controls on capital movements have been lifted. Following the Chilean example, private pension funds are being established and encouraged to strengthen the institutional structure of the region's financial markets. The prospect is for more stable, less interventionist economic management than has been typical in the region. At the same time, governments have transformed their external trade regimes. Most no longer see any future in the closed, protected economic regimes which predominated in Latin America for half a century. Free trade is seen as a way of promoting economic efficiency and bearing down on inflation. Governments have moved to negotiate bilateral free trade agreements and to create free trade areas and customs unions, such as Mercosur, covering the countries of the southern cone, and the revived Andean Pact. The Bush administration in the US - liberated from the ideological baggage of the cold war - has signed with 16 Latin American governments framework accords: the first step towards free trade agreements. President Bush has spoken of a free trade area from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. All the agreements await the signing of a landmark accord with Mexico and Canada, which now looks unlikely to be settled until 1993. Such developments open up the possibility of a big expansion in trade within the region. Inter-regional trade now accounts for only 4 per cent of the western hemisphere's gross domestic product, according to the InterAmerican Development Bank, compared with 14 per cent for the European Community, and 17 per cent for the Pacific Basin countries, excluding China. These developments also are likely to presage a broad corporate restructuring across the region. Companies in Latin America are beginning to look across borders in a way that made no sense before trade barriers began to be dismantled. Similarly, companies from outside the region are beginning to seek acquisitions of Latin American companies, particularly those in Mexico. This impression was reinforced this month by the acquisition by Cadbury Schweppes of the UK of the Mexican bottler and mineral water company, Aguas Minerales. Mr Thomas Keesee, responsible for Latin American business for First Boston in New York, says mergers and acquisition business in Mexico has grown every year since 1988. Then, seven transactions were completed worth a total Dollars 1.1bn; in 1989, this grew to 15 and Dollars 2.2bn, and in 1990 to 29 transactions worth Dollars 5.1bn. Last year, the number of deals fell to 22, but their value jumped to Dollars 14.5bn. The pattern could be repeated throughout the region. 'If you look through the top 500 companies in Latin America, you will see that many are parts of conglomerates, which make sense in a closed economy and when you are protected from outside competition. In an integrated market - as we have seen in Europe - there is tremendous potential for restructuring conglomerates,' he said. Mr Mark Coombs, head of ANZ's international merchant bank, said he has at least one corporate client in the southern cone 'aggressively seeking acquisitions in Argentina and Brazil'. Profitable mergers and acquisition work, new finance in the bond and equity markets, privatisations, rising stock markets, falling interest rates; all these make for an investment bankers' paradise. Small wonder that the hotel lobbies from Caracas to Buenos Aires, from Mexico City to Santiago are more packed with visiting bankers than they have been since the bad old 1970s. Small wonder, too, that worries have surfaced over whether their enthusiasm for Latin America represents a replay of the nightmare of the debt crisis. The attempted February 4 coup in Venezuela has shown that democracy, while admittedly imperfect, is not everywhere secure. Neither is economic reform: Brazil, for example, has yet to provide evidence that its fiscal position is under control; Argentina's reform programme still has far to go; Mexico's current account deficit is rising, some believe, dangerously fast. External events - a collapse in oil prices, a failure of the Uruguay round trade talks - may take their toll. The region's markets are thin and prone to overshoot in potentially devastating fashion. There remain big risks for investors in Latin America. For now, many investors believe that they are more than compensated for them by the expected returns on their investments. Provided the inflows are soundly based, as they seem to have been up to now, this can only be good news for a region starved of capital for almost a decade.</p>

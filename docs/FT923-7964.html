			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Hanson reports 21.2% fall pre-tax after nine months HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, yesterday reported a 21.2 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the nine months to June 30 as the economic climate affected both sides of the Atlantic. The fall in profits, from Pounds 967m to Pounds 762m, was exacerbated by the weakness of the US dollar and the absence of any natural resources disposals. Last year's profits were boosted by Pounds 127m from the sale of Newmont Mining, which was swapped for Cavenham Forest Industries. This year's sales of British Ever Ready and the 2.8 per cent stake in Imperial Chemical Industries were taken below the line and extraordinary income was Pounds 144m against Pounds 23m last time. After adjusting for the sale of these businesses, turnover increased from Pounds 5.82bn to Pounds 6.11bn. Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said: 'After adjusting for the different exchange rate (which boosted last year's profits by Pounds 41m) and last year's natural resources profit, this year's pre-tax profit decreased by only 5 per cent.' This year's profits continued to be boosted by acquisition benefits. These included a full seven months' contribution from Beazer, the US construction business, and a nine months' contribution from Cavenham. Earlier in the day Hanson announced that discussions with parties in the Canary Wharf project had ended. Hanson's shares rose 2 1/2 p to close at 195 1/2 p. Mr Mark Cusack, conglomerates analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'The fact that Hanson looked at Canary Wharf and rejected it is no surprise. Mr Bonham had a realistic view that market reaction would have been cynical and sceptical if it had bought Canary Wharf.' Hanson is to concentrate on building its core businesses, through acquisitions and growth, and is planning to sell some smaller companies on both sides of the Atlantic. While the group found no tangible evidence of a recovery in the UK it said economic conditions in the US were improving slowly. Lord Hanson believes that the delayed recovery in the UK will mean that many of the companies which just managed to survive last year are now in worse trouble and may be forced to turn to a big company such as Hanson for help. In the three months to June 30 pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 379m to Pounds 274m on sales of Pounds 1.88bn (against Pounds 1.89bn). Fully diluted earnings per share for the three months to June 30 were 4.6p, down from 6p. Net debt fell from Pounds 1.6bn to Pounds 1.1bn and is expected to fall to below Pounds 800m by the year-end. The second quarterly dividend was unchanged at 2.75p. Lex, Page 12</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Technology: Spinning a yarn to its limit - How synthetic microfibres produce fabric that is stronger and finer than silk In KaDeWe, Berlin's largest department store, there is a coat for sale that looks both classically trench and stylishly Scandinavian. Its lining is beaverskin and the price tag is DM 3,750 (Pounds 1,300). But while the inside of the coat is merely expensive, the outside is revolutionary. It glows like silk and feels like the bloom of a peach. The cloth is made of polyester microfibres, the filaments of which are finer than silk. There are some in the textile industry who believe, or at least hope, that microfibre fabrics will eclipse Du Pont's Lycra as the hottest new material in popular clothing. Lycra has graduated from womens' hosiery to professional and fashion sportswear, as exemplified by cycling shorts. Now microfibres are following a similar route. Once limited to blends with wool and cotton, their combination of toughness and softness has put them into sportswear, rainwear, silk mixture blouses and even medical filters. The tight weave possible with such fine filaments means that a fabric can be made waterproof without the need for a plastic coating. The spaces in the weave do not let rainwater seep in but they let water vapour, from sweat, out. The principle is not new. Gore-Tex, a fabric invented in the US and popular in outdoor clothing, also has microscopic holes that perform the same role. But Gore-Tex holes are made in a plastic film, rather than the weave. With microfibres, the need for such a coating is eliminated. For more advanced fabrics, a chemical coating can be used which makes it possible for the material to pick up water from the skin and draw it away from the body to the outside of the cloth. 'The results is theoretically seven times more porous than cotton and will dry three times as fast,' says an executive at UK fibres maker Courtaulds. There are more adventurous products yet. By combining highly twisted microfibres with conventional fibres of lower twist, delicate napped surfaces such as on the Scandinavian coat can be made. 'Each fibre might have to be twisted hundreds of times,' explains Mike Bartle of Yorkshire silk fabric specialist Lister. But the costs are high and the search is on for short-cuts. 'You can get a similar effect by mixing fibres that respond differently to heat,' says Bartle. Other exotic finishes are possible. In Japan, Toyobo makes a 'powder touch' material and Kanebo a 'moist touch' fabric. Both are intended for the fashion industry. The origin of these high technology materials is humble. When nylon first hit the streets in the 1940s it was called artificial silk and priced accordingly. It was quickly joined by polyester and production grew rapidly. Prices fell quickly as volumes rose. By 1975, polyester accounted for around one third of the entire US textile market. Such popularity bred contempt. By the late 1970s, nylon and polyester had become cheap to produce. Synthetic fibre clothes were considered tacky and sweaty. Their only advantages were strength and an ability to withstand being thrust into a washing machine every week. In the 1980s, cotton and wool were, once again, the fabrics of choice - except in Japan. There, demand for silk is traditionally higher than in western countries and demand has grown alongside the Japanese economy. The price of the raw material remained high and its supply, largely from China, unpredictable. As a result Japanese textile companies redoubled their efforts to reproduce the feel of silk. Since the mid-1970s, Japan has led the world in making fibres as fine as silk. Microfibres are usually less than one denier (the number of grams that 9,000 metres of the filament weighs). What such fine fibres do in principle is to make a fabric feel soft. Microfibres have been blended into wool or cotton for a luxurious feel that is as strong as a more traditional natural/artificial fibre mix. Fine fibres also make floppy fabrics: a silk garment drapes quite differently from one made of wool or cotton. Used on their own, microfibres can imitate silk better than any previous synthetic and still stand up to being machine washed. Experts can tell the difference between microfibres and silk, usually on sight and more easily by touch. But consumers seem to be prepared to pay high prices for fabric that feels luxurious, regardless of how it is produced. 'There are huge margins for clothes retailers,' says Les Jacques at ICI's fibres division. The profits thus generated are what makes microfibre products so attractive to manufacturers and retailers. Clothes, such as specialist sportswear, made from microfibres are marketed as luxury goods. Special materials, such as that in the Scandinavian coat, even more so. The typical extra cost of a microfibre is 30 to 50 per cent above that of the normal gauge of filament. But by the time the clothes are on sale in a shop, even an expensive fibre represents only a small proportion of the selling price. Microfibres appeal particularly to manufacturers in developed countries. They are capital intensive products. Third world suppliers, which have made huge in-roads into developed country markets with natural fibre fabrics, cannot compete. So the push for finer filaments continues. Today, Japanese fibre producers such as Toray can produce polyester of 0.01 denier. Such fabric is used to make artificial leather and can be 'sueded', in which an abrasive breaks some of the fibres in the weave to create a different surface texture. Garments are not the only route for microfibres. At 0.1 denier, fabrics can be used in the medical world as biological filters. And there is the barely explored area of industrial filtration, where polyesters are particularly useful because they are relatively inert. At the cutting edge, there are reports that Japanese laboratories have made a filament of 0.0003 denier. This would be a laboratory curiosity with no obvious applications. The road to world domination for these products is far from smooth. Even for ordinary microfibres, there are production problems. Existing machine designs have to be scaled down to make finer fibre, so production is low. There are risks that filaments will break during manufacture and hold up production. Furthermore, the greater surface area of a large number of smaller filaments means that much more dye has to be used. 'You will never get the same intensity of colour with microfibres,' says Bartle. The greater surface area can be useful, however. The high surface area of microfibres means they are already being used as cleaning cloths, especially for optical equipment and spectacles. Towelling is another possibility. The very promise of the fibres has led to a sharp growth in production capacity. In 1990, the Economist Intelligence Unit listed 19 Japanese companies making microfibres. They included giants such as Mitsubishi and Asahi, as well as more traditional fibre makers such as Toray, Teijin and Kuraray. European companies have been slower to join in. While the Japanese started in the mid-1970s, the likes of Courtaulds started only five years ago. European manufacturers now include Hoechst of Germany, Montefibre of Italy, Akzo in the Netherlands and ICI. The result is over-capacity. This has already hit the prices of the larger sizes of microfibres, at close to one denier. Hoechst acknowledges that there has been some price erosion and that last year was difficult. Nevertheless, the desire to reduce fibre diameters will continue. The aim is to make artificial materials better than natural alternatives. The potential rewards of genuine innovation in this largely mature industry will continue to push manufacturers towards new products and applications.</p>

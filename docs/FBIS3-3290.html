			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 16 (AFP)--China's budget deficit,  forecast to double in real terms this year to nearly 70 billion  yuan (eight billion dollars), will continue to grow in coming  years, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said Wednesday [16 March].    "My personal view is that in the coming two or three years  there will be an increase in the deficit," Liu told journalists,  but expressed confidence the Chinese authorities would be able  to sell some 100 billion yuan in treasury bonds this year to  cover the shortfall. Nevertheless, he acknowledged the growing  deficit was a "headache" for the government.    In his budget speech to the National People's Congress on  Friday, Liu said the deficit would hit 66.9 billion yuan in  1994, with revenues and expenditures rising 7.7 percent and 15  percent to 475.9 billion yuan and 542.9 billion yuan  respectively. The deficit is up from 20.5 billion yuan last  year, but Liu stressed the leap was partly due to a shift to  international accounting methods under which income from debt is  not included in total revenue and debt servicing is removed from  total expenditure. Based on the new methods, last year's debt  would have totalled about 30 billion yuan, he said.    Liu said he believed this year's treasury bonds would sell  well, despite the lack of public enthusiasm for an issue of 30  billion yuan in 1993.    Blaming last year's problems on "financial disorder" in  China, he said the situation now was "quite different," while  the terms of the bonds were more attractive and the distribution  system more sophisticated. "So although the figure of the  treasury bonds issued this year is a little bit larger, it is  entirely possible that distribution will be smooth," he said,  denying that individuals had been forced to buy them in 1993.    Liu was unable to indicate why urban residents facing  year-on- year cost of living rises of more than 20 percent  should show interest in bonds fixed this year about one percent  higher than the national rate of 13 percent.</p>

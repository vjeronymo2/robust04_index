			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD SIGN GETS NEW LOOK -- BRIEFLY;  </P> <P> LANDMARK: ARTISTS' PREDAWN OIL WAR EFFORT IS YANKED DOWN BEFORE SUN'S FIRST  RAYS. OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE NOT AMUSED BY THE PRANK.  </P> <P> It's a sign that the community is still just as HOLLYWEIRD as ever.  </P> <P> Ten self-proclaimed artists who stealthily crept to the HOLLYWOOD sign before  dawn Friday to protest the continuing crisis in the Middle East slipped away  after delivering a message that almost no one saw.  </P> <P> They no sooner had draped black plastic sheeting over the 400-foot-long letters  to make them spell out OIL WAR and then hiked to the bottom of the hill to  admire their handiwork when Los Angeles officials delivered a message to them.  </P> <P> It's HOLLYWRONG to tamper with a city landmark, said park rangers and police  who rushed from the top of Mt. Lee to yank down the plastic covering before  sunrise -- and before nearly anyone except Park Ranger Matt Perez on patrol  could notice it.  </P> <P> The hillside skirmish was the latest in an escalating war between pranksters  and officials over the 68-year-old sign, which in recent years has been changed  to read HOLLYWEED in celebration of a new marijuana law, HOLYWOOD (twice) in  honor of Easter and visiting Pope John Paul II, OLLYWOOD for Iran-Contra's  Oliver L. North, CALTECH for the school, GO NAVY for a football game, JOLLYWOOD  for an airline, FOX for the television network and RAFFEYSOD for an obscure  rock band.  </P> <P> In the past, the altered sign has been left in place long enough to be seen and  snickered at by passersby.  </P> <P> But this time unamused officials were downright HOLLYRUDE, according to the  leader of the band that spent several hours draping plastic sheeting over the  50-foot-tall letters during their ill-fated raid.  </P> <P> "This was supposed to be something that would bring a question to people's  minds as to whether or not it's really worth it to fight a battle to maintain  inexpensive gasoline in the United States," said Danny Finegood, who organized  Friday's sign-altering attack.  </P> <P> The sign is easy to tamper with because its nine letters are enough to spell  out plenty of other words, said Finegood, 36, a furniture maker who lives in  Los Feliz.  </P> <P> Griffith Park Chief Ranger Hector Hernandez said late Friday he would like to  spell an end to what he sees as vandalism. He said intruders have to trespass  on posted property to reach the sign; those climbing up the steep hillside risk  falling and hurting themselves.  </P> <P> Park employees sent to clean up the sign must climb onto the giant letters,  Hernandez said. "I don't think it's funny for my men to risk their lives for  what is supposed to be a joke," he said.  </P> <P> Shel Jensen, assistant general manager of the city's Department of Parks and  Recreation, said the city plans to fight back by installing a fence, a burglar  alarm and television surveillance cameras around the sign. Among his many  complaints, Jensen said, is that the occasional pranks draw unwanted sightseers  into the neighborhood.  </P> <P> Funding for the extensive security plan will come from a trust fund organized  by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. The account is financed by fees paid by  movie studios to film the famous sign and companies using it in advertising and  on souvenir items, said chamber President Larry Kaplan.  </P> <P> The total now ranges somewhere between $177,000 and $277,000 -- although the  exact amount will be determined by state auditors called in to mediate a  dispute over the cash, Kaplan said.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the landmark sign looms like a beacon to Finegood and his  friends, who claim responsibility for HOLLYWEED, one of the two HOLYWOODs and  OLLYWOOD.  </P> <P> Hollywood hasn't seen its last HOLLYRUSE, Finegood said. "We have more ideas.  We'll be back. I suggest people keep their eye on the sign."  </P></p>

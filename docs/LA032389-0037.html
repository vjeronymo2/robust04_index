			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> More Layoffs at Law Firm: Pillsbury, Madison &amp; Sutro said it is initiating  a second round of layoffs among its secretarial and support staff. The San  Francisco law firm, which last week said 35 secretaries had been terminated,  said up to an additional 24 clerks, possibly including several in the Los  Angeles branch office, will be let go as part of its new cost control program.  Last week, the firm acknowledged that its 170 partners would skip their regular  March profit sharing check because of soaring expenses, in part caused by a  costly computer conversion and the opening of new Los Angeles and San Jose  branch offices.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Wei Yufeng (7614 3768 7364) and </F> XINHUA reporter Liu Jun (0491 6511)]    [Text] Shanghai, 18 May (XINHUA) -- The on-the-spot  meeting on conducting education on patriotism at primary and  secondary schools opened today in Shanghai. The meeting marked  the taking of the concrete steps and measures to further  implement the "one guiding principle and four important tasks"  proposed by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the national work  conference on propaganda and ideological work.    The meeting, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and party's  basic line, will conscientiously implement the guidelines laid  down at the national work conference on propaganda and  ideological work; sum up and exchange experiences gained from  conducting education on patriotism across the nation in recent  years; study ways to implement the "Outlines for Implementing  Education on Patriotism" at primary and secondary schools under  the new situation; and carry out the education on patriotism at  primary and secondary schools in an extensive, in-depth, and  lasting manner.    Ding Guangen, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat,  showed great concern for and attached importance to the  education on patriotism. He heard briefings on the convening of  the on-the-spot meeting and set forth his demands. State  Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing sent a congratulatory message to  the meeting. In the letter, he pointed out that it was  extremely important to call the on-the-spot meeting on education  of patriotism at the primary and secondary schools, to sum up  the rich experiences gained from conducting the education on  China's contemporary history, on China's current situation, and  on patriotism in recent years, and to institutionalize and  persist in the system of conducting education on patriotism in  the future. This will have a pragmatic significance to  publicizing the major trend of the times and patriotism among  the youngsters; to carrying forward China's excellent tradition;  to promoting the 64-characters on the great enterprising spirit;  to using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics to arm and educate the youngsters;  and to training a new generation of people with ideals,  morality, culture and discipline for the next century.    Last year, the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department;  the State Education Commission; the Ministry of Radio, Cinema,  and Television; and the Culture Ministry, after summing up  experiences of conducting education through movies and  television across the nation, issued a "Circular on Using Good  Movies and Television Programs To Conduct Education on  Patriotism at the Nation's Primary and Secondary Schools" and  launched the activity of showing 100 patriotic and educational  movies across the nation. The showing of 100 movies was  welcomed by the broad mass of primary and secondary school  students, teachers, and parents and obtained excellent social  effect. Representatives attending the meeting called for  persisting in this successful experience, for organically  integrating this successful experience with educational  planning, and for fully bringing into play the roles of movies  and television as "lively and three-dimensional teaching  materials."    Liu Bin, vice minister in charge of the State Education  Commission, spoke on ways of using education on patriotism to do  a good job on moral education at primary and secondary schools.  He stressed that education on patriotism is the foundation for  doing a good job on building socialist spiritual civilization  and that it is necessary to fully implement the policy of  stressing the building of socialist spiritual civilization.  First, he said, it is necessary to do an even better job in  laying a foundation for education on patriotism and optimize the  social environment for cultivating the people. Second, in  addition to turning the schools into places to conduct education  on patriotism, it is necessary to use such means as movies,  television, books, magazines, and songs to foster students'  patriotism. Third, it is necessary to greatly publicize  advanced models' patriotism, so as to give play to the  demonstrative and inspirational roles of advanced models.  Fourth, it is necessary to establish certain protocols and  rules, just like those displayed by the squad at the Tiananmen  Square that is responsible for flag- raising ceremony, so as to  instill patriotism among youngsters.    Liu Yunshang, deputy head of the CPC Central Committee  Propaganda Department, presided over the meeting. Chen Zhili,  deputy secretary of the Shanghai CPC Committee, attended the  meeting to greet its opening and comprehensively and  systematically briefed the participants on the experience of  conducting education on patriotism at primary and secondary  schools in Shanghai.    The meeting was co-sponsored by the CPC Propaganda  Department; the State Education Commission; the Ministry of  Radio, Cinema, and Television; the Culture Ministry; and the  Communist Youth League Central Committee. Some 150  representatives and people in charge of relevant departments  from 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities  attended.</p>

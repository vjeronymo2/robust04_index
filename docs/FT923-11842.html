			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Radius helped by cost controls Radius, the USM-traded computer systems and maintenance group, reported profits of Pounds 525,000 before tax for the six months to May 31. The outcome compared with Pounds 801,000 in the corresponding half but marked a sharp improvement over the second six months of last year when profits, before exceptional items, amounted to just Pounds 141,000. Mr Michael Roberts, chairman, said the latest upturn reflected tightened operational controls and cost reductions. Turnover declined Pounds 12m (Pounds 14.7m) following 'recessionary pressures' and the discontinuation of loss-making activities. Earnings per share fell from 1.7p to 1p, but the interim dividend is maintained at 0.9p.</p>

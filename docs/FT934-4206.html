			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Loopholes go, lures stay - Profit-related pay / The Budget and You Kenneth Clarke's Budget speech might have been expected to reflect satisfaction at the success of the government's profit-related pay (PRP) legislation. Instead, he joined the sceptics who believe too many companies are introducing PRP to grab the tax relief on offer and not to create a genuine link between wages and profits. But while Clarke has now blocked two of the more blatant loopholes, PRP's tax-saving charms remain largely intact. PRP is pay which varies in line with changes in the profits of the employer's business. It is usually calculated by applying a specific percentage to the company's profits; this amount will be the PRP 'pool.' PRP paid under a scheme registered with the Inland Revenue is tax-free up to a limit of 20 per cent of salary or, if less, Pounds 4,000. Hence, a 40 per cent taxpayer can reduce his tax bill by up to Pounds 1,600 a year while someone only taxed at the basic rate will have a maximum benefit of Pounds 1,000. Any rational employer will welcome the chance to help staff to pay less tax; indeed, some may even hope to split the gain with their workers by, for example, using PRP as a justification for a wage freeze. At the same time, few companies - or, for that matter, employees - relish the uncertainty inherent in a genuine pay/profits link. So, for the past few years, tax advisers have been racking their brains to devise PRP schemes which combine tax efficiency with predictability. But one type, which possessed both qualities in full measure, was killed off by the Budget. It exploited the fact that an employer can impose an upper limit on the percentage of its profits which are to be taken into account for PRP purposes. The lowest limit which can be set is 160 per cent of profits in the previous year. Hence, a company which earned profits of Pounds 200,000 in the year before it started PRP could stipulate that, if it earned more than Pounds 320,000 in its PRP year, the profits above Pounds 320,000 would be disregarded. This upper limit is a sensible way to protect a company against freak results. In the wrong hands, however, it has been used for more devious purposes. The trick is for an employer to persuade staff to sacrifice part of their salary in return for PRP. If payroll costs are significant in relation to profits, then the salary reductions will give a considerable boost to the bottom line. If it is clear that, as a result, profits will rise by more than 60 per cent, the company can rest assured that the figure to be used for calculating the PRP pool will be 160 per cent of the previous year's profits. Armed with this information, the employer will be able to calculate the PRP percentage that will produce precisely the amount of PRP it wishes to pay out. And the employees, knowing how much PRP they will get, should have no qualms about a wage cut. The chancellor has now ruined this device by legislating that where a company's payroll costs are lower in its PRP year than in the preceding year, the 60 per cent threshold will be pushed up so as to negate the impact of the fall in salaries. Apart from the need for a genuine link with profits, the other main strand of the government's PRP philosophy is that the benefits should be shared out between employees on an equitable basis. Payments pro rata to salary are acceptable - but not a scheme in which higher-paid staff receive more than they should. Companies have been flouting this egalitarian ethos by exploiting the concessions granted to 'special schemes.' These are schemes which include employees of only part of a business but use the profits of the whole enterprise when calculating PRP. Without such a concession, companies wanting to set up separate schemes for each constituent part of the business would be unable to include the 'non-productive' units. In practice, however, companies have exploited the special scheme rules in order to pay disproportionately large amounts of PRP to a favoured group of employees, such as headquarters staff. Clarke has blown the whistle on this type of discrimination. From now on, the ratio of PRP to payroll in a special scheme must be no higher than the equivalent ratio for the rest of the company's work force.

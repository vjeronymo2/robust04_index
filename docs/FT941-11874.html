			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Builders struggle to win work: The industry's emergence from recession is proving painfully slow Construction output has started to climb again in the UK after three years of recession, but the improvement is expected to be slight and contractors are still charging 'suicidal' prices to win work. Cement prices, meanwhile, are poised to rise by an average of about 3 1/2 per cent from March 1, the biggest annual increase for two years. This will further increase the building material costs of struggling construction companies. Developments, forecasts and workload studies announced by the industry in the past few days emphasise the fragile nature of a recovery which companies say could claim almost as many business failures as during the recession. The recent collapse of Kentz, the UK subsidiary of Kent Corporation, the Irish-based mechanical and electrical contractor, may cause yet another cascade of receiverships as the effects ripple down to sub-contractors and suppliers. The problem for contractors is that there are still too many companies chasing too little work, despite receiverships. Mr Martin Laing, chairman of John Laing, has upset senior executives in the industry by criticising banks for propping up weaker rivals which he says ought to have been allowed to fail to allow much needed rationalisation of the industry. 'Prices must get back to economic levels,' he said. 'This cannot happen while there are so many companies competing against each other. Orders have risen a bit, but nowhere near enough to allow margins to recover.' Industry order books are rising for the first time since 1990. The environment department says the value of construction orders won by contractors in the UK rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 18.06bn during the first 11 months of last year compared with the corresponding period of 1992. Sales of ready-mixed concrete, one of the best guides to construction activity, rose by 12 per cent during the final three months of last year compared with latter part of 1992, says the British Aggregate Construction Materials Industries trade association (Bacmi). Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, says too many contractors are quoting 'suicidal' prices. Work is being won at cost or even at a loss just to keep cash flowing into weakened businesses. This could cause serious problems on projects such as the Pounds 1.9bn Jubilee Underground line extension in London where London Underground is thought to have negotiated exceptionally keen prices providing little or no profit for contractors. Construction companies working at cost or worse often try to improve their return as work progresses and design changes are required by the client - particularly if material cost increases mean they face heavy losses on the original price. London Underground, to prevent itself from being held to ransom by contractors, has incorporated strict conciliation procedures in contracts. It also required 'on demand' performance bonds allowing it to seize up to 10 per cent of the value of a contract without having to prove default by contractors. Increasing demands from customers for performance bonds is adding to strains on contractors' finances. Companies are also concerned that the rise in orders seen in the second half of last year may slow as public spending cuts take effect in the spring and with retailers such as Tesco and Safeway planning to reduce store developments. There is also concern that the housing market recovery may be set back when tax and National Insurance increases start at the end of March. Construction Forecasting and Research, which previously prepared industry forecasts for the National Economic Development Office, expects the value of output in constant 1985 prices to rise only 1 per cent this year and by the same amount in 1995. Hardly a robust recovery. A fifth of 600 companies questioned by the Building Employers Confederation last month expected to reduce their workforces further during the next 12 months. For many, the hard times remain even if the gloom has got a little lighter.</p>

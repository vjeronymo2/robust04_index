			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: T-D Bank wary despite improvement TORONTO-Dominion Bank yesterday reported a 14 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings. However, it cautioned that performance continued to be impeded by high non-performing loans, loan-loss provisions and losses on investment securities. Earnings totalled CDollars 90m (USDollars 70.8m), or 27 cents a share, in the quarter to April 30, up from CDollars 79m, or 24 cents, a year earlier. Return on shareholders' equity rose to 7.5 per cent from 6.3 per cent, but return on assets slipped to 0.45 per cent from 0.47 per cent. Total assets grew to CDollars 82.6bn on April 30 from CDollars 70.1bn. Loan-loss provisions were CDollars 150m, unchanged from the previous quarter. But non-performing loans on April 30, at CDollars 1.57bn, were CDollars 134m lower, thanks to improvements in its US and European portfolios. Montreal-based National Bank of Canada's second-quarter earnings rose to CDollars 40.1m, or 23 cents, from CDollars 29.8m, or 16 cents, a year earlier. The latest figure includes a CDollars 23m gain from the sale of leasing operations.</p>

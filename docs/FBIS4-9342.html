			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 22 Apr (TANJUG) -- The new government of  national unity of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK]--with  Borislav Mikelic as prime minister--held its first working  session today. The government reviewed the implementation of the  Zagreb agreement and preparations for the continuation of the  negotiating process with Croatia and the UN.    As Mikelic told journalists after the session, at tomorrow's  talks on the implementation of the cease-fire agreement with  Croatia -- to be held in Turanj near Karlovac -- the Serb side  will raise the issue of certain corrections to the buffer zones;  that is, the line of separation.    We must raise this issue because we have been tasked by the  parliament, and we are also forced by complaints from the field.  We will reexamine the maps and see what people have not  accepted in the implementation of the agreement, Mikelic  stressed.    The government also adopted stances on the forthcoming talks  with the UN special envoy, Yasushi Akashi. As it was said  today, the government will set firm conditions, the fulfillment  of which will be a precondition for the resumption of talks with  Croatia.    First of all, Krajina will demand at least a partial  annulment of provision 12 of UN Security Council Resolution 820  to make possible talks and negotiations on equal basis, Mikelic  said.    The Krajina delegation for talks with Akashi will comprise  RSK president Milan Martic, prime minister Mikelic, and foreign  minister Milan Babic.    The delegation will also raise the issue of the  reconstruction of Vukovar, for which, according to Mikelic,  funds have been secured but have been given to Croatia. We will  demand, he said, that the funds be used and that reconstruction  begin.    The RSK government also has one condition for talks on  economic relations with Croatia -- the payment of pensions.    "Croatia must honor this to open talks on economic  relations.  The reopening of traffic links is at the moment out of the  question," Mikelic said categorically.    According to figures Mikelic presented yesterday while  explaining his government's program, around 40,000 pensioners  who worked in Croatia are demanding to be paid pensions.</p>

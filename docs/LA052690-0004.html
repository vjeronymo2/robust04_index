			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE REJECTS DRUG SEARCHES AT CHECKPOINTS;  </P> <P> CIVIL RIGHTS: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S BID TO ALLOW STOPS WITHOUT PROBABLE CAUSE IS  CALLED UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  </P> <P> A U.S. District Court judge Friday rejected the federal government's bid to  give the U.S. Border Patrol authority to make drug searches "without a founded  suspicion" at the two immigration checkpoints on major freeways leaving the San  Diego area.  </P> <P> In a major victory for civil libertarians, Judge J. Lawrence Irving ruled that  the government's request to use the checkpoints for both immigration and  drug-related stops of motorists would violate the Constitution, particularly  Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys opposing the government's motion had argued that expanded  narcotics jurisdiction at the checkpoints -- in the northbound lanes of  Interstate 5 near San Clemente and of Interstate 15 in southern Riverside  County -- could eventually give U. S. officials broad authority to set up drug  checkpoints almost anywhere in the nation.  </P> <P> "Despite the gravity of the drug-trafficking problem and the brevity of the  proposed stops," Irving wrote in his 16-page decision, "this court cannot  condone the evisceration of the Fourth Amendment by allowing permanent  checkpoints to serve the 'dual purpose' of permitting Border Patrol officers to  investigate both immigration and narcotics violations."  </P> <P> The decision was applauded by Betty Wheeler, legal director of the American  Civil Liberties Union of San Diego and Imperial Counties, who called the  government's request yet another example of the assault on individual rights  associated with the anti-drug efforts.  </P> <P> "This is just one instance in many in which the perceived drug crisis has  caused the government to seek exceptions to civil liberties requirements,"  Wheeler said. "Our view is that it is precisely during times of perceived  crisis that our civil liberties have to be upheld."  </P> <P> William Braniff, U.S. attorney in San Diego, said prosecutors will probably  continue to seek court approval for the drug stops, possibly at the appellate  level. However, he noted that Irving's decision will not be appealed, as the  judge, in the same ruling, actually upheld the legality of two recent drug  seizures at the checkpoints that resulted in criminal prosecutions.  </P> <P> Irving ruled that the Border Patrol had sufficient legal authority to conduct  the searches that led to the seizures because the behavior of the motorists  gave the agents reasonable cause to suspect that something was wrong.  </P> <P> "We feel our position is a correct one, and we look forward to being able to  demonstrate that in the future, either to another judge or a higher court,"  Braniff said.  </P> <P> The U.S. attorney general's office in Washington had approved the prosecutor's  decision to seek authority to conduct drug stops at the checkpoints, Braniff  said, although the idea originated in the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego.  </P> <P> In court papers, federal prosecutors had argued that the increasing amounts of  drugs entering via the U.S.-Mexico border required the dual-purpose role at the  checkpoints, which were set up exclusively for immigration-related  investigations. A 1976 Supreme Court ruling, U.S. vs. Martinez-Fuerte, upheld  checkpoint stops of motorists for brief questioning regarding immigration  status.  </P> <P> But the high court ruling made no mention of drug investigations. In the  current case, the government had sought to extend the Supreme Court's rationale  to the narcotics arena, thereby enabling checkpoint agents to conduct narcotics  stops without the "founded suspicion" of a violation that is now required.  </P> <P> "The problems associated with alien smuggling are clearly no more important  than the scourge of drugs," Assistant U.S. Atty. Patrick K. O'Toole argued in  court papers.  </P> <P> As part of their application, federal prosecutors submitted statistics  demonstrating what they characterized as the soaring volume of drug trafficking  along the almost 2,000-mile-long U.S.-Mexico border, which has long been a  smuggling corridor. Border seizures of cocaine increased from fewer than 60  kilograms in fiscal 1982 to almost 12,000 kilograms in fiscal 1989, while  seizures of marijuana rose from about 27,000 kilograms to almost 200,000  kilograms during the same period, according to government figures filed in  connection with the case.  </P> <P> But Judge Irving rejected the government's argument, noting that the 1976  Supreme Court ruling permitted only immigration stops. Accepting the  government's argument, the judge said, would come "uncomfortably close" to  rejecting the Supreme Court's ruling in a Prohibition-era case, Carroll vs.  U.S. (1924). In that instance, Irving noted, the court ruled that law  enforcement officers needed some form of "probable cause" before stopping a  vehicle, questioning its occupants and searching it for contraband. The  "probable cause" threshold has since been upheld by numerous court rulings, and  has become a bedrock principle in U.S. law enforcement to protect innocent  citizens from harassment by police agencies.  </P></p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Council tax expected to rise less than inflation Council tax could rise by less than inflation this year, a survey of 67 councils shows. Public Finance, the journal of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, today publishes findings which show that in 67 councils to have set a figure the average band D council tax will rise 1.1 per cent - by Pounds 6.16 to Pounds 561.57. The demands made by county councils as their share from council tax have risen an average 6.6 per cent, according to Cipfa. Only three counties are predicted to set budgets below the government's capping limits. Changes in central government grant are blamed. Cuts are most likely in London boroughs and metropolitan districts, because of changes in the tax base and the cushioning effects of the grants that the government has made to compensate for changes to the formula which determines local authority funding. Conservative-controlled Bromley is reducing its council tax by 7.5 per cent with no cut in services. Liberal Democrat-controlled Tower Hamlets will leave its tax unchanged. The biggest increase so far proposed is for Merthyr Tydfil, in Wales, where band D tax will increase 20.9 per cent, from Pounds 282.09 to Pounds 341.60. In Northampton it will rise 14.3 per cent. The highest band D figure is Salford's Pounds 740. Wandsworth, the Conservative flagship borough in south London, has the lowest council tax at Pounds 139 - down from last year's Pounds 146. The council admitted it had benefited from transitional relief paid to individuals to guard against big increases compared to the former community charge, but said it had the second lowest needs-related support from the government of any inner-London borough.</p>

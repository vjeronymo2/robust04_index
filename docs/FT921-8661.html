			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / EC and Efta move closer to single market deal THE European Community and the European Free Trade Association (Efta) yesterday broke the legal logjam that had been blocking the creation of the world's largest single market, covering their 19 member countries. The settlement of the remaining dispute over juridical matters brings the EC and Efta partners close to the altar. But before the contract establishing the European Economic Area (EEA) is signed, there could be further hitches. An earlier treaty negotiated last October was thrown out by the EC's Court of Justice (ECJ) because it contained a joint EEA panel of judges. The court had complained that such a mixed EC-Efta court would undermine its own autonomy. As a result the EEA court idea was abandoned. Negotiators started again this year trying to find another formula that would ensure reasonable legal uniformity throughout the future common economic zone. The European Parliament has further muddied the water by calling this week for any new EEA draft treaty to be resubmitted to the court for its opinion. The European Commission, which has negotiated the far-reaching EEA deal on behalf of the Twelve, said last night it would decide next week what course to take. The treaty has to be ratified by the European Parliament, plus national legislatures of EC and Efta states. The EEA could be short-lived, with many Efta countries applying for full EC membership. For this reason, both sides have settled for a less than legally perfect arrangement. They agreed: A legal disputes settlement procedure, under which differences over judicial interpretation of EEA laws would go to a joint EEA political committee. If there was no agreement, and if one side chose to invoke safeguard or retaliatory measures, then the other side could demand binding arbitration. In the absence of any overall EEA court, both sides will exchange information on case law. Efta has agreed to let the Commission and the ECJ deal with virtually any competition case of significance.</p>

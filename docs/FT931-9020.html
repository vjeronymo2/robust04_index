			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec is near to 1m b/d output cut MINISTERS of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries last night reached the basis of an agreement to cut second quarter output by just under 1m barrels a day from the present quarter figures to 23.6m b/d. The deal, which ministers hope to finalise this morning, looked to have been agreed after Mr Ali al-Baghli, the Kuwait oil minister, said the Gulf state would accept a cut in its production to 1.6m b/d for the second quarter. Mr al-Baghli said Kuwait had reluctantly accepted the cut on condition that its production would be subject to 'review' as the its reconstruction programme increased capacity. Kuwait claims to be lifting 1.98m b/d and says capacity will top 2.1m b/d in the second quarter. Industry and other Opec estimates put Kuwait's output nearer 1.75m b/d. The agreement, if sealed and if embraced with more than customary Opec discipline, would strip just under 1m b/d from the first quarter ceiling of 24.58m b/d, but take closer to 1.5m b/d from the oil market overall, given that most non-Opec estimates put the cartel's production above 25m b/d. Most members are understood to have agreed to make pro-rata cuts towards a ceiling which, according to Mr Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's energy minister, might even dip below 23.6m b/d when final figures are tallied today. Ministers are eager to wrap up the agreement today, when the New York market opens after a day's holiday. Gulf delegates said they may also seek to reinforce the agreement's credibility by imposing the cuts in full by March 1. Analysts said the figures for the overall ceiling and for Kuwait's output, which had been the central point of contention over three days of talks in Vienna, were likely to be met positively in the market and at least sustain prices at pre-meeting levels. Crude prices had taken a Dollars 1.5-Dollars 2 fillip from the apparent consensus before this weekend's meeting that Opec needed to cut its ceiling by at least 1m b/d. Kuwait's agreement to accept 1.6m b/d was hard won. Its determination to resist cuts caused no little resentment among other delegations, many of which felt that Kuwait's pleading for special treatment after the Gulf war had been overplayed and was jeopardising Opec's ability to deliver any credibility to the market. This resentment matched by Kuwait's indignance that countries which had covered for its lost production during the Gulf war should be resisting what it considered its rightful share of output.</p>

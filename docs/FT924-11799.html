			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Letter: Amortising goodwill Sir, Profesor Arnold's excellent article on accounting for goodwill ('A new approach to valuation of the intangible', October 15) will, I believe, be broadly welcomed by industry, except in one regard - the requirements that 'any goodwill capitalised should be amortised against profit over its useful economic life'. In fact, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales report provides, I believe, for the value of certain assets such as brands to be reviewed periodically and does not require amortisation if it can be shown that there has been no decline in value. Conversely, if the economic life of the asset is indeterminate and there is no identifiable decline in value, the amortisation period can be infinite.

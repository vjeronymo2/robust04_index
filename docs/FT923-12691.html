			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): Short of revolution, the soundest IOU - But remember that there's an inverse relationship, as prices rise, gilt yields fall, and vice versa / Fixed interest 1: Gilts THE 1990s may be the decade of the gilt. After years of being neglected in favour of the cult of the equity, some have argued that a low-growth, low-inflation economic environment is the ideal background for gilt investors. Gilts are merely IOUs from the government, on which interest is paid twice a year. Their price can fluctuate in the short term, but in the vast majority of cases, the repayment value is fixed and, short of revolution, certain. Interest on gilts is taxable but non-taxpayers can receive the income gross, if they buy their gilts from the post office. Any capital gains made on gilts are tax-free. So what factors affect the price of a gilt? First, there is the interest rate or coupon, which is the return the gilt will pay per Pounds 100 of nominal value. But private investors should realise that this is not the return they will normally receive. In the vast majority of cases, the gilt will not be trading at its face value price; instead, it will be somewhere above or below 100. Imagine a market with just two gilt issues; one which paid 10 per cent and one which paid 12 per cent. If both were on offer at the face value of 100, then all investors would obviously opt for the one which paid 12 per cent. Its price would rise, and that of the 10 per cent gilt would fall. An investor who bought the 12 per cent gilt for Pounds 120 would still only receive Pounds 12 in interest. His income return, therefore, would not be 12 per cent but 10 per cent (Pounds 12 divided by Pounds 120); this relationship is known as the running yield and can be found in the FT prices list each day under the 'int' heading. Gilts with the highest coupons will tend to trade at above face value; gilts with low coupons tend to trade below face value. The second key factor in gilt prices is the maturity date. Eventually, the gilt will be repaid at face value (this does not apply to undated stocks, or to index-linked). As a consequence, anyone who buys a gilt trading above face value faces the prospect, if he holds the gilt to maturity, of a capital loss. And those who buy gilts below face value will make a capital gain if they hold on till maturity. This factor will limit the extent to which gilt prices can move away from 100. The total return thus consists of both the income stream and the capital gain (or loss) to maturity; the combination is known as the gross redemption yield, and can be found in the FT prices list each day under the 'red' heading. Gilts with similar maturity dates will trade on similar gross redemption yields. The golden rule is that yields and prices have an inverse relationship; as prices rise, gilt yields fall and vice versa. A host of factors will affect the general level of gilt yields (and thus prices). If the government has a budget deficit, it will have to issue a lot of gilts to fund it. This will increase the supply, and as with any other commodity, an increased supply ought to have a dampening effect on the price. Expectations of inflation are also important. Since the repayment value of a conventional gilt is constant, high inflation will eat substantially into investors' real returns. Thus, if investors expect inflation to rise, gilt prices will fall. This will, of course, mean a rise in yields, and analysts often talk of a real yield, that is the nominal yield minus inflation. Real yields have been very high in recent years, as investors have demanded a high return after their bad experiences in the inflationary 1970s. The level of short-term interest rates in the economy also affects gilt prices. The two are not directly correlated. But if the government cuts base rates, the gilt market might assume that inflation will increase. Gilt yields will have to rise (and prices fall) to compensate. But although there can be substantial gaps between gilt yields and base rates (over five percentage points in 1990), there have been long periods over the last 20 years in which the difference was no more than two percentage points either way. The bulls' argument for buying gilts is that, despite the growing government deficit, yields will fall (and prices therefore rise) as inflation and interest rates are cut. Those investors who need income will also be able to 'lock in' to current rates and thus avoid the danger of reduced returns from variable rate deposits, such as building societies. They're in five categories The FT prices page classes gilts in five categories: Shorts. These are issues with less than five years to maturity; as a consequence, the prices stay fairly close to 100. Mediums. These are issues with between five and 15 years to run. Longs. These are bonds with at least 15 years to maturity. Their prices are sensitive to long-term expectations of inflation and can move quite a distance from their face value. Undated. These issues will never be repaid, but will pay interest indefinitely. They thus trade entirely on a running-yield basis and are highly sensitive to interest rate expectations. The much higher interest rates prevailing over the last 30 years have badly affected these issues, with prices falling to around 20 per cent of nominal value in some cases. Index-linked. The devastating impact that inflation had on gilts in the 1970s prompted the government to produce these inflation-linked issues, ironically just as inflation started to fall. The repayment value of an indexed issue is linked to the level of the retail prices index; ie, if the original RPI was 100, and the RPI around maturity date is 200, then the gilt will be repaid at double its issue price. In addition, there is a small coupon - 2 or 2 1/2 per cent - which increases in line with inflation each year. What causes some confusion is that the RPI used in the calculation is the index eight months before issue and maturity. As a consequence, the investor has no protection against inflation in the last eight months of the gilt's life; this complicates the yield calculations, because the real yields will be different on different inflation assumptions. The FT prices page shows real yields assuming either 5 or 10 per cent inflation. A great advantage of the index-linked gilt to the private investor is that the bulk of the return comes in the form of capital gain, which is tax-free; the disadvantage is that there is little to attract income-seeking investors. Two ways to buy them In buying gilts, there are essentially two routes: via a stockbroker or by the post office. Using a stockbroker will normally be more expensive, but you may be able to benefit from the broker's advice in choosing issues. The post office has a restricted range of issues, and may take longer to deliver, but charges are low: Pounds 1 for the first Pounds 250 invested, with 50p for each further Pounds 125. A Pounds 5,000 investment would therefore cost Pounds 20. The golden rule when buying a gilt is to remember that those trading below par value offer a lower running yield, but present the potential for capital gain; those trading above par value pay a higher income, but offer the prospect of capital loss. Taking the unit trust route Investors who do not want the aggravation of selecting their own gilts can instead plump for one of the bond funds run by unit trust managers. These invest in a range of fixed-interest issues, with the aim (normally) of providing income, and are very popular in the US, where they make up around a third of the collective fund market. The real question is whether the manager's expertise in selecting issues is worth the bid-offer spread (sector average around 4.7 per cent) and the annual management fee (usually around 0.75 to 1 per cent). Over five years to May 1, the average UK gilt and fixed interest fund made a return of 30.2 per cent (offer-to-bid with income reinvested) - that is certainly better than the return offered by most UK equity-based unit trusts. But Fund Research, the leading unit trust analysis group, criticised the sector in 1991, saying that too many trusts 'have used high yields to attract investors. It would appear that many gilt trusts are, in effect, quasi-annuities, generating a stream of income at the expense of the initial deposit.' Fund Research warned that some trusts would have to cut dividends to avoid heavy capital depreciation - a warning that was borne out by some subsequent trust announcements.

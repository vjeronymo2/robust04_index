The prediction, by Vice-Minister of Coal Industry Pu  Hongjiu,  comes after coal prices were floated on the open market as the  central government lifted controls last weekend.    With the new prices, the industry expects to reduce its  losses by 4 billion yuan ($460 million) this year and in 1995.    It has run at a loss for decades due to rigid central  planning, government price controls, and rising costs of  materials.    When coal prices were under State control, they were too low  for mines to meet production costs, let alone to make profits.    But prices of materials, such as steel, wood and cement, had  been allowed to float on the market years ago.    Throughout these years the coal industry received subsidies  from the central government to maintain operations.    Pu Hongjiu said the central government is taking a  soft-landing policy in the coal pricing system.    In 1992, prices of some 300 million tons of coal were freed  and the prices of another 600 million were floated in 1993.    Coal makes up 75 percent of China's energy consumption.    And 70 percent of the country's installed electric power  capacity of 180 million kilowatts, comes from coal-fired  generators.    Pu said coal mines which had been allowed to sell their  products at market prices had already made profits.    Pricing reforms, important to the country's transition from  central planning to a socialist market economy, were first tried  with mines in Anhui Province.    The industry chose these mines because demand for their  higher- quality products, was stable.    Their clients are concentrated in East China, where the  economy has developed faster than in other parts of the country.    Pu said the mines in Anhui are among the most efficient  enterprises in the industry.    So far, the freeing of coal prices has had positive results.    However, reports say some industries are thinking of using  the reform as an excuse to raise the price of their own products.    A Ministry of Coal Industry official said it would take  months for coal prices to float to the levels that permit coal  mines to meet production costs and then make profits.    There is currently a glut of coal with about 200 million  tons  are stored at mines and electric power plants.    Analysts say the industry will have to beef up co-ordination  among coal mines to cut production so that retail prices rise by  a reasonable margin.    Co-ordination will be tough as the ministry has a strong  influence only on large and medium-sized mines.    Many small mines are governed by regional authorities and  other ministries such as the Ministry of Agriculture.    The industry used to employ 7 million people to dig some 1.1  billion tons of raw coal, but hundreds of thousands of them have  now been transferred to other jobs.    Due to China's backward social welfare system, the industry  has to provide living means to 800,000 retired workers.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] </F> Deputy Sergio Ramirez by Noel Irias; place and date not given;  first three paragraphs BARRICADA introduction]    [Text] Deputy Sergio Ramirez, member of the Sandinist Front  National Directorate (DN), heads the long list of signatories of  the document titled "For a Sandinism That Goes Back to the  Majorities," a document which sums up the proposals of a large  faction of that party.    However, the public admission of his wish to seek the  Sandinist candidacy in the 1996 presidential elections has  caused confusion over the nature of the document.    Ramirez says he does not want to appear to be binding the  signers to back a candidacy, "but rather, a position," and  insists that the FSLN must renew itself in order to win the  coming elections. Otherwise it will have to wait until the year  2002.    [Irias] What is the relationship between the special  congress  in May and the 1996 election process?    [Ramirez] The special congress in May is not specifically  designed to open up election prospects for the FSLN.    However, the congress does become a political platform for  the 1996 elections by virtue of the fact that the platform  definitions that we make will necessarily be a reference point  for society in terms of the election because they cannot be  abruptly changed.    These platform definitions of democracy, the Armed Forces,  the government, relations with the United States, violence, and  methods of struggle will be a mirror in which society will view  us as an election option.    The effects of the FSLN's democratization process will serve  as a parameter indicating whether or not we have a party that  has evolved.    It will show whether we have a party with procedures for  open  admission and greater proselytizing activity because, starting  in May, we shall have to step up our proselytizing profile in  organizational terms and strive to become a winning party.    This will all depend upon party structure and our political  readiness to go into operation rapidly in an election situation.    [Irias] What would happen if the special congress were to  decide that a renewal of this type is not necessary?    [Ramirez] I think we must fight such a tendency with great  imagination, creativity, and determination.    A congress that merely marks time and that devotes itself to  mulling over ideological concepts in order to prove that we are  a party that is ideologically pure would not put us in a  politically advantageous position.    I think the FSLN has to articulate a very clear message for  society, what it wants and does not want, what it has to offer  in terms of an alternative solution to the major economic  problems facing us.    It must also state what the FSLN believes the role of the  individual in society must be, its views on the safety of the  individual, his property and beliefs, war and violence. All of  which must be elucidated in political terms in order to make the  Sandinist election goals viable.    I must think in preeminently political and therefore  election  terms if, indeed, we are to go into major elections because the  FSLN's victory in 1996 is vital.    I would be enormously concerned if the Sandinist Front were  defeated again in 1996 and forced to rebuild its election base  in 2002, out of power for 12 years.    [Irias] You have expressed presidential aspirations. What  conditions must exist for this to occur?    [Ramirez] I am proposing to the FSLN and Nicaraguan society  a  party that is transformed, renewed, and resting on truly  democratic foundations, internally speaking.    The last thing I would ever do would be to propose a bossist  take-it-or-leave-it option to Sandinists, stating that my  person, my figure, is indispensable to the FSLN's election  interests.    I have merely spoken of the legitimacy of my aspiration to  hold an elective post rather than of the aspiration in itself.    I have tried to put back into the closet the old skeleton  which says that aspiring to elective office in the FSLN is a  cardinal sin. On the contrary, I believe that in a revolutionary  party, individuals have the right to their own aspirations and I  want to legitimize that fact.    I want a renewed FSLN. Then and only then shall we decide on  presidential candidates. If the Sandinist Front does not become  a force in terms of empowerment as a force capable of winning,  then choosing preliminary candidates will serve no purpose  whatsoever.    I decided to place my name on the document "For a Sandinism  That Goes Back to the Majorities" in order to force yet another  skeleton back into the closet: casting the stone while hiding  one's hand. I was indeed a decisive factor in the formation of  that faction and in the drafting of that faction's views.    I agreed to place my name on it out of loyalty to its 1,000  signers, but I do not want to appear to be forcing the signers  to back a candidacy, but rather, a position. I have not tried to  gather signatures backing me personally.    When I decide to announce as a precandidate in the elections  representing the FSLN, I will begin to speak with complete  legitimacy, and the party will have a means to determine who the  candidate will be, because there will certainly be several.    What I refuse to accept is for the leadership to decide on a  single candidate who will then be imposed on the party's rank  and file.    [Irias] Did the National Directorate decide that its members  would not sign any document or participate in the activities of  the factions?    [Ramirez] Opinions were expressed that it was not advisable  for members of the National Directorate to head factions within  the FSLN or sign documents, but none became an actual decision.    This happened after a number of members of the DN attended  the founding meeting of the Beijing Guerrilla faction, who  obviously did not sign the document. They did attend, however,  and I consider them part of that core of founders and recognize  their right to do so, just as I reserve the same right to  discuss related positions with other comrades.    After the document "For a Sandinism That Goes Back to the  Majorities" came out and the matter was discussed once again, we  agreed that members of the DN should have freedom of opinion and  the interplay of factions, while respecting the rules of a  high-minded debate.    I do not think the DN could make a decision to prevent its  members from participating in the factions because it is almost  of a provisional nature. We will report when the congress elects  a new leadership in May.    Within the DN itself, we should accept the possibility of  the  competence of candidates and how to resolve it in the most  appropriate fashion. There could be several candidates for the  post of secretary general of the FSLN. We would be speaking of  immediate proselytizing action rather than action relating to an  assumed presidential candidacy in the distant future.    No one has decided that there will be only one candidate for  every post and we no longer have elections by lists. We must  expect several candidates for every elective post; that is  inevitable.    [Irias] What is your view of the election results in the  Atlantic Coast area?    [Ramirez] I believe that what happened resulted from the  Sandinists' inability to engage in election proselytizing. The  FSLN is still unprepared to be a party that will win the  majorities, as those elections show.    Our comrades on the Coast made an enormous effort, but the  central party machinery did not lend them sufficient support.    We are not acting like a national party called upon to win  in  regional elections. The duty of a party is to win, not compete  for second place!    [Irias] Should the FSLN form alliances for election  purposes?    [Ramirez] As a general rule, I think the FSLN should be open  to alliances--particularly in a civil struggle in which it is  votes that define victory--while always bearing the national  purpose in mind.    I do not think the Sandinists are the sole proprietors of  the  solutions to the country's crisis. I wish there were a union of  forces in which the FSLN would play the central role and set the  course for emerging from the country's crisis in 1996.    [Irias] Will you run for the National Directorate at the  next  congress?    [Ramirez] I have not yet decided. I would like to be a part  of the leadership elected by the congress and I would not refuse  an elective post. Nor am I blackmailing anyone, as has been  written and stated on the radio, saying that if the congress  does not do what I want, I will withdraw from it or even switch  to another party.    I do not believe in political bossism consisting in having  men be more important than things: the party, our institutions.  Bosses are capable of sacrificing anything: the unity of a  party, the coherence of a plan, the viability of a country, in  order to reign personally. I am not like that.    However, I do reserve the option of not running for an  elective post if the ratio that emerges from the congress  indicates that there is no possibility of transformations like  those I believe the FSLN needs in order to face the election  challenge politically speaking.    Here we have yet another skeleton to put back into the  closet: that it is a cardinal sin to run for elective office and  a cardinal sin if you do not run because you are threatening our  unity.    As a member of the FSLN, I shall always defend the fact that  failing to appear on a list of candidates at any given moment  should not alarm anyone or lead people to believe I am attacking  unity.    [Irias] Does the National Directorate function as the real  leadership of the party?    [Ramirez] The DN does not function as the real leadership of  the party, as proved by the fact that if a special congress was  indeed called ahead of the scheduled date of June 1995, it is  because of recognition of a crisis of leadership in the party.    The feeling of collegial leadership has been lost and the  Sandinist Assembly is not functioning as such. Most of the  resolutions passed by the Sandinist Assembly exist only on paper  and have not been carried out within the party. The departmental  organs are also in crisis.    Not only is the FSLN engulfed in an identity crisis, but it  is facing an organic crisis as well. It was because of it that  we were unable to contribute effectively to an election victory  in the Atlantic Coast region.    For all of these reasons, the FSLN's renewal as a party is  essential.</p>

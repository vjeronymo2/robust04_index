The Duma has already shown  effectiveness by electing speaker, Nikolay Travkin, leader of  the Democratic Party of Russia, said at a news conference on  Friday.    Travkin believes the Duma can have a stabilising effect on  society.    He said his party has not entered and is not going to enter  any blocs, but members of the Democratic Party would be  gratified if their interests coincide with those of other  factions.    Travkin said the Democratic Party objects to possible  construction of a new parliament building, believing that this  would only discredit the new legistative body.    He added that a regular congress of the Democratic Party of  Russia will be held on February 18-19. He said the purpose of  the congress is to make the party less amorphous and impart to  it a more rigid structure.</p>

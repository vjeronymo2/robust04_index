			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Commodities (Year in the Markets): Prices end back at square one after another turbulent year RECESSION and continued turbulence in the former Soviet Union have left commodity prices little changed at the end of the year from those seen last January. But that bald statement belies the level of activity in the markets. On the London Metal Exchange the flood of imports from the former Soviet Union pushed nickel prices sharply down and kept a firm lid on the aluminium market, where warehouse stocks now stand above 1.5m tonnes. The zinc market suffered a classic squeeze. Copper, still traded in sterling, appears to have risen sharply until the figures are converted to dollars - around Dollars 1 a lb looks set to be the going rate this January as last. Gold has fallen further, hit by an almost total lack of interest from investors. Both platinum and silver have continued to settle into their relatively new roles as industrial metals. Cocoa and coffee prices have touched their lowest levels for 20 years or more before recovering. The lack of activity in the sugar market has left London with virtually no futures trading. Gold fell to a six-year low in late March as it crashed through what many traders had seen as the last line of defence - Dollars 342 a troy ounce. Persistent selling, some of it thought to be on behalf of an eastern European central bank, coincided with Ramadan, the Islamic fast, which kept most Middle Eastern operators away from the market. By Easter gold was at a fresh low of Dollars 336.80 a troy ounce, with dealers predicting that the price was bottoming out. They were proved right for a time as the market started to climb, brushing aside an announcement by the Belgian central bank that it had sold 202 tonnes from its reserves. Platinum was also rising as South African unrest made users reluctant to go short in case of a miners' strike. In July the platinum price hit the year's high of just over Dollars 390 a troy ounce. But some analysts pointed out that the market was ignoring weak demand from Japan and continuing recession in the US. Gold reached its peak for the year of just under Dollars 360 a troyounce a few days after platinum - and then both markets slid steeply, leaving one analyst just two weeks later describing Dollars 355 for gold as 'like the Matterhorn'. On one mid-August day gold fell by more than Dollars 8 and platinum by Dollars 16 a troy ounce. The withdrawal of US investment funds sparked the gold fall, which was exacerbated by more news of central bank selling - this time from Uruguay, which unloaded 50,000 troy ounces in July in order to buy fixed term deposits denominated in US dollars and D-marks. Platinum slid along with the Japanese equity market. The European currency market jitters of September gave some support to gold, but South African and Australian producers were able to lock in profits in their own currencies through forward selling. Gold has not had a good year; Middle East sales in November finished the battering from central bank sales and the total lack of investor interest and took the market to a 7-year low of Dollars 329.30. It has not made much headway since, closing at Dollars 333.05 a troy ounce on Thursday, down about Dollars 20 on the year. Platinum ended the year at Dollars 355.25 a troy ounce, some Dollars 20 above its price at the beginning of the year. Optimism about a recovery in Japanese demand and positive charts point to further gains, analysts believe. Silver hit an 18-month low of 364.75 cents at the end of August and closed at 367.5 on Thursday, 20 cents down on the year. The biggest excitement of the year was the Saudi sale via the National Commercial Bank of Jeddah of Dollars 160m-worth of silver - equivalent to more than 10 per cent of world demand - in just two hours early in July, knocking more than 20 cents off the price. Like most of the base metals copper began the year in a fairly hopeful mood. Chilean strike fears and technical factors had helped to lift prices to 2 1/2 -month highs by mid-February, before some of the gains were relinquished in response to reports that Russia, hungry for hard curency, was planning to cut export duties on the metal. In the spring talk of Chinese buying was partly counteracted by concern about the effects of a possible strike in Germany, one of the biggest importers of copper, but as London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks began to be reduced and US recovery hopes started to grow prices climbed to 12-month highs by mid-June. Bullish sentiment continued - fuelled by concern about supply tightness, Polish labour tension, bad weather in Chilean producing areas and expected demand growth - and a month later copper prices stood at the highest level for 18 months. From that point the picture becomes blurred by sterling's extreme weakness against the US dollar, in which base metals are traded worldwide. The effect of the pound's decline, most of which was concentrated in the dramatic mid-September devaluation, on copper prices is illustrated by the fact that the two-year sterling high reached in early November equated to a nine-month dollar low. And that factor has continued to dominate the market. The three months copper price closed on Thursday at Pounds 1,538 a tonne, Pounds 350 up on the year. But once the currency disportion is stripped out the 12-month advance comes down to a much less impressive Pounds 78 a tonne. For lead, the LME's other sterling-denominated contract, the devaluation effect is even more pronounced, turning what would have been a Pounds 60 fall into an apparent Pounds 8 rise on the year, at Pounds 308.75 a tonne for three months metal. After a flat start to the year, depressed by sluggish car battery sales, the LME lead market found support in production problems, notably in Italy and Yugolslavia, followed by signs of a technical squeeze on nearby supplies and reports of Chinese buying. Between them, and helped by the pound's weakness, these factors lifted the lead market to a 12-month peak in July. And that was exceeded in the September as a direct result of sterling's plunge. By the end of November, however, the market's fundamental weakness had been reasserted and prices were back to five-month lows. Another LME market to feel the effects of a squeeze this year was zinc. Signs of the coming technical suppy tightness were apparent from the start of the year, though they tended to be obscured by the effects of production problems in Italy, Peru, Canada, Mexico and the US, among others. Hopes of a US retail upturn were also cited as zinc prices reached 15-month highs in March. But from then on the squeeze was the undoubted dominant factor. The normal 'contango' situation, with the cash price at a discount to forward positions, was reversed in late March and the 'backwardation', as a cash premium is known, widened inexorably until it reached an extraordinary Dollars 189 a tonne in the middle of June. In normal circumstances a backwardation would suggest a shortage of metal available for delivery, but that hardly fitted in with this year's sustained rise in LME warehouse stocks of zinc, which, by the time the cash premium appeared, had grown from 152,000 tonnes at the start of the year to 221,000 tonnes. It was clear, therefore, that some sort of distortion (not to say manipulation) was afoot. The exchange responded by imposing a descending ceiling on the one-day backwardation  - ie on the cost of carrying forward a short position for one day. The backwardation had disappeared by the end of July, though it made frequent reappearances before the squeeze, suspected to be the work of a group of producers, could confidently be said to be over in early October. With fundamental considerations taking over direction of the market and the rise in LME stocks continuing the ensuing price slide saw the three months price retreat some Dollars 300 from its summer level to end the year at Dollars 1,079.50 a tonne, down Dollars 35.50 on balance. The aluminium market had been weighed down in 1991 by the unprecedented growth of the stockpile in LME warehouses, which began 1992 by passing the unwelcome milestone of 1m tonnes. There were hopes that the flood of metal from the former Soviet Union that had been largely responsible for swelling LME stocks would soon abate, especially in view of the inefficiency of smelters in the newly independent republics and their much-vaunted espousal of market economics. But the republics' hunger for hard currency proved greater than their commitment to industrial efficiency and with CIS exports remaining very high the LME stockpile grew by another 500,000 tonnes. Perhaps surprisingly, the market took this pretty much in its stride and the three months LME price ended the year Dollars 110 to the good at Dollars 1,260.50 a tonne. Gains early in the year were mostly lost in the summer as hopes of economic recovery faded and the gloomy truth about CIS export prospects became apparent. But in the latter part of the year the market was encouraged by the announcement of production cuts. The biggest loser on the LME last year was nickel. The mood was bright enough early on as traders looked forward to big production cuts in response to the low price level and, as with aluminium, a slackening of CIS exports. The former came too late, however, and the latter came not at all, and the six-month highs seen in February proved to be the year's peak. By the time Inco of Canada instituted a round of output cuts in October nickel prices had fallen to two-year lows and LME stocks of the metal had risen by 300 per cent on the year so far to nearly 50,000 tonnes. In those circumstances the market was looking for an upturn in demand, especially in the stainless steel sector, to give it the necessary shot in the arm, not simply a reduction in output. Further production cuts were subsequently announced by Falconbridge of Canada, Cuba's state-run producer and Western Mining of Australia - amounting in all to nearly 38,00 tonnes in a full year  -but the price slide continued and LME three months nickel closed on Thursday at Dollars 6,023 a tonne, down Dollars 1,192 on the year. By comparison, the tin market had a good year. LME stocks rose by only 7.4 per cent to 14,710 tonnes and the three months price ended 1992 up Dollars 240 at Dollars 5,845 a tonne. A life-of-contract low of Dollars 5,485 had been registered at the beginning of the year but by mid-February the market was at a six-month high, reflecting concern about shipment delays from Brazil and Malaysia, the two biggest suppliers. The bullish mood continued throughout the first half, lifting the price to a 25-month high of Dollars 6,950 a tonne, before a reaction was caused by Brazilian and Chinese selling and bearish technical factors. But the market was moving higher again before the new year, encouraged by buying in Kuala Lumpur and activity in the options market. For the oil market in general 1992 proved a disappointing year and for members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries a worrying one. Having started at the low level of about Dollars 17 a barrel the Brent crude price was buoyed in the spring by optimism about the prospects for demand when the expected industrial recovery began. And the price moved above Dollars 20 a barrel for the first time in six months when Opec ministers agreed unexpectedly in May to roll over its second quarter production ceiling of 22.98m b/d into the third quarter, rather than anticipate the rise in demand. But by November, in the absence of the expected demand boost, the market was looking for Opec ministers to agree substantial production cuts at their meeting in Vienna. When this did not happen prices fell sharply and it took the political turmoil in Russia, the world's biggest producer, to lift Brent crude back above Dollars 18 a barrel last month. Of the softs, cocoa began the year in the most optimistic mood as the market looked forward eagerly to the first annual supply deficit for eight years. But, with collapsing demand from the former Soviet Union, hopes of higher prices proved to be a pipe dream, with the market failing to regain the 1991 peak of Pounds 829 a tonne. The second postion contract on London Fox opened the year at Pounds 745 a tonne. The market continued an almost unbroken decline for the next six months. The nadir came at the end of June, when the second position contract fell to Pounds 509 a tonne, the lowest level for more than 16 years. At these levels countries of origin, including the Ivory Coast, were reluctant to sell, and were also pinning some hope on the outcome of Geneva talks on a new international agreement. The market began a slow climb back to more than Pounds 750 a tonne in early November, given a boost by sterling's devaluation and an Ivory Coast decision to ban the sale of small beans. But London prices have ended close to Pounds 700 a tonne, and it is worth noting that the nearby New York contract which began the year at Dollars 1,245 a tonne, closed it at Dollars 936. The Economist Intelligence Unit is predicting a small deficit of 43,000 tonnes for 1992-93, while the US Agriculture Department estimates production and supply in balance at 2.35m tonnes. The EIU expects the next round of talks on a cocoa pact in February to end with a purely administrative pact, and is predicting prices to average about the same as in 1991 at 55 cents a lb. Coffee prices, like cocoa, went into a steep slide from the beginning of the year. The London robusta market fell by more than Dollars 300 to hit 22-year lows at the beginning of May. The high level of consumer stocks - 19m bags (60 kg each) - left producers with little option but to sell for what they could get. Throughout the summer the market edged higher, keeping an eye on the International Coffee Organisation's interminable negotiations on a new international agreement. The different supply and demand picture for robustas and arabicas kept London steady while New York arabicas went below 50 cents a lb in September. But by the end of October both markets were rallying strongly as traders enjoyed a total change in sentiment, mainly on perceptions of a smaller 1992-93 crop in Brazil, the biggest producer, and Colombia. In December, London's second position robusta contract broke through the Dollars 1,000 a tonne level for the first time since January 8. The EIU believes the recent rise has been overdone. Consumer stocks are still high and this month's ICO talks are likely to be inconclusive, pushing a new coffee agreement back to 1994. The centre of gravity for world sugar prices has moved decisively from London to New York, where speculative money provides liquidity. The second position New York raw sugar futures contract has ranged between 8 and 10 cents a lb throughout the year - another market with more than enough production to satisfy demand. For much of the last few months the market has been stuck between 8.5 and 9 cents - a narrow range with depressingly low traded volumes, according to ED &amp; F. Man's latest sugar report. But this contrasted with increased volumes of freely traded sugar following the dissolution of the Cuban trading arrangements with Comecon, Man pointed out. A November report from the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation predicted trade expansion for sugar, but believed that by the turn of the century prices would still be about 10 cents a lb in 1990 terms.</p>

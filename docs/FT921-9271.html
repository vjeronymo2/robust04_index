			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / IFC-style investment company launched: Former World Bank officials see growing opportunities in emerging markets A NEW asset management company was launched in Washington yesterday to take advantage of growing opportunities for direct and portfolio investment in developing countries, eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, writes Michael Prowse in Washington. The Emerging Market Corp was founded by Mr Moeen Qureshi and Mr Donald Roth  -until recently two of the World Bank's most senior officials - and Mr Jay Higgins, a former vice-chairman of Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street investment house. Bankers Trust, the New York bank which is already active in emerging markets in developing countries, has agreed in principle to become a partner in the new company. The new company will be based in Washington and begin operations in April. Its immediate aim is to establish a Dollars 200m-Dollars 250m (Pounds 111m-Pounds 139m) fund for making direct equity investments. Mr Qureshi, the chairman-designate, said yesterday EMC would add value by providing a vehicle through which pension funds and insurance companies could take direct equity stakes in developing countries. At present, investors were mainly limited to portfolio investment in emerging markets. He said the age of substantial bank lending to developing countries had passed. His company was being established to ride the new wave of direct and portfolio equity investment. EMC may also represent the start of a trend towards seeking private-sector solutions to the problems of economic development. It can be seen as a profit-making, entrepreneurial version of the International Finance Corp (IFC), the arm of the World Bank that seeks to promote private-sector development in the third world. In eastern Europe, EMC could compete with the public-sector European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has taken direct equity stakes in enterprises. EMC offers investors considerable expertise in development and finance. Mr Qureshi was until recently in charge of operations at the World Bank  - one of two senior vice-presidents under Mr Lewis Preston, the president. Mr Roth is currently the bank's treasurer, its senior financial officer. Mr Higgins was head of investment banking at Salomon and previously head of mergers and acquisitions. EMC aims to operate in Asia, Latin America, eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Mr Qureshi said he expected eastern Europe to be an important market but to develop slowly. In the former Soviet republics, the group would seek 'enclave-type projects' where returns were likely to be independent of the economy's overall performance. Although focusing initially on direct equity stakes, EMC will seek to take advantage of growing opportunities for stock market investment as capital markets deepened in developing countries and former communist economies. Mr Qureshi said opportunities were far greater than generally appreciated. He expected portfolio investment in emerging markets to expand from about Dollars 20bn now to about Dollars 100bn by the end of the decade.</p>

The two countries are in dispute  over American access to the Japanese market with Japan resisting  a push by the United States for specific targets.    Australia says it favors any opening of the Japanese market,  but is opposed to any managed trade targets. Trade Minister Bob  McMullan says Australia has been monitoring events through its  embassies and Tokyo.    [Begin McMullan recording] I have issued an instruction to  both embassies to reiterate Australia's concerns to those  governments that we would be concerned if there was a failure to  reach an agreed outcome. But at this stage, I think it is too  early to talk about looming trade wars. There is robust debate  about how a dispute that both sides regard as important, but I  don't think it is beyond the capacity to resolve it. [end  recording]</p>

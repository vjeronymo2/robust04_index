			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stefano Brusadelli: "Oscar Targeted"] </F>   [Text] The Second Republic: the battle at the  presidential palace, the Quirinale.    Accused by former Sisde [Intelligence and Democratic  Security Service] agents, threatened by assassination plots, and  challenged by his former DC [Christian Democratic Party] friends  who are against holding early elections, President Scalfaro is  under attack. However, he does not seem to be giving up.    "No, I do not think he has any lost weight at all. In fact,  he wanted me to give him the Donald Duck pin I always wear in my  button hole. Of course, he is tense, but he is holding up well.  And I have understood why. He is sustained by two great  resources: His Roman Catholic upbringing has taught him  patience; and his experience as a magistrate has given him the  conviction that, sooner or later, he will be able to unravel  this mess." PSDI [Italian Socialist Democratic Party] Secretary  Enrico Ferri is also a magistrate and is also up to his neck in  troubles with a party that is dissolving and with the upcoming  elections. But on Tuesday, 11 January, he went to the Quirinale,  and now he speaks, with the affection of a friend, about the  drama of Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.    The gentlemanly President Scalfaro has been muddied and  threatened with new disclosures and even attempts on his life.  He was the man chosen to ensure and guide the transition to the  Second Republic. Now he is in danger of going down with the  First Republic, whose end he himself wanted to hasten, by  accepting Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's resignation and  dissolving Parliament after only 21 months.    So, the Quirinale is living the most difficult moments of  the  Scalfaro era. The palace is under maximum surveillance. On duty  inside are the body guards, and outside, the ROS [Special  Operations Section] units of the Carabinieri are even equipped  with laser weapons. The presidential secretary general, Gaetano  Gifuni, has strictly forbidden Scalfaro's entire staff, even his  highest level colleagues, to release statements to the press.  Even when he leaves the palace, reporters are no longer allowed  to approach the head of state. When he visited Catania before  Christmas, an army of 800 agents was mobilized to ensure his  safety. More and more often, Scalfaro goes to mass in the chapel  inside the Quirinale. He constantly changes his routine without  notice: spending one night in his private home in the Forte  Bravetta quarter and the next night in the Quirinale. He can use  the small apartment in the little Fuga palace, which was  Francesco Cossiga's favorite for his afternoon rests, or else  the other rooms that have been readied for the emergency from  among the 2,000 rooms in the great palatial residence. In a  couple of months, the presidential apartment will also be ready  at the end of the Manica Lunga wing, which has remained  uninhabited since the times of [former President] Giovanni  Leone. It is a 500-square-meter apartment in the shape of a T,  with four bedrooms, two living rooms, a kitchen, a private  dining room, and another enormous dining room for receiving  guests.    Scalfaro is a man alone. It seems ironical that, in order to  portray him, we cannot avoid using the adjective, "alone," which  had become the distinctive characteristic of the last moments of  Cossiga's presidency, that seven-year term that Scalfaro had to  banish. And now he, too--just like his predecessor who visited  him on the afternoon of Friday, 7 January, to offer his full  support--finds himself threatened and surrounded by a wall of  ice.    This is not due just to the disclosures about the Sisde  scandal. His own party, his beloved DC, does not forgive him for  his decision to call for immediate elections, which was as much  a slap to those tortured by the nightmare of not getting  reelected as it was to Mino Martinazzoli, who is in great need  of more time to build his new Popular Party. Rumors that  Scalfaro would resign immediately following the elections were  rampant and even expressed out loud by DC group leader Gerardo  Bianco. They indicate a hostility resembling a vendetta carried  out in words. Today, most of Parliament, which was his great  love, regards him with scorn. It is not convinced of the new,  unknown direction the head of the state has chosen.    "Of course it does not, because for the first time in the  history of the Republic," says constitutional expert Augusto  Barbera of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], "the  Quirinale is not dissolving Parliament because it cannot resolve  a governmental crisis. It is doing so because it no longer feels  Parliament represents the country and because it wants to allow  a new electoral law to be implemented." That is the refrain that  Scalfaro obsessively repeats to everyone he encounters. But it  is a subjective evaluation and an extremely delicate one. It has  only two precedents, both in distant times: in 1913, when  universal suffrage was granted, and in 1919, when they passed  from a majoritarian electoral system to a proportional one. It  is a hard pill to swallow.    Even an old friend of the president, Alfredo Biondi of the  PLI [Italian Liberal Party], went to the Quirinale on Wednesday,  12 January, and gave vent to his rage: "Oscar, you cannot offer  the Italians a musical instrument that cannot be played yet. It  takes time to make a majoritarian system work. You can see that,  can't you? The alliances are far from complete, and we risk  having more confusion than ever...."    It is causing the head of state a lot of mental anguish.  Almost all his traditional reference points are against him,  while at his side he--who has always been anti-Communist--finds  Achille Occhetto, who hopes to come away a winner in the spring  elections. The private portrait of the besieged president is a  mixture of anguish, nervousness, and a display of serenity  worthy of a Christian martyr. Enzo Bianco, who as mayor had  welcomed him to Catania, recalls with affection that he had  often caught him gritting his teeth--the only, almost  imperceptible sign of tension.    Tuesday, 11 January, as he was leaving the palace of the  Constitutional Court, where he had gone for the 1994 opening  session of the Court, was the first time Scalfaro responded  rudely to a reporter who had managed to approach him. This is  another sign of his distress. At the reception at the Quirinale  during the holidays, the head of the Lega Senators, Francesco  Speroni, had approached Scalfaro warmly and remarked on the  abundance of Piedmontese specialties in the buffet. He received  a cold response: "My maitre d' attended hotel school in Stresa."  There are even moments of anger. There are whispers about the  rage of the president when he read a comment attributed to  Martinazzoli that "the Quirinale is a hostage of the PDS." There  was a phone call that attempted to clarify the matter between  the two men, but the incident has not been totally forgotten.    So there have been many dark moments. However, they have  been  tempered by the resources of a man who has a very strong  character. Capuchin Friar Igino Ciabattoni, who was Scalfaro's  spiritual advisor for many years and is now involved in a drug  rehabilitation facility in the Marches, waxes lyrical about his  friend Oscar. He says that because he "is a Franciscan lay  brother, he has a clear conscience as big and deep as the  ocean." Christian Democrat Luigi Granelli, another old friend  who went to see him on Tuesday, 11 January, mentions a rare  moment of happiness. They had discussed the pope's letter to the  Italian bishops. "It is a different field," said a pleased  Scalfaro, "but the call for Italian unity from such an  authoritative source is moving."  <H5>  The Nightmare of Misfortune </H5>   Among the things that soothe the president are the flower  arrangements his daughter Marianna expertly composes with  blossoms from the Quirinale gardens and the hearty bowls of  pasta seasoned with hot red pepper that he puts away. This is  the head of state's favorite dish, and he has not cut down on  its consumption in recent weeks. His official activity has not  fallen off either. On the contrary, he has made a show of  remaining very busy, almost as if he wanted to emphasize his  role of trustee in all aspects of the country's life. For  example, military leaders, the Palermo Prosecutor Gian Carlo  Caselli, and the anti-Mafia Prosecutor Bruno Siclari have all  visited the president since the beginning of 1994.    While the First Republic is in the throes of death, the  nightmare of misfortune that has befallen all the DC presidents  since the days of Antonio Segni again hangs over the  presidential palace. The prince of astrologers, Peter Van Wood  from Holland, had told Scalfaro in a restaurant near  Montecitorio [Chamber of Deputies building] a year before it  happened that Scalfaro would be elected president. Now he is  predicting his early resignation, "by his own choice, however,  out of moral revulsion." But Mayor Bianco did notice something  during the presidential visit to Catania before Christmas. After  kneeling in prayer in the Cathedral of Sant'Agata before the  skull of the saint covered in porcelain and precious stones,  Scalfaro invited the chorus that was chanting the "Hallelujah"  to sing in the Quirinale at Christmas time in 1994.</p>

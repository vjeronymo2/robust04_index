			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Pretoria seeks to calm fears on spending South Africa's government of national unity yesterday sought to play down fears of a sharp rise in public spending on socio-economic development, with top finance officials promising to maintain fiscal discipline and fight inflation. Mr Jay Naidoo, the minister charged with implementing the reconstruction and development programme, said in Pretoria that the government was aiming to maintain macroeconomic balance and reduce public debt while improving the delivery of public goods and services. He was reacting to estimates released this week showing that the reconstruction programme will cost R80bn-R90bn (Pounds 14.6bn-Pounds 16.5bn) over five years, more than double the R39bn cost which the African National Congress put on the programme during campaigning for the all-race elections which it won last month. Mr Naidoo stressed that the programme had to be funded, at least in its early stages, from savings within the current budget rather than through 'add-on' expenditure. While he insisted that an adequate amount would be available this year to kick-start the programme and to show that 'we will visibly be able to deliver something to our people', most of the money would come from redirecting spending and improving government efficiency. This commitment to fiscal discipline is expected to be reflected in the government's first budget, to be submitted to parliament on June 22. It is understood that the budget will not deviate fundamentally from a 'mock budget' released in March which provides for a real cut in government expenditure and a budget deficit of 6.4 per cent of gross domestic product, just below last year's 6.8 per cent figure. Expenditure of R124.8bn would be just over 8 per cent more than last year's R115.2bn, well below the inflation rate of nearly 10 per cent. No increase in the general level of taxation is foreseen, though there could be rises in so-called sin taxes on tobacco and alcohol, a new capital transfer tax and possible changes to value added taxes to exempt basic foodstuffs but raise taxes on luxury items. Mr Derek Keys, the former industrialist who was reappointed finance minister last week, is expected to present the budget plans to the cabinet on Monday. President Nelson Mandela will give some details of economic policy when he delivers his state of the nation address to parliament the following day. Mr Keys' economic team includes Mr Naidoo as minister without portfolio and Mr Alec Erwin as deputy finance minister. While both are ANC members and former trade unionists, the team appears unanimous in endorsing the need for fiscal discipline. However, independent economists question whether sufficient savings can be made to fund the programme as planned. Officials give no details of where savings will be found, though it is understood that spending on security forces will be targeted. At the same time, however, there will be pressure on government spending from the creation of nine new regional bureaucracies, as well as demands for affirmative action within the public service coupled with pre-election commitments not to sack white civil servants. Government spending will also be slightly increased because of the extra costs of the recent election, which officials put at under R1bn.</p>

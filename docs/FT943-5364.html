			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Nigerian regime defeats oil workers' strike The leaders of Nigeria's two oil workers' unions yesterday called off their two-month-old strike aimed at forcing an end to military rule. A spokesman for the leaders of the unions Nupeng and Pengassan, who last month were barred from their posts by military decrees, said they had only decided to 'suspend' their action 'in the interest of the suffering masses  .the economy and the oil industry'. However, an attempt to resume the strike action is almost certainly to fail in the wake of the waning support among their members, some of whom had already returned to work. 'We have asked all our members to resume work immediately, and from tomorrow they should all be back to work,' said the spokesman, Mr Arthur Onoviran. The unions said that they still stood by their demands for the military government to uphold the undeclared victory of Mr Moshood Abiola in last year's presidential poll, release him from jail and restore the democratic institutions that were swept aside in November. The unions are also demanding reforms in the state's management of the oil industry, where under-investment has led to heavy job losses. During August, the strike cut more than a quarter from Nigeria's 2m-barrels-a-day output of crude oil, the country's only major export, and severely disrupted national fuel distribution. Most of the lost production was at Shell's onshore operations, while offshore producers were largely unaffected, with Chevron raising output 12 per cent, according to industry sources. The companies said last week that production staff were returning to the oil fields and that tanker drivers in Lagos and the country's south-west had resumed work. Nigeria's main oil refinery at Port Harcourt was again producing, and the fuel depots were open. The oil workers became isolated in their struggle against General Sani Abacha's regime, which has rejected demands to hand over to civilian rule and release Mr Abiola. Strikes in other sectors of the economy were shortlived or haphazard, and the movement to end military rule lacked political leadership, despite strong popular support, especially in Mr Abiola's native south-west. The end of the strike leaves the government in its strongest position in several months Mr Abiola and several of his outspoken supporters are in jail, a strike in the most important industry has been broken, the national executive of the oil unions has been replaced by government nominees and the government has carried the army in the clampdown against pro-democracy forces. Without a government in waiting - a cohesive political movement to take control if the government were to fail to rally the strikers during a long haul - the oil workers could not achieve their aims. The strike has proved that an oil industry stoppage is a powerful weapon in a long campaign against a government in Nigeria but alone cannot bring down a determined regime. The multinational oil companies successfully replaced strikers at the oil fields with senior management or expatriates usually employed in other jobs, and the government was prepared to accept a 25 per cent drop in exports for the foreseeable future, despite the effect on Nigeria's balance of payments and the long-term damage to the oil industry's investment and production capacity caused by the stoppage. Mr Abiola's future obviously remains in doubt. He has been in detention since his arrest in June for declaring himself president on the anniversary of his unofficial victory in the 1993 presidential election. He faces charges of treason. Fears about Mr Abiola's health led to repeated demands at the weekend that he be allowed hospital treatment.</p>

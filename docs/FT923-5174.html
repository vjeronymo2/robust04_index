			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Fisons up on drug stories THE RUMOUR factory got to work on Fisons ahead of the pharmaceutical group's interim results, scheduled for release next week. Old speculation that a bid for the group was imminent resurfaced, as did the recurring story that Fisons' Opticrom drug is to be reinstated in the US. The shares jumped 12 in early trade and then drifted with the market to close a net 5 ahead at 173p. Hoare Govett, which was recommending the shares last week, was blamed for the rumours. However, Hoare's Mr James Culverwell was keen to disassociate himself. 'I think there is no prospect of a bid in the near term,' said Mr Culverwell. He was also sceptical about the imminent return of Opticrom and argued that the shares were merely recovering after being oversold. ICI, which was pinpointed as the potential bidder for Fisons, dipped 2 to 1063p. Courtaulds weak Chemicals group Courtaulds fell sharply in early trading as an agency broker lowered its forecasts for the company. The shares were down 20 at one stage and closed 17 off at 412p. James Capel cut its forecast for the year ending March 1993 by Pounds 15m to Pounds 200m and for the following year by the same amount to Pounds 220m. Capel analyst Mr David Ingles said the reduction reflected pressures in various businesses throughout the world and the weakness of the Australian and US dollar. The new current year prediction compares with an existing range of between Pounds 210m and Pounds 215m but it was felt that estimates are about to be adjusted. Capel said the prospect of a general review had prompted it to remain cautious on the stock in spite of believing that the shares are almost at a support level. Shares in leisure group Rank Organisation were friendless and retreated sharply after securities house Kleinwort Benson weighed in with a profits downgrading. With an eye on last week's profits warnings and downgrades in the brewing sector, Kleinwort reduced its current year estimate for Rank by Pounds 17m to Pounds 228m, and the following year's by a more severe Pounds 34m to Pounds 287m. The securities house cited concern about the company's level of business at Butlin's holiday worlds, and at Rank's holiday centre operator Haven and Warner, as well as in its casinos, discos and North American leisure interests. Rank closed 14 weaker at 490p after thin trading for the stock. Automotive and aerospace group Lucas Industries came under further pressure as worries over the dividend intensified, sending the shares tumbling to a 7 1/2 -year low. Sentiment was also depressed by news that members of the company's staff pension fund are suing the fund's trustees over the transfer of money to Lucas towards the end of last year. The stock finished 5 down at 78p, its lowest level since January 1985, after brisk turnover of 2.5m shares. Mr John Goldschmidt at broker Charterhouse Tilney, however, remained unconvinced about the likelihood of a dividend cut, and said the continued decline of the share price made the company a bid target. He added: 'If the Lucas share price stays at current levels over the next six months, a bid is a racing certainty because there is value in the company.' Unravelling of the Electricity Package ahead of its demise tomorrow put it, and most of the related utilities, under pressure. The package fell Pounds 85 to Pounds 3155. Builders were under continuing pressure following gloomy statistics last week and worries about a possible rise in interest rates. George Wimpey, the UK's second biggest housebuilder, dropped 12 to 85p on growing concern over the safety of the dividend, and Barratt Developments slid 8 to 41p. North of England housebuilder Persimmon plunged 25 to 148p as first-half profits of Pounds 7.25m, at the bottom of the range of expectations, prompted forecast cuts. BZW came down to Pounds 15m from Pounds 19m for the current year, and by Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 17.5m for 1993. Electrical and engineering group GEC bucked the market trend and picked up 3 1/2 to 237p, with Hoare Govett reiterating its buy stance after press reports that the group's defence division had won a Pounds 50m order for in-flight entertainment. Hoare said GEC has set a target of half of its defence sales coming from the civil market by the end of the century. British Gas continued to slide after disappointing interims last week. SG Warburg reiterated its sell recommendation and published a note confirming its reduced profits forecast - down to Pounds 890m from Pounds 1.164bn and around the bottom of the range. Gas finished 3 1/2 lower at 238p. Pharmaceuticals were undermined by dollar weakness over the long weekend. SmithKline Beecham, which announced job cuts and withdrawal from some areas of long-term research, was down 11 at 443p, and Glaxo fell 16 to 706p. Conglomerate Tomkins was reported to have been a weak market on vague talk that the company may be looking to make an acquisition in the near future. The shares closed at 205p after a two-for-one share split came into effect. Business services group BET fell 10 to 104p, making it one of the day's biggest falls in the FT-SE Index. Securities house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was reported to have downgraded profit expectations. Publisher Reed International held up well in spite of an announcement that Moody's Investors Service said it might downgrade Reed subsidiary Reed Publishing. The unit's senior unsecured debt is currently rated AA3 and about Dollars 725m (Pounds 364.3m) of long-term debt is affected. One analyst said the Moody's announcement was surprising because 'Reed's interest cover is over six times, gearing is not particularly high and margins are not under pressure'. Reed eased 2 to 468p. Speculation that British Aerospace was about to clinch the long predicted order for Tornado and Hawk aircraft from Saudi Arabia boosted the shares by 7 to 205p.

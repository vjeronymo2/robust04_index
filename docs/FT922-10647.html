			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Institutions demand fair shares for all: An unusual flexing of shareholder muscle at Worcester Group's annual meeting Shareholders in Worcester Group will meet today and display an unusual flexing of institutional muscle. They will decide whether to challenge the sale of the company to Robert Bosch, the privately held German conglomerate. The case raises critical questions about corporate governance and the extent to which boards of directors must treat all shareholders equally, even to the detriment of their own interests. The Association of British Insurers, the powerful trade body representing some of the aggrieved shareholders, has also expressed concern about the issue. Investors holding at least 25 per cent of Worcester's shares are expected today to vote to ask the Takeover Panel to review a decision different terms to management and outside shareholders. Worcester's management and its families control 38 per cent of the company, giving them an unusually high degree of influence over the company's fate. This has allowed them, say some shareholders, to obtain terms which breach the first principle of the Takeover Code, that all shareholders be treated similarly by a bidder. The dissident shareholders are unhappy with two aspects of the deal. First, they feel the cash price of 225p is too low, with 300p a more realistic price. Second, they object to the separate deal being offered to management, who will have a 32 per cent stake in the merged business, and receive dividends on their shares. There is a formula to buy them out in 1996 at a price between 100p and 393 1/2 p depending on the earnings achieved by Worcester up to then. 'Preserving the interests of non-management shareholders is a very critical issue,' said one member of the Takeover Panel. Even if Worcester shareholders fail to press their case, therefore, the Takeover Panel is likely to take the matter up at one of its quarterly meetings, the member added. With cross-border mergers on the rise, the issue is unlikely to die with the culmination of the Worcester deal. Continental takeovers are usually agreed deals with management; complaints by shareholders are rare. These companies have yet to come to terms with the emerging assertiveness of UK institutional investors. In this case, Bosch insisted on obtaining irrevocable commitments from shareholders totalling more than 50 per cent of the company before its bid became public. None of the dissenting shareholders argue against the deal in terms of industrial logic. The merger of Bosch's Junkers boiler business with Worcester, the UK's largest manufacturer of combination boilers, would give a leading position in two main European markets and a platform from which to dominate the rest of Europe. But industrial logic matters little to outside shareholders since they are being offered cash, not a continuing interest in the merged business. Mr Cecil Duckworth, chairman and chief executive of Worcester, remains convinced that the deal with Bosch offers the best future for the company and its employees. He acknowledges there is a conflict of interest between 'getting it right industrially and looking after outside shareholders'. Originally, he had hoped to negotiate a deal with Bosch under which the German group would take a 20 or 25 per cent stake initially. But he realised that it would be 'a bit much to ask Bosch to pay up' to buy the rest of the group after the benefits of the alliance began to flow through. The only way forward was a full bid, he says. He says the 225p offer looked a good premium over the shares' 168p price at the time terms were struck. But the post-election stock market surge reduced that premium. Mr Duckworth points out that at least three large institutional shareholders considered the price attractive, so Bosch was able to tie up 51 per cent of the votes. He thinks that shareholders are only raising the issue of similar treatement in order to induce Bosch to pay them more for their shares. The price is considered 'fair and reasonable' by Mr Michael Davies, Worcester's only independent director. Mr Davies says he was involved in the negotiations of the 225p price, which he agrees is 'at the bottom end of the bracket' of valuations. But he says it is a fair and reasonable price, and his view is backed by Smith New Court, Worcester's financial adviser. Mr Davies also believes that the management deal is fair compared with the cash offer. Dissenting shareholders acknowledge that they are fighting an uphill battle. Should the Takeover Panel reject their arguments, they could collectively decline to tender their shares. If holders of more than 25 per cent of the shares stick together, they could keep the Stock Exchange quotation for the shares and block any effort by Bosch to restructure its new subsidiary. Eventually Bosch might have to buy them out at a higher price. One recent precedent is discouraging for the dissident shareholders, however. When DRG, the packaging group, was acquired through a Pounds 697m leveraged bid by Pembridge Investments, unhappy shareholders met to discuss action but their resistance fell apart when they failed to agree. Thus, the message for shareholders is that effective activism stems from collective efforts - a lesson UK institutions are still trying to learn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORCESTER GROUP  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Directors' interests                                    31 DEC 1991                          Ordinary               Ordinary                            shares                  share                                                  options  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cecil Duckworth         9,000,000                      - Nigel Collis            1,256,000                206,830 Clive Woods                 7,500                200,000 Peter Walker              450,000                      -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Biggest shareholders  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gartmore Investment Management                      5.8% Scottish Amicable Investment Managers               4.1% Standard Life                                       3.9% TSB Group                                           3.8% Scottish Mutual Assurance                           3.2%  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

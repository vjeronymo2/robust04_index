			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FORMER KLAN LEADER SWORN IN AS MEMBER OF LA. LEGISLATURE  </P> <P> Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke overcame two last-minute efforts to block  him from taking his newly won seat in the Legislature today and was sworn in as  a member of the Louisiana House.  </P> <P> Rep. Odon Bacquet objected to letting Republican Duke take his seat, claiming  that he did not meet the residency requirement, but Bacquet's tactic failed  when the House voted 69-33 to table his motion. Duke, who now heads the  National Assn. for the Advancement of White People, then was sworn in. Outside  the Capitol, about 25 students -- both black and white -- chanted "Don't seat  Duke, keep Duke out."  </P> <P> Just before the House met, a state district judge in Metairie, which includes  Duke's district, refused a request by defeated House candidate John Treen for a  restraining order to prevent his taking the seat. Treen appealed to the state  Supreme Court.  </P></p>

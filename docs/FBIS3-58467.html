Leotard was referring to UN plans to reopen the airport at  the Moslem enclave of Tuzla and to relieve Canadian troops  blocked in the Srebrenica enclave.    Leotard told journalists that if no action was taken, "the  risks will be even greater if we refuse to carry out the  essential task of our armies, which is protection of human  dignity."    At Tuzla, the minister said, Swedish peacekeepers "need a  Danish unit with heavy Leopard tanks and communications systems"  to allow the airport to be reopened. Effective air support from  NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) warplanes was also  needed, he said.    The 12 tanks are at present at Pancevo, near Belgrade. They  will have to skirt Bosnia to the west and be shipped to Split  before reaching Tuzla by road, an informed source said.    Earlier Leotard told the National Assembly's defence  committee that starting the Tuzla and Srebrenica operations  depended on UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali who on  Thursday was due to meet his representative for former  Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi.    A parliamentary sources said that plans were underway for a  relief corridor between the Dalmatian coast and the capital,  Sarajevo.    Meanwhile in Belgrade, Bosnian Serb chief of staff General  Manojlo Milovanovic warned that NATO air strikes against Bosnian  Serb positions would directly threaten the UN Protection Force.    In an interview in Thursday's POLITIKA paper, he said: "Let  them bomb, but by doing so they put the UNPROFOR [United Nations  Protection Forces] units directly in danger, to say nothing of  the Croat and Moslem forces in direct contact with the Serb  forces on all the fronts in Bosnia-Herzegovina."</p>

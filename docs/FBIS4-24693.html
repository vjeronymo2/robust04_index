[passage indistinct] The army officers  transferred to civilian work and the retired armymen placed in  the province have made great contributions to building the  province on various fronts and to building the socialist  material and spiritual civilizations. The province has persisted  in the principle of letting the party manage the armed forces  and have energetically strengthened the building of militia and  reserve service forces, thus enabling the province's national  defense and reserve forces to grow and expand in the course of  carrying out reform and opening up. Since the beginning of this  year, a total of 600,000 militiamen and reserve service men have  participated in [words indistinct] and have undertaken and  completed more than 100 construction projects.

Wang Jinshan made a speech at the conclusion of the report  meeting. He pointed out: Qian Bo's report has stressed on a  variety of contents, ranging from history to present, from the  world to the domestic China, from the economy to national  defense, from the content of the law to the enforcement of the  law, and from achievements to problems. On the occasion of  marking the 10th anniversary of the promulgation of the present  military service law, we should conscientiously master this law  in the course of studying, propagating, and implementing it.    Wang Jinshan pointed out in his speech: We should make  greater efforts to profoundly launch the activities of studying  and propagating the military service law throughout the  province. We should spread the ideas that performing military  service according to law is the bound duty of citizens and  showing concern for and supporting the building of national  defense is the duty of the whole society. We should regularize  the propaganda of national defense building, with the military  service law as the major content, in order to firmly foster  throughout the province the sense of national defense, the sense  of the legal system, and the idea of preforming military service  according to law. In combination with the studying and  propaganda of the military service law, we should inspect and  summarize the items stipulated by the military service law, and  then find out problems in order to enforce the law in a  down-to-earth manner.    In his speech, Wang Jinshan stressed: Leading cadres at all  levels should be fully aware of their exemplary and leading role  and should serve as the model in studying, propagating, and  implementing the military service law. At the same time,  leaders of party committees and governments at all levels should  firmly grasp the principle of letting the party manage armed  forces, actually list the armed forces work as a major item of  their daily agenda, show concern for and support the national  defense building, and resolve some major problems and adopt  correct policy decisions in a timely manner in order to ensure  the successful building of reserve forces and the successful  fulfillment of all military tasks.</p>

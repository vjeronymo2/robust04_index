Some 20,000 worshipers, all  from Jerusalem, arrived for the prayers. The closure of the  territories did not permit Muslims from other places to arrive  for the prayers. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that  very large police forces are present in the area. The police  have evacuated all Jewish worshipers from the Western Wall  compound.</p>

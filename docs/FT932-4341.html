			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Kurdish rebels declare war on Turkey Kurdish rebels declared all-out war on Turkey yesterday and the government vowed to destroy them, setting the stage for another bloody summer in the south-east, Reuter reports from Ankara. Mr Abdullah Ocalan, head of the Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK), said he was resuming the military struggle because Ankara had ignored the unilateral ceasefire the PKK declared in March. Some 330 people, most of them PKK rebels, have been killed in the mainly Kurdish south-east since the PKK seized and killed 33 soldiers in May.</p>

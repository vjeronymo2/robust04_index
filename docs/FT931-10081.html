			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Charter deal welcomed IN A POOR session in the market, the spotlight fell on the day's biggest deal, in which industrial group Charter Consolidated finally offloaded its 38.3 per cent holding in metals refiner Johnson Matthey. The deal was executed in two parts. A 20 per cent stake was sold to a company jointly owned by Johannesburg Consolidated Investment and Minorco. In an unexpected move, the remaining 18.3 per cent was quickly placed in the market with institutions by BZW and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The two securities houses were reported to have paid 455p a share and passed the stake on at 456p. Turnover in Johnson Matthey jumped to 66m as the stock dropped 19 to 473p, while Charter followed the market lower and closed 28 down at 656p. Mr Rob Davies at Lehman Brothers said: 'This is a good deal for Charter. In addition, it not only removes the uncertainty over Johnson Matthey but also increases the liquidity in the stock.' Following the sale, speculation about how Charter was to use the proceeds of the deal did the rounds. One view was that it may buy out the 35.8 per cent stake in Charter held by Minorco. Another view was that it may bid for engineering group Vickers, 2 firmer at 124p. Storehouse falls Hints that the chief executive of Storehouse might be about to leave the group sent the shares into swift retreat amid unusually heavy turnover of 8.9m. The rumours in the UK market appeared to centre on an article in a US trade magazine which suggested that Mr David Dworkin had been approached by Carter Hawley Hale, the Los Angeles-based store chain. Storehouse refused to comment although a statement is expected today. The shares fell heavily, slipping 17 before recovering to close 11 off at 194p. Stores specialists said that, if true, the news would spell an uncertain time for the shares, which have staged a dramatic recovery, climbing from 85p in January last year. Mr Dworkin is credited with having turned Storehouse around and analysts said finding a comparable executive replacement would be difficult. Wellcome firm Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome was one of the rare bright spots in a depressed FT-SE 100 Index as two securities houses recommended the stock. The shares held firm all day and closed 10 higher at 895p. Mr Robin Gilbert of broking house Panmure Gordon issued a 16-page analysis highlighting Wellcome as the key buy in the sector. He said Zovirax, the group's anti-herpes drug, and Retrovir, its anti-Aids treatment, were the only two headline drugs in the sector which were cheaper in the US than in Europe. Consequently, they were less likely to come under pressure from the Clinton administration, which has promised to attack the whole area of drug pricing. Also, US house Lehman Brothers was advising its clients to switch out of SmithKline Beecham, arguing that Wellcome was cheaper in price/earnings terms. SmithKline 'A' fell 15 1/2 to 448 1/2 p and the Units 15 to 389p. Waters wanted The water sector moved sharply higher just before the close after suggestions that Ofwat, the water industry watchdog, is about to tell the water companies that increased efficiency in their core businesses could be passed on to shareholders via dividend payments. But, utilities specialists pointed out, inefficient companies would have their dividend payouts restricted. Talk that letters confirming Ofwat's efficiency/dividend strategy will be received by the water companies today saw the sector substantially outperform the wider market. Welsh Water was seen as a prime beneficiary of the move and raced up 11 to 552p, closely followed by Wessex Water, which settled 7 better at 597p; Wessex nil-paid closed 6 firmer at 113p. Other good performances in the sector came from Southern, 5 ahead at 492p, and Northumbrian, 4 harder at 566p. US sells Reuters US analysts took a harder view on the full-year figures from Reuters Holdings than their UK colleagues and early firmness in the stock was undermined when Wall Street opened. Reuters profit of Pounds 382.2m was so close to UK analysts' forecasts that the share price gave virtually no response. The chief executive's statement, traditionally cautious, was relatively upbeat and the market liked the near 25 per cent rise in the dividend. Early indications suggested forecasts for this year would rise to between Pounds 430m and Pounds 440m. The shares were marginally higher at one stage but US analysts had been expecting more from the results and US selling took the London price to a close of 15 off at 1382p. The financial areas of the market remained among the market's favourities to provide the next heavy rights issue. Lloyds Bank assumed the role of the bank most likely to ask shareholders for cash and dipped 17 to 517p. Sun Alliance's Pounds 155m convertible bond issue lifted lingering fears of a rights issue but did not prevent the shares declining 9 to 333p. Commercial Union remained the sector favourite to launch a fund-raising attempt and the shares lost 22 more to 598p. Specialists said the 11 1/2 per cent and 8 3/4 per cent yields on CU's two tranches of preference stock issued last year were looking demanding and could be replaced with equity capital. The prospect of a broad agreement on output cuts at this weekend's Opec meeting prompted another strong performance from an oil sector boosted by a further slide in sterling. British Gas receded 6 1/2 to 283 1/2 p, unsettled by the Ofgas annual report, and profits downgrades instigated by Hoare Govett, the company's broker. Hoare cut its 1992 net income estimate to Pounds 865m and its 1993 figure to Pounds 980m, in spite of emphasising its positive stance on the stock. Aran Energy was the market's second most heavily traded stock with more than 14m shares changing hands. Smith New Court was responsible for most of the buying after publishing a strong buy recommendation. Aran closed 2 1/2 up at 23 1/2 p. Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries led the downward trend as SG Warburg Securities nudged back its stance on the shares. The stock hit 967p before rallying to close 18 off at 976p. Further speculation over the terms and conditions of the Kingfisher bid for Darty, the French electrical retailer, left the market none the wiser. Yesterday's focus was again on the level of the rights issue that will be required to finance any offer, with a variety of rumours circulating. The strongest suggested an announcement was imminent over a one-for-12 call at 480p. All combined to weaken the shares, which had performed well in recent sessions as fears of a Pounds 1bn issue were scaled down. The shares closed 5 adrift at 526p. Another bid target, Clifford Foods, added 2 at 515p, while one of its rumoured predators, Unigate, put on 4 at 331p. A line of 5m shares in Albert Fisher was said to have unsettled the stock, off 6 at 66p. Hunting jumped 13 to 233p after the company announced the sale of its protective coatings subsidiary to Williams Holdings. Mr Clive Forrestier-Walker at Charterhouse Tilney said the deal would enhance profits at Hunting substantially over the next two years. Williams closed 2 lighter at 342p. British Steel remained active and turnover rose to 9.4m as the shares lost 2 to 75p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (225).

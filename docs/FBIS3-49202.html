			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Jan 5 (TANJUG)--U.S. Ambassador to the  United Nations Madeleine Albright said sanctions might be  imposed against Croatia if it did not heed warnings to refrain  from interfering in the Bosnian civil war.    Albright made the statement on Wednesday when replying to a  question on how Washington would react to Croatia rendering  military assistance to the Bosnian Croats. Albright underlined  that Washington had often discussed the situation in Bosnia and  that Croatia would face sanctions if it did not change its  stand. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman recently threatened the  Moslems that Croatia would openly intervene in  Bosnia-Herzegovina unless they stopped their offensive against  the Croats.    Erstwhile allies in the war against the Bosnian Serbs, the  Croats and Moslems fell to fighting fiercely last spring over  territories in central and south-western Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Co-chairman of the Yugoslav Peace Conference Lord Owen said  in Vienna on Tuesday it was a public secret that Croatia already  has regular troops in Bosnia. This was confirmed by UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] reports.    Regular Croatian troops have been involved in the Bosnian  civil war since it broke out in April 1992. Their number at the  end of last year was estimated at 60,000.</p>

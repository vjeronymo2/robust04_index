			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / How To Spend It: In dark times, it's time for beauty / Review of three exhibitions which celebrate the very best in craftsmanship TIMES MAY be tough but beautiful things, happily, are always with us. This week three companies, Tiffany, Cobra &amp; Bellamy and The Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, all concerned with the nurturing of creativity, of fine design and craftsmanship, fly their flags high and put on exhibitions where price and practicality are not the guiding principles. There is always the danger, in times like these, that those intricately involved with making one-off beautiful things may lose the heart and the spirit to do so. This recession is no exception: everywhere craftsmen are in trouble - eager for work, able to produce original innovative things but commissions are thin on the ground. Nobody, after all, in the strictly practical sense, really needs beautiful things - the fact that they nourish the soul, refresh the eye and uplift the heart is often forgotten. So, too, is the fact that many of these craftsmen have acquired their skills long and arduously and if they can no longer earn a living many may die out. A visit to any of these three exhibitions is a treat for the eye - a reaffirmation that that there is more to life than the daily grind. Few of us will be able to afford to buy but all will, I think, be glad to know that they are around. COBRA &amp; Bellamy (small, dark and Greek, Veronica Manussis is the Cobra and tall, blond and willowy Tania Hunter is the Bellamy) have had a long and fruitful partnership exploring the more arcane reaches of the jewellery world. Known primarily for being amongst the first to acknowledge the inherent aesthetic qualities of period costume jewellery, they then introduced Art Deco jewellery, with great panache and success, to a wider public. The shop the two friends started in London's Sloane Street has only been going since 1980 but its influence seems to have been out of all proportion to its size. Besides promulgating the virtues of period costume jewellery and Art Deco, Cobra &amp; Bellamy also embarked, some seven years ago, on a richly rewarding partnership with the Italian jewellery designer Barbara Bertagnolli. Her work is singular for uniting an uncompromising contemporary aesthetic with very fine, high quality materials and workmanship. All the pieces are hand-crafted and once seen her work is not forgotten - the strong combination of sterling silver and applied 24 carat gold with rich, colourful gemstones are the hallmark of her style. Today Cobra &amp; Bellamy customers the world over look out for new Bertagnolli pieces to add to their growing collections. From Thursday 12th November until Saturday 28th November a special collection of some 240 different pieces, every single one of which has been completely hand made by Barbara Bertagnolli herself, will be on view and on sale at Cobra &amp; Bellamy's Sloane Street shop. The jewellery this time is stronger, bolder, larger than ever before. Gemstones give the collection drama and colour - iolites, amethysts, rubies, mooonstones, garnets, emerals, tourmalines, pearls, adorn rings, bracelets, necklaces and torques. But besides the jewellery there is also a wonderfully rich and witty collection of accessories which have been adorned the Bertagnolli way - an enbonised Victorian walking cane sports four emeralds and an iolite, a black suede evening bag is embellished with pink and green tourmalines whilst a pair of silk-lined suede gloves are each given drama with a rainbow moonstone and an iolite. Look out, too, for a series of small household pieces - magnifying glasses, clocks, bookmarks, scent bottles, mirrors, pillboxes, all have been individualised and turned into collectable objects of great beauty by Barbara Bertagnolli. Given that all the pieces feature sterling silver, applied 24 carat gold and gemstones and that they are handmade and individual the prices cannot be cheap. A bookmark is about Pounds 180, the one-off individual jewellery starts at about Pounds 600 whilst larger pieces, like the necklace photographed here (which rejoices in approx 3 carat's worth of emerald, moonstones, citrines, a blue and a green tourmaline and iolites), is Pounds 5,400. There is also a small collection of rings and ear-rings which are part of what Barbara Bertagnolli calls her diffusion lines which work out considerably cheaper. All are handmade but each design is repeated three or four times. Rings start at Pounds 158, earr-rings at Pounds 180. IT IS NOT only frock-designers that have been affected by a deep bout of nostalgia - this week Tiffany takes a long and affectionate look back into its history. For those of us who think of Tiffany as a quintessentially modern store - certainly it exudes a very different air from the rest of its Bond Street neighbours - it is instructive to see such a range of beautiful pieces stretching way back into the last century. Rosa Monckton, managing director of Tiffany &amp; Co, London, is particularly thrilled at the arrival of the collection of historical pieces. 'This is the first time we have been able to show our customer the finest jewellery from the Victorian age through to the present day. We thought our customers would like to know something of the history of the store. Though we opened as recently as 1986 in London, the roots of the business go back to 1837 when Charles Louis Tiffany opened his first store at 259 Broadway.' From the beginning Tiffany developed a tradition of working with top designers of the day and his son, Louis Comfort Tiffany, was the designer behind the still sought-after Tiffany lamps. Through the years the company worked with people such as Edward Moore, the silversmith, with Schlumberger, the great designer of the 30s, with Claflin in the 70s. Claflin it was who developed a new and interesting setting for the single-stone diamond - whereas the tradition of the time was to use a prong setting he found a way of using a two-dimensional setting which threw a different light on the stone, a setting still used and much copied today. The tradition continues with a close relationship between the store and the work of Paloma Picasso and Elsa Peretti, two designers whose work one could not imagine in any other Bond Street store. Almost all the pieces on show are for sale, though just a few are museum pieces that are there simply for the role they played in the history of the company. Many of the pieces are as beautiful and as timeless as ever. Prices, given that many of these are one-off collectors' pieces, do not seem to me unreasonable. There is a 1910 pair of platinum and diamond lorgnettes that would cost Pounds 1,000. Whilst nothing is priced in the hundreds there is quite a lot of choice at under Pounds 2,000 and nearly 40 per cent of the collection is under Pounds 5,000. There is, for instance, a most beautiful Louis Comfort Tiffany necklace, made from nephrite jade and plique-a-jour enamel with freshwater pearls; dating from 1905 it is a perfect example of jewellery from the Art Nouveau period. But if all those prices are beyond you, and for most of us they will be, one of the great joys of Tiffany has always been that for under Pounds 100 you, too, can buy a little Tiffany style. There are sterling silver Elsa Peretti earrings for Pounds 85, the famous sterling silver T-clip Tiffany ballpoint pen is Pounds 45, trumpet shaped champagne flutes are Pounds 10 each, sterling silver dumbbell cufflinks are Pounds 25 each and a miniature heart-shaped perfumed flacon is Pounds 50. THE Goldsmiths' Hall, Foster Lane, London EC2V 6BN, hosts an exhibition that I hope every city tycoon or patron or the arts who from time to time has to commission something fine and beautiful will make a point of visiting. The three artists whose work is featured all work in different fields. Brian Asquith is a silversmith, George Daniels is a watch maker and Elizabeth Gate a jeweller. Each of them is a master of their field. George Daniels, for example, is said to be one of only three men in the world who can make a watch entirely by hand. From fashioning the sheet metal for the case, to the movements and the winder, every single piece is made by Daniels alone. His watches have become world-renowned, sought-after by collectors in the know. They combine the precision skills of the engineer with the beauty of the artist. His hand-made movements are more accurate than any quartz and once regulated should need no more adjusting for at least ten years. There is no shop where a George Daniels watch can be bought - his preferred method of working is to make a watch in his own meticulous, time-consuming way and when it is done to place an advertisement in The Times and sit back and wait until it is sold. Prices vary, according to the complexity of the model and the amount of time it has taken but it is, I am afraid, rather like the luxury yacht - if you need to ask the price you cannot afford it. However, we all can look, and I recommend a trip to Goldsmiths' Hall because his timepieces are a rare and exceptionally exquisite commodity. Brian Asquith, meanwhile, has taken over the whole of the white and gold room at the Goldsmiths' Hall to show just what he can do. Here is the standard fare of corporate gift-giving, transmuted into pieces of great beauty. Here a goblet, there a candlestick, over there a chalice and right beside it an official trophy. All have personality and charm and should give many a potential patron ideas of what can be done. For those who like Brian Asquith's work but are not in the market to commission it is worth noting that he has produced a range of more affordable domestic ware, all in sterling silver. Prices start at Pounds 75 for a napkin ring or a whisky measure, whilst salt and pepper mills would be Pounds 1,000 a pair. There are also candlesticks, mirrors and goblets. For a catalogue write to Brian Asquith Design Partnership, Turret House, Youlgrave, nr. Bakewell, Derbyshire DE4 1WL. Tel: 0629-636204. Finally, there is the work of Elizabeth Gage, a jeweller whose prices put her pieces way beyond the reach of most of us but who nonetheless seems to have a steady clientele. Ever since she produced her first famous Byzantine-inspired rings she has drawn inspiration from history, mythology and ancient cultures for her pieces. She uses stones beautifully - sometimes combinations of tourmalines, spinels, black jade and amethysts, at other times pearls, diamonds and other precious stones. The pieces on show at The Goldsmiths' Hall range from a stunning necklace of 18 carat gold with pearls, tourmalines and diamonds and a detachable pin to smaller, more affordable ear-rings, rings and pins. One of the hallmarks of her work is producing pieces which can be worn during the day or at night - very often by means of a detachable pin. Pieces are not for sale at the exhibition itself but Elizabeth Gage has a shop and showroom at 20, Albemarle Street, London W1 where the full range of her work can be seen. The exhibition runs until November 20.</p>

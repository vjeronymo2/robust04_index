			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Japan's ruling coalition  and the opposition agreed tonight to convene a plenary session  of the House of Representatives early tommorrow morning to vote  on a no-confidence motion against the minority government of  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, the KYODO NEWS SERVICE reported.    According to party officials, they reached the agreement at  a  meeting of directors of the lower house's steering committee.    If Hata fails to survive the no-confidence motion introduced  by the leading opposition liberal party, he must either resign  with his entire cabinet or dissolve the lower house for a snap  election.    Talks between leaders of the ruling coalition and the second  largest opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social  Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] are now under way, but  prospects seem to be dim for an agreement on a future  re-alliance.    If the coalition's efforts fail to entice the SDP back into  the governing camp, the SDP may support the no-confidence  motion, which means it would be readily approved in the lower  chamber.    The SDP and the ruling coalition remain at odds over the  resignation of Hata and the formation of a new government.    The ruling coalition has rejected demands from the SDP that  Hata and his cabinet resign en masse, the principle condition  set by the SDP for returning to the fold.</p>

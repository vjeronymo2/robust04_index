			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Common standard for VCRs The world's leading consumer electronics makers yesterday announced plans to discuss a common standard for the next generation of video tape recorders, digital VCRs, and VCRs for high definition television, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The move comes as worldwide consumer demand for electronics goods is waning, and the industry cannot afford to engage in costly wars in an area which they believe will be important in stimulating demand for new electronics products. The 10 companies, including eight Japanese companies led by Matsushita and Sony, Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France, will form a technical conference to develop a common set of specifications to prevent a damaging standards war. Digital VCRs record films from televisions or camcorders in computer language and, unlike the current generation of analogue VCRs, offer virtually perfect pictures no matter how many pictures are made.</p>

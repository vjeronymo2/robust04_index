Denktas held a one-hour meeting with Gustave Feissel today.  In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that they  exchanged views on how to determine the priority of the issues  to be discussed during the actual negotiations. The aim of this  exercise, Denktas said, is to find out?how the package will  affect the Turkish Cypriot community, what its advantages are,  and whether the benefits promised by the United Nations and by  the UN experts are real.    The president pointed out that if the answers to these  questions are positive and satisfactory, then the package of the  confidence-building measures can be implemented. He added that  he considers it useful to discuss these issues.    Denktas announced that he will meet with Feissel again on  Friday [11 February], and that the talks planned for 15 February  will be held on 17 February because of the postponed Greek  Cypriot National Council meeting.    Feissel, in turn, said that they held a beneficial meeting  with President Denktas, adding that they are working on the  agenda and issues of the talks planned to begin next week.  Replying to a question, Feissel said that the  confidence-building measures package is being regarded as a  whole.</p>

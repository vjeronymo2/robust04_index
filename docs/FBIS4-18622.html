			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mia Doornaert: "Kremlin Blows Hot and Cold About </F> Partnership for Peace -- NATO Waits To See Whether Russia Will  Sign on 21 April"]    [Text] At NATO it is still not known whether a Russian  delegation will come to sign the agreement on the Partnership  for Peace [PfP] on 21 April. Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  had held out the prospect of this date, but since then Moscow is  continuing to blow hot and cold about PfP. A day after the  Foreign Ministry said that 21 April would "probably" be  maintained, yesterday another interview appeared in which  President Boris Yeltsin said that "Russia was not in a hurry."    "We hope and expect that Russia will come and sign on 21  April, but that date has never been officially confirmed," a  NATO source told us yesterday.    In the interview with the INTERFAX press agency, Yeltsin  said  that cooperation between NATO and Russia "would have to be  different in scope and content from cooperation with other  countries." He was thinking of a "special agreement which  expressed the place and role of Russia in European and world  affairs and the military power and nuclear status of our  country."    This is where the problem lies. Russia does not want to be  treated in the same way as the 14 countries from the former East  Bloc which have so far joined the PfP. It is demanding a  special partnership which, according to various statements,  would mean among other things that NATO and Russia would jointly  guarantee the security of the countries of Central and East  Europe.    The latter point is resolutely rejected by these countries,  which want no new form of Russian guardianship. Many of these  countries, led by the four Central European countries, are  pushing for full NATO membership, which Russia is opposing  strongly.    NATO sources told us yesterday that in Russia there appeared  to be some misunderstandings about the PfP, which the NATO  summit of mid-January offered to all the member countries of the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.    The 16 NATO countries invited these countries to cooperate  with the alliance on the basis of their needs and possibilities.  The PfP offers an extensive menu containing various forms of  political and military cooperation for this purpose -- from help  with drawing up military budgets to joint peacekeeping exercises.    Therefore cooperation takes place in various stages,  according to a NATO source. "The first stage is signing a  framework agreement, in which the country shows that it is ready  to cooperate with NATO," the source said. "In a second stage  the partners present a presentation document, in which they  indicate the precise areas in which they want to cooperate. If  agreement is reached on this with the NATO Council, then  concrete cooperation can begin."  <H5>  "Special" </H5>   The source said that in this sense every agreement between  the sixteen allies and a PfP member is a "special agreement,"  because every agreement is specifically designed to match the  partner's wishes, needs and possibilities. "Once Russia has  signed the framework agreement, it can put forward a  presentation agreement which takes account of its specific  needs," the source said.    The source did not think that the alliance would work out a  special framework agreement for Russia. "The PfP was signed by  the heads of state and government leaders of the 16 member  countries," the source said. "I find it difficult to imagine  that they would meet again to work out a special membership  arrangement for Russia."    The NATO sources stressed that the alliance, "in contrast to  what is sometimes claimed in Russia," was seeking a security  structure in Europe "with Russia, not without Russia." At  present, studies are being made in NATO to see how the future  relationship between Russia and the alliance should look. "Of  course this takes account of the status of Russia as a big  country, a nuclear power, and permanent member of the Security  Council," the source said.    At the end of February a delegation made up of the U.S.,  British and Spanish ambassadors to NATO flew to Moscow to  convince Russia to join the PfP. In early March Kozyrev  announced that Russia would sign the PfP framework agreement on  21 April. But, since then, the services of President Yeltsin  have sown doubt on the issue more than once. At NATO  headquarters in Evere they are now waiting to see whether Russia  will become the fifteenth partner on 21 April.</p>

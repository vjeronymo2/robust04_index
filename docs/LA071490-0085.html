			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> BRITON'S ANTI-GERMAN DIATRIBE REFLECTS WIDE UNEASE;  </P> <P> EUROPE: MANY PRIVATELY FEAR A REUNIFIED, POWERFUL NATION, AND HOW THOSE FEARS  ARE HANDLED WILL AFFECT THE SPIRIT IN WHICH THE NEW STATE IS BORN.  </P> <P> A British Cabinet minister's anti-German diatribe in a magazine interview may  have triggered a wave of official outrage across Europe, but it has also  highlighted a large and growing double standard in attitudes toward German  unity.  </P> <P> Behind the polite applause and lofty declarations of support for German  unification echoing through the conference halls of Europe, another emotion  dominates -- a gnawing worry about the power of a united Germany.  </P> <P> It is an emotion widely felt but rarely expressed in public, a feeling that has  intensified as outsiders watch the speed and apparent ease with which unity  unfolds.  </P> <P> Admittedly, even in private, few go as far as British Trade and Industry  Secretary Nicholas Ridley did in his interview published Thursday in the  respected British weekly The Spectator.  </P> <P> In the course of a three-page interview, he described efforts to forge a  European monetary union as "a German racket designed to take over the whole of  Europe," accused France of "behaving like poodles to the Germans" and stopped  just short of comparing Adolf Hitler favorably with West German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl.  </P> <P> Even though Ridley quickly retracted his comments, made in Hungary, the level  of indignation may cost him his job.  </P> <P> "The man who the cartoonists loved to depict as a corpse (has) become one,"  Peter Jenkins of the Independent newspaper wrote. "It will be flown home from  Hungary today and buried quietly over the weekend."  </P> <P> Other commentators said Ridley would be an obstacle in negotiations with  Britain's European allies, especially West Germany.  </P> <P> While the tone of Ridley's remarks was clearly contentious, he was also  discussing a subject that politicians have tried to avoid in order not to stoke  enmity or be seen casting suspicion on an ally.  </P> <P> Indeed, some argued Friday that Ridley's only real sin was to discuss the  subject at all.  </P> <P> "As embarrassing as Ridley's comments are, it's hard to dispute that they have  brought into the public domain a subject usually discussed only on the quiet,"  commented the Swiss daily, Neue Zuercher Zeitung.  </P> <P> Added the West Germany newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau: "The feelings, the  fears, the prejudices that came from the minister's mouth are the feelings,  fears and prejudices shared by many of his countrymen."  </P> <P> How these fears are handled, both by a uniting Germany and its neighbors, will  do much to determine the spirit in which a powerful German state is born --  whether it is welcomed into the community of Western democracies or ostracized  and left to sulk as a rejected, potentially dangerous outsider.  </P> <P> "There are only two paths for German unity -- either a nationalist path or a  European path," noted Bonn University historian Karl-Dieter Bracher. "The best  way to control the Germans is binding them into an integrated Europe. Anything  else is dangerous."  </P> <P> While both German governments insist that they want unity as part of a larger  European unity, this has done little to allay the undercurrent of concern.  </P> <P> "In part, it's a generational thing," said West German spokesman Dieter Vogel.  "Younger people are more relaxed about unity.  </P> <P> "We've lived with this for a long time," Vogel added. "We'll have to live with  it a while longer."  </P> <P> In the democracies of northern Europe, there are few foreign policy issues  where private reservations contrast so sharply with unqualified public backing.  </P> <P> "It's not next month or next year I'm worried about," said a respected Western  ambassador who has served in the region for several years. "It's 10, 15 years  from now, when they've gotten used to their size and their strength -- that's  the time I worry about."  </P> <P> The 12 European Community leaders last month officially blessed unification at  their summit in Dublin. But, unofficially, more than one of those present would  have nodded approvingly at the well-known, tongue-in-cheek comment of French  author Francois Mauriac that he loved Germany so much that he was happy there  were two of them.  </P> <P> In the weeks after the Berlin Wall fell, French President Francois Mitterrand  and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher strayed from their longstanding  endorsement of German unity, until they realized that it was inevitable. Like  others who now cheer unity, they decided that to oppose German public will at  this point would be politically disastrous.  </P> <P> East Europeans also fear German unity. But free of alliance or ties to the  European Community, they express their worries more openly -- especially the  Soviet Union, where such concerns constitute a key stumbling block in  negotiations on the external aspects of unification.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Times/Economist magazine poll published last month found that  half of those surveyed in Britain and France expressed concern about a dominant  Germany. In Poland, the figure was nearly 70%. This level of public worry in  Europe is a key factor separating the Bush Administration's unwavering support  for unity from Europe's double standard.  </P> <P> When asked recently why German-American ties had become so close, Kohl's answer  was a not-so-subtle swipe at his European allies.  </P> <P> "There are some who mean it when they speak of the right to  self-determination," he said.  </P></p>

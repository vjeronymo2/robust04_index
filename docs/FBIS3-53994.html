			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Proposal To Deploy UN Forces Along the </F> Line of Control"]    [Text] Citing Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan,  the Indian English daily THE HINDU writes that Pakistan has  expressed cautious reaction over an Indian proposal to convert  the Line of Control [LOC] in Jammu and Kashmir into a line of  peace and tranquility and has given the impression that Pakistan  will be glad to hold direct talks, if this proposal reflects  India's intention to reduce the forces deployed on the LOC.  But, if India wants Pakistan to accept the current situation in  Kashmir as it is, Pakistan is not ready for it.    Whenever India accuses Pakistan of interfering in occupied  Kashmir, Pakistan puts up a proposal to have the LOC under U.N.  supervision. But, India does not accept it. India also does  not want the representatives of human rights organizations to  visit occupied Kashmir and see for themselves the human rights  violations there. Pakistan has positively responded to every  positive proposal and will continue to do so. India should have  the moral courage within itself to accept the proposal to let  the LOC be supervised by the U.N. forces or the member countries  of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.  Pakistan is also ready to consider the reduction of forces  along the LOC.</p>

Here is our correspondent Valeriy Kuts.    [Kuts, in progress as heard] ...by Moscow time, the Mi-8TM  helicopter with the terrorists and hostages on board took off,  circled the airport and town several times, and headed off for  the town of Makhachkala, but because of heavy icing, the  helicopter had to return to the airport at the town of  Mineralnyye Vody, where it landed at 0240 Moscow time [2340  GMT]. Evidently officials of law and order bodies will once  more attempt to make contact with the criminals at dawn in order  to establish their further plans. Valeriy Kuts, information  service.</p>

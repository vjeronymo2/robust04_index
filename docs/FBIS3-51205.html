			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Peru monitored through 13  January.    The Lima stock exchange registered a 150 percent increase in  1993 after a 1992 increase of 273 percent. The stock exchange's  profit was 79 percent higher than the inflation rate, which  represents the best investment in the financial market.  Specialists said this was the result of the major participation  of foreign investment, which totalled 70 percent. (Lima EXPRESO  in Spanish 3 Jan 94 p A24)    The legislative branch issued 16 decrees on the  implementation of a new tax system by which all taxes were  reduced to only 12: six for the central government and six for  the local ones. This system was in force beginning 1 January.  (Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish 4 Jan 94 p B2)    The National Exporters Association reported that the  Peruvian  trade balance registered a $532 million deficit with exports at  $3.467 billion and imports at $3.999 billion.

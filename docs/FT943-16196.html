			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Arafat looks to future capital in Jerusalem Mr Yassir Arafat flew into Jericho on an Egyptian helicopter yesterday for an emotional reunion with the West Bank after 27 years' exile, and to press his demands for a speedy expansion of Palestinian self-rule beyond Gaza-Jericho. In a whirlwind visit to the capital of Palestinian self-rule, Mr Arafat, still croaking from too many speeches during his historic four-day homecoming, blew kisses to an excited crowd, vowed to build a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, swore in the first Palestinian self-government and held a series of meetings with dignitaries and well-wishers. Mr Nabil Shaath, senior Palestinian negotiator, said Israel, which has hailed Mr Arafat's visit as a 'triumph of common sense and pragmatism', had upgraded its delegation for talks in Paris today to cover redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank and an early transfer of authority. Mr Arafat has asked Israel to redeploy its troops out of Palestinian population centres in the West Bank, the second major phase of the peace process, by August to allow Palestinian elections in mid-October. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, who will meet Mr Arafat in Paris for the first high-level negotiations since the signing in May of the Gaza-Jericho accord, vowed to strengthen the peace process with Palestinians, despite right-wing Israeli protests against Mr Arafat's return to Gaza and Jericho. 'With all the protests and the shouting, we will continue with the peace process. We got a mandate from the people and we will go on with it,' Mr Rabin told trade unionists. In Jericho, a crowd of 3,000-5,000 joyous Palestinians pushed and shoved to get their first glimpse of 'Mr Palestine'. PLO officials blamed the poor turnout on Israeli demonstrations and restrictions which stopped many Palestinians from the West Bank arriving. As soon as Mr Arafat stepped off his helicopter in a cloud of dust, one boy shouted: 'I see him, I see Abu Amar' - referring to the veteran PLO leader by his nom de guerre. Others shinned up telegraph posts and pushed against security forces, breaking down a wire-mesh fence in the frenzy to see more than the tip of Mr Arafat's head surrounded by bodyguards in olive-green uniforms. To the applause of the crowd, Mr Arafat embraced orthodox Jews in black hats and coats from the small Neturei Karta sect, which supports the creation of a Palestinian state on the grounds that it will hasten the coming of the Messiah. Mr Arafat then sped through the town centre in a convoy of jeeps, fire engines and at least 12 ambulances, their sirens wailing. Two Palestinian youths rode on horseback with the motorcade. Later Mr Arafat took the oath of office on a Koran covered with white shells, then swore in 12 members of the Palestinian national authority, a de facto cabinet. Mr Shaath, planning and economic co-operation minister, said the authority got to work in its first official meeting and took several decisions including negotiating strategy in Paris and a plan to build 25,000-30,000 new housing units and create 20,000-25,000 jobs in the next 12 months.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Bui Quoc Huy Article: "Peaceful Evolution, the Successive </F> Strategic Scheme"]    [Text] The imperialists and hostile forces have been  persistently striving in every way to sabotage the world  revolutionary movement. Ideas of the ways to eliminate  socialism with "peaceful evolution" had been nurtured since the  40s in this century when the reality of the power balance did  not allow the imperialists to use military intervention when it  so wished to topple socialism. At the end of the 80's, the  imperialists and hostile forces sparked by the successes of  "peaceful evolution" in Eastern European countries and the  former Soviet Union, pushed forward their activities in the hope  of obtaining "victory without war" in the remaining socialist  countries.    In our country, "peaceful evolution" and the activities of  the hostile forces have been and are developing new traits,  contents, forms, and maneuvers. They make clear their  intentions, aims, and action plan for the peaceful evolution  scheme in Vietnam. The contents of the scheme are comprehensive  and cover all economic, political, ideological, cultural, and  diplomatic areas. Numerous measures and forms are being  deployed flexibly. These measures are unilateral and  multilateral, with violence and without, and use governmental  and non-governmental bodies. They are peaceful and non-peaceful  evolution measures, in-depth and wide, vigorous and in careful  order using well-coordinated forces.    They constantly attack us on the political and ideological  fronts aiming to erode trust in the party leadership, separate  the party and the people, deny the glorious past of the Vietnam  revolutionary party. They also openly criticize  Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought. Our choice of  socialism and the renovation undertaking is denounced with the  hope that it will make people lose their confidence and question  their ideals. Their maneuvers are virulent and well-organized  because they combine secret with overt activities, with the  support and assistance of hostile forces to fight socialism in  our country as well as in others.    As an adjustment to the strategy, the hostile forces use  "human rights" as a major striking force against us. They  elevate "human rights" and "democracy" into strategic issues.  They blatantly accuse us of "religious oppression", "democratic  coercion", and "human rights violations". They demand that we  release "political prisoners", using it as an excuse to  interfere in our internal affairs, and advocate support for  dissident forces, while demanding for constitutional amendments,  political pluralism, an opposition- type multiparty system, and  so forth.    The hostile forces are also accelerating their secret  activities, especially in intelligence-gathering and espionage  such as in stealing national secrets. They also strive to sow  discord within our organizations, first within our party, then  state organizations, the army, and police. They expect that  from the ties forged by investment cooperations and other  projects such as cadre training, humanitarian aid, and so forth,  they will be able to convert viewpoints and ideals within our  party, and entice people with faulty thinking, and those who are  undecisive, biased, opportunistic, and greedy for either glory  or material gain. They will wait for the right opportunity to  plant spies and create "flag" wavers. From there they will form  opposition organizations and unite their internal forces to  become the opposition of the state in the "peaceful evolution"  scheme from within. When the opportunity comes they will  quickly turn to violence.    In parallel to increasing aid and directing exiled  reactionary organizations comprising overseas Vietnamese to  carry out sabotage activities from abroad, they are also make  contact with reactionary groups within the country to cause  disorder, to carry out sabotage activities and political  instability. All the methods of non-violence, peace,  "reconciliation", "harmony" in the struggle for "democracy",  "freedom", "prosperity" will be combined and slowly developed to  gain legitimacy, popularity, and internationalization, leading  the way for foreign forces to interfere and pressure us.    It is obvious that peaceful evolution activities of the  hostile forces is the next step of the basic strategy they have  been applying so far. But the scheme is now being carried out  vigorously, resolutely, with timely adjustments by new and more  cunning maneuvers.    The success of their scheme, however, is not for them to  decide. The destiny and future of our country is decided by our  party and people with correct policies and proper measures.    In implementing the renovation initiated by the Seventh  Party  Congress, our people has scored important achievement in all  economic, political, cultural, social, external relations,  national defense, and security aspects. We have continuously  freed ourselves from the obstruction and isolation of the enemy,  and created a new position in the international community. Our  country is experiencing new opportunities as well as new  challenges, and the challenges emerging from opportunities.    It is therefore the duty of the entire party, people, and  army to fight against peaceful evolution. The prime and urgent  duty is to protect the fatherland of socialist Vietnam.    To ensure the strength and ability of our country for  development, we have to maintain political stability, continue  our renovation for socioeconomic development, and fight an enemy  taking advantage of our economic reforms. We have to take care  of the people's livelihood at the same time while safeguarding  security and national defense, expanding external relations,  reforming and rectifying the party, and consolidating the  party's leadership role, and the flesh and bone relations  between the party and the people. We also have to improve the  management efficiency of the state mechanism and the socialist  legal system, and strive to heighten the people's sense of  vigilance by making them understand clearly the enemy's scheme  of peaceful evolution. By being alert, flexible, resolute, and  determined in our struggle, we will absolutely defeat all  "peaceful evolution" plots and maneuvers.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Adams may meet Congress members Mr Gerry Adams, head of Sinn Fein, is expected to meet members of both houses of the US Congress when he visits Washington next month. Mr Adams yesterday applied for a US visa, George Graham in Washington writes. Although congressional committees traditionally do not hold full hearings for foreign visitors, Mr Adams is expected to meet members of the Senate foreign relations committee for a 'committee coffee', and meetings are also likely with members of the House of Representatives. Other leading Northern Irish politicians have also been beating a path to Congress's door. Mr John Hume was due to meet senators yesterday afternoon, and a delegation of Ulster Unionists is to arrive in Washington today.</p>

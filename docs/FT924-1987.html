			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / World Trade News: US nearer to full trade ties with Vietnam PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday moved the US a step further towards normal relations with Vietnam by authorising US companies to open offices, conduct feasibility studies and sign contracts in the country. Mr Bush refused, however, to lift outright the US embargo on trade with Vietnam - contracts that are signed may only be executed after the embargo is lifted. The US has over the last two years progressed slowly in accord with a 'road-map' towards normalisation of its relationship with Vietnam. It has made its concessions conditional on co-operation on its investigations into the fate of US servicemen listed as missing in action (MIA) during the Vietnam war as well as on efforts to restore peace to Cambodia, where Vietnam has backed the Phnom Penh government led by Mr Hun Sen. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said yesterday that the latest step had been taken because of the Vietnamese government's co-operation on the MIA investigations. Vietnam has recently made new evidence, including a large collection of photographs, available to US investigators. Senator John Kerry, the Vietnam war veteran who chairs a Senate committee looking into the fate of the MIAs, recently told Mr Bush that the Vietnamese had been 'forthcoming'. The third phase, involving limited diplomatic links and a complete end to the trade embargo, is to take effect six months after a Cambodian peace plan has been in effect with full Vietnamese co-operation. The final phase, with full diplomatic relations, most favoured nation trading status and an end to restrictions on lending to Vietnam by the World Bank and other multilateral development banks, is not expected to be implemented until Vietnam has an elected government. US companies fear being left out of the race to take part in Vietnam's economic development. Japan last month resumed development aid to the country, and businesses from other Asian countries, Australia and France, are already investing there.</p>

Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said it is  important that Vietnam recovers from the effects of the war and  grows to prosper just like other countries in Southeast Asia.    Replying to a question at an open forum with the members of  the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Manila, he  said Malaysia believes when countries are prosperous they are  less likely to cause problems to their neighbors. He said  already Vietnam is moving very forward and that is the result of  the investment of (?southern) countries, including Malaysia.

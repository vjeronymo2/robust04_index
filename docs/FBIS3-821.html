The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] dissolved by decree  the Bophuthatswana parliament two days ago. All cabinet members  and MP's of the homeland are regarded as ordinary citizens and  will not have access to any state resources. The TEC also  announced that Job Mokgoro of the Southern African Development  Bank, together with Dr. Tjaart van der Walt, would take over the  running of the territory until after the election. The two men  will control all government funds and work with the Electoral  Commission, Independent Media Commission, and the TEC. Election  officials are expected to arrive in the homeland today to make  voting preparations.    Meanwhile the ANC's [African National Congress] first rally  in the homeland will go ahead as planned.</p>

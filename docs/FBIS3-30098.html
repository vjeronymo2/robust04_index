Cabinet ministers, including Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata  and International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai,  gathered at Hosokawa's official residence Friday to start  determining the specifics of an earlier-announced government  plan to open up the domestic market.    Aimed at overcoming the deadlock in Japan-U.S. "framework"  trade talks, the plan includes encouraging imports and  investment, lifting regulations, facilitating the procedures  involved in government orders and spurring competitive policies.  The government hopes the measures will help allay criticism  mounting in the United States over Japan's huge trade surplus,  and stave off the possibility of U.S. retaliatory measures.    The Japanese officials started discussions on the  government's policy to introduce liberalizing measures for the  automobile, auto parts and insurance markets -- three areas in  which Japan spurned U.S. requests to set "numerical import  targets."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] News reports coming from New York indicate that the  Security Council has failed to reach an agreement on issuing a  resolution condemning the massacre committed by the Israeli  terrorists against those who were praying at the honorable  al-Haram al-Ibrahimi [mosque] that led to the fall of scores of  victims among the praying Arab Palestinians. The Council had  resorted to the adjournment of its session during the past days,  at the request of the U.S. representative to the Council.    JANA Arab affairs editor has commented on this saying:    The failure of the so-called Security Council to condemn  this  savage massacre -- which constitutes one of the ugliest and  dirtiest crimes of official terrorism -- exposes before the  entire world the truth of this Council, which is controlled by  the Christians and used by the crusader West as a tool to serve  its interests and is a sword hanging over the necks of those who  reject its blackmailing policies and refuse to give in to its  will.    Although a week has elapsed since the savage massacre of  al-Haram al-Ibrahimi -- and despite the clear evidence of  official Israeli responsibility before the world for this  terrorist crime that claimed as victims scores of Arab Muslim  Palestinians while they prayed inside the Ibrahimi mosque -- the  so-called Security Council is still postponing its session and  is evading anything that will implicate the criminal Israelis,  who are still shedding Arab Palestinian blood while the Council  is claiming to be discussing the massacre.    The editor added that this exposed attitude by the so-called  Security Council is the attitude of the West, which does not  want to declare the truth and admit that what the Israelis have  done was premeditated, official terrorism and a link within a  long chain of Israeli acts of terrorism and thus to convict the  Israelis of terrorism.    The editor stressed that this is another scandal of the  so-called Security Council -- which holds immediate sessions and  enthusiastically issues resolutions on sanctions and embargoes  when the question is concerning the Arabs, applying the seventh  chapter against them even when those resolutions are based on  mere suspicion -- while witnessing with its own eyes one of the  ugliest crimes of terrorism committed by the Israelis, openly  and officially and before the entire world. Yet the Council  refuses to issue even a denunciation of the criminals. It is a  stand that cannot be explained except by the crusader West's  indifference towards Arab lives and their blood, as if they were  a race other than mankind. It is also an encouragement to the  Israeli terrorists to commit more massacres against the  Palestinian people. It is another indication regarding the  extermination scheme being implemented against the Arabs and the  Muslims by the Jewish-Christian alliance.</p>

			<p>Disappointing   <F P=102>   94WS0282C Paris INFORMATIQUE in French 18 Feb 94 p 6--FOR  OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94WS0282C </F> <F P=104>  Paris INFORMATIQUE </F> <F P=105>  French </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article signed F.N.: "Cap Gemini Sogeti [CGS] Misses in </F> Germany"]    [Text] Cap Gemini Sogeti experienced losses again in 1993  (result, share of the group: -434 million French francs [Fr]),  while consolidated sales fell by 7.4 percent, to Fr11 billion,  and the personnel was reduced by 3 percent. The net loss of  Fr212 million in 1992 was not an accident.    CGS is going through a serious crisis, due in the first  place  to poor economic conditions and to declining cost-plus contract  activities (which accounted for 30 percent of its sales in  1993). But the SSII [data-processing services and engineering  company] is also experiencing a severe disappointment,  especially in Germany, following Daimler-Benz's acquisition of  an interest in Sogeti and the creation of a joint subsidiary,  Cap Debis--owned 51 percent by Debis Systemhaus and 49 percent  by Cap Gemini Sogeti. "Germany accounts for much of our  results," the management pointed out, acknowledging that the  creation of Cap Debis (Fr2.2 billion in sales) was "a  significant financial failure." Moreover, "managing a 50-50 SSII  is tricky, and poor economic conditions just make it more  difficult." This is why Cap Debis, which owned 20 percent of CCS  (the computing center management subsidiary), will become part  of Debis Systemhaus, the Daimler Benz subsidiary. The resulting  company will be worth about Fr6 billion, and CGS will obviously  become "diluted" in it. Without the German burden, the  management claims, results would be comparable to those of 1992.    The group will thus see itself forced to increase its  capital  by Fr1.5 billion. In addition, other assets will be sold,  without any geographic disengagement. While management claims  that their interest in the Sema Group still possesses strategic  value, they acknowledge that they will take part in negotiations  on the future of Cisi [International Data Processing Services  Company], 36 percent of which is owned by Sogeti. The year 1994  will be marked by the search for another partner, besides  Daimler Benz.</p>

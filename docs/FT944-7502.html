			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Pfizer/SB SmithKline Beecham may justify the disposal of its animal health business by insisting it wants to concentrate on human health. But yesterday's sale to Pfizer was motivated more by financial needs than industrial strategy. Although the deal may prove marginally dilutive, that will be more than offset by the balance sheet impact of Pounds 700m in net cash. By year-end, gearing should have fallen from a peak of nearly 350 per cent to just 120 per cent. Pfizer's desire to leap from number six to the top spot in animal health appears initially puzzling. After all, the sector's low margins and relatively slow growth mean it has always been a poor cousin to human health. However annual growth of the US pharmaceuticals market has decelerated to just 5 per cent, little more than animal health's 3 per cent. Moreover, the mix of SB's business means that during the last three years its division has enjoyed average growth of 10 per cent and margins of 17 per cent. That will give Pfizer's operations, whose margins fell from 18.6 per cent in 1990 to just 6.4 per cent last year, a substantial shot in the arm. Whether Pfizer has overpaid is unclear: the acquisition is unprecedented in the animal health industry. The multiple of 22 times historic earnings is probably justified by the business fit. There is little product overlap and fine geographical synergy given SB's strength in Europe and Australasia and Pfizer's in South America and Japan. Given the fragmented state of the animal health industry and the continuing turmoil in the drugs industry as a whole, this is unlikely to be the sector's last deal.</p>

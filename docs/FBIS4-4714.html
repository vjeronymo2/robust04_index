			<p>BFN     [Text] Governor Masahide Ota's regular unofficial meeting  with reporters at 1100 [0200 GMT] on 4 April suddenly became an  emergency news conference on the crash of the U.S. Forces' F-15  fighter. The incident has seriously shocked the prefectural  government, and Ota has issued direct instructions to his Base  Affairs Office to confirm the details of the accident.    Prefectural Policy Coordinator Choko Takayama, and Tatsuo  Matayoshi, director of the Governor's Office, are now busy  arranging the lodging of a protest with the U.S. Forces Okinawa  area coordinator, and Kadena Air Base commander. They are also  demanding an investigation into the cause of the crash.    The accident happened during Ota's preparations for the  visit  to Okinawa of U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale on 10  April. He is now working on how to petition Mondale for  solutions to the prefecture's base issues.    Ota said at the news conference: "It is extremely  unfortunate and regrettable. Time and again, we have asked U.S.  Forces and the U.S. Consulate General to take measures to  prevent accidents. Each time, we are told that they are looking  into the causes. Does this mean that as long as there are  military bases in Okinawa, there will be no way to prevent  accidents? We will exert even greater efforts in asking for the  return of the bases." He reemphasized his position that the  return of the military bases forms a major pillar of the  prefecture's administrative policy.    The latest accident demonstrated once again that Kadena Air  Base is inherently dangerous. Ota is scheduled to visit the  United States in late May to discuss base issues. During this  visit he will probably demand in strong terms that the U.S.  Government take firm measures to "prevent any more accidents."    At present, takeoff and landing exercises at Kadena are  conducted over civilian residential areas every day. The crash  site of the F-15 fighter on 4 April was within the vicinity of  the Kadena Arms Depot. One slip could have led to a major  explosion, and brought about a disaster.    The F-15 fighter crash occurred with Kadena Air Base still  unable to publish the findings of its investigation into the  helicopter crash in September 1993. For this, the prefectural  government is greatly dissatisfied with U.S. Forces.</p>

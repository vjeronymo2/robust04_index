			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Australia stakes ADollars 2.3bn on recovery AUSTRALIA'S Labor government yesterday staked its future on a ADollars 2.3bn (Pounds 980m) spending programme intended to speed up economic recovery and bring unemployment below 10 per cent before the next election scheduled to take place by mid-1993. The success of the package will determine the government's chances of overhauling the conservative opposition, made up of the Liberal and National parties, which has a substantial lead in most opinion polls and is widely expected to win the election. Mr Keating said the spending programme would form the first stage of a four-year 'strategy for growth' which would create 800,000 jobs and lay the groundwork for a decade of prosperity. Longer-term structural economic reforms include further deregulation of aviation, relaxation of controls on foreign banks and simpler planning procedures for big mining projects. The government also announced reforms to the corporate tax system, including accelerated depreciation allowances, more generous treatment of banks' bad debt provisions and changes to capital gains tax. Ministers hope the tax changes will help accelerate growth by encouraging private sector investment and giving banks an incentive to allow problem borrowers to trade their way out of trouble. Mr Keating was unable to find room for cuts in income tax before the election. However, he promised cuts worth more than ADollars 8bn by 1996, sufficient to reduce the top rate of tax to 30 per cent for three-quarters of taxpayers. Mr Keating promised during his leadership campaign to produce an economic statement calculated to 'get Australia moving again' after two years of flat or negative growth which have seen unemployment rise to 10.3 per cent. Most of the ADollars 2.3bn earmarked for pump priming will be spent on infrastructure projects to upgrade Australia's inefficient roads and railways and ease congestion at crowded airports, notably in Melbourne and Sydney. The government resisted strong pressure from trade unions and some employers for a slowdown in its 10-year tariff reduction programme. The package was welcomed by business leaders. Mr Frank Conroy, managing director of Westpac Banking Corporation, said the growth projections were high, but he forecast that the package would not unsettle the financial markets. Mr John Hewson, leader of the Liberal/National opposition, said it was 'one of the most irresponsible packages I have seen contemplated in Australia'. It was largely based on over-optimistic growth estimates which could not be achieved, he charged. Keating's gamble, Page 4 Editorial Comment, Page 22</p>

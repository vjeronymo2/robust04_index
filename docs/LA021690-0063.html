He also said  he wants Soviet troops out as soon as possible. The Solidarity-led government  of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki has adopted a more tolerant attitude  toward Soviet withdrawal, saying the 40,000 troops in Poland should leave only  after creation of a new security arrangement for Europe.  </P></p>

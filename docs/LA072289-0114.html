			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRMS GET BOOST IN GAS PIPELINE RACE TO STATE  </P> <P> The race to build a natural gas pipeline to California heated up Friday when  Southern California Gas Co. announced an agreement to buy gas from the Altamont  pipeline project, which would bring gas from Canada to Wyoming.  </P> <P> At the same time, the Kern River Gas Transmission Co., which is proposing its  own pipeline from Wyoming to California, said it had agreed to transport  Altamont's gas on the final leg of its journey south.  </P> <P> The agreements gave a boost to Altamont and Kern in their competition with a  rival pipeline project of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. of San Francisco,  which also proposes to transport the cheap Canadian gas desired by many local  customers.  </P> <P> Kern's agreement with Altamont also is an apparent setback for the competing  Wy-Cal Pipeline project, which would follow a route nearly identical to Kern's.  </P> <P> All of the projects are competing with several others for federal permission,  customers and financing to begin construction and ultimately win a share of the  expected strong market for natural gas here.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Revives Interest  </P> <P> Altamont also announced Friday that it had applied for federal permission to  proceed with the project.  </P> <P> "I wasn't sure whether (Altamont) could be a viable project," said Richard  Bilas, a member of the California Energy Commission. "It certainly revives  interest in Altamont project and shows that someone else is thinking about  bringing in Canadian gas other than through the (PG&amp;E) system."  </P> <P> Southern California Gas said it would contract for 200 million cubic feet per  day of Canadian gas through the Altamont line, a $580-million, 620-mile pipe  from Wild Horse, Alberta, Canada, to Opal, Wyo.  </P> <P> At Opal, Altamont would connect with the proposed Kern River pipeline, a  762-mile $750-million line that would bring the gas to California and gas  company pipelines.  </P> <P> The agreements followed by a month separate deals between Kern River and the  Mojave Pipeline Co. to merge their pipelines at Barstow. SoCal Gas has  previously contracted with Kern River for 150 million cubic feet per day of  natural gas.  </P> <P> The combined projects would afford Southern California Gas access to natural  gas from Canada, Wyoming, Kern County and the Southwest, said gas company  Senior Vice President Frederick E. John.  </P> <P> Altamont is sponsored by Petro-Canada Inc., Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. Ltd. and  Shell Canada Ltd. Kern River is a joint venture of units of Tenneco Inc. of  Houston and the Williams Cos. of Tulsa, Okla.  </P></p>

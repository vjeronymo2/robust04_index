			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad by </F> reporter Freek Robinson; place and date not given; on the  "Agenda" program--recorded]    [Text] [Robinson] Mr. Aziz Pahad, deputy foreign minister,  welcome back from the United Nations. What was the spirit there  when you were there?    [Pahad] Well, as reflected in the interviews with Addis  Ababa, the United Nations welcomed us very warmly. The Security  Council debate had 34 countries participating in a topic quite  important for us, and generally, the secretary general conveyed  the message that they were willing and they were waiting for us  to retake our seat at the United Nations so that we can play a  role in that family of nations. So, overall, I think,  everywhere across the continent and the world they are expecting  us to play a very positive role in world politics.    [Robinson] Well, I think we will talk about the United  Nations in a moment with Mr. Brahimi here as well, but could you  first just try to give us an indication, Mr. Pahad, of South  Africa's foreign policy? Is it something that you can call a  specific name at the moment, say something such as an  internationalist policy, or what?    [Pahad] Well, South Africa's foreign policy has been  evolving  over years. As you know we have been isolated for over 40  years. We are now being accepted warmly into the community of  nations, and our policy will have to reflect that. We are, of  course, now accepting that we are a country which is African.  We are not a European outpost in the African continent, so our  specific interests have to be in our region initially, and in  the African continent generally.    That is why our joining the OAU is so important for us. It  means becoming the 53rd member state of the OAU. We can now  contribute to the role that Africa can play in world politics.  I seriously believe that we can make a major contribution to  the work of the OAU, but in that we can then make a contribution  to Africa's role in international politics. We have very major  roles to play.    I think our experiment in finding a negotiated resolution to  our problems, which many people did not expect, has indicated  that we have got an experience that we must now take to the  other international arenas. I think that we are committed now  to playing a role in the human rights struggle, democratization  struggle globally and on the African Continent. We are going to  commit ourselves to ensuring that we try to resolve conflict  through negotiations, and try to solve all problems through  negotiations, and I think our own experience would help us well  in that perspective that we are going to put forward.    We will join, of course, the Southern African Development  Community, which will mean that it will be an element of our  economic relationship that we will have with our region. I want  to also say that as South Africa, the government of national  unity is committed to struggling for democracy across the world,  but also against racism wherever it emerges. We were recipients  of international solidarity that was unprecedented. It is up to  us now to ensure within our limited possibilities we will  contribute to making the new world a better world.    [Robinson] Well, if you say that we must get involved in the  resolution of conflicts, the first one might be Rwanda?    [Pahad] Well, Rwanda is a sad and a very tragic situation,  and we have already indicated as South Africans we are very  concerned about the carnage that is taking place there. We are  discussing with the United Nations, we had discussions with the  secretary general of the United Nations, we had discussions with  the vice president of the United States, and we've had  discussions in Addis Ababa with the OAU to try to work out a  common approach to how to resolve this. We are committed to a  system in any way possible to try to resolve the problems in  Rwanda.    We are also as committed to trying to help the process in  Mozambique and Angola, and wherever we can. In that context we  will use all our capacity to help resolve those problems, and we  want to put forward a message that our task will be to try to  ensure that we try to resolve any conflict through peaceful  means and through negotiated solutions.    I think South Africa now has been accepted as having gone  through what everybody sometimes referred to as a miracle, and I  think our own experience, the fact that we have got a government  of national unity that is now committed to the African continent  will give us a better position to deal with this situation in  Rwanda, not necessarily in a military way. There are lots of  other ways in which we can contribute to helping to resolve it,  but that will emerge from our discussions with the OAU, with the  United Nations. We think there must be a regional approach to  the matter.    [Robinson] Just quickly to get a picture of how many  countries are represented in South Africa, how many  representatives do we have abroad, and what are your priorities?    [Pahad] Well, at the moment we have diplomatic relations of  one sort or another with 124 countries. We've got 68 embassies  abroad, we have 25 consulates, and we have got 55 honorary  consulates abroad. In this country we have 78 embassies, we've  got 55 consulates, and 23 honorary consulates. So we've got  quite a representation, and a lot of this has happened in the  last few years as the democratization process started.    [Robinson] And it's still extending?    [Pahad] And it will extend. As we emerge out of isolation  our interests change. We have to go to areas where we were  never allowed in before -- the far East, Asia generally, Latin  America, Central America, and the European Union of course. We  now enter in a different way so we will then transform, we would  like to believe, our own emphasis, given our own national  interests.    [Robinson] What would you say is the priority in the  Department of Foreign Affairs now?    [Pahad] Our priority is to consolidate our relation to the  international community. Our priorities is how do we,  interacting with the international community, ensure that we  have a growing economy, and through a growing economy how we  deal with the aspirations of our people, and through our own  strength how do we help the region generally, Africa broadly,  and then our contribution to the world. Our priority has to be  to consolidate our role within the international community.    [Robinson] Well, thank you, Mr. Pahad. That's the basis for  our discussion. I thank you for what you have said so far, and  in a moment we will also speak to our other two guests.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Military snub for Chilean president Chilean civil-military relations were thrown into crisis yesterday when the head of the police force refused to resign over allegations of covering up the murder of three communist leaders in 1985. General Rodolfo Stange publicly refused to step down after a long meeting with President Eduardo Frei, in a move which undermines the president's authority and highlights the limits of democratic rule, regained in 1990 after 17 years of military dictatorship. Although under the 1980 constitution, drawn up by the military, the president cannot dismiss commanders of the armed forces, Mr Frei had made it clear that Gen Stange's position was no longer tenable. Mr Milton Juica, a judge who has been investigating the case since 1989, said that Gen Stange may have 'failed to fulfil his military duties' by impeding the investigation. Mr Juica on Thursday sentenced 16 people, 15 of them former carabineros, to various terms of imprisonment for the murders. Three, including a former colonel, were given life terms, by far the stiffest sentences delivered in connection with the human rights abuses committed during the military regime, most of which remain unpunished. Mr German Correa, minister of the interior, last week called on Gen Stange to 'examine his conscience' after the publication of Mr Juica's findings. Mr Jorge Schaulsohn, president of the chamber of deputies, yesterday said Gen Stange ought to resign his post 'as a patriotic act'. Gen Agusto Pinochet, who remains commander in chief until 1997, has strongly backed Gen Stange, as have top police officials who last week issued a statement saying: 'The carabineros do not accept nor will accept any question. . . of placing in doubt the legality, transparency and honesty of the actions of the force or its commander.'</p>

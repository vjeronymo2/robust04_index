			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 22  March.    According to a 1993 Mexican Petroleum (Pemex) report, Mexico  is willing to sell its entire stock of crude exports to the  United States as long as U.S. market prices for Mexican oil are  best for the country. In 1993, Mexico sent almost two-thirds of  all the oil it sold abroad to the U.S. market. The nation's  overall income from oil and petroleum products in 1993 was  $5.992 billion. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 21 Mar 94 p  15)    Mexico's oil reserves decreased between 3.5 and 4 percent in  1993. Nevertheless, the decline was not as sharp as in previous  years. Pemex Director Francisco Rojas announced at ceremonies  marking the 56th anniversary of the Mexican oil industry's  nationalization that Mexico currently has oil reserves of 64.769  billion barrels. Energy industry sources say the decrease in  the reserves resulted from meager investments in the exploration  and production of oil, despite the discovery of new deposits.  (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 18 Mar 94 p 19)    Pemex Director Francisco Rojas says oil production in Mexico  declined last year by 14 percent. Rojas attributed the decline  to the "worst cyclical depression ever experienced by the  petrochemical industry worldwide and Mexico's economic  recession." President Carlos Salinas de Gortari spoke at the  same event -- the 56th anniversary of the Mexican oil industry's  nationalization. He reiterated that "oil is a strategic  resource for our great nation and will continue to be the  exclusive property of the Mexican people." Salinas added that  oil has remained a nonnegotiable point in NAFTA. (Hamburg DPA  in Spanish 0037 GMT 19 Mar 94)    President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has announced in  Tlaxcala  that the National Foreign Trade Bank and the Secretariat of  Commerce and Industrial Development, Secofi, will redouble its  efforts to allow more medium-sized and small businesses to enter  the North American, Central American, and European export  markets. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430  GMT 12 Mar 94)    Fernando Heftye, Secofi's director of foreign investments,  says that through February foreign investments in Mexico  amounted to just over $4 billion, which could increase to $15  billion by year's end. Heftye said at least 20 countries are  interested in signing bilateral agreements to protect and  promote investment but that a formal negotiations process has  not been initiated. Among the countries interested, he said,  are Germany, Great Britain, Switzerland, Italy, and Spain.  (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 17 Mar 94 pp 1, 6)    Jacques Lecomte, European Union, EU, ambassador to Mexico,  says Mexico's exports to Europe decreased by 17 percent in 1993  because of the economic recession in the region. This decline  in sales also slowed the Mexican economy and fostered  uncertainty among Mexican businessmen prior to the signing of  NAFTA. Lecomte said the EU has not conducted studies on the  impact NAFTA will have on the EU-Mexican trade balance, but, he  added, telecommunications will be among the most adversely  affected areas. Lecomte concluded that the European countries  would like to increase their exports to Mexico. (Mexico City  NOTIMEX in Spanish 0242 GMT 16 Mar 94)    French Ambassador to Mexico Paul Dijou says French investors  and bankers would like to establish themselves in Mexico because  NAFTA has made it a strategic point for investments. They are  considering opening branches or establishing partnerships with  Mexican banks. Dijou toured Puebla State to sign technological  cooperation agreements with the Autonomous University of Puebla.  (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0148 GMT 16 Mar 94)    Mexico's industrialization process has remained at a  standstill over the past 13 years. Today, high technology  exports total 60 percent of the country's total exports.  Mexico's participation in the international market with  sophisticated technical equipment is limited by the industrial  underdevelopment in Latin America. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO  in Spanish 16 Mar 94 p 3A)    The nation's airlines are not ready to deal with the  increased shipping of merchandise under NAFTA. Domestic cargo  service by domestic airlines decreased 3.8 percent over the past  two years, while foreign airlines increased their cargo services  by 30 percent over the same period. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO  in Spanish 16 Mar 94 p 21)    EL FINANCIERO conducted an economic analysis based on Bank  of  Mexico information that shows prices of nearly one-third of the  basic food basket staples increased at an annual rate of 11.2  percent in January -- a rate 3.7 percent above the national  inflation index for consumer prices. Increases in the prices of  corn meal, cookies, rice, oats, powdered milk, margarine, and  other items all contributed to lowering the people's purchasing  power.

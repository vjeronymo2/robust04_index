The Council examined the economic situation in the country,  including price hikes, the sharp deterioration in the exchange  rate of the Yemeni currency, as well as the difficulties and  increased suffering this has caused to citizens in terms of  overburdening their living conditions.    The Presidential Council regretted the negative and  far-reaching repercussions of the continuing political crisis on  the overall situation in our country, particularly on the  economic and development levels, not to mention the climate of  psychological and social instability it has created.    The Presidential Council affirmed the need for the  government  to shoulder its responsibilities by taking necessary and rapid  measures to remedy the economic situation and bring the cost of  living as well as the monetary and financial situation under  control. It also affirmed the need for the public, private, and  mixed sector organizations to play their roles and shoulder  their responsibilities by ensuring the availability of basic  commodities, achieving price stability, and easing the citizens'  burdens.    The Presidential Council instructed the government to take  firm measures against those who tamper with prices, hoard  commodities, and speculate on the national currency, and to  rapidly refer them to the Public Prosecution so it may take the  proper legal measures against them. It also asked the  government to activate the state agencies and organizations to  achieve the administrative reform that would eliminate public  negligence and apathy and promote services within the state's  administrative agencies, facilities, and organizations.    The Council also asked the government to draw up and  implement an effective monetary and financial policy that would  ease the citizens' economic burdens and their difficult living  conditions in order to thwart the efforts of the enemies of  unity and democracy to sabotage the economy and speculate on the  national currency so as to weaken it and create bottlenecks to  bring about indignation and anger among the public, undermine  national unity, and foment riots and sabotage, which only harm  the national economy and the higher national interests.    The Presidential Council urged the brother citizens to  demonstrate vigilance and awareness to thwart these hostile  schemes, and also to cooperate with the competent agencies to  help them perform their duties in order to safeguard public  security and stability within the society.    During today's session, the Presidential Council examined  several issues as well as national, regional, and international  developments. It was also apprised of the activities carried  out by the Presidential Council chairman and members last week.    The Council expressed satisfaction over the growing  improvement in Yemeni-Qatari ties, and also over the existing  fraternal cooperation between the two fraternal countries. It  voiced its appreciation of the positive stand of the fraternal  Qataris, who are eager to see us cope with the current situation  in the homeland, not to mention their support for Yemeni unity.    The Presidential Council addressed several topics listed on  its agenda and adopted the appropriate decisions.</p>

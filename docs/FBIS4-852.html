			<p>BFN     [Text] Dar es Salaam -- The government has said efforts to  repatriate Tanzanians in Rwanda are continuing, in light of the  deteriorating situation there.    In an interview with the BBC today, the minister of foreign  affairs and international cooperation, Honorable Joseph  Rwegasira, said the first group of Tanzanians had already  returned and another was expected to leave Kigali this morning  via Burundi in collaboration with the Belgian Government, which  had the task of evacuating its own citizens from Rwanda.  Minister Rwegasira said the situation in Rwanda remained  deplorable and that the fighting was continuing. He said the  government was following up on reports that some Tanzanians had  died in the fighting.    Honorable Rwegasira said that as a result of the worrying  situation, the government had taken precautionary measures along  its borders to protect itself under any circumustances. He said  Tanzania did not intend to interfere in the fighting under way  in Rwanda but, if there was a danger to the lives of the  Tanzanians and all other ordinary means of evacuating them were  blocked, then there was a possibility that the government might  intervene to save its citizens.</p>

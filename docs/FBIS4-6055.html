			<p>BFN     [Text] Mitsuo Gima, speaker of the Okinawa Prefectural  Assembly, and six other representatives of the ruling and  opposition parties visited Consul General Richard Christenson at  the U.S. Consulate General in Okinawa on 13 April to lodge their  protest on the F-15 fighter and CH-46 helicopter crashes. The  representatives demanded particularly the "prompt announcement  of the causes of the accidents."    In response, the consul general showed a positive attitude,  saying: "We will ask the U.S. military authorities to make such  an announcement, and work toward making this announcement  possible."    The prefectural assembly delegation lodged the protest in  accordance with a resolution adopted at the emergency session of  the assembly.    Christenson said during the meeting, "We take the  prefectural  assembly's protest seriously." Concerning the F-15 and  helicopter accidents, he explained the U.S. base authorities'  position, claiming "after the accidents, there was a ban on all  flights. Flights were only resumed after all aircraft had been  checked for safety."    The consul general also said, "I can understand the  Okinawans' negative feelings. We will implement safety measures  strictly." However, he reiterated that U.S. military training  "is part of our duties under the security pact."    The prefectural assembly's delegation is also scheduled to  petition the relevant government ministries and agencies later  this month. The representatives reaffirmed on 13 April that  "the approach of the Japanese Government is important in the  solution of base issues. We give priority to our petition with  the Foreign Ministry and other government offices."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian  negotiating team, has denied reports that he apologized to PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat for not wanting to join the new  Palestinian national authority which will run the self-rule in  Gaza and Jericho.    In an interview with our correspondent Sa'id Mu'addi, Sha'th  said he was not nominated to join this authority in the first  place and that news agency reports on this issue were only  rumors. He noted that no appointments have been announced yet.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Rule 1109 requires that the trading halt provisions in Rule 918C(b) shall be applied to the trading stock index warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon Commission approval of the foregoing amendments, the Exchange proposes that it will only file rule changes for specific warrant issues where there is no corresponding option or warrant on the same underlying index already listed on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ. Accordingly, when a listed option overlies a particular broad based index, the Exchange proposes it be allowed to list warrants on that index without further Commission review and approval pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both initial and maintenance listing standards for stock index warrants will require that no more than 20% of the securities in the underlying index, by weight, may be comprised of foreign securities or American depositary receipts (``ADRs'') overlying foreign securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the Amex and the primary exchange on which the foreign security (including a foreign security underlying an ADR) is traded. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  Furthermore, proposed Rule 1100 provides that stock index and currency warrants listed on the Exchange prior to SEC approval of this filing shall continue to be governed by those provisions of the Exchange's rules that were applicable to such warrants prior to approval of this filing. Finally, prior to trading index or currency warrants, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership providing guidance regarding member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations) when handling transactions in index or currency warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Telephone conversation between Benjamin D. Krause, Amex, and Michael Walinskas, SEC, on December 2, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). The Exchange proposes that the ``20% test'' be applied in the same manner as that contained in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34157 (June 3, 1994), 59 FR 30062 (June 10, 1994) (Commission approval order allowing the expedited trading approval of certain narrow-based index options). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers and dealers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

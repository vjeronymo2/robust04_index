			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Two buy-out teams considering coal bids Two management buy-out teams announced yesterday they were considering plans to bid for parts of British Coal. Their announcement came as the government disclosed that 25 companies had qualified to bid for the five UK regions on offer. Mr Bob Siddall, director of opencast operations, and Mr David Brewer, head of finance, said their company, English Coal, had qualified to bid for the three regions incorporating England and north Wales. Mr Alan Houghton, director of the central north region comprising the Yorkshire pits, is heading Northern Coal, a company which has qualified to bid for the region he runs. A third buy-out team is expected to announce its plans today. Mr Bryan Riddleston, regional director for the South Wales opencast region, is thought to be leading a potential bid for his area. National Power and PowerGen, the main electricity generators, are thought to be among the other 22 companies which have qualified. Analysts believe it is extremely unlikely they will make a bid, but that they want to look at the businesses of future suppliers. Both companies are thought to have paid the Pounds 75,000 necessary to qualify in all five coal regions. Mr Keith Palmer, managing director of NM Rothschild, the merchant bank advising the government on privatisation, would not say yesterday which companies had qualified to bid. However he said that of the 33 which had applied, 25 had qualified to bid for one or more of the regions. Several others among the 33 had qualified for one or more of the six stand-alone mines. A small, unspecified number of the 33 had failed to meet technical or financial criteria, Mr Palmer said. The qualifying companies were yesterday sent information covering the areas or pits in which they are interested. The companies will have access to the areas or pits in which they are interested and a data room, and will be able to visit British Coal sites. Bids are due in mid September. English Coal, which is advised by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the consultancy firm, said it had qualified as a prospective bidder for five of the six stand-alone pits: Goldthorpe, Thorne, Annesley/Bentinck, Ellington and Kiveton. English Coal and Northern Coal said employees and management would be given the chance to participate in the ownership and profits of their businesses if the bids succeeded.</p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Markets: Between the lines at Pentos - The Bottom Line PENTOS shares plunged to a seven-year low this week after Terry Maher's specialist retail and office furniture group broke with tradition and delivered a profits warning instead of a seasonal message of good cheer. In the last two decades, Maher has transformed Pentos into an aggressive high street retailer whose outlets include the booksellers Dillons and Hatchards, Ryman the stationers, Wilding office equipment and Athena Galleries, which sells posters and prints. Although Pentos is perhaps best known for its opposition to the price controls of the Net Book Agreement, the source of shareholder grief this week had little to do with the group's rapid expansion, or book pricing policy. Dillons, including Hatchards, which was acquired two years ago, accounts for around 60 per cent of group operating profits, and remains the pride of the Pentos group. Its branches have been equipped with modern electronics and it now ranks as the second largest bookseller in the UK with a 12 per cent market share and a target of 15 per cent by 1994. In contrast, Ryman has been a relatively disappointing performer since its acquisition in 1987. Turnover in 1991 was Pounds 27.8m and sales in 1992 are expected to show meagre one per cent growth. Overall, Pentos' pre-tax profits for the year which ended on Thursday are set to drop by two-thirds to about Pounds 5m because of poor Christmas sales at Athena, a fourth-quarter slump in office furniture orders, and a clutch of exceptional costs. Sales at Athena are particularly disappointing. The business is highly seasonal, and its relatively high fixed costs and gross margins make it more than usually sensitive to changes in sales volumes. Sales have been hit at both ends of the product range. High-margin framed print sales have fallen because of the slump in house sales while sales of posters and other products, mainly targeted at the 14 to 24 year-olds, have suffered because of demographic changes and unemployment which has hit this group particularly hard. Similarly, the office furniture division has struggled with a 25 per cent contraction in overall market size over the past 12 months. Pentos is reducing overheads by Pounds 2m a year in the furniture business and by Pounds 1m a year at Athena. However, Pounds 2m in reoganisation and other 'cleaning-up' costs imposed by Clive Gregory, who returned to Pentos in October as finance director after a 10-year break, and a Pounds 1.5m provision to cover surplus property costs at Hatchards, will be treated as exceptional items. The share price has fallen from a peak of 170p in October 1991 to 55p at the close on Thursday. Arguably, Pentos was a recovery stock bid up too soon, but the price may also be reflecting other anxieties. In particular, the group has adopted a curious approach towards reverse premiums - the up-front sweeteners given when taking up a lease. The 1990 profits were restated (downwards) as a result of a change in the group's accounting methods for these premiums, which are now spread over two accounting periods instead of the old method of one year. Another worry is that year-end net borrowings are likely to show a Pounds 28m increase to about Pounds 48m, producing uncomfortably high gearing of 50 per cent. However, capital expenditure and investment should both be lower in 1993 and Pentos should generate cash for the first time in three years. At some stage, it might also make sense for Pentos to offload the office furniture business. This would enable the group to focus exclusively on specialist retailing - particularly important if a booksellers' price war ever breaks out. Pentos has invested aggressively to build market share while reducing its cost base. If consumer spending were to increase, it would produce a rapid and substantial increase in profitability. Even without an economic upturn, the group's underlying performance should be improved by the latest round of cost cutting. The stock may well have been oversold.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government is committed to mapping out a set of  external economic measures by the end of June, and a centerpiece  of the package of external economic measures is a package of  deregulatory measures. Six cabinet ministers, including Koshiro  Ishida, director general of the Management and Coordination  Agency; Eijiro Hata, minister of international trade and  industry; Mutsuki Kato, minister of agriculture, forestry and  fisheries; and Hiroshi Fujii, minister of finance, met at the  Diet building on 22 June to discuss ways to map out the package  of deregulatory measures. During the meeting, Director General  Ishida stressed the need to boldly relax the current  regulations, but other cabinet ministers said only that the  package of deregulatory measures can be mapped out on the basis  of deregulatory measures that are incorporated in the budget  bill and other deregulatory measures that are included in  council recommendations. As a result, the meeting failed to  produce any tangible results.    The government has mapped out a package of deregulatory  measures covering about 200 areas. The government, however,  intends to increase the number of areas to be deregulated by  urging each cabinet minister to make political decisions. The  government plans to make a final decision on the package of  deregulatory measures at a cabinet meeting on 29 June.    Director General Ishida reported the results of the meeting  to Prime Minister Hata at the end of the meeting. Upon  receiving the report, the prime minister emphasized the need to  flesh out the package of deregulatory measures, saying: "It is  important to flesh out the package of deregulatory measures. I  hope that each ministry and agency will work to increase the  number of areas to be deregulated."</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (10): Global groups win out - Smaller houses are losing their independence WHEN a rowdy group of grape growers burst into the opulent Intercontinental Hotel in Paris this summer to shout 'Thief] Thief]' at the dapper figure of Pierre Berge, chairman of Yves Saint-Laurent, it looked like little more than yet another outburst from France's stroppy farmers. Yet the grape growers' protest was only the start of a lobby by the French champagne industry against YSL's decision to call its new fragrance, Champagne. A French court last month ruled against YSL by banning it from using the name in France. YSL is appealing. If it loses again, YSL, which also faces similar cases in Britain and Germany, may face writing off millions of pounds that it has spent on the launch. The Champagne affair is a blow for YSL and for Elf Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals company that bought it this spring. It also casts a cloud over the rest of the luxury goods industry. YSL is not the only famous name in luxury to have forfeit its independence this year. This autumn, Maurizio Gucci this autumn lost control of his family's leather company after a bruising battle with Investcorp, the Arab investment consortium. Dunhill, one of biggest British businesses in the sector, has been merged into the Vendome group with Cartier, the French jeweller, by Richemont, their secretive South African parent company. Kenzo, another French fashion house, has sold out to LVMH, the French group which also owns some of the champagne houses now fighting YSL. Yet other companies have emerged unscathed from the industry's difficulties. Hermes has continued to expand. Asprey has built on its base as an exclusive gift shop on Bond Street, London, by buying a string of jewellers. Jil Sander in Hamburg and Prada in Milan have been building up their fashion businesses. These companies are all tightly focused operations that have carved out discreet niches in the luxury market. Hermes' success is rooted in decades of investment in craftsmanship and quality. Asprey has flourished by positioning itself as the gift shop for the 30 or 40 people in the world who are so rich that they have barely noticed the recession. Jil Sander and Prada are both renowned for the understated fashions that have come to the fore in the early 1990s. But the real winners in the luxury industry this year have been the global groups that emerged in the 1980s. The doyen is LVMH, the French company assembled by Bernard Arnault in a 1980s bid battle, which is a force in fashion, cosmetics and luggage through Christian Dior, Christian Lacroix, Givenchy and Louis Vuitton, as well as the recently acquired Kenzo. The other contenders are Vendome, which owns Baume et Mercier and Piaget, the watchmakers, as well as Dunhill and Cartier; Investcorp, which already owned Tiffany, the famous New York jeweller, before taking over Gucci; and, after its recent acquisitions, Asprey. Meanwhile, the beauty market is dominated by France's L'Oreal, Estee Lauder of the US and Elf Sanofi. Most of the global groups have been affected by the recession. But they also have the advantage of scale: their activities are so broadly-based that they are less vulnerable. LVMH has compensated for losses on Lacroix and its ill-fated fragrance, C'Est La Vie], with the success of Dior's new Dune perfume and Vuitton's cuir epi collection. L'Oreal has been burnt by its investment in the relaunch of Lanvin, the French fashion house. But Lanvin's losses should be offset by the profits from the record-breaking launch of Gio, the new Giorgio Armani perfume. Cartier's performance has helped Vendome to counter Dunhill's difficulties in the Japanese market. These companies, along with the other survivors in the luxury trade, should soon be able to benefit from less difficult competitive conditions as economies edge out of recession. The European market is still under pressure but the US scene is more encouraging. Barneys opened a stylish new store in uptown Manhattan in September and it has got off to a roaring start. Other US stores were busy buyers at last month's Paris and Milan fashion shows. The growth of the emerging Asian economies - South Korea, Taiwan, and even China - is helping to offset the downturn in Japan. In theory the whole industry should be helped by the new Asian markets, but in practice it will probably be the larger groups that benefit most. They have the resources to meet the start-up costs. Also, the bigger companies have, so far, been first to take advantage of the luxury market's new-found stability by investing in new product launches. YSL's dilemma shows just how vulnerable the smaller houses have become. One of the main reasons behind its decision to sell to Elf Sanofi was that, as an independent company, it could no longer afford to compete in an industry where it can cost Dollars 500,000 to stage a fashion show and Dollars 50m for the global launch of a fragrance. Thanks to Elf Sanofi's support, YSL was able to press ahead with the launch of Champagne, its first new women's scent since Paris in 1973. That support now seems even more important in the light of the Champagne court case. If YSL loses the legal battle, Elf Sanofi would, at least, be big enough to absorb the potential losses, which could have been crippling for YSL in its old guise as an independent company.</p>

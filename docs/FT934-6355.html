			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Aberforth Split to raise Pounds 51.5m via share issue Aberforth Split Level Trust is seeking to more than double its size by raising an addi-tional Pounds 51.5m after expenses. As with most recent trust issues, the funds will be raised via an offer of C shares at 100p each. The investment trust, which invests in the shares of small companies, has a split capital structure, with income shares, capital shares and units (a combination of one capital and one income share). In July 1994, the C shares will be convertible, either into a unit, or into one capital and one income share, at the option of the holder. Trusts use the C share structure so that the two pools of assets are kept separ-ate until the money raised via an issue is fully invested. Conversion then takes place at prices based on the asset values prevailing at the time. Irrevocable undertakings have been received to apply for 47.5m C shares. The balance of the offer, some 5.5m C shares, is available to the public.</p>

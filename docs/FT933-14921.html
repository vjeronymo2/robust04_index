			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Survey of Belgium (4): Green light likely for eco-tax - Hilary Clarke discusses legislation designed to protect the environment BELGIUM is set to become the first European country to introduce a green tax to force consumers to switch to products that have a less damaging effect on the environment. The so-called eco-tax, at present being debated in the Belgian upper house, has put the government of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene at odds with a range of different industries from plastics and chemicals to French mineral water producers. If, as seems likely, the tax is agreed by the senate, it will become operational next year. The eco-tax was born out of Belgium's constitutional reforms, the bulk of which were agreed last February. To obtain a necessary two-thirds majority in parliament for its sweeping constitutional changes which will federalise the country, the government needed the support of opposition Flemish Agalev and French-speaking Ecolo parties. The ecologists, who between them have 18 members of parliament, seized the opportunity and said they would back the government's plans only if it agreed to the eco-tax. Industry claims the eco-tax will put up new barriers to trade and is out of step with environmental legislation designed to cut domestic packaging waste in the European Community. Belgium's trade unions, which originally backed the tax, have now joined the employers' protest because they fear it could result in huge job losses. The experimental tax will be applied to a selected group of consumer items including disposable cameras and razors, paper with less than a certain amount of recycled fibre and domestic chemical products such as weed killers, pesticides and glue. Beer and wine bottles, soft drink cans and water bottles will also be taxed a maximum of 15 francs a litre. Batteries and throw-away razors will have a levy of 10 and 20 francs respectively. Leading the battle against the tax are the plastics and chemicals industries. PVC bottles are the only product which will automatically be taxed the maximum 15 francs a litre in a bid to gradually abolish PVC production altogether. 'PVC is the most recycled material in Belgium today. It is clear there is a prima facie discrimination against PVC,' said Jean-Marie Chandelle, head of corporation communications with Belgium's largest PVC manufacturer, Solvay. French water manufacturers have joined the Belgian plastic industry in their protest as the majority of plastic-bottled water in Belgium is imported from France. The French government has lodged an official complaint against the tax with the Belgium authorities. For its part, the plastics industry has complained to the European Commission that the tax discriminates against PVC. But the tax has also angered a broad range of Belgian industry. 'We are not against the principle of imposing a levy on a product to correct damage done to the environment, but we are against an arbitrary and general taxation the proceeds of which will not be used for cleaning up the damage the product has done,' said Georges Jacobs, head of the Belgian Industry Federation. Belgium's eco-tax differs from packaging waste schemes already introduced in other EC countries because it will be high enough to change consumer habits and influence distributors' choice in packaging, rather than raising revenue for waste management investment. Environment has been the responsibility of Belgium's regional governments since 1980. Revenue from the eco-tax will be distributed to the Brussels, Flanders and Walloon authorities who will have control over its spending. The Belgian employers' organisation says there is no guarantee that money raised, an estimated BFr22.5bn on plastic bottles alone, is used for waste management and environment corrective projects. Doubts have also been raised over how the tax will be collected, although the Greens say the additional administration will be worth it because of the knowledge to be gained on consumer behaviour with regard to the environment. Following the outcry from industry against the proposals, it was agreed to establish a follow-up commission to examine the impact of the tax, part of a last-minute trade-off between the government and the Greens during their negotiations over the eco-tax. The government-appointed body will have considerable power to modify the law, including waiting until June 1994 before setting final tax levels. Resigned to the fact that the eco-tax will be introduced in Belgium in some form or other, Belgian packaging users, manufacturers and raw material producers are developing their own alternative packaging waste reduction programme, Fost-Plus, which will be based on Germany's Dual-System scheme. Under the Fost-Plus plans, distributors will pay a levy into a government fund which will be pumped back into industry-run waste management schemes. Industry hopes to persuade the Greens to adopt this system. Whether the ecologists can be persuaded to do this is uncertain. 'An essential element of green thinking is product policy, not just the production process. What's the point of a clean factory that makes polluting products?' asks Agalev member Chris Vermeeren, who helped draft the eco-tax legislation. Industry's other plan of attack is via the European Community. 'We hope the European Commission will at least object to the discriminatory clause against PVC,' said Nancy Rusotto of the Association of Plastic Manufacturers in Europe.</p>

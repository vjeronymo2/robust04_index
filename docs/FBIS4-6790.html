			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`Commemorative report' by Comrade Kim Kwang-chin, member of </F> DPRK National Defense Commission and Vice Marshal of Korean  People's Army, KPA, marking 62d anniversary of the founding of  the KPA at the 8 February Hall of Culture in Pyongyang -- live]    [Text] [applause] Comrades, today when all the people and  soldiers of the People's Army are effecting a new upsurge in  production and construction, while firmly defending the  socialist fatherland by upholding the militant appeal of the  party and the leader [suryong] and with single-hearted unity  under the revolutionary banner of self-reliance, we are  significantly commemorating the 62d anniversary of the founding  of the heroic Korean People's Army [KPA].    Marking the KPA founding anniversary -- a felicitous  revolutionary day -- I warmly congratulate the courageous  officers and men of the KPA and the Korean People's Security  Forces, who are firmly defending the defense line of the  fatherland by cherishing a lofty sense of loyalty to the party  and to the revolution, in the name of the Political Bureau of  the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee and of the  Central Military Commission of the party, under the  authorization of the respected comrade supreme commander.  [applause]    I also express the lofty sense of reverence to the  anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs and to the patriotic  fighters of the People's Army, who dedicated their precious  lives for independence and liberation of the fatherland, for  freedom of the people, for the party and for the revolution.  [applause]    I extend warm congratulations to the old anti-Japanese  fighters, old war veterans, disabled soldiers, and discharged  soldiers, who registered heroic feats in the arduous  anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and in the great fatherland  liberation war and who are continuously blooming the  revolutionary flowers of the socialist construction today.  [applause]    I send warm greetings to all people who are vigorously  struggling to defend, protect, and glorify the popular  mass-centered socialism of our own style in firm unity with the  party and the leader and who love and sincerely help the  People's Army as if they are their own offspring. [applause]    Comrades, more than 60 years have passed since our people  founded the Korean People's Revolutionary Army [KPRA] -- their  first revolutionary armed forces -- to achieve the cause of  national liberation by upholding the banner of the chuche idea.  At this significant occasion of commemorating the 62d  anniversary of the founding of the KPA today, we are recalling  with deep emotion the path of honorable struggle along which our  revolutionary armed forces have traversed and their immortal  achievements.    The cause of independence and the cause of socialism of the  popular masses are carried out in a fierce confrontation and  struggle against the imperialists and all sorts of  reactionaries, and these causes can be carried out successfully  by the armed support of the revolutionary armed forces. The  country and people without their mighty revolutionary armed  forces cannot defend the fatherland and the revolution from the  imperialists' aggression, nor can they victoriously advance the  cause of socialism.    The cause of building the revolutionary armed forces in our  country was pioneered by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song,  and it was continuously deepened and developed by the victorious  advance of the chuche revolutionary cause.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forth a policy on  building genuine revolutionary armed forces to organize and  improve the armed struggle against the Japanese imperialists  based on his deep insight into the historical lesson of our  country's anti-Japanese movement for national liberation learned  during the period he pioneered the course of the Korean  revolution. This was a revolutionary policy purporting that the  Korean revolution must be carried out by the Korean people  themselves. It was an original policy that opened a new road  for the anticolonial war for national liberation and for the  building of the revolutionary armed forces. [applause]    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song formed the KPRA on 25  April 1932 based on a strong political and military foundation,  which he himself provided through his energetic struggle to  realize his policy on building the revolutionary armed forces,  and proclaimed the founding of our revolutionary armed forces to  the entire world. [applause]    The founding of the KPRA was a magnificent birth of true  chuche-type revolutionary armed forces in our country. It was a  historic event that brought forth a momentous turning point in  our people's anti-Japanese struggle for national liberation and  in the development of their communist movement. [applause]    With the founding of the KPRA, our people could victoriously  wage the struggle, on a new higher plane, for the independence  of the country and the liberation of the people with their  genuine revolutionary armed forces. This was the very starting  point of the glorious history of our revolutionary armed forces.  Our revolutionary armed forces have traversed a proud  victorious road for the past six decades through the blaze of  the stern and arduous struggle. With their heroic struggle, our  revolutionary armed forces have made immortal achievements that  will shine long in the history of the country. [applause]    The respected and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim  Chong-il has noted: Our People's Army has waged a heroic  struggle to defend the party and the leader and to defend the  gains of the country and the revolution and has made great  accomplishments for the party and the revolution. The KPRA,  which was the first rank of our revolutionary armed forces, had  to wage a bloody struggle against the strong imperialist enemy  right from the time of its founding. The anti-Japanese  revolutionary struggle was the most glorious revolutionary war  in which our revolutionary armed forces defeated powerful  imperialists, fighting with them over a protracted period of  time under unprecedented arduous and grim conditions.    During the severe anti-Japanese revolutionary war, when  there was no rear area of the nation or support from regular  armed forces, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song victoriously  organized and led the KPRA while solving difficult and complex  problems raised in the course of implementing the general Korean  revolution, including the armed struggle, in an original way  based on a chuche- oriented position. [applause]    The KPRA men fully demonstrated the revolutionary Army's  militant power everywhere by using chuche-oriented hit-and-run  tactics under the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's  extraordinary military and political leadership. At last, our  revolutionary armed forces smashed the Japanese imperialist  aggressors and brilliantly achieved the historic cause of  liberalizing the fatherland by carrying out the heroic struggle  for 15 years while overcoming various trials beyond man's  imagination. [applause]    During the fortitude anti-Japanese struggle, the  single-hearted unity of revolutionary ranks around the leader  [suryong] was achieved, vivid models of the faithfulness of  upholding the leader [yongdoja] were created, and our party's  brilliant revolutionary traditions were firmly prepared. These  are deep and stout roots of our party and Army, as well as an  eternal footstone that guarantees the victory of our revolution.  [applause]    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song strengthened and  developed the KPRA into the regular armed forces, KPA, in a  short period following the liberalization, based on the  revolutionary armed forces' valuable traditions prepared in the  period of the anti-Japanese struggle. The KPA, the direct  descendant of the KPRA, has been strengthened and developed into  modern, regular armed forces and has excellently fulfilled its  honorable mission in defending our party's cause. The  invincible might of the KPA was fully demonstrated in the  fatherland liberation war, which was a great revolutionary war  in which our people defended their fatherland after defeating  [tasung] the U.S. imperialists, the head of world imperialism,  for the first time in history by carrying out the heroic  all-people struggle.    While saddling himself with the heavy burden for both the  front and the rear in the severe period of the life-and-death  war -- decisive to the destiny of the fatherland -- the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song united the entire party, the entire  Army, and all the people as one and organized and mobilized them  to the sublime struggle to destroy the enemies, thus leading the  fatherland liberation war to victory. [applause]    Upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's orders, the  wise and brave soldiers of our Army, Navy, and Air Force rose as  one and sagaciously fought to defend every inch of the  fatherland at the cost of their blood, while bearing deep in  mind their lofty mission for the fatherland the people.    Heroic feats of the People's Army officers and men, who  guaranteed the victory in the war by destroying the enemy's  tanks and warships with human bombs and by blocking the enemy's  guns with their hearts on the field of fierce battle with the  enemy, will be handed down forever with the history of the great  fatherland liberation war. [applause]    During the period of the arduous war, all the people in the  rear area, regardless of age or sex, rose and supported [wonho]  the front line and ensured wartime production by defending their  plants and villages. Thus, they made great contributions to the  victory of the war.    Officers and men of our People's Army inflicted disgraceful  defeat on the U.S. imperialist aggressors, who boasted being the  strongest in the world, by demonstrating mass heroism and a  sense of peerless sacrifice in the great fatherland liberation  war. Thus, they honorably defended independence of the  fatherland and sovereignty of the people. [applause]    Our people, who rose in a just fight against an armed  invasion of the imperialists, won active support and  encouragement from hundreds of millions of people in the world.  In particular, the Chinese people, who carried out a common  struggle against the Japanese imperialists for a long time,  dispatched support forces under the slogan: "Resist America and  aid Korea," and helped our people's struggle with their blood.  Our people are always grateful to our friends for the sincere  support and encouragement they extended to us during the most  arduous period. We will never forget them. [applause]    Our people won victory in fights against the two most  atrocious and strong imperialist powers in the anti-Japanese  revolutionary war and in the fatherland liberation war. These  victories were vigorous demonstrations of the might and  invincibility of our revolutionary ranks, who are firmly rallied  behind the party and the leader. [applause]    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forward the  self-defense military line for converting the entire Army into a  cadre Army, for modernizing the entire Army, for arming all  people, and for turning the whole country into a fortress, in  conformity with the demand of the situation created after the  war and of the development of our revolution. He also put  forward the outstanding and unique line for advancing economic  construction and national defense construction at the same time.  He wisely led the struggle to implement the line.    With thorough implementation of the party's line, our  People's Army has been strengthened to a  one-a-match-for-one-hundred revolutionary armed forces, and our  nation came to highly display its dignified appearance as a  strong independent, self-reliant, and self-defensive socialist  country. [applause]    The People's Army smashed every step of the enemy's constant  aggression and war provocation maneuvers, and reliably defended  the security of the nation and the people. Thus, the People's  Army made a great contribution to construction projects for the  nation's prosperity and the people's happiness. Whenever the  revolution faced an arduous trial, our People's Army tenaciously  defended and protected the party and the leader at the van of  struggle, and actively carried to accomplishment the party's  line and policy.    When the situation at home and abroad was complicated and  difficult after the war, the People's Army firmly defended the  party's cause with arms by upholding the slogan: "Let us defend  with our lives the party Central Committee headed by Comrade Kim  Il-song!"    At the same time, our People's Army displayed heroic feats  in  the great socialist construction by upholding the slogan of  loyalty: "What the party decides, we will do!" Thus, it  honorably fulfilled its mission as the Army of the leader, of  the party, and of the people. [applause]    Indeed, the brilliant history of our people's revolution has  been embroidered with proud feats of our revolutionary Armed  Forces registered before the nation and people. The great  creations built on the land of the fatherland contain precious  blood and sweat of officers and men of the People's Army. Today  our People's Army has entered a new historic period of its  development by following the outstanding and refined leadership  of Comrade Kim Chong-il, our supreme commander, and an epochal  turn is being effected in all domains of building the Army.  [applause]    Our comrade supreme commander, who directed great efforts  to strengthen and develop the People's Army at an early date,  put forward the outstanding line of building the Army and  remodeling the entire Army on the chuche idea in compliance with  the new demand of development of the revolution, and  energetically led the struggle to implement the line. The line  of remodeling the entire Army on the chuche idea is the most  just program for building the Army, which enables us to make  officers and men of the People's Army genuine revolutionary  vanguards who are unswervingly loyal to the party and to the  leader and to provide reliable military insurance for the  socialist cause by accomplishing the chuche-based cause for  building the Army. [applause]    The line of remodeling the entire Army on the chuche idea  has  been vigorously accelerated under the outstanding leadership of  the respected comrade supreme commander, and as a result, the  chuche-based system of commanding the Army, under which the  entire Army moves as one under the leadership of the party, has  been firmly established within the People's Army. The chuche  idea has been thoroughly embodied in all domains of building the  Army and military activities, and single-hearted unity and  tradition of loyalty have been brilliantly inherited.    Today all ranks of the People's Army are filled with  death-defying determination to loyally uphold the leadership of  the party, no matter what storm and trial may come forward, and  to become a fortress and a shield to defend and protect the  respected comrade supreme commander. [applause]    Our comrade supreme commander developed the chuche-oriented  tactics in compliance with the demand of modern warfare and with  the concrete conditions in our country, and wisely led us to  build a powerful modern defense industry and to constantly  strengthen combat capabilities and armed equipment of the  People's Army. Under the leadership of the respected comrade  supreme commander, our People's Army has been fostered to be a  loyal combat unit capable of fighting for the party and the  leader by dedicating its life and one-a-match-for-one-hundred  strong Army with all sorts of powerful offensive and defensive  means. Our revolutionary Armed Forces are upholding as their  supreme commander the great general and great commander who has  indomitable will and courage and outstanding strategy and  alchemy. Herein lies the guarantee for all victories and for  constant strengthening and developing of our revolutionary Armed  Forces. [applause]    Together with the People's Army, combat capabilities of the  Red Worker-Peasant Militia and Red Youth Guard have been  remarkably strengthened, and all people have been armed and the  whole country has been further consolidated as an impregnable  fortress.    Our party's idea for military-people unity has been  brilliantly embodied in the entire Army and whole society, and  as a result, blood ties between the military and people have  been further intensified at a new higher stage. As long as we  have the revolutionary Armed Forces, which have been  strengthened and developed into indomitable combat ranks, and as  long as we have the all-people defense system with the People's  Army as its center, we can smash any aggressor and firmly defend  the party's cause -- the socialist cause. We can say this with  confidence. [applause]    The party, the Army, and the people are firmly united as one  with our comrade supreme commander -- the great military  strategist and iron-willed sagacious commander -- as the center,  and constitute a strong independent main force of the  revolution. Therefore, our socialism is advancing victoriously  without wavering even in the midst of violent upheaval.  [applause]    This invincible might of our revolution was verified again  through a severe trial last year. Last year's political and  military confrontation between our people and the U.S.  imperialists was a large battle without gunshots. It was also  an all-people, life-and-death battle to protect our party and  the socialist fatherland.    When the fatherland and the revolution faced a grave trial,  our comrade supreme commander took the stern self-defensive  measure of declaring a semi-war state of the entire nation, all  the people, and the entire Army to cope with the then-prevailing  situation.    After receiving the supreme commander's order from the  bottom  of their hearts, officers and men of the People's Army and all  the people launched as one into the struggle to protect the  country's sovereignty and revolutionary gains and honorably  defended the dignity and safety of their socialist fatherland by  smashing the enemy's challenge and aggression maneuver. This  was a victory of our comrade supreme commander's extraordinary  military strategies, braveness, and iron-firm faith and will as  well as a great victory of the single-hearted unity of the  leader, the party, and the masses. [applause]    The valuable achievements and immortal feats registered by  our revolutionary Armed Forces were a brilliant victory of the  chuche- oriented military ideology of the great leader Comrade  Kim Il-song and the respected and beloved supreme commander  Comrade Kim Chong-il as well as the result of the outstanding  and seasoned leadership of the party and the leader. [applause]    At this meaningful moment of commemorating the 62d  anniversary of the founding of the KPA, I extend the greatest  honor and the warmest gratitude, along with the boundless  admiration and fervent loyalty of all people across the country  and of the People's Army officers and men, to Comrade Kim  Il-song, the great leader of our party and our people, who  founded our revolutionary Armed Forces at an early age and has  led them along the single road of victory, thus greatly  demonstrating the honor of our fatherland and our nation and  building a firm military guarantee for the completion of the  socialist cause in our country, and to the respected and beloved  supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, an extraordinary  military genius. [applause]    Comrades:    Today's situation for our revolution is very complicate and  tense. We must build socialism amid fierce confrontation with  the enemy and achieve the historic cause of national  reunification. The U.S. imperialists and reactionaries have  unprecedentedly strengthened anti-Republic maneuvers in order to  isolate and crush our nation -- the stronghold of socialism --  on pretext of the so-called nuclear problem. By bringing  numerous war means and troops into South Korea, they are leading  the situation on the Korean peninsula into the brink of war  while militarily threatening us. We should further strengthen  the People's Army to accelerate the revolution and construction  and to firmly defend the popular masses-oriented socialism of  our own style under today's acute situation.    The might of the People's Army lies, above all, in its  political and ideological superiority. We should intensify the  party's political work in the People's Army so as to firmly arm  all soldiers with the chuche idea and to make them resolute  revolutionary fighters who do not hesitate in sacrificing their  youth and lives for the party, the leader, the fatherland, and  the people.    The endless loyalty to the party's leadership is the life of  the People's Army. Officers and men of the People's Army should  thoroughly establish a revolutionary military trait, with which  the entire Army acts as one according to the supreme commander's  order, and should make all ranks of the People's Army filled  with the revolutionary, militant military spirit of working and  living in conformity with the party's ideology and intent.  [applause]    The ethos of unity between officers and men and between the  party and society is an important content of the ideological  superiority of the People's Army and lofty trait to be  maintained by all soldiers. The officers and men of the People's  Army should show the unity between the upper and lower levels,  continue to highly display the ethos of unity between officers  and men and between the party and society with which they help  and lead each other, and further be possessed with lofty traits  of a revolutionary army.    The political and ideological superiority of the People's  Army can display its invincible might when it is combined with  military and technological preparedness. In accordance with the  party's military line of self-reliance, we should thoroughly  implement the party's policy of turning the whole Army into an  army of cadres, a modernized army, and continue to exert efforts  to make all the people armored and fortify the entire country,  thereby fortify the self-reliant national defense power that is  able to resolutely defend and safeguard the popular  masses-centered socialism of our own style in any changing  situation. [applause]    The People's Army should put emphasis on combat and  political  training as the fundamental task and thoroughly implement the  training methods and principles presented by the party. All  soldiers should be strongly armed with our party's military  strategic ideology and chuche-motivated war method, foster them  as one-a-match-for-a-hundred fighters with high combat  efficiency suitable for modern war, and further reinforce the  People's Army companies. Highly displaying the traditional  ethos of army-people unity is important for strengthening the  People's Army and completing the preparations for a combat.  Only when the People's Army help the people--the people  actively support the Army, and the Army and the people literally  become harmoniously united--can the People's Army be  strengthened and developed into a matchless rank and win the  fights against the enemies.    Officers of the People's Army should maintain the spirit of  devoted service for the fatherland and the people, and continue  to demonstrate heroic feats in the struggle to build socialist  economy and protect the people's lives and property. The people  should establish social ethos that stresses military affairs,  and love and sincerely support the People's Army as family. In  this way, the Army and the people can firmly be prepared to  fight as one sharing the destiny of life and death in the  contingency.    The single-hearted unity between the party and the  revolutionary rank should be strengthened by all means. The  single-hearted unity of the leader, the party, and the masses is  our party's revolutionary philosophy and our revolution's mighty  weapon. As did in the past, we should face the enemies with  single-hearted unity in the future to push forward and complete  our revolution with the might of single-hearted unity.  [applause]    All the people and the KPA officers and men should be loyal  toward the party and the leader and have their belief and  character, and defend our firmly united revolutionary rank's  single-hearted unity around the respected and beloved comrade  supreme commander like the apples of the eyes.    Economic construction is an important work for firmly  building up our socialist revolutionary position. In this  regard, we should thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary  economic strategy so as to further strengthen and highly display  the superiority of socialism of our own style. In order to  thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary economic  strategy, we should highly manifest the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude.    We should break through difficulties and obstacles in  socialist economic construction with a revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude, and at the same time we should  continue to work without faltering with the firm ideological  determination to carry out assigned revolutionary tasks with our  own strength. National reunification is the nation's supreme  task that should not be delayed even for a moment. We should  achieve the cause of national reunification at the earliest  possible date to achieve our nation's unanimous desire. Thus, we  should hand a reunified fatherland over to our next generations.    Our party and the Government of the Republic have made all  sincere efforts to achieve national reunification under the  principle of national independence in conformity with the desire  of the whole nation and the desire of the times. However, a  graver obstacle has been created on the road ahead of national  reunification because of the maneuvers of the United States and  the South Korean authorities.    The United States is adhering to the military adventure  [kunsajok mohom] to crush [apsal] our Republic by stepping up  anti-Republic pressure commotions more openly in the  international arena over our nuclear problem. The South Korean  authorities frequently stage large-scale military exercises  against our Republic in collusion with outside forces and are  driving North-South relations to a dangerous phase while talking  about military countermeasures and an international cooperation  system under the pretext of our nuclear problem.    All of these moves in South Korea show that traitor Kim  Yong-sam is precisely an out-and-out flunkeyist nation-seller  who surpasses successive puppets, a treacherous and wicked  fascist hangman, and implacable warmaniac.    As for our nuclear problem that the U.S. imperialists and  their followers are clamoring about, it is a product of the  antisocialist and anti-Republic maneuvers that the United States  has been tenaciously perpetrating. It is precisely the United  States who brought nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula and  is actually threatening us. It is also the United States who  clamors about the suspicion of the nonexistent nuclear  development in the North. Even now the United States is  deploying improved new type missiles to South Korea and is,  thus, further strengthening military pressure on us. This proves  that the United States has not renounced its wild ambition to  keep hold on South Korea as an advanced base of the Far East and  that it is using the nuclear problem as a means to isolate and  crush our Republic.    The danger of war is growing momentarily on the Korean  peninsula because of the reckless military threat and war  provocation maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and the South  Korean puppet clique [choson pandoesonun chonjaengui wihomi sisi  kakkakuro kogago issomnida].    Today, at a time when our nation, which has been forced by  outside forces to endure the sufferings of division for half a  century, is faced with even the danger of suffering the  holocaust of nuclear war. We can never look at this grave  situation with folded arms. Although they are frantically  running wild to isolate and suffocate our Republic and crush our  socialism under the pretext of the nuclear problem, the U.S.  imperialists and international reactionaries cannot frighten our  people with any pressure, threat, or blackmail, and no  high-handedness or pressure can fool us. As recognized by the  world, our people do not like to engage in empty talk. They are  a resolute people [kyoltansong innun inmin] who will do what  they say they will and will not do anything when they say they  will not. Responding to dialogue with dialogue and to war with  war is our firm position. [applause]    Our people who treasure the nation's independence and the  country's peace do not want war, but we will not beg for peace  even if our sovereign rights are infringed upon. Pursuing  aggression and war under the pretext of peace is the  imperialists' conventional means. All situations taking place  today on the Korean peninsula and the international arena show  that the imperialists' aggressive and plunderous nature will not  change at all and that we must not have any kind of fantasy  about imperialism.    The officers and men of the People's Army and the People's  Security Forces and members of the Red Worker-Peasant Militia  and Red Youth Guards must be firmly armed with the  chuche-oriented point of view on war, observe with vigilance the  moves of the enemies, and assume a full combat readiness to  destroy in a single blow whenever and wherever the enemies  attack. [applause]    If a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula where U.S.  nuclear weapons are concentratedly deployed, it will easily draw  the world into the ravages of a thermonuclear war. Then, man  will suffer an irrecoverable wretched calamity. The United  States and the South Korean authorities must contemplate over  the grave consequences this reckless act will bring about and  act with discretion. The Japanese reactionary class must  correctly look at the trend of the times and must not commit a  rash and thoughtless action.    If the U.S. imperialists and their following forces kindle  the flames of a war on Korea to the very end, running counter to  the trend of the times, our people and the People's Army will  fight to the end for the party and the leader and for our  socialist fatherland obtained through blood, to thoroughly  annihilate and sweep away the aggressors and once again manifest  the spirit of the heroic Korea. [applause]    Today's situation is presenting a very grave problem before  our 70 million people of whether to open the road for the  fatherland's reunification through great national unity, or  become a victim of the big powers by carrying out hostility and  confrontation between the fellow countrymen. Our nation must  move toward the road of reunifying the fatherland through great  national unity. Great national unity must be achieved to break  the current deadlock, defend the nation's dignity and sovereign  rights, and open the road for the fatherland's independent and  peaceful reunification. All the fellow Korean countrymen of the  North, South, and overseas must unite as one under the banner of  the 10-point program of great national unity for the  fatherland's reunification to carry out a nation-wide struggle.  Therefore, we will realize the cause of the fatherland's  reunification without fail. [applause]    Our people's struggle today is arduous, but it is an  honorable and sacred struggle for the fatherland's prosperity  and man's bright future. Voices of the world's revolutionary  people supporting the socialist cause and our people's struggle  for the fatherland's reunification are being raised with each  passing day, and our revolution's international solidarity is  being all the more strengthened. Amid the active support and  encouragement of the world's progressive people, there is no  power in this world that can obstruct our people's advance  fighting for the just cause of the leadership of the great  leader and the great party. We will also be always victorious.  [applause]    Let us all single-heartedly unite around the party Central  Committee accompanied by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim  Il-song to all the more vigorously fight in realizing the cause  of the fatherland's reunification and completing the chuche  revolutionary cause. [applause]    Hurrah for Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our  party  and people! [shouts of hurrahs and applause]    Hurrah for the glorious WPK, the organizer and leader  [hyangdoja] of all victories of the Korean people! [shouts of  hurrahs and applause]    Let there be victory and glory for the officers and men of  the heroic KPA. [applause]</p>

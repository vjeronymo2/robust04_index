			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / BZW moves towards a new generation Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays, yesterday signalled a move towards a new generation of management with an announcement to staff that Mr John Spencer, its 50-year-old deputy chief executive, is to leave the firm at the end of the year. Mr Spencer is to be succeeded as chief executive to BZW's markets division by Mr Sam Marrone, an American who is currently chief executive of BZW Securities in New York. The firm may decide on a successor to Mr Spencer as deputy chief executive later this year. The move follows a request from Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' chief executive, for BZW to establish a successor to Mr David Band, BZW's chief executive since 1988. Although Mr Band, who is 51, has no immediate plan to move, it is thought that he may do so in two or three years. Mr Band could then become chairman of BZW, a post currently held by Sir Peter Middleton, who is also deputy chairman of Barclays. There was speculation over whether Sir Peter would remain at the bank after Mr Taylor was appointed last year, but Mr Taylor is believed to regard him highly. BZW said yesterday that Mr Spencer had decided to leave of his own accord and that the parting was 'entirely amicable'. He has worked at Barclays for 24 years, recently bringing the bank's foreign exchange and money markets operations into BZW, and developing new risk management systems for trading. The move leaves no clear successor to Mr Band, but the question could be resolved with the appointment of a new deputy chief executive. The appointee would probably be drawn from the eight-member management committee headed by Mr Band which runs BZW's operations. BZW told staff that Mr Marrone, a 51-year-old former US marine, is to move to London at the end of the year. As well as heading the markets division, he will share responsibility for the debt capital markets operation with Mr Graham Pimlott. Mr Dennis Rooke, deputy chief executive of the markets division and head of global money markets and foreign exchange, will take on liaison responsibility for the Middle East. Mr Ben Grigsby, joint deputy chief executive of the markets division, will succeed Mr Marrone in New York. Some Barclays directors had regarded Mr John Varley, formerly deputy chief executive of the equities division, as a candidate to succeed Mr Band in the longer term. But Mr Varley decided to leave BZW earlier this year for personal reasons. Mr Pimlott, to whom Mr Taylor has given responsibility for large corporate lending as well as merchant banking would be a candidate to succeed Mr Band. Mr Band joined BZW from the US bank J. P. Morgan in 1988. If Mr Band were to become chairman of BZW, Sir Peter might take on other responsibilities within Barclays, despite being over the bank's official retirement age.</p>

He said the Georgian Government is helpless and incapable  not  only to provide with the security of the pipeline but also to  cope with the Azerbaijani military joints [as received] acting  in that part of Georgia.    Adonts declared that Azerbaijani militants control all the  elevations along the Southern part of the pipeline. He said it  hampers the reconstruction of the pipeline. In the same time  Roland Adonts rejected the idea of Armenia's military  interference for provision of the pipeline security. He  considers it impossible because this region of Georgia is  basically inhabited by Azerbaijanians. This problem requires a  serious political and military interference of Russia and  Georgia.</p>

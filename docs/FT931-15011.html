			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / CBS buys some expensive chat DAVID LETTERMAN, a 45-year-old comedian and chat show host from Indianapolis, was last night set to be poached from NBC by CBS Television for a salary of about Dollars 14m (Pounds 9.2m) a year, making him the world's best-paid chat show host. For CBS, the network controlled by Mr Larry Tisch, the billionaire investor, hiring Mr Letterman would be a potentially profitable coup. Both networks were scrambling yesterday to arrange press conferences, with NBC, a subsidiary of General Electric, planning to announce in Los Angeles that it had decided not to match the CBS offer. Mr Letterman, an articulate showman who hosts an offbeat chat show starting at 12.30am, has been unhappy since he lost the chance last spring to take over the Tonight Show when Johnny Carson, host of show for decades, retired. Instead of Mr Letterman, NBC named Jay Leno, a square-jawed comedian who has been panned by many critics, to host the Tonight Show, which is broadcast for an hour from 11.30 in the evening. That put Mr Leno up against ABC's Nightline with Ted Koppel, the influential current affairs programme. CBS was only able to offer mysteries and movies in this important time slot. By moving from NBC to CBS Mr Letterman would not only fulfil his ambitions by launching a programme in the 11.30 slot and competing directly with the Tonight Show, but he would also double his salary. His negotiations have been handled by Mr Michael Ovitz, the head of Creative Artists Agency (CAA), the Hollywood talent agency that is the most powerful in the US. NBC's management has been criticised for a sharp decline in audience ratings over the past two years. General Electric is believed to be interested in selling the network provided it can obtain the right price; among those interested is a consortium headed by Bill Cosby, the comedian.</p>

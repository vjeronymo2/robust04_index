Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar stressed to QUDS PRESS: Naturally, we  will not participate in any legislative or executive institution  linked to self-rule so that we will not bear the responsibility  for signing an agreement that is incompatible with our doctrine  and political program. Hamas, however, will participate in any  elections to choose the Palestinian people's representatives  provided those elections are not connected to the agreement or  to any preconditions that might divert the elections toward  political goals that are inconsistent with our tendencies.    Al-Zahhar ruled out any clash between the Palestinian  authority expected to be established in the occupied territories  and Hamas. He said: We will endeavor to solve our problems on a  personal level. In the event that any problem develops we will  ask to meet with PLO officials or the authority to resolve the  differences.

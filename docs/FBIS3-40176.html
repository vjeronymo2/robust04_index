			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Xiyan: "The Machinery Industry's Problems </F> in Developing Foreign-Funded Enterprises"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Many problems have emerged in  the process of developing foreign-funded enterprises in the  machinery industry, and those problems are harming the healthy  development of the utilization of foreign capital in the  machinery industry, and warrant a high degree of attention.  <H5>  Most Projects Are Small in Scale and Low in Standards </H5>   The average agreed amount of foreign investment for  foreign-funded enterprises in the machinery industry is only  $1.03 million. The amount of funds actually invested is even  more pitifully small. In the Jiangsu and Anhui region, most  foreign investment consists of funds invested by Hong Kong and  Taiwan businesses and processing projects for Japanese  businesses. In terms of technology, there has been no  qualitative improvement in enterprises' products. This shows  that in terms of the average amount of investment for the  projects, China's machinery industry's utilization of foreign  capital is characterized by small scale and low standards, and  that it is necessary to develop joint ventures and cooperation  with internationally renowned large transnational conglomerates,  thereby raising standards and achieving upgrades.  <H5>  Projects Are Not Properly Distributed </H5>   Basic parts and basic machinery are the weak links of the  machinery industry, and the improvement of the overall standards  of the machinery industry depends on the rapid development of  basic parts and basic machinery. However the basic parts sector  has utilized only $200 million in foreign direct investment,  accounting for 4 percent; the average amount of foreign capital  involved for the projects is only $630,000. Basic machinery  mainly refers to machine tools. The machine tool sector has  utilized only less then $300 million in foreign direct  investment, accounting for 6 percent; the average amount  utilized for the projects is only $650,000. In the two basic  sectors, the scale of utilization of foreign capital and the  average amount of foreign capital utilized for the projects are  both small, and the technological content of products is low;  the two basic sectors are far from meeting the demands of the  overall development of the machinery industry. Therefore it is  necessary to accelerate the development of the two sectors.  <H3>  The Problem of Increasing Pressure at Every Level and  Pursuing Quantity in a One-Sided Manner Is Serious </H3>   The purpose of developing foreign-funded enterprises is to  make up for the insufficiency of domestically gathered funds,  accelerate the optimization of economic structure, accelerate  resource development, and promote technological progress.  Nevertheless, some localities seek to increase the number of  foreign-funded enterprises in a one-sided manner, increasing  pressure at every level; they have made the quantity of foreign  capital utilized an item of performance evaluation. As a result,  in whatever areas foreign businesses have shown interest, there  will be negotiations on those areas, and projects in those areas  will be carried out accordingly. Joint ventures are established  in a blind manner. "Whatever is put into the basket is  considered vegetable." There is no bargaining with cooperation  partners, neither is there any strategy or blueprint. Also,  there is a lack of macro-level guidance.  <H5>  Pre-project Decision Making Is Ineffective </H5>   Currently, when making preproject decisions on  foreign-funded  enterprises, many localities have failed to form strong teams to  conduct investigation, study, surveying, and supporting  analysis, and have instead operated in a perfunctory manner,  grabbing everything available indiscriminately. The main  manifestations include: 1) A failure to select cooperation  partners carefully; 2) a failure to conduct extensive market  investigations and a tendency to join the action in a hurry,  resulting in redundant projects; 3) a failure to acquire  adequate information about foreign businesses' credit status,  resulting in being defrauded in some cases; and 4) a failure to  conduct self-evaluation and consider future development in an  adequate manner. A factory in Wuxi signed the contract on a  joint venture project with a U.S. company before the assets of  the Chinese partner had been evaluated. According to later  evaluations, the assets were worth more than estimated in the  contract; asset disputes thus ensued, casting a shadow over the  development of the joint venture. The joint-venture contract on  a joint-venture project between a factory in Anhui and ABB  Corporation was signed when agreements on technological  transfers and on plant, equipment, and land leasing had not been  entirely worked out; in addition the contract provided that the  technological-transfer percentage-retention payment should  amount to 3 percent of net sales. Without an agreement on  technological transfers, how could there be any  technological-transfer percentage-retention payment? Is all this  not very strange?  <H5>  There Is No Guarantee of Supporting Funds </H5>   In developing joint ventures, the Chinese partners depend  almost entirely on loans for funds. Since the middle of last  year, supporting funds have been in short supply. As a result  agreements on some new projects on which negotiation has been  completed cannot be signed according to schedule; projects on  which agreements have been signed cannot start to be constructed  or be put into production operation according to schedule; and  the projects which have been put into operation cannot function  normally. Consequently, foreign businesses' confidence in  project success has been lowered, and the rate of delivery of  agreed investment funds has declined.  <H3>  Internal, External Management of Foreign-Funded Enterprises  Is Not Strict </H3>   1. The property rights of Chinese partners do not have  actual  effects, and the responsibility for state assets is not clearly  located. As the present period is a changing and transition  period, the rights of local machinery-industry management  agencies as representatives of state assets are not clearly  defined. After becoming joint ventures, most enterprises' boards  of directors contain no officials from government agencies. The  supervisory agencies' management of enterprises is carried out  mainly through the boards of directors, but most directors  representing the Chinese partners work as employees in the joint  ventures, and are thus unable to represent the interest of the  Chinese partners in a satisfactory manner.    2. Foreign partners often take advantage of Chinese  partners'  weaknesses, such as being unfamiliar with the international  market situation and lacking purchasing and marketing channels,  by manipulating prices and fee standards, appropriating  enterprise profits, and evading taxes, thereby harming the  interests of the country.    3. The system of external management of foreign-funded  enterprises is not yet characterized by an organic structure,  and management work is weak.  <H3>  Quantity, Quality of Trained Personnel Cannot Meet Demands  of Development </H3>   1. There is a lack of personnel competent for externally  oriented economic activities. There are often no suitable people  who can negotiate with foreign parties. Consequently it has been  necessary to cope with the matter by using some people who are  doing other work. Those people do not understand negotiating  procedures, negotiation techniques, or international practices.  Whatever the foreign parties say is accepted. All this has  created a very difficult situation.    2. The people who participate in the management of joint  ventures on the Chinese side are relatively low in quality and  strong in self interest, and do not act in the interests of the  country, resulting in damages to the interest of the country.  For instance, a joint-venture company in Suzhou has five  directors, three of whom represent the Chinese partner; but one  Chinese director is siding with the foreign partner. As a  result, control over the joint-venture company has fallen into  foreign hands when the Chinese partner has a majority of the  shares. Secondly, the professional competence is also low.  Chinese partners' representatives play no effective role in the  management of joint ventures. Chinese managers of some joint  ventures lack knowledge about foreign languages, computers, and  the accounting system, do not grasp the actual business  situation of the joint ventures, and are thus unable to  participate in management.    3. As the standards of some Chinese technical personnel in  joint ventures are low, the process of nationalizing production  has been slow, and it has been difficult to achieve a foreign  exchange balance.  <H5>  Information Channels Do Not Function Well </H5>   China does not yet have a complete information system  providing enterprises with information about foreign capital.  This fact has produced large adverse effects on developing  foreign-funded enterprises. First, Chinese enterprises do not  have detailed information about large companies in their  respective industries around the world. If they want to form  joint ventures, they cannot take the initiative in seeking joint  venture partners, but can only negotiate with those who have  come, resulting in a large degree of blindness and a low success  rate. Second, as they do not know the situation of prices and  purchasing channels for the equipments needed by the joint  ventures on the international market, they cannot but let  foreign partners make profits and harm Chinese interests by  raising prices at will. Third, Chinese partners do not control  channels of purchasing raw materials and parts needed by the  joint ventures or channels of marketing joint venture products  on the international market. As a consequence, foreign partners  can import things at high prices and export things at low  prices, thereby making huge profits in the circulation stage. At  the same time the joint ventures would be suffering losses in  terms of what the books show; thus the Chinese partners will  receive no dividends and the state can collect no taxes.</p>

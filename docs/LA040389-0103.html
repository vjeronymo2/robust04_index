			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MAKEOVER DIDN'T TAKE;  </P> <P> MRS. ILLINOIS HAS A WORD FOR PAGEANT -- A FOUR-LETTER WORD  </P> <P> Renee Johnson said good riddance today to her reign as Mrs. Illinois. She said  pageant officials wanted to make her up like a hooker. They claim they tried  but failed to make her a lady.  </P> <P> "I told my husband that if I ever mention entering a beauty contest again, that  he should give me a good shake," said the 25-year-old Rockford woman.  </P> <P> Johnson was barred from the weekend ceremonies that crowned her successor,  Barbara Trobar.  </P> <P> Pageant Director Marcie Aceto said Johnson violated terms of her contract.  </P> <P> "I don't think she went on all of her appearances, but I really couldn't tell  you all of them," Aceto said. "I can't remember them. I do know that I tried to  make this woman a lady, and she couldn't even say thank you for what we turned  her into."  </P> <P> Aceto said Johnson "likes to use four-letter words and doesn't embody what I  think a Mrs. Illinois should be."  </P> <P> Johnson admitted she used "some foul words," but denied any contract  violations. She said pageant officials tried to make her over.  </P> <P> "I am a housewife," she said. "I didn't want blond streaks painted in my hair .  . . They wanted me to dress in glitter clothes, and I wanted to be myself . . .  I didn't want to end up looking like a hooker."  </P></p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (3): Confidence begins to return  -United Kingdom AFTER the exciting years of the late 1980s, the UK mergers and acquisitions market went into hibernation in the early 1990s. Last year it barely stirred in its deep sleep. But now there are signs that the market is waking up. This is not to say that a return to the action of the last decade is expected, in the short or even long term. It is agreed that the frenetic activity seen then is unlikely to be repeated. But one merchant banker reports the first half of 1993 has been as busy as ever before in his corporate finance department, though much of the work is new issues and privatisations as well as bids and deals activity. Another says: 'Confidence is beginning to come back, but slowly. In 1992, companies were keeping their heads down, containing costs and no-one wanted to know about making bids. Now they are beginning to look at expanding by acquisition again.' However, many consider there are few 'cheap' companies available to a bidder. The high level of the stock market relative to companies' earnings means businesses are expensive to buy. Furthermore, the increasing amount of research done on companies means there are fewer undervalued stocks around. Certainly the trend of hostile, break-up bids seems over. Hanson's Pounds 780m hostile bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall last November was topped by a recommended Pounds 935m offer from rival Tomkins in December. Even the Tomkins bid might have appeared an old-style unbundling attempt but seven months on Tomkins had not made a single significant disposal of RHM assets. Other hostile bids have failed - such as T. Cowie's offer for Henlys Group last summer, and Airtours offer for Owners Abroad this year - as investors have given the target company's management a chance to prove themselves. Gone too appears to be the simplistic attitude that a company on a p/e of 20 can pay 15 times earnings for another, and make money on the deal. One merchant banker says that hostile bids and financially driven bids are 'extremely difficult to win. Investors want a cash alternative and these are difficult to provide'. Traditionally, companies making share bids have offered a cash alternative through the underwriting system. However, such cash underpinnings are expensive in commissions. The takeover timetable in the UK takes up to 60 days from the issue of the first offer document, and longer if a competing bid appears. Underwriters demand higher commissions for longer risk periods, especially in bids where if the stock market falls during the offer period, shareholders in the target company are more likely to opt for the cash alternative leaving more stock with the underwriters. Airtours, for instance, said its failed bid for Owners Abroad cost Pounds 9m, of which Pounds 5m covered underwriting commissions and advisers' fees. Agreed deals can be easier to finance, for example using vendor placings which can be arranged to coincide with the announcement of the bid, or issuing convertible Eurobonds. Pilkington's Pounds 95m purchase of Heywood Williams glass distribution arm, for instance, was financed by the issue of a sterling 5-year bond with equity warrants. Sedgwick, the insurance broker, financed its acquisition of Medisure, a private health insurer, by a share placing and later issued a convertible bond. T &amp; N, the motor component maker, financed its purchase of Goetze, a German piston ring manufacturer, with a share placing. If hostile bids are out of fashion, agreed or friendly deals are the vogue. And while conglomeration - buying an extra leg - is also demode, industry restructuring through friendly deals is in. Says one corporate financier: 'There is a trend for less financially-driven activity and more industrially-driven activity.' Such deals are more likely to be friendly, since, he argues, if there is a strong commercial logic then both sides will recognise it. Take for instance the recent agreed deal between Greenalls and Devenish. The combination of the two pub operators will produce one of the biggest chains in the UK, with more than 2,000 pubs. Only two years ago Devenish successfully fought off a hostile bid from Boddington. Other instances of commercially driven deals are BT's recently announced alliance with MCI of the US, which involves a joint venture between the two and BT taking a 20 per cent stake in MCI; and Richemont's decision to rearrange its luxury goods and tobacco brands into separate companies. Another trend is towards cross-border deals. Many companies now feel constrained by their domestic markets and want to expand internationally. The agreed bid by Kingfisher, the retail group, for Darty, the French electrical chain, was Kingfisher's first significant move outside the UK. One expert says that in the past five years, more than 60 per cent of merger and acquisition activity by UK companies has involved buying or selling a non-UK asset. To meet these needs many banks are now stressing their global strengths, and ability to advise clients on doing deals in different continents. Many UK merchant banks have wide networks covering Europe, America and the Far East. Also, those US banks which have succeeded in the UK market have done so by stressing their international expertise. Goldman Sachs, for instance, developed its UK business initially in the early 1980s by advising UK companies on buying businesses in the US. Within merchant banks one trend has been to develop expertise in particular industry sectors. If a corporate financier knows an industry intimately he can suggest deals to companies, or think laterally around a client's problem. Fees for corporate finance work do not seem to have fallen much, in spite of competition for work. One merchant banker says: 'There has been some evidence of fee cutting. If clients are in recession we must be as reasonable as we can be on fees. But no one is gaining market share on that basis.' Many say that fees are heavily success-related, with fee structures designed only to cover costs if a transaction does not go ahead.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    TOP FIVE ACQUISITIONS OF PRIVATE UK COMPANIES COMPLETED IN 1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Target (UK)     Adviser         Bidder      Adviser    Value (Pounds m)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Virgin Music    Goldman Sachs   Thorn EMI   SG            560 Group                           (UK)        Warburg  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Allied-Lyons    SG Warburg    Carlsberg       -           510 (UK brewing                     (UK brewing interests)                      interests)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Del Monte       Charterhouse    Royal Foods SG            360 Foods Intl      Bank            (UK)/Anglo  Warburg                                 American                                 Corp (SA)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Express Dairy/  SG Warburg    Northern    NM            359 Eden Vale                       Foods (UK)  Rothschild  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cope Allman     Credit Suisse   Bowater     Morgan          232 Packaging       First Boston    (UK)        Grenfell  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Acquisitions Monthly/AMDATA III  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 1992 UK PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LEAGUE TABLE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Adviser                           Value (Pounds m)        No of deals  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SG Warburg (2*)                      9,973                  29 Schroders (5)                          5,131                  37 Samuel Montagu (13)                    4,176                  16 Morgan Grenfell (4)                    3,193                  33 NM Rothschild (1)                    2,463                  25 Goldman Sachs (3)                      1,817                  14 Barclays de Zoete Wedd (6)             1,566                  23 Baring Brothers (7)                      962                  21 Lazard (16)                              907                  20 Kleinwort Benson (8)                     816                  28 KPMG Peat Marwick (-)                    711                  55 Price Waterhouse (-)                     500                  58 Coopers &amp; Lybrand (-)                    493                  86 Charterhouse (-)                         414                  22 Credit Suisse First Boston (19)          403                   4 Hambros Bank (-)                         330                  19 Morgan Stanley (11)                      263                   3 Robert Fleming (-)                       262                  15 Lehman Brothers (12)                     256                   5 Touche Ross (10)                         250                  46  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This table is based on the 1992 public league table plus UK private transactions completed between January and December 1992; * 1991 ranking  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Acquisitions Monthly  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

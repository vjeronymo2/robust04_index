			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Thorvald Stoltenberg, cochairman of the </F> Geneva conference, and Radovan Karadzic, president of the  republic of Srpska, on the Geneva talks; place and date not  given -- recorded; Karadzic and Stoltenberg speak in English  with superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian]    [Text] [Stoltenberg] It has been confirmed again that all  three sides will continue to act according to the plan of action  of the European Union, which means on the union of the three  republics. To be more precise, Sarajevo will be under UN  administration, Mostar under European Union administration. The  Bosnian Presidency will be given one-third of the territories.  So far, we have not managed to overcome the issue of  territories. In the coming days, the United States and Russia  are going to talk actively with the conflicting sides in order  to be able to see whether the negotiating process can be  continued. We will then meet again at the end of this month or  the beginning of March. Progress in the talks: That means  that I can look somebody in the eye and say that we are closer  to peace than we were on Friday, at the beginning of the talks.  No, I could not say that. Therefore, we now have the agreement  that Sarajevo will be under UN administration, but we do not  have an agreement that we will take Sarajevo by storm first.    [Karadzic] We have invested a great effort to give the  Muslim Republic first 30 percent and then 33 percent of the  territory. However, they have expanded their demand to 15 more  towns, seven from the Croats and eight from the Serbs. It is  obvious that they have rejected the plan of the European Union.  They are using the method of delaying in order to gain time and  cause military intervention with a view of improving the  situation in and around Sarajevo. This is why they have  rejected the plan on Sarajevo that was accepted a few days ago  in cooperation with Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg.    We must stress here that the Muslims are not taking peace  seriously and that the threats by the international community  are encouraging the Muslims not to sign peace but to continue  fighting. If they fight for territories legitimately then nobody  can guarantee 33.33 percent to them. They are gambling.    As regards threats, they are going to threaten, whatever we  do, because our behavior did not cause these threats. The  reason for the NATO threats is NATO itself. Problems within  NATO are the reason for the threats.    Besides, Mr. Juppe, French minister of foreign affairs who  is  trying to pull the United States into the chaos and push it into  the conflict, is trying to compromise NATO. If NATO interferes  in a conflict on one side, this is the end of NATO.    We can completely guarantee the security of those people who  are working on humanitarian aid in the republic of Srpska.</p>

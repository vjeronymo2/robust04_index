			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Technology: A closer look at shoppers - Worth Watching Retailers often have only a hazy idea of which promotions work best and what attractions tempt shoppers most. To help them identify what makes people stop and buy, Global Systems has come up with SelectaCount, a small device for counting and recording those going past, stopping and even picking up products. SelectaCount is a development of another product designed to trigger spoken messages for point-of-sale displays. Anthony Prior, managing director, says its potential retail and market research applications are numerous. It works by measuring the minute effect a body has on a sensitive electronic circuit. 'It's so sensitive, it can even measure people hiding behind doors, walking past a shop window or even standing behind a brick wall.' SelectaCount can be rented from 75p a week or bought for around Pounds 150. Global Systems: UK, 0273-329880.</p>

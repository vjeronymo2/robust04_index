			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Caricom reduces external tariff and pleases no-one THE Caribbean Community (Caricom) has lowered the rates of a controversial tariff being applied to imports from third countries. However, the reduction has angered regional businesses which want continued protection, and is not expected to satisfy the community's critics, including the US, which want more substantial and immediate cuts. At an extraordinary summit in Trinidad, the leaders of the 13 Caricom states agreed to reduce the top level of the common external tariff from the 45 per cent to between 30 per cent and 35 per cent, with all states committed to this reduction between January 1 and June 30 next year. This will be followed by a further reduction of the top rate to between 25 per cent and 30 per cent by 1995, with the rate falling to between 20 per cent and 25 per cent by 1997. The Community, which has a market of 5.5m people, is made up of 13 English-speaking countries of the region, and is trying to create a customs union which the members have agreed is a prerequisite for a planned common market. The Bahamas is not a party to the community's trading arrangements, and Belize has been granted permission to delay the implementation of the new tariff arrangements. The new tariff structure is a compromise aimed at satisfying the deep division among community members. Jamaica, which had called for an immediate reduction of the top rate to 20 per cent, said the region's industry had to be made competitive. But some countries objected, saying their fledgling industries needed protection from cheap imports, while others said their budgets would be harmed by reduced revenues if import duties were cut. Mr Patrick Manning, prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, and chairman of Caricom, said the competing interests of all members had to be taken into account, and this explained the progressive cut in the top rates, spread over five years, rather than a more significant and immediate cut. Having asked for an immediate and steeper reduction of the tariff, Mr P J Patterson, Jamaica's prime minister, said he had accepted the sliding scale, but would move immediately to a top tariff rate of 30 per cent in January. However, regional business leaders who had objected to any reduction in the tariff rates, are angered by the Caricom decision. 'With a eventual tariff level of 20 per cent, very few manufacturers will be able to compete,' complained Mr Neil Poon Tip, president of the Trinidad and Tobago Manufacturers Association. 'We operate very small plants and our inputs also have an additional cost in freight charges.' Mr Bobby Khan, president of the Barbados Manufacturers Association, forecast business closures in the region, saying that the countries which have been pressuring the community for a reduction in the tariff rates would also lose markets in the Caribbean. The Caricom decision is unlikely to satisfy Washington, which had said a more significant reduction in tariffs was needed if the community was to keep in step with changing trends in global trade.</p>

It marks the  beginning of the normalization of the relationship that had been  hampered by their territorial dispute over Sabah, now in fact  one of the federal states of Malaysia.    The visit is a breakthrough in the sense that the dropping  of  the Philippine claim to Sabah was not a precondition to Doctor  Mahathir's visit. High on the agenda are issues associated with  the expansion of bilateral economic relationship within the  context of transforming Asean into an economic bloc that can  counter the protectionist tendencies of competing regional  groups such as the North American Free Trade Association and the  European Community.    In shelving the Sabah issue, both the Philippines and  Malaysia recognize that the territorial dispute does not stand  in the way of expanding economic relationship, which is now a  priority over political questions.

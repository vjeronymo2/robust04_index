			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Airbus to rethink test flights after fatal A330 crash The European Airbus consortium is expected to decide in two weeks when to pursue flight tests on the A330 airliner powered with US Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, following Thursday's crash at Toulouse in which seven crew died. The new compulsory tests for the aircraft's all-weather landing capability will be conducted at less extreme conditions to see if the consortium needs to modify the aircraft's autopilot system, being tested at the time of the accident. Airbus said yesterday there appeared to be no need to modify the system at this stage. The accident occurred under conditions not normally experienced during routine commercial airline service. The flight was part of the certification requirements for all-weather landings of the A330 powered with US Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4168 engines. The same tests had been successfully carried out with the US General Electric CF6-80E-powered A330, which is already in service with Air Inter, the French carrier, and Aer Lingus of the Irish republic. Airbus said the crew performed planned manoeuvres immediately after take-off on Thursday: capture of an exceptionally high angle of climb of 28 degrees to fly at a deliberately low speed (by comparison a commercial airliner is normally limited to an angle of 18 degrees); engagement of the autopilot; simulation of an engine failure (in this case the left engine) by bringing it to idle, and cutting off the related hydraulic circuit. The combination of the simulated engine failure and the high angle of climb induced a loss of lateral control at 400 metres. 'This altitude did not allow the crew, which regained control of the plane, to avoid impact with the ground,' said Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chief executive. The commercial implications of the crash are difficult to evaluate. It was the first time an Airbus has crashed during tests. Mr Pierson yesterday noted that sales of the narrow-body, twin-engine A320 airliners had doubled since an A320 crash in 1988. In the last 20 years, 10 Airbus airliners have crashed, but Airbus's safety record is better than the industry average, which since 1979 has been one passenger death for every million take-offs. In Airbus' case, the average has been 0.73 deaths. However, Airbus has had a particularly bad run of accidents this year, including the crash of a China Airlines A300-600 at Nagoya airport in Japan and of an Aeroflot A310 in Siberia.</p>

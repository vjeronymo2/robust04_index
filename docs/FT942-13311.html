			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / London Conservatives shun national agenda: Some council chiefs would not even welcome ministerial visits In the non-descript suburbs of London, there is little doubt that the Tories can expect a poor result in next week's council elections - but it is far from clear that Labour and the Liberal Democrats will secure an overwhelming victory. Mr Ronnie Barden, leader of Tory-controlled Redbridge in north-east London, admitted the party was under pressure but said: 'People will get quite a shock when they see how resilient the Conservative vote in London still is.' The London poll will be at the centre of attention on election night. After the last council elections in the capital four years ago, outer London remained the only big blotch of blue on the electoral map. But high unemployment in some suburbs, overcrowded classrooms and cuts in services have put this fortress of Conservative local government under threat. Small swings against them would see the Tories lose control of Ealing, Brent and Enfield. The Liberal Democrats are fighting ferociously to win control of Kingston-upon-Thames from the Tories. In Croydon, with its distinctive skyscrapers, the Conservative leader admitted that his party would lose control of the council for the first time if 500 traditional Tory voters vote Labour. Mr Barden, like other Tory council leaders, confessed that he had a few concerns. In London, as everywhere else, the unpopularity of Mr John Major's government is at the heart of both the Labour and Liberal Democrat campaigns. Tory councillors are therefore emphasising that this is not a referendum on national issues, with some underlining the point by quietly sniping at the government. Mr Donald Abbott, Tory leader of Harrow, speaks openly about 'distancing himself from national policies'. Another council leader privately expresses relief that Mr Michael Portillo, the leader of the Tories' London campaign, is not visiting the borough. Others complain that lower levels of government grant to London boroughs this year - due to demographic changes - have made it hard to avoid unpopular cuts in services. Yet London's Tories betray no signs of panic. They know that the other parties must win over those who were prepared to vote Conservative in 1990, at the height of the poll tax debacle, when tens of thousands deserted the party in the rest of the country. Mr Leslie Winters, a Tory councillor in Brent, said: 'These people look most likely to abstain on the day - and that is not good enough for Labour.' Labour must also counter the 'London effect' - the widespread perception of Labour councils in the capital as 'loony left'. In Croydon, Labour's canvassing shows they are picking up 35 per cent of the total vote, with the Tories a little way behind - helped by the 'moderate' image of local Labour councillors and by the difficulty the Tories have in blaming an opposition which has never been in power. Even in Redbridge, Ms Liz Pearce, the Labour group leader, believes her party might win the 12 seats needed to take overall control. But in Brent, where the Tory majority is just six, Labour faces a tough fight to erase memories of its administration of the late 1980s - industrial action which left streets unclean and rubbish uncollected has not been forgotten. A MORI poll for the council has shown a 60 per cent increase in satisfaction with services since the Tories came to power. There has also been a cut of Pounds 112 in this year's Band D level of council tax. In at least two Tory-held boroughs Labour's challenge is overshadowed by the Liberal Democrats. This is partly because education - a strong issue for the third party - is of particular local interest. In Tory-controlled Harrow, Mr Ralph Bancroft, a Liberal Democrat campaigner, says canvas returns show his party gaining about half of the votes cast with the Tories and Labour splitting the rest. Tory-controlled Kingston-upon-Thames, with one of the best school-performance records in the country, is also one of the party's top targets. The borough is surrounded by Liberal Democrat-controlled Richmond, Sutton and Surrey. The Liberal Democrat campaign is being fought with all the trade marks of a marginal by-election. Supporters have converted front rooms into computerised campaign centres distributing orange posters. As a Tory campaigner put it: 'You have to wear sunglasses on the Kingston by-pass.' The party needs to win three wards to take control - but two had huge Conservative and Labour majorities in 1990. On the night of May 5, the loss of Kingston would be hard for Tories to stomach. But the party leadership's embarrassment could be mitigated if it retained some boroughs. As a Brent council official put it: 'If I were chairman of the Tory party on election night and had lost quite a few councils, it would still mean a lot to say that we'd held Brent.'</p>

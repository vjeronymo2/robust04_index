			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondent Sergey Karmalito] </F>   [Text] Simferopol, 25 May -- The formation of a Ukrainian  National Guard brigade in the Crimea numbering 2,500 to 3,000  men is continuing. This was stated today in an exclusive  interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent by Major General  Valeriy Kuznetsov, the minister of internal affairs of the  Crimean republic. In his words, claims that the armored  vehicles that had been moved to Simferopol the other day had  been under repair and had now gone to their places of previous  deployment, were at variance with reality. In fact, they have  been handed over to the Ukrainian National Guard brigade which  is being formed in Sevastopol and Simferopol and includes  subunits of the Special Forces.    V.Kuznetsov drew attention to the fact that this kind of  military build-up was "not necessary and not typical" for the  Crimea, which was already "oversaturated with military  formations and combat equipment" as it was. At the same time,  he pointed out that moves are being made on the part of the  Ukraine to win over and test the ground in army units as to the  readiness of the personnel in the event of an emergency being  introduced in the Crimea. It is essentially a question of  possible interference by the army and National Guard if the  situation deteriorates. At the same time, attempts are being  continued to split the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] of the  Crimean Republic by creating a Chief Administration subordinated  to Kiev. So far, V.Kuznetsov said, the unity of the MVD is  being maintained. In our view, he continued, the best thing is  to tackle all the disputed questions at the negotiating table.  Russia's treaty with Tatarstan and current dialogue with  Chechnya could serve as an example, "especially," the Crimean  minister of internal affairs stressed, "as we are not declaring  that we are ceasing to form part of the Ukraine or reviewing the  existing frontiers."</p>

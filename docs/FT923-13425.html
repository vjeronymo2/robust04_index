			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Observer: Eau no It is illegal for South Koreans to buy bottled water. This little infringement on their liberty is creating a ticklish problem. For pollution is increasing in the river Han, the main source of drinking water for the residents of Seoul. The rationale for the 20-year-old law is that bottled water poses a threat to social harmony; those who couldn't afford it would harbour ill-will against those that could. But that was two decades ago and South Korea has become a much more affluent place since then. Are the authorities relenting? It doesn't appear so. Although their product may be sold to foreigners, two executives of a bottled water company have been arrested for illegally peddling the precious liquid to fellow countrymen. The police say they are flushing out other cases.</p>

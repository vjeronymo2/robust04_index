			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 4 May PEVALEHT, p.3; "News Bulletin" No. 85/94] </F>   [Text] An Interior Ministry official denied the reports of  a coup plan prepared by Russian officers, announced by MP Mart  Niklus at a picket at the Russian naval HQ on Monday [2 May].  Niklus had declared that a secret meeting of Russian officers  took place in Tartu on April 23 where an armed coup was  discussed. He further claimed that the conspirators are armed  and have cells in different regions of Estonia.    The PEVALEHT reports that a dismissed Defence League member  had sent a letter recently to President Lennart Meri and  Commander in Chief General Aleksander Einseln, claiming that  retired Russian officers had been preparing a coup at the  aforementioned date. The man had added that some servicemen of  the Estonia Defence Forces have been involved in the preparation.    An unnamed Interior Ministry official dismissed the report,  explaining that April 23 had been the day of the payment of  pensions to the retired Russian military and their possible  expressions of dissatisfaction can hardly be qualified as a  preparation of coup attempt.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV CREW HELPS HOMELESS WOMAN GIVE BIRTH IN MACARTHUR PARK  </P> <P> In a section of MacArthur Park, where lives are often lost to crack cocaine, a  new life began early Thursday when a young, homeless woman gave birth to a baby  girl.  </P> <P> Paramedics, normally summoned to the lakeside park west of downtown to treat  addicts who have overdosed on drugs, were called to the scene about 3:45 a.m.  and "found this young girl on the ground," Los Angeles Fire Department  Inspector Ed Reed said.  </P> <P> "There were homeless people around her and one was holding the child, still  attached by the umbilical cord to the mother."  </P> <P> Eugenia Marin, 21, had apparently delivered the 5-pound, 4 1/2-ounce infant  herself, assisted by the light of a free-lance television news crew that  arrived on the scene.  </P> <P> "They just left the light on," said Gary Arnote, owner of Newsreel Video  Service, whose crew had heard the call to paramedics on a police scanner. "If  we helped, we're glad to have done it."  </P> <P> Fire Department officials said Marin had been living in the park since  September.  </P> <P> "The baby was cold and dirty," Reed said, adding that paramedics clamped the  umbilical cord, cleaned the infant, and wrapped her in a blanket before taking  her and her mother to a hospital.  </P> <P> "It's a horrible way and place to have a baby," said Brad Lenhoff, one of the  paramedics who assisted Marin. "But it looks as though the baby will make it."  </P> <P> Mother and daughter were in good condition at California Medical Center, a  spokeswoman said.  </P></p>

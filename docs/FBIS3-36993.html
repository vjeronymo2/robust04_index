Yeltsin If He Had Wanted To"]    [Text] On 11 February world agencies reported on a  briefing at the White House on the adoption by the NATO Council,  at the level of representatives of the member countries, of a  decision which, as is known, presupposes the possibility of  bombing raids on Serbian positions in Bosnia.    During the briefing, White House press secretary Dee Dee  Myers said, in particular, that President Clinton had "tried to  get through to Yeltsin before the announcement of NATO's  decision. Unfortunately, their conversation did not take place."    This statement clearly qualifies as sensational on two  counts. Even in the cold war years there was no occasion when  the leaders of the two great powers were unable to hear one  another in an emergency. Second, your IZVESTIYA correspondent  has seen the mobile presidential communications switchboards  which are set up wherever he might be at any time of the day or  night: in a car, in an aircraft (from the big presidential  TU-154 M to the small Yak-40, on which he occasionally makes  short flights, and the helicopter, which is used for trips to  his out-of-town residence, and so on).    V. Ilyushin, the president's principal assistant [pervyy  pomoshchnik], told INTERFAX that B. Yeltsin had been ready to  talk for 90 minutes and had waited for the call "for as long as  he decently could."    Your IZVESTIYA correspondent also managed to establish that  "non-hotline" communications between the two presidents are  conducted via a switchboard at the Foreign Ministry. A. Lake,  the U.S. president's national security assistant, got through to  Moscow via this switchboard, and this fact might refute Mrs.  Myers' words about technical difficulties.    So what we are talking about probably is political  "difficulties." Washington wanted to wait for the NATO Council  decision on the Serbian question, and only then perhaps inform  the Russian president.</p>

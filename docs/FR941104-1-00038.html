Amended rules are necessary to relieve certain vessels of an unforeseen regulatory burden. The proposed rules would relieve those vessels of that burden and yet minimize the potential for capsizing and other casualties caused by inadequate damage stability. To obtain further information from members of the regulated community and the general public, the Coast Guard will conduct a second public meeting and re-open the comment period on the amended rules. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The meeting will be held December 1, 1994, from 1:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Written material must be received not later than December 16, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The meeting will be held in room 2415, Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street S.W., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001.

This detailed analysis of twenty-one domestic vessel designs was released in late September 1994, and a copy has been placed in this docket. Information on obtaining a copy of this report may be obtained by contacting the person listed above under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice extends the period for submission of comments on the proposed changes to 46 CFR 171.080(e) described in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published on August 10, 1994 (59 FR 40855). It is the Coast Guard's goal to implement regulations that will best address both the safety and the operational needs of all vessels. These standards were based on one developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for any passenger vessel allowed to carry 12 or more passengers on an international voyage (under a ``SOLAS Passenger Ship Certificate''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard again seeks advice from owners and operators of vessels and shipyards, and from naval architects, its own inspectors, classification societies' inspectors, consumers, crews of vessels, and others involved in the affected vessels' compliance with &sect;171.080(e) as this proposed rule would amend it. Interested persons are invited and encouraged to participate by submitting written data views and arguments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this notice [CGD 94&hyph;010], identify the specific paragraph of the section to which each comment applies, and include supporting documents or sufficient detail to indicate the reason for each comment. The Coast Guard will acknowledge receipt of comments if a stamped, self-addressed post card or envelope is enclosed with the comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Meeting Date <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard has determined that the opportunity to make further oral presentations will aid the rulemaking process and will hold a second public meeting from 1:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. on December 1, 1994, in room 2415 of Coast Guard Headquarters, Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001.

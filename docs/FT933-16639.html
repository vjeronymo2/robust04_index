			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Securities settlement The report by the Bank of England's task force on securities settlement comes as a welcome relief after the Taurus fiasco. The collapse of Taurus after more than a decade of work left London in urgent need of a reliable, inexpensive and quick settlement system that would narrow its embarrassing gap with other centres. The task force does not aim to please everybody, but it does hold out the prospect of a reasonably timely move to five-day rolling settlement. Its decision to drop the idea of a central register may help to keep the banks on side. Their role will be crucial to accompanying payments arrangements. Yet moving from theory to practice remains a daunting task. On the one hand are practical problems over and above the need to develop reliable technology: the initial move to a shorter settlement period while still using a paper-based system may make life harder for private client brokers. On the other, are more political questions - notably the ultimate ownership of Crest, the settlement service which the report envisages. Since it will effectively have a monopoly position, it would be undesirable for Crest to be in the hands of a single commercial owner. A consortium approach will be more desirable but one which also requires strong leadership. After Taurus, the Stock Exchange lacks any credibility. That leaves the Bank, which may yet have to bang heads together at the development stage. It may need to remain actively involved once Crest is up and running as well.</p>

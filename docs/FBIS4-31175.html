			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Geneva, June 7 (AFP) -- UN special envoy  Yasushi Akashi said Tuesday that he would insist that Bosnia's  warring parties accept a four-month countrywide ceasefire at  peace talks that entered their second day here. Akashi, asked  if he would be prepared to reduce the duration of the ceasefire  as demanded by the Moslem-led Bosnian government and their Croat  allies, answered firmly: "No, I am not." But, he added "our  negotiation with both parties separately is proceeding  exceedingly well. The atmosphere is businesslike, frank and  friendly."    The duration of the ceasefire is one of the principle  sticking-points in the ceasefire talks which began here Monday  between Bosnia's Croats, Moslems and Serbs, UN diplomats said.  [passage omitted]    Akashi said that although the ceasefire talks were "separate  from a political settlement ... of course the two agreements  have to be closely linked." Akashi said there were still "a few  difficult questions which have to be resolved." But, he added  "we will make every effort possible to anchor the agreement by  tonight." [passage omitted]    Akashi was due to meet the Serb delegation led by Radovan  Karadzic Tuesday morning for an hour before joining a meeting  between UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and the joint  heads of the Bosnian delegation, Kresimir Zubak and Ejup Ganic,  around 11:30 a.m. (0930 GMT). "Then we will see the Bosnian  side and the Serb side and we will repeat this throughout the  day," Akashi said.    The UN envoy said he did not envisage the Bosnian and  Bosnian  Serb delegations would sit at the same negotiating table except  "for the signature" of an agreement.</p>

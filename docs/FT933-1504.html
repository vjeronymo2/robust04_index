			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz pierces accounting mystique - David Waller on the release of German and US figures before a New York listing IF ACCOUNTING is the language of business, the American and the German versions of accounting are as different as mandarin Chinese and Flemish. Looking at the figures which Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company, published in both German and US accounting language last week, it is difficult to imagine how the two versions refer to the same company. Under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Daimler made a loss of DM949m (Dollars 586m). Under German rules, the automobiles-to-aircraft group made a profit of DM168m. The gap is likely to widen in the second half, and for the year as a whole the group is likely to report a German profit of DM1bn and a US loss of DM2bn. Explaining the two versions of the figures goes beyond consideration of abstruse accounting rules. It raises questions about Daimler's underlying financial performance and calls into question the assumptions which have driven the strong rise in the German stock market this year. Daimler released German and US figures in tandem last Friday is order to comply with New York Stock Exchange regulations before the company's listing on the world's largest capital market on October 5. It will be the first German company to be listed there. For decades German companies have refused to come to the US market for the very reason that they did not want to make the financial disclosures required under GAAP. Scrutinising the Daimler figures, it is not difficult to see why, as they serve to puncture the mystique which has long surrounded German accounting. As Mr Gerhard Liener, Daimler's finance director, said last week, the US figures provide a more accurate reflection of Daimler's underlying trading performance than the German version. And that trading performance is far worse than anyone had dared to predict - especially when Daimler's management raised hopes by predicting a DM1bn (German) profit for 1992 and twice as much for next year. Until last Friday, Anglo-American analysts assumed that German accounts underestimated a company's profitability. The rules which govern German accounts put the interests of the tax authorities and creditors higher than those of shareholders. It was thought that this conservatism served to deflate profits and balance sheet assets. By contrast, US and UK rules give companies the freedom to present a 'true and fair' view of business performance. This is designed to ensure that shareholders are kept in the picture (not a priority in Germany), but the flexibility of UK accounting has often been exploited by management to present an exaggeratedly favourable picture of underlying business performance. Thus, if valuations of German shares were a little higher than of US or UK companies in the same sector, the investment risk was offset by the conservatism of the numbers on which the valuations were based. In theory. Daimler's latest disclosures do indeed show that the group's balance sheet has consistently been understated under German rules. Show the hidden reserves, and shareholders' equity in Daimler's balance sheet grows from DM18.9bn at the end of June under German rules, to DM26.2bn under US rules. However, the detailed figures also reveal that Daimler only made a profit under German rules because of release of provisions from hitherto hidden reserves. In the first half some DM1.62bn of 'changes in appropriated retained earnings', as this is euphemistically called, flowed from the balance sheet to the benefit of the German profit and loss account. In other words, it was nonsense to think that US GAAP would expose the hidden profitability of the big German company: quite the opposite. These revelations make Daimler's shares look more, rather than less, expensive before the listing on the NYSE. This is especially the case when the shares are compared with those of big US automobile manufacturers - now possible because Daimler and General Motors are speaking the same accounting language. While the shares of the US 'big three' - GM, Chrysler and Ford - are on a multiple of seven times 1995 prospective earnings, Daimler's shares trade on 15 times US GAAP earnings of DM48 a share (the forecast comes from a 285-page buy note put out by Goldman Sachs this week. The US investment bank is advising Daimler on its NYSE listing). The argument that Daimler's structure as 'diversified technology concern' justifies a higher rating than the German company's US peers is difficult to defend: the Mercedes-Benz luxury car subsidiary accounted for 67 per cent of last year's sales and 112 per cent of profits. In other words, the spate of acquisitions in recent years has reduced the group's profitability and, if anything, should justify a lower rating than for a pure cars and trucks group. If the accounting revelations make Daimler's shares look expensive, the same is true for the German stock market as a whole. The DAX index of 30 leading shares has risen by 23 per cent this year to 1,893, much of the increase in the last three months. Valuations are already giddily high - German industrial companies are trading at 28 times 1993 and 19 times 1994 earnings. Factor in a discount for the true earnings position as would be revealed if every component of the DAX 30 sought a US listing, and the valuations are even ambitious. Of course, investors have not bought German shares because of this year's earnings outlook. They are buying on the assumption that there will be a massive recovery in profits next year and in 1995. That assumption is not completely undermined by the Daimler disclosures. It is just that the turnround next year and the year after has to be that much more convincing to justify today's prices.</p>

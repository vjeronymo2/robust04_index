			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> FREEZE-OUT ATTEMPTS TO THAW CLIMATE;  </P> <P> COLLEGE HOCKEY: FORUM TOURNAMENT SHOWCASES TOP TEAMS IN HOPE OF NURTURING  DIVISION I PROGRAMS IN SOUTHLAND.  </P> <P> Until recently, many Southland residents thought icing went on top of a cake,  and Zamboni was probably a magician.  </P> <P> But all this has changed since Wayne Gretzky joined the Kings in August of  1988. Los Angeles has become a hockey town. Amateur leagues have doubled and  tripled in size.  </P> <P> And that is why the Forum is playing host to the Great Western Freeze-Out, a  college hockey tournament matching some of the best college hockey teams from  Canada and the United States.  </P> <P> Jeannie Buss, the Forum's special events director, is hoping that the  tournament will help intercollegiate hockey gain more recognition in the city.  </P> <P> "I'd like to see (NCAA) Division I hockey here," Buss said. "I think that it's  important to have hockey here at that level. Since Wayne arrived, the Kings  have generated so much interest, I can't imagine it not growing."  </P> <P> But better facilities are needed. It is so difficult to reserve ice time that  some local college teams must practice at midnight.  </P> <P> Fortunately for the University of Alberta, Denver University, the University of  British Columbia and Michigan State, the Forum was able to arrange practice  sessions at either Culver City Ice Arena or the Olympic Ice Arena -- the latter  called "a converted barn" by one UBC player.  </P> <P> "It was pretty brutal," UBC forward Kalle Furer said. "It was all hacked up,  and the boards only came up to my hip. I wouldn't want to play a game in  there."  </P> <P> Players who skated at the Culver City Ice Arena said it was adequate. They were  not surprised by the popularity of local college hockey.  </P> <P> "Just because the climate is warm doesn't mean that you can't have hockey  teams," UBC left wing Dan Baker said.  </P> <P> "It's not that hard to make good ice. It's just a matter of keeping it at the  proper temperature."  </P> <P> About 8,000 tickets have been sold for tonight's 7:30 championship match  between top-ranked Michigan State and the University of Alberta. On Monday  night, the Spartans (17-3-1) defeated Denver, 2-1, and the Golden Bears  (18-7-2) beat British Columbia, 5-4, in triple overtime.  </P> <P> "We're very excited about having been given the opportunity to prove ourselves  against Michigan State," Baker said. "'People really think that the American  universities are superior, but the Canadian schools are good, too. We just  don't get a chance to play against them during the regular season."  </P> <P> Luring the teams to Los Angeles, away from sub-zero temperatures, was easy.  </P> <P> "It's just like you see in the movies and television," Michigan State forward  Leif Gustafson said. "I'm happy to be playing here."  </P> <P> A television contract for the tournament fell through. "We just want to make  this tournament first-rate this year so that the television people will pick it  up next year," Buss said.  </P> <P> Buss hopes the tournament will become as popular as those played in Canada and  the East.  </P> <P> Jeffrey Martinson, a hockey fan from Van Nuys, praised the tournament, saying:  "I started coming to the (Kings') games last year, and now I have season  tickets. I'll see any hockey game played in L.A. I'd like to see UCLA and USC  play at the same level that these kids do. This is really great."  </P> <P> Eric Simpson of Beverly Hills said: "The people who know hockey out here were  never really involved because it was never taken seriously. Even the NHL  players used to think that they were coming here for an easy two points and a  day at the beach, but not anymore."  </P></p>

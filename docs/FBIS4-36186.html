			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio discussion by political correspondent Gadi Sukenik </F> and announcer Ya'aqov Ahime'ir on the "Popolitika" program;  monitored in progress -- live]    [Text] [Sukenik]...I have  the letter Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres wrote to the late  Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst. Permission to  make the letter public was given by his successor. The Foreign  Ministry said Israel firmly insisted that the Palestinian  autonomy institutions be situated in Jericho and not in  Jerusalem, but made it clear that there would not be any change  in the status of the Palestinian inhabitants. Foreign Minister  Peres acted with the knowledge of the prime minister, and that  is very important for relations between the two and for  responsibility, for at least the information fiasco. The letter  says: I wish to confirm that the Palestinian institutions in  East Jerusalem and the affairs and welfare of the Palestinians  in East Jerusalem are very important, and will be upheld.  Therefore, all the Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem  -- economic, social, educational, and cultural -- and the  Christian and Muslim holy places fulfill a vital function for  the Palestinian population. There is no need to say we will not  intervene with their activities. Yours sincerely, Shim'on Peres.    That is the letter. It is still not clear whether that is  all there is. I must say that several days ago....    [Ahime'ir, interrupting] But we just saw the letter, and you  read out the translation. What do you mean when you say it is  not clear if that is all there is? Is that the letter or not?    [Sukenik] That is the letter. The question is whether there  is more, why Israel admitted to a letter only three weeks after  'Arafat divulged the fact that he has a letter on Jerusalem, no  matter how innocent it is. Shim'on Peres and others --  including Rabin in the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense  Committee several days after the letter's existence became known  -- said that there are no secret annexes to the accord with the  Palestinians. In other words, they say this is not an annex to  the accord, but a knowledgeable Foreign Ministry source told me  that it is an accompanying letter -- to what? Not to my  mortgage--apparently to the agreements with the Palestinians.    [Ahime'ir] Gadi, do you suspect there might be other  documents?    [Sukenik] I do fear that because of the fact that it was  held up for weeks and the fact that we were told it contains  only a quote from Peres' Knesset speech. By the way, there is  another letter translated into Hebrew -- I will not show it to  the camera now -- which contains quotes from Peres' speech to  the Knesset, but Faysal al-Husayni spoke about other  understandings on Jerusalem made in February, and in the wake of  this whole circus, it is not clear if that is all there is.  There is no doubt that in the best circumstances, Rabin and  Peres have lost a lot of points in their battle for credibility.  We are going to have a national referendum, at least on the  Golan Heights, and this creates a big problem.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLERGAN ANNOUNCES LOSS, LAYOFFS  </P> <P> Allergan reported Wednesday a $10.2-million loss for the fourth quarter and  said it would shut down a manufacturing plant in Irvine and eliminate 210  positions there over the next year.  </P> <P> The company, which makes eye-care and skin-care products, said it would also  reduce 300 jobs worldwide as part of an effort to reduce expenses.  </P> <P> To cover the costs of layoffs and the discontinuation of several products,  Allergan took a one-time charge of $22.8 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31.  The charge contributed to the quarterly loss, which contrasted with a  $32.8-million profit in the same quarter a year earlier.  </P> <P> For all of 1989, Allergan made $57 million on revenue of $807 million, compared  to a profit of $72 million on sales of $756 million a year earlier. Allergan --  formerly a division of SmithKline Beckman -- has been an independent company  only since July of last year.  </P> <P> Earnings and sales figures for 1988 are estimates of how Allergan would have  done if it been a publicly traded company then.  </P></p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Observer: Repeat after me Thank goodness for that. Someone has owned up at last for misspelling the name on Dulwich College's new minibus, referred to in Wednesday's column - and it was not a pupil. Parents, who have to pay up to Pounds 11,670 a year for the privilege of sending their kids to the exclusive London school, will be relieved to learn that the culprit did not have the benefit of a Dulwich education. It was the fault of Kirkham Minibuses, which supplied the vehicle, and the bursar stresses that he had already spotted the mistake. The Lancashire firm, better known for its craftsmanship than its spelling, is correcting the error and writes to say that it has apologised to the headmaster for 'any embarrasment'. Oh dear, Kirkham. Surely you know that there are two s's in . . .</p>

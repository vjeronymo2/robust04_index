			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Food &amp; Drink: Their world is an oyster - The French brotherhoods devoted to eating THOSE who missed a trip to France this summer, panicked perhaps by blocked autoroutes or drained finances, could experience much of the essential Frenchness of France for Pounds 35. This is the price of Les Grandes Confreries de France,* a new, privately-published guide to one of the country's identifying institutions. These confreries are true brotherhoods, built not on personal commercial advancement but on greed of a purer sort. Although ritual is crucial to the 150-odd brotherhoods detailed in the book, their unifying theme is not masonic but, perhaps not surprisingly, gastronomic. No wine is too obscure, no victual too mundane, no sweetmeat too slight to have an entire constitution, chapter of officers and roster of ceremonies centred on it. Here are confreries dedicated to a particular sort of macaroon, quince jam, choucroute, Cavaillon melon, pheasant terrine and tripes a la mode fertoise. The confrerie exists to promulgate by gathering, and the typical gathering is a long ceremony during which new members are given an honorary rank and required formally to eat, drink, identify, or swear eternal allegiance to the comestible in question - followed by an even longer, and much more convivial, feast. In a small village outside Albi, for instance, is the Order of the Stuffed Chicken, male members of which attain the rank of Coq et Chevalier and females that of Coquette Dame. The mirabelle plum of Lorraine has been defended by its own 'consultat' since 1974 but the pumpkin pate of Millancay only since 1980, while the sausage of Muscadet was left to fend for itself until May 1990. Most seafoods seem to have inspired their own brotherhood of enthusiasts, a high proportion of the confreries being centred on a particular oyster or scallop and one on the squid of tiny Bidart near Biarritz (ranks: Chevalier and Grand Pecheur) Even the art of slashing the top off a champagne bottle with a sabre has its very own Confrerie du Sabre d'Or. The author and publisher of this heroic and revealing work is Bernard Tardif, president and grandmaster of the Confrerie Gastronomique de la Marmite d'Or (golden stewpot), a sort of National Trust of the French table which resurrected an ancient royal company of provisioners nearly two centuries after Robespierre sentenced it to an extended siesta. His book is not cheap and one ponders at first the luxury of printing at least one full-colour photograph on most of its 250 pages. But this is to overlook another vital aspect of life as a confrere: the clothes. The French, more than anyone, believe the maxim that you haven't done it if you haven't dressed for it and this book provides glorious, nay sumptuous, proof of the French robe-maker's ingenuity. Each order has not only its own ranks, certificates and traditions but its own uniform, designed to add pomp to what might otherwise, just possibly, look a little silly. Ideally, the robe should be floor-length, generous in cut (especially round the girth), vaguely evoke medieval heraldry (and, if possible, the product in question), incorporate a sash and/or clanking insignia and, of course, a hat. Typical, and very smart, is the uniform of the Chevaliers de l'Olivier, based at Nyons in the southern Rhone. Their velvet cloaks with matching olive-sprigged trilbys are, of course, in olive green (the regulation red bow tie surely not representing a pimento stuffing?), but the rig-out must be jolly hot at their regular meeting on the first Sunday of July. One of the most fetching costumes is the emerald and shocking-pink satin smock and baker's bonnet worn by the Confrerie of the Saulxures Raspberry, founded in 1972. On the other hand, the brilliant orange robes and green striped headgear designed to celebrate the Cormery macaroon look as though they had just been unpacked for the photographer - but then, this confrerie was founded only in 1990. It is not at all like the seriously charitable, and seminal, Jurade de St-Emilion to which I have the honour of belonging (as Dame) along with the claret Commanderie du Bontemps du Medoc et Graves, and the grand order of the burgundian snail (which, worryingly, does not feature in this book; but then, I was told when I joined back in 1977 that France already imported most of its snails from Taiwan) and the noble order of the trou normand (or mid-meal shot of calvados). The oldest of France's confreries, the Jurade, can trace its roots back to 1199 and is based, like all of confreriedom, on a charter governing the administration of a part of France then under the English crown. So, it is possible that, without Albion, French life (and presumably Monsieur Tardif) would be considerably the poorer. Les Grandes Confreries de France is available only by mail from Bernard Tardif, 5 Allee de Ia Chevaleries, 37170 Chambray-les-Tours, France. FFr315 inc. postage.</p>

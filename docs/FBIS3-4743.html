The delegate of the Third World Movement Against the  Exploitation of Women said Japan had failed to take effective  measures to compensate the "comfort women for the army" and the  United Nations must take steps for the punishment of the  criminals and an adequate compensation to the victims.    The delegate said that to this end, a step should be taken  immediately to set up an international court and establish an  international arbitration tribunal so that the Japanese  government may deal with suits brought by victims.    The delagate of the World Council of Churches said Japan had  not admitted that it was its legal obligation to make an  adequate compensation to the "comfort women for the army" but  merely repeated that it felt responsible for its crimes.    He said the World Council of Churches demanded that the  United Nations Commission on Human Rights put pressure on Japan  to punish the criminals and compensate the victims.    The delegate of the International Fellowship of  Reconciliation said that if the Japanese law was not enough to  punish the criminals involved in the issue of the "comfort women  for the army," Japan must enact another law to discharge its  obligation according to the international law and that the  organization had presented recommendations to the Japanese prime  minister to enact a "law for punishing the war crimes and crimes  against humanity and other crimes in view of the international  law."    Noting that Japan, however, punished none of those  responsible for the criminal acts against more than 200,000  "comfort women for the army," he stressed that though the  Japanese government was trying to hush up the crime, it could by  no means evade its responsibility.</p>

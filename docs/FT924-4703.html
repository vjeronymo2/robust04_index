			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Ashman buys into Harland Simon arm MR ROY ASHMAN, former chairman of the collapsed control systems company Harland Simon, has bought back into one of the company's main subsidiaries through a management buy-out. Mr Ashman provided financial backing for the buy-out of Harland Simon Control Systems, maker of process control equipment for the newspaper industry. The company was bought from receivers Touche Ross. No price was released. Mr Tony White, a Harland manager who co-lead the buy-out, confirmed Mr Ashman's role. 'He is giving us financial backing to a certain extent,' Mr White said. He refused to comment on the level of Mr Ashman's backing, although he said Mr Ashman was not the only investor. Mr Ashman's involvement in the buyout has angered some of Harland Simon's institutional shareholders. They believe he is at least partly to blame for the company's collapse. Harland went into receivership in October and shareholders are unlikely to recover much of their investment. Mr Ashman resigned from Harland in February after the company released a profits warning. Before the warning, analysts expected Harland to make profits of about Pounds 12.5m for last year. Instead, Harland announced losses of Pounds 6.3m. Harland had enjoyed rapid profits growth but this was fuelled in part by highly questionable financial procedures, according to documents in the possession of the Financial Times. Mr Ashman received a Pounds 365,000 pay-off when he resigned and later received his full pension entitlement of Pounds 960,000 from the company's pension fund. Control Systems, which was the original core to the Harland Simon group, is to be renamed Harland Simon Limited - its original name. Mr Ashman is a non-executive director of the acquiring vehicle. Mr White said Mr Ashman 'could well' be a non-executive director of the renamed company. Mr White said he and another manager, Mr Jim Reynolds, would run Control Systems. But former Harland managers doubted Mr Ashman would remain a passive investor. 'He's a very hands-on person,' one said. Background, Page 21</p>

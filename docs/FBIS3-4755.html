A congratulatory message from the minister of state for  external affairs of India to the seminar was conveyed, and a  congratulatory speech made by ex-Indian President Giani Zail  Singh.    In his speech, he said the chuche idea founded by the great  leader his excellency President Kim Il-song is an idea brightly  illumining the road ahead of the progressive people in the era  of independence.    Korea is advancing triumphantly without any vacillation even  when some socialist countries have collapsed and the imperialist  pressure and blockade are intensifying, he said, adding: this  is entirely because it is advancing under the banner of the  chuche idea, the banner of self-reliance.    A reporter and speakers at the seminar said it is thanks to  the sagacious guidance of the dear leader his excellency Kim  Chong-il that the programme of modelling the whole society on  the chuche idea is being carried out with success and the  anthropocentric Korean- style socialism firmly defended in Korea.    Noting that the chuche idea is the basic idea of mass media  in the era of independence, they evinced their resolve to more  briskly conduct media activities to establish a new  international information and communication order.    A letter to Comrade Kim Chong-il was adopted at the seminar.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A STAUNCH ENEMY OF DRUG TRAFFICKING IS FAVORED TO BE COLOMBIA'S NEXT PRESIDENT;  </P> <P> ELECTION: VIOLENCE IS THE MAIN ISSUE FOR VOTERS. FRONT-RUNNER CESAR GAVIRIA  VOWS 'NO CONCESSIONS' TO COCAINE BARONS.  </P> <P> In presidential elections scheduled for Sunday, the terrifying violence that  plagues Colombia overrides all other issues, and the candidate who has taken  the toughest position against killer drug lords is favored to win the vote.  </P> <P> Cesar Gaviria of the governing Liberal Party may not win as strong a mandate as  he would like to back his policy of fighting narcoterroristas "without  concessions." According to recent surveys, Gaviria was preferred by as little  as 40% of those polled.  </P> <P> But the surveys have shown that none of the 11 other candidates was preferred  by more than 20%.  </P> <P> The winner will take office in August, succeeding Virgilio Barco Vargas as  president of South America's second most populous country, with 32 million  people.  </P> <P> Gaviria, 43, served as minister of finance and minister of government in  Barco's Cabinet. He quit last year to head the presidential campaign of Luis  Carlos Galan, a charismatic Liberal who was assassinated at a campaign rally  last August.  </P> <P> Since then, terrorists suspected of working for cocaine traffickers have killed  two more presidential candidates and hundreds of other Colombians in a shocking  siege of shootings and bombings.  </P> <P> One of Gaviria's main campaign positions has been a stern stand against the  terrorist campaign, which is aimed at forcing government concessions to  traffickers.  </P> <P> "He is the only one of the four main candidates who is not preaching some form  of accommodation," observed a European diplomat. Gaviria summarized his  hard-line stance in a meeting this week with foreign correspondents.  </P> <P> "No society can lose the fight against terrorism without risk of dissolving,"  he said. "I am in favor of facing up to terrorism without making concessions to  it."  </P> <P> Gaviria's position coincides with U.S. policy, and American officials credit  him with bravery under threats to his own life.  </P> <P> "He's probably the most threatened person right now, under a tremendous amount  of pressure," said one U.S. official. "And every time I have seen that he has  spoken to the press, he has not wavered. He's extremely tough on the narcotics  issue."  </P> <P> Gaviria said the immediate goal of the violence by traffickers is to disrupt  the electoral process.  </P> <P> "They want to destabilize the democracy," he said. He added that right-wing  death squads and leftist guerrillas have the same goal.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, the Colombian press has reported almost daily clashes between  guerrillas and the army. On Friday, radio stations said seven policemen and  five guerrillas died in a rebel ambush near the town of Jamundi, about 200  miles southwest of Bogota.  </P> <P> But the terrorist campaign of the drug lords has overshadowed other kinds of  violence. Radio RCN said bombings and shootings killed 35 people Thursday in  the city Medellin, home of the notorious Medellin cartel.  </P> <P> Six of the dead were police. The cartel has offered a bounty of $4,300 for  every police officer killed in Medellin, and more than 30 have died this month.  </P> <P> The three candidates closest in pre-election opinion polls to Gaviria have all  taken more conciliatory positions than he.  </P> <P> Rodrigo Lloreda, candidate of the opposition Social Conservative Party, has  said he opposes the extradition of Colombians to the United States for trial on  drug trafficking charges. An end to extradition has been one of the  traffickers' main goals.  </P> <P> Alvaro Gomez, candidate of a Conservative splinter group, has proposed the  legalization of cocaine in the United States. He has said the government should  consider granting unspecified conditions in return for the surrender of  traffickers.  </P> <P> Antonio Navarro, candidate of the M-19, a former guerrilla movement, has also  advocated a conditional surrender and rejected extradition.  </P> <P> "The extraditions have done nothing for Colombia," Navarro told foreign  reporters this week. Fifteen accused traffickers have been extradited to the  United States since late August.  </P> <P> Navarro became the M-19 candidate after the April killing of candidate Carlos  Pizarro, who had led the former rebel movement into the political arena earlier  this year. The M-19's switch from rebellion to legal politics was the result of  peace negotiations with the Barco administration.  </P> <P> This week, the government began negotiations with another guerrilla movement,  the Popular Liberation Army. Two other major rebel groups continue to fight,  although both have announced cease-fires for election day.  </P> <P> Both officials and rebel leaders say the process of pacifying guerrillas  depends on reforms in Colombia's democratic system, long dominated by Liberals  and Conservatives to the exclusion of other parties and interests.  </P> <P> When Colombians vote Sunday for a president, they will mark a second ballot on  the question of whether to convene a constituent assembly that could write  political reforms into the constitution. The national Congress previously has  blocked the creation of a constituent assembly.  </P> <P> All leading presidential candidates support the idea. Some, including Gaviria,  have said that constitutional changes also are needed to strengthen the  country's judicial system, which has been almost totally ineffective against  powerful drug traffickers.  </P> <P> Because of the threat of assassination, all major candidates except Lloreda  have avoided outdoor campaign rallies this month.  </P></p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / International Company News: FOX property futures scandal costs almost Pounds 1m LAST October's property futures scandal at the London Futures and Options exchange (FOX) cost the exchange almost Pounds 1m in irregular expenditure, Reuter reports from London. According to the chairman's report - to be circulated to the FOX annual meeting on July 9 - expenditure attributable to the irregularities in the property futures market has generated exceptional costs of close to Pounds 4m. The report was written by Mr Andrew Large, who has since taken over as chairman of the Securities and Investments Board (SIB). The new chairman of FOX is Mr Michael Jenkins. The scandal involved the discovery in October last year that trading incentives had been granted by the exchange to traders dealing in FOX's screen-traded property, rice and metal index futures (MGMI) contracts.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Inward investors give qualified approval INWARD INVESTORS in the north gave the statement a cautious welcome but stressed that, while its main points were helpful, they alone could not transform confidence. The cut in interest rates, improvements in capital allowances and the decision not to increase national insurance contributions were all applauded. But investors emphasised that economic stability and clarity of policy remained vital. There was some disappointment that the chancellor had not been more bold. Mr David D'Arcy, financial director of Norwegian-owned Grorud, which relies heavily on local authorities to buy the stair lifts and door and window fittings it produces at Consett, County Durham, said that the permission given to councils to spend future capital receipts would have limited impact. Mr John Dolan, managing director of Compaq, the US-owned computer manufacturer based at Erskine, near Glasgow, welcomed capital allowances improvements, although he had hoped for more relief on research and development. Mr David Smith, human-resources manager at NSK, the bearings and automotive products manufacturer at Peterlee, County Durham, said: 'In general all the measures are gratefully received.' But he said they were 'insufficent to transform our future'. Nissan Motor Manufacturing, which employs 4,600 people at its Sunderland car plant, welcomed the abolition of car sales tax but said confidence had to return before sales could rise significantly. Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Northern Development Company, responsible for attracting inward investment to north-east England and Cumbria, said the boost to export cover would help. Professor Neil Hood, director of Strathclyde University's International Business Unit, said improved capital allowances might influence the timing of some inward-investment projects, and the cut in interest rates would send a favourable signal to inward investors.</p>

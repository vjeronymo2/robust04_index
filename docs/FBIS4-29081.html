			<p>BFN     [Text] In response to the DPRK (North Korea) announcement  on its immediate withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA), a government source said on 14 June that the  government had begun to review its stance toward UN Security  Council [UNSC] resolutions. The Japanese Government has been  taking a moderate attitude toward North Korea, calling for a  UNSC warning before imposing any sanctions. However, some  quarters in the government are calling for stronger actions to  cope with North Korea's high-handed attitude. The government  has reportedly started consulting the United States and the ROK  to jointly urge the UNSC to adopt immediate sanctions.    On the same day, a top Foreign Ministry official hinted at a  change in Japan's stance toward UNSC resolutions, saying:  "Japan has been calling for step-by-step sanctions beginning  with a warning by the UNSC, but this does not mean Japan wants  to disturb the efforts of the international community." In  addition, a Foreign Ministry source said stronger sanctions are  likely to be imposed: "The UNSC may include Japan's ban on  remittances to North Korea from the first stage." In that case,  the government will face a difficult situation since the  remittance ban is expected to arouse much controversy in Japan.    To cope with the North Korean nuclear issue, Japan, the  United States, and the ROK held working-level talks in  Washington on 4 June. Moreover, U.S. Under Secretary of State  for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff visited Japan and the ROK  from 10 to 11 June to finalize a motion to be submitted to the  UNSC.    The Japanese Government has been insisting that UNSC  sanctions be implemented moderately on a step-by-step basis,  since impatient measures would obtain support from neither China  nor the Japanese public. In line with the moderate policy,  Japan requested the UNSC issue a warning against North Korea  prior to imposing sanctions.    The United States and the ROK initially showed consideration  for Japan's position, and agreed to jointly seek step-by-step  sanctions. Yet the two nations then showed slightly different  positions, calling for a UNSC decision on suspension of  technological aid and cultural exchanges by the United Nations,  rather than bans on remittances or oil exports.    Following North Korea's announcement of its immediate  withdrawal from the IAEA, the United States and the ROK have  assumed a firm attitude. In a phone call with Foreign Minister  Koji Kakizawa on the morning of 14 June, U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher hinted at a U.S. policy to strengthen the  UNSC resolution, saying: "We may have to reconsider our proposal  to the UNSC."</p>

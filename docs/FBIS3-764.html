			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sipke de Vries] </F>   [Text] Bophuthatswana interim administrator Dr Tjaart van  der Walt has committed the South African Government to bringing  about salary parity between Bophuthatswana and South African  civil servants "as soon as possible". Addressing about 3,000  civil servants in Mmabatho's civic theatre on Monday [14 March]  morning, Dr van der Walt said: "The South African Government  guarantees the salary and pension privileges of every civil  servant, including those who were dismissed in the past."    He then promised parity of salaries with South African civil  servants' pay grades "as soon as possible". "Your salaries will  be paid at th? end of the month, but do your jobs," Dr van der  Walt told his cheering audience.    Dr van der Walt said in spite of the sad events and  atrocities of last week's unrest, "we'll get Bophuthatswana  moving like never before". "We'll make Bophuthatswana the  backbone of the north-west as part and parcel of the new South  Africa."    Dr van der Walt said he had warned the South African  Government last year about the "grassroots unrest" in  Boputhatswana. The "sad fact was that, humanely speaking, the  loss of life and property in the homeland could have been been  prevented. But we are here to pick up the pieces".    The people of Bophuthatswana could now regard themselves as  South African citizens and participate in the elections.    Dr van der Walt said he took full responsibility for calling  in the South African Defence Force to stabilise the situation in  the troubled homeland, and apologised for the right-wing  insurgence into Bophuthatswana last week, saying the SA  Government was not responsible for this.    He told the civil servants the security situation was under  control and nobody needed to feel intimidated or threatened.    Dr van der Walt's remark that he had informed  Bophuthatswana's former President Lucas Mangope on Saturday  night that his presidency was no longer recognised, was  applauded loudly by the audience.    He also promised the civil servants the government would  "carefully consider" civil servants' concerns and "look  sympathetically" at all reasonable demands.    Dr van der Walt said he had been in touch with Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler,  who had told him the IEC was drawing up a plan of action for  free and fair political activities in Bophuthatswana for the  April elections. Contact with community leaders at the weekend  would continue.    Calling on the civil servants to "return to normality as  soon  as possible", Dr van der Walt said outside experts would be  brought in to help the Bophuthatswana civil service get back on  its feet.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Impact feared on recovery: Institutional government seen as one way to restore stability and unity Up to now, the brawl on Italy's bridge about who is in command has done little to upset work in the engine-room, where the real economy has powered ahead. But industrialists fear this week's no-confidence votes could usher in a new phase of political uncertainty and turmoil on financial markets. Among the few well known names to speak out publicly has been Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the chairman of Olivetti and a business rival of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. He provoked the wrath of the premier last week with an interview in which he called for the coalition to be replaced by an institutional government. The political uncertainty 'risks compromising the industrial recovery which has now taken off,' he told La Stampa, the Turin-based newspaper controlled by the Agnelli family. Other business leaders are privately voicing concern. 'We can no longer say that the real economy is divorced from the political turmoil,' says an executive at one of Italy's largest quoted companies. Confindustria, the Italian employers' federation, is maintaining a rosy forecast for next year's economic growth, but the federation is concerned that continuing political uncertainty - in particular the risk that a new government would have to introduce painful supplementary budget measures in early 1995 - could deter companies from investing in new plant and creating new jobs. Mr Luigi Tessera, managing director of Tepak, a manufacturer of padded envelopes based near Turin, says the economic environment for small companies in his region is now better than it was six months ago. But he admits that local companies are worried about what lies ahead. His solution, however, is to press ahead with investment. 'We need to invest to reinforce our business against these moments of uncertainty.' One fear is that the persistent weakness of the lira could trigger a new spiral of inflation. Exporters admit they have reaped the benefit of a weak currency, after its September 1992 devaluation. But even they were not expecting the lira to reach the levels recorded this week: yesterday it touched a record low of L1,050 to the D-Mark, compared with about L988 just before the March elections. Mr Daniele Vacchi of IMA, a medium-sized family owned Bologna manufacturer of packaging machinery, says: 'The weak lira isn't a 360-degree advantage: we are in a high-technology area and have to buy some raw materials, semi-finished goods and electronic components abroad. These goods are increasing in price.' One counterweight to inflation would be a further rise in interest rates, but that would increase pressure on those companies still nursing borrowings from the recession and directly hinder investment. Entrepreneurs also say Italy's poor image abroad is increasingly bad for business, especially when competing for contracts against competitors from Germany. The concern now is that in the scramble to form a new coalition or, worse still, in the chaotic run-up to new elections, some of the worthy aims of the Berlusconi government may be sacrificed or postponed. There is a risk, for example, that the ambitious privatisation timetable could suffer delays, further disillusioning international investors. Business hopes for an institutional government - a non-party government of technocrats - which could calm the frenzied political atmosphere, and unite all in the national interest. Significantly, Mr Giulio Tremonti, Italy's finance minister, made a point on Monday of stressing that his newly launched white paper on fiscal reform had all-party support. The paper, which proposes simplification of Italy's Byzantine tax system, has been eagerly awaited by individuals as well as small and medium-sized companies, labouring under a heavy bureaucratic burden. 'Fiscal reform is a constitutional reform and therefore needs the participation of the opposition as well,' Mr Tremonti said on Monday. However, given the acrimony likely to be generated between government and opposition in the next few days, that could be easier said than done.</p>

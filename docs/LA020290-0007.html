			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECORD GETS PROBATION  </P> <P> Isn't it ironic that Secord is now calling Reagan "cowardly"? Here is a man who  lied to his country.  </P> <P> He didn't have the guts to stand up for the truth! Secord, a convicted felon,  should be lucky that he received a probationary sentence. The fact that he now  says Reagan is cowardly carries no weight. A real coward is someone who is  afraid to stand up for the truth when the moment is at hand.  </P> <P> KELVIN D.

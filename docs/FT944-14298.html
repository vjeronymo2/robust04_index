			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Milan in the dark Alitalia warned last week that fog could disrupt travel to and from Milan's Linate airport this winter more than usual, writes Andrew Hill. The airport has replaced its out-dated instrument landing system (ILS), which allows aircraft to land when visibility is as poor as 100m. But such landings will only be possible next winter (1995-96), when testing of the new equipment is complete. Until then, if visibility drops below 200m, airlines will have to use other airports, such as Malpensa (Milan's second airport) or Bergamo, or cancel flights. Last winter was unusually clear, but fog patches are already causing problems for drivers in the Milan area.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / The man who must bite Italy's budget bullet: Haig Simonian interviews treasury minister Barucci, key figure in the government's war on spending MR PIERO Barucci, Italy's treasury minister, may be forgiven for thinking he is one of the most sought-after men in the country. As an architect of the new government's accelerated privatisation programme, 'at least 200' merchant bankers are now knocking on his door to sell their wares. A similar-sized posse of executives - this time creditors - would like to discuss their grievances at the government's handling of Efim, the state holding company put into voluntary liquidation last month. Dissatisfaction over Efim, especially among foreign banks, which reacted frostily to yesterday's cabinet decree on the company's debts, could come at a bad time for the government, which will have to rely largely on foreign markets to take up its privatisation issues. As if that was not enough, the first assault on the popularity of the treasury minister, traditionally the lynchpin of the government's economic policy, could come from Italians anxious to hear what his 1993 budget plans, to be announced next month, will hold. Mr Barucci is in the front line of the fight to axe spending and tackle the ballooning budget deficit. The challenge has already triggered reports of 'draconian' measures in store. 'We intend to be decisive, not dramatic,' says Mr Barucci in his first interview since taking office. 'The budget will be neither Shakespeare nor Verdi'. The trick, he admits, will be to reduce private consumption without plunging the fragile economy into recession. 'On taking office, we were confronted by a foreign exchange and bond crisis following the Danish referendum result and signs that our 1992 deficit would reach L180,000bn (Pounds 84bn),' he says. 'We had to move fast to cut that figure and reassure the financial markets. It should be considered a miracle in the Italian context that we managed to transform our decree on a L30,000bn emergency 1992 budget into law within a month'. With the immediate crisis behind them, ministers are now looking ahead. However, their room for manoeuvre is limited by the continuing weakness in world economic growth, meaning Italy's economy will expand by less than 2 per cent next year, and the fact that the deficit is still swelling. And they need to maintain a tight monetary policy to fight inflation, despite the attractions of lower interest rates, which would reduce the immense burden of servicing the deficit. 'We have already managed to pass four decrees which will should bring the deficit under control. But you can't expect them to take effect in just a few months. That's the problem we face with next year's budget'. The decrees cover various spending categories, notably Italy's bloated pensions system. Its mushrooming growth has been among the biggest contributors to the deficit. Mr Barucci is confident the measures to reform pensions will be enough, in spite of criticisms that they are too tame. 'The 1993 budget will have to be decidedly anti-inflationary, but it will also have to guard against recession,' notes Mr Barucci. He recognises the risks in choosing the wrong policy mix. 'It's a real puzzle, which we'll have to address by a careful balance between fiscal and price policies. That's why I've always said the hardest test for this government will be in September'. Mr Barucci is taciturn about what will be unveiled on consumption. Rumours are already circulating about a possible rise in the basic rate of income and value added tax from their current levels of 19 per cent. 'Nothing has been decided yet,' he says. 'We'll start discussions on the basis of projected figures at the end of this month. But it will be the end of September - the official deadline for the 1993 budget plans - before you see the details.' But while Mr Barucci appreciates the government, based on a wafer-thin 16-seat parliamentary majority, could easily be toppled, he draws confidence from its achievements so far, based partly on MP's distaste for new elections and the lack of an effective opposition.</p>

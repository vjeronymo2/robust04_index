			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> FOXX PROPERTY AUCTION BLOCKED  </P> <P> A federal bankruptcy judge has delayed plans for an Internal Revenue Service  auction of property belonging to comedian Redd Foxx, just 24 hours before the  sale was scheduled to begin.  </P> <P> U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Clive Jones issued a 30-day stay of the sale today,  despite protests by IRS attorneys and the auctioneer involved.  </P> <P> Foxx's attorney, Paul Whitford of Beverly Hills, told the court that the IRS  sale of the property would conflict with the interests of the Bankruptcy Court.  Whitford said the issue was "whether provisions of the bankruptcy code override  provisions of the IRS code."  </P> <P> Foxx, who filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1983, owes the IRS about $900,000  in back taxes, penalties and interest.  </P> <P> The IRS seized more than 400 items of personal property in a raid on his home  Nov. 28. The property ranged from his Las Vegas home to antique cars,  furniture, dozens of pieces of flashy jewelry, posters and photographs.  </P></p>

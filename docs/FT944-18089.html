			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Insider dealing Well-meaning but unworkable. That is likely to be the verdict on yesterday's consultation document from the London Stock Exchange on tackling insider dealing. The proposals could also prove more damaging to markets than the report appears to acknowledge. The exchange's aim is to protect investors from the effects of trading based on unpublished price-sensitive information. Its main suggestion is that it will intervene whenever a share price breaches certain pre-set criteria based on volatility. While investigating whether the jump derives from a leak of price-sensitive corporate information, it may issue an 'alert' to the market, warning that the share is under investigation. Alternatively, it could declare trading 'indicative', removing marketmakers' obligation to quote firm prices and sizes at which they will deal. Or it could temporarily halt trading in a share, possibly leading to suspension of the listing. The proposals arise from the exchange's acute and understandable frustration at the low level of prosecutions and convictions of insider dealers. They have also been prompted by improvements to its electronic surveillance of trading, which allow it more easily to monitor price jumps and discern traders' identities. But the shortcomings of the proposals are legion. For a start, they are unlikely to pick up more cases of insider dealing, many of which do not cause the share price to move. Instead, they will 'catch' a much larger group of trades - those which are motivated simply by unsubstantiated rumours. In doing so, the exchange is attempting to protect 'outside' investors from the speculation of market professionals, even where those professionals are not strictly insiders. But information and rumour will never be distributed evenly across a market. Given the frequency of such speculative trades, the exchange is setting the scene for a farce in which it may find itself playing a prominent part. The measures are also potentially damaging to the markets. The exchange will itself be inserting price-sensitive information into the market, namely, that a stock is under investigation. Moreover, it sacrifices too lightly the principle that trading should be interrupted only in extreme circumstances, a principle which does much to protect investors. For all the good intentions of yesterday's paper, the better way to protect the market is to convince traders and investors that insider dealing will be detected and punished. That may depend on improving the rate of successful prosecutions. Ministers and financial regulators should consider whether the burden of proof required in criminal prosecution is too high, and whether insider dealing should also be made a civil offence, as it is in the US. That question deserves serious evaluation. The best weapon against insider dealing is the carefully targeted pursuit of suspicious trades.</p>

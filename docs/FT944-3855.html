			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Orange County starts action against banks Orange County, the beleaguered southern California district facing Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 958m) of investment losses, formally started legal action yesterday against a number of Wall Street investment banks. The move came as a new team took up the task of sorting out the county's finances, cast into chaos by the losses and a decision to file for bankruptcy earlier this week. Mr Thomas Hayes, a former auditor general of California and a close associate of Mr Pete Wilson, the state's governor, was appointed late on Thursday to lead the restructuring of the troubled investment portfolio in order to reduce the actual losses born by the prosperous area's taxpayers. The county also named Salomon Brothers, one of a small number of US investment banks not to have had dealings with the investment fund, as an adviser. The decision to take legal action, reached after a meeting of the county's board of supervisors on Thursday evening, will pit the county against a number of leading firms on Wall Street, among them Morgan Stanley, Smith Barney, Prudential Securities and Nomura. Since the filing, the firms have all sold securities they held as collateral for loans made to the county. Total sales had reached Dollars 11.4bn by yesterday, the county said. Officials in California have argued that the filing put a legal block on the firms selling the securities, a move intended to prevent its investment losses from being realised. 'We are outraged that some broker-dealers have elected to ignore the law and have only contributed to the uncertainty that has confronted us in recent days,' said Mr Thomas Riley, chairman of the board of supervisors. According to the county's lawyer, Mr Bruce Bennett of Stutman Treister &amp; Glatt, the bankruptcy filing put an 'automatic stay' on any actions that could impair the authority's finances. Merrill Lynch, which had lent Dollars 2bn to the investment fund, is believed to be the only bank not to have sold its collateral by late yesterday. The bankruptcy was precipitated after CS First Boston earlier this week sold Dollars 2.6bn of securities it held belonging to the county, which is believed to have missed an interest payment due to the bank on advances it had made under so-called 'repurchase agreements'. CS First Boston would only say it had 'liquidated the collateral under the terms of the agreements we had', and that the sales had taken place before the bankruptcy filing. Meanwhile the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates the US investment markets, has moved fast with its own investigation. Merrill Lynch, which is believed to have sold the county many of the investments on which it faces losses, confirmed it had received a subpoena from the agency for information. Other investment banks are understood to have received similar requests. See Editorial Comment, World Stock Markets and Lex</p>

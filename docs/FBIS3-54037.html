In an exclusive statement given to a MENA correspondent in  Kabul, Rabbani reiterated that foreign powers planned and  financed the conspiracy to achieve special covetous designs,  although Afghanistan does not interfere in their affairs. The  Afghan president said that the coup attempt was a vicious plot  perpetrated by Golboddin Hekmatyar, General Abdul Rashid Dostam,  the communists, and other parties in a bid to overthrow the  Islamic regime in Kabul by armed force. He pointed out that  they planned to execute the plot on the anniversary of the  foundation of the Communist Party in Afghanistan.    The Afghan president described Gen. Dostam as a professional  killer and a traitor. He said that Dostam is a remnant of the  former communist regime. The Afghan president added that  Golboddin Hekmatyar has distorted the image of jihad and  mojahedin in Afghanistan. After the inception of the Islamic  state in Afghanistan, we granted them amnesty with the hope that  they would repent and contribute toward reconstructing a new  Afghanistan, the Afghan president added. But, driven by their  criminal nature, they decided to return to their conspiratorial  course.    President Borhanoddin Rabbani noted that all Muslim  scholars,  shayks, mojahedin leaders, and Islamic political powers had  responded to the Islamic jihad call. The Afghan president  revealed that many mojahedin leaders, who belong to Hekmatyar  groups, refused to take part in the coup attempt and rejected  his alliance with Dostam.    Rabbani said that he will reject any contacts for a  cease-fire with Dostam, but he added that it is possible to work  out a kind of cease-fire formula with Hekmatyar provided there  are guarantees that he would not violate it. The Afghan  president stressed that the Afghan people are capable of  crushing any domestic rebellion or foreign plot. The Afghan  people will continue to support their Islamic state with all  their strength, President Rabbani added.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Metallgesellschaft up 17% on UBS note Bourses liked the US CPI data and investors, particularly, seemed to go for commodity-based cyclicals, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT turned in respectable gains, mostly in insurers, automotive and engineering and metals stocks, although trade was quiet after Thursday's holiday. The Dax index rose 15.12 to 2,258.75 on the session, up 1 per cent on the week, and held its ground in the post bourse to close at an Ibis-indicated 2,257.33. Turnover fell to DM6.9bn from Wednesday's DM8.6bn. The stock of the day was Metallgesellschaft, the disaster stock of late 1993 and early 1994 after its exposure to oil-trading losses through a US subsidiary. It leapt DM42, or 17 per cent, to DM285, up 27 per cent on the week. The automotive, engineering and research team at UBS put out a strong recommendation on the stock this week, seeing a lot of potential in the company after its restructuring under the new management board chairman, Mr Kajo Neukirchen, who was successful with similar exercises at the engineer, KHD, and the ball-bearing maker, Kugelfischer. Elsewhere there were respectable gains for Thyssen, up DM6.80 to DM302.30 on its mobile telephone prospects, and for Veba, another DM6.50 higher at DM543.50 on Tuesday's good first quarter results, and on its oil interests at a time of rising commodity prices. PARIS took comfort from the US data and the CAC-40 index immediately reacted with a strong, but unsustainable, rise. Having touched a session high of 2,206.24, the market slipped back to close the day up 10.26 at 2,187.00, a rise of 1.3 per cent on the week. Hoare Govett yesterday recommended upgrading the French market to 'fully weighted' on four counts: improved economic fundamentals; support from falling bond yields 'as the domestic bond market has been sold more heavily than others in Europe, with little apparent domestic justification'; better then expected first quarter company results; and a likely easing of the 'liquidity crunch' over the summer since no further privatisations are scheduled until the autumn. LVMH, up FFr8 at FFr903, benefited from a rise in first quarter turnover from Christian Dior, up FFr1.10 at FFr447.90. AMSTERDAM was pulled both ways, with two of the most heavily capitalised issues moving in opposite directions. Royal Dutch, which has been performing strongly since its recent first quarter results exceeded analysts' expectations, gained Fl 2.20 to Fl 207.90, a week's advance of 2 per cent. For UBS, the oil group's results indicated that cost reductions were coming through, that sales were showing above average growth and that chemicals were starting to turn round. James Capel remained more cautious and maintained its hold recommendation. But there was disappointment for Unilever, off Fl 5.50 at Fl 195.50, but up from a session low of Fl 193.80, as investors reacted with disappointment to yesterday's first quarter results. Analysts particularly noted the group's lacklustre showing in the US and were worried about the so-called 'detergents war' with Procter &amp; Gamble. The AEX index finished off 0.99 at 411.58, unchanged over the week. Other notable gains were seen from KLM which was moved by a feeling that benefits from its alliance with Northwest of the US might soon come through, and the shares, which earlier saw a year's high of Fl 56.70, ended up Fl 1.40 at Fl 56.10. MILAN turned its attention to Fiat, following the vehicle group's first quarter results which came after the close on Thursday. The Comit index rose 5.83 to 808.85, up 1 per cent on the week. Analysts were not surprised by Fiat's 1993 losses - the biggest in its history - which had already been discounted. Of more interest was the fact that the first quarter of 1994 showed a gain of L30bn, compared with a 1993 loss of L222bn. The shares improved L90 to L7,225, 2.7 per cent better on the week. ZURICH recovered more ground after strength in the banking and insurance sectors, the SMI index rising 47.8 to 2,680.8, 1.5 per cent higher on a volatile week. Receding interest rate worries left CS Holding, the most active stock of the day, up SFr19 at SFr603. Among insurers, Zurich bearers rose SFr55 to SFr1,310, and Winterthur put on SFr27 at SFr672 after good earnings growth in this week's progress reports. MADRID found it difficult to cope with Wall Street's apparent reaction to good US data, but late institutional buying rescued the market, and the general index ended 1.87 higher at 329.03, 3.4 per cent higher on the week. Turnover was a solid Pta50bn. ATHENS hit a 1994 low for the second consecutive session, the general index closing 16.58 lower at 934.19, 4.8 per cent lower on the week, with foreign investors worried by pressure on the drachma.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> B. Continue to maintain safe control over the byproduct material, by keeping the material in locked storage and no allowing any person access to the material, except for purposes of assuring the material's continued safe storage, until the material is transferred to a person authorized to receive and possess the material in accordance with the provisions of this Order and the Commission's regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Transfer the cobalt-60 and the krypton-85 byproduct material and all associated radioactively contaminated waste located at 22 Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, Massachusetts within 30 days to a person authorized to receive and possess the material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Decommission the facility within 60 days of the date of this Order and DFI and provide: (1) a notification of when decommissioning has been completed, and (2) a report providing the information required by 10 CFR 30.36 (c)(1)(v)(A) and (c)(1)(v)(B), appending to it the original and one copy of NRC Form&hyph;314, ``Disposition of Radioactive Material,'' with copies of all shipping papers. This 60 day period does not excuse the continuing violation of the requirements in 10 CFR 30.36 to remove radioactive contamination, properly dispose of byproduct material, submit a completed form NRC&hyph;314, and conduct a radiation survey of the premises. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to issuance of this Order, the Commission requires further information from Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton in order to determine whether the Commission can have reasonable assurance that in the future, should Messrs. Tarr or Hamilton perform licensed activities under any other NRC license, Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton will conduct any activities in accordance with NRC requirements, and to determine whether enforcement action is warranted against Messrs. Tarr or Hamilton, as individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, pursuant to sections 161c, 161o, and 182 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commissions's regulations in 10 CFR 2.204, Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton are hereby required to submit, either jointly or separately, to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, within the timeframe specified below, a statement in writing, under oath or affirmation, on the following information: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Within 10 days of the date of this Order and DFI, inform the NRC, by letter, how each intends to comply with NRC requirements; in particular, how you intend to maintain safe control over the byproduct material prior to the transfer of the material to an authorized recipient. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Within 15 days of the date of this Order and DFI, Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton shall provide a decommissioning plan for NRC review and approval, which will meet the applicable requirements of 10 CFR 30.36. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Within seven days following transfer of the radioactive material, Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton shall provide: (1) confirmation that the cobalt-60 and the krypton-85 have been transferred; and (2) a copy of the certification from the authorized recipient that the byproduct material has been received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. At least two working days prior to the date of the transfer of the byproduct material, Mr. Tarr or Mr. Hamilton shall notify Dr. Ronald Bellamy, Chief, Nuclear Materials Safety Branch, NRC, Region I, by telephone (610&hyph;337&hyph;5200) so that the NRC may, if it elects, observe the transfer of the material to the authorized recipient. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Within 30 days of the date of this Order and DFI, if Messrs. Tarr and Mr. Hamilton believe they do not have sufficient funds to complete the transfer and decommissioning, they must provide specific evidence supporting such a claim by submitting: (1) an estimate of the cost of the transfer and decommissioning, and the basis for the estimate, including the license number and identity of the person who would perform the transfer and decommissioning; (2) written statements from at least two banks stating that Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton could not qualify for a loan to pay for the transfer of the byproduct materials and decommissioning of the facility; (3) copies of Federal income tax returns for the years ending 1993, 1992, 1991, and 1990, for both Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton; (4) copies of all Bankruptcy Court submittals for the Licensee, RCM Corporation and Cherokee Electronics Corporation; copies of all Bankruptcy Court decisions related to the above corporations; and copies of all correspondence between these corporations and the NRC related to the bankruptcy proceedings; and (5) a signed agreement to allow the NRC to receive Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton's credit information from a credit agency. A SUBMITTAL OF EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT FUNDS DOES NOT EXCUSE NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THIS ORDER. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Within 30 days of the date of this Order and DFI provide:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. A list of all NRC licensees for whom Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton perform licensed activities, or with whom they are associated in any other capacity; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. A statement as to why the NRC should have confidence that Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton would comply with NRC requirements in the event that they perform licensed activities under another NRC license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. A statement as to why, in light of the facts set forth above, the NRC should not issue an Order to both Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton, as individuals, prohibiting them from engaging in NRC-licensed activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This information is needed to light of the continued violations of Commission requirements. Copies of the response to this Demand for Information also shall be sent to the Regional Administrator, Region I, 475 Allendale Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406, and to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing your response, the NRC will determine whether further action is necessary to ensure compliance with NRC requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 2nd day of August 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Hugh L.

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / 'Iron Butterfly' flutters aloft as political landscape is reshaped: Former Socialist leader becomes first woman Speaker of the Diet FROM HER elevated position in the Japanese parliament building, Ms Takako Doi, the 'Iron Butterfly', yesterday became the first woman to look down upon her peers from the velvet covered seat. Although she initially rejected the job of Speaker of the Diet - the lower house of parliament - she assumed the post in serious vein, naming the country's new prime minister with her booming voice. It has been a long week for the 64-year-old former leader of the Social Democratic party, previously known as the Japan Socialist party. Her supporters had hoped she would refuse the offer of the Speaker's post. They had suggested she form a new party along with the left-wing faction of the SDP. Left-wing members have been unhappy at the SDP's decision to enter a coalition government with former members of the Liberal Democratic party - the establishment party now edged out of power after dominating Japan's postwar politics. Ms Doi's own left-wing leanings, including support for the North Korean regime and opposition to Japan's defence forces, were blamed for the unexpected defeat of the SDP in the Tokyo gubernatorial elections two years ago, after which she resigned as party leader. But even though she stepped down from the top job, Ms Doi has maintained her personal popularity as a politician and retains the charisma which once awed the LDP. Leaders of the present coalition were worried that she and a band of left-wing members might splinter from the SDP and so reduce the coalition's majority in parliament. Since Speakers of the Diet are expected to give up party membership during their tenure, leftists in the SDP have accused party officials of trying to get rid of 'true socialist' ideologies by promoting Ms Doi. After days during which SDP officials pressed her to take the offer, Ms Doi finally relented. She had resisted on the grounds that the party with the largest number of seats in the Diet should nominate the Speaker. But she eventually accepted the post, she said, to 'prevent democracy from collapsing' and hoped to make the political process more open and less corrupt. The daughter of a doctor in Kobe, western Japan, Ms Doi became a professor of constitutional law before being elected to the Diet in 1969. Coalition leaders said her constitutional law background was perfect for the post of Speaker. Her popularity stems from her down-to-earth image. She plays pachinko, the Japanese version of pinball, loves karaoke and is an avid fan of baseball. She is also respected for her outspoken ways. Unlike some of her peers, who are renowned for their evasive answers, she is not afraid to call a spade a spade. Some politicians fear that such straightforwardness could stand in the way of her new job, which often requires delicate handling of parliamentary proceedings. However, Ms Doi has made clear that she will not follow tradition, but will go about her business the 'natural way'.</p>

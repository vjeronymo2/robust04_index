			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 13 Jun (AFP) -- The Central American  presidents agreed to propose at the Cartagena summit an  endorsement of Ibero-American ecological and trade integration  and to request specific actions to promote the isthmus'  "unrestricted" access to third markets.    After a second working session that concluded today at noon,  the Central American presidents signed in San Jose a joint  declaration outlining proposals for the area with the  Ibero-American summit in mind. This summit will open in  Cartagena de Indias, Colombia on Tuesday.    "We propose that Ibero-America incorporate ecological  integration into efforts toward economic and social integration.  It is necessary to combine subregional integration agreements  so it will be possible in the near future to create a large free  trade zone," states the document, which was read by Guatemalan  President Ramiro De Leon Carpio .    De Leon emphasized the need for the Ibero-American community  to increase technical and financial aid to Central America to  fight poverty; promote fair, sustainable development; and  consolidate its democratic process after enduring the previous  decade's severe crisis aggravated by the "Cold War."    The document states: "Renewed international solidarity with  Central America should be expressed in concrete actions in the  field of trade exchange, thus clearing the way for unrestricted  access of the isthmus' products to the Ibero-American  community's markets."    According to the presidents, ecological integration will  allow the establishment of Ibero-American environmental laws,  the signing and implementation of an agreement in favor of  nature, and the transfer of technology to benefit all productive  sectors.    The Central American presidents also agreed to request the  participation of the Ibero-American nations as extraregional  associates of the Central American Bank of Economic Integration  to finance regional development projects.    The declaration was signed by Presidents De Leon Carpio,  Carlos Roberto Reina (Honduras), Armando Calderon Sol (El  Salvador), Violeta Chamorro (Nicaragua), Guillermo Endara  (Panama), and Jose Maria Figueres (Costa Rica).    The Costa Rican president stressed that despite internal  differences Central American countries must face the  "challenges" of development together as an example of the  isthmus nations' "brotherhood."    In addition, the presidents called for a Central American  ecological summit to be held in Nicaragua 12-13 October as well  as for an international conference for peace and development in  Central America, slated for 24-25 June in Honduras.    After the mini summit, the first working session of which  was  held on Sunday night, the Central American presidents will  travel to Cartagena together in a plane provided by the  Colombian Government.</p>

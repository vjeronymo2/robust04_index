			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Record fine over worker's death A COURT yesterday imposed a record fine on a construction company for a health and safety offence. J Murphy and Sons of north London was fined a total of Pounds 160,000 plus Pounds 28,000 costs at Knightsbridge Crown Court following the death of a worker in February 1991. The company admitted two charges under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. The Health and Safety Executive, which brought the case, said the level of the fine reflected 'a widespread corporate failure'. Mr Jeff Hinksman, HSE deputy chief inspector, said the fine 'should serve as a warning to all firms in the construction industry to take their management responsibilities for health and safety seriously'. The court heard that William Kerr, 35, of Greenford, Middlesex, died from an electric shock suffered while working underground on stage two of the London water ring main project. He was one of a number of subcontracted workers who were moving a mobile electrical transformer inside a tunnel. Mr Hugh Carlisle QC, for the HSE, told the court a 'catalogue of errors' throughout the company had led to 3,300 volts - 13 times the domestic rate - passing through Kerr. An oversight meant the electrical system had not been properly earthed and the work should have been done under guidance from a fully qualified engineer, he said. Maintenance supervision was 'haphazard' while the company had failed to come to terms with new electric regulations brought in almost a year earlier. The company was fined Pounds 150,000 for failing to have a system for ensuring the safe design, construction and maintenance of the electrical system at the site. It was also fined Pounds 10,000 for failure to maintain the electrical system involving the transformer. Costs were awarded to the HSE. J Murphy and Sons said last night it deeply regretted the accident. 'The company views the safety of its employees, contractors and members of the public as being of prime importance.' The company added that Mr James O'Callaghan, J Murphy's director with responsibility for safety matters and director of the tunnelling division, had been acquitted of charges under the Health and Safety at Work Act and had been awarded costs after the prosecution declined to offer any evidence.</p>

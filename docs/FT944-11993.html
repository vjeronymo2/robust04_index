			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: The preferred route to recovery - British Coal's cast-off could be Anglo's salvation Anglo United shareholders could not believe their eyes when they read their newspapers on Tuesday morning. The company they have supported through two debt restructurings and a rescue rights issue had been nominated by British Coal and its adviser Price Waterhouse as one of four preferred bidders for its smokeless fuels subsidiary, Coal Products. If it succeeds, Anglo will certainly have to restructure the debt yet again and call on shareholders to finance the acquisition. It is thought Anglo has offered between Pounds 60m and Pounds 90m in the initial bidding round for Coal Products, all of which will have to come from shareholders. On the surface, Anglo's preferred status appears surprising. The company has incurred losses for the past two years and has negative shareholders' funds of about Pounds 146m. In the words of one Anglo executive, gearing is out in the stratosphere. Debt remains a weighty Pounds 96m and no dividends are expected to be paid until borrowing ratios return to earth. The shares were last trading at about 2p. Nor does the company's history provide much comfort. It made headlines in the late 1980s with its Pounds 500m hostile takeover of Coalite, one of the UK's last great leveraged bids. The bid was the brainchild of Mr David McErlain, Anglo's former chairman, whose Coal Developments company is also one of the preferred bidders for Coal Products. He intended to pay off the debt incurred by the Coalite takeover by selling off the target's peripheral businesses. Unfortunately, recession and problems encountered in selling assets hindered his plans, and by 1991 the company was forced to defer loan repayments. Over the next two years, Anglo launched a Pounds 25m rescue rights issue to pay off a bridging loan and two debt restructurings. The most recent, completed last year, left the banks owning half the company. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation is the largest shareholder with 40 per cent. The banks have been crucial to Anglo's success in passing the initial tests in the bid for Coal Products. They are understood to have given assurances of support for the required equity funding and debt restructuring. It is likely that for Anglo to become the sole preferred bidder, it will have to have the debt restructuring and plans for a rights issue ready to go by the end of the year. The restructuring is likely to be a complex issue. While winning Coal Products could go some way to reducing the deficit in shareholders' funds, a substantial debt for equity swap is almost certain to be on the cards yet again. Anglo refuses to comment on its bid or the comfort it might have received from shareholders. However, winning Coal Products could give it the vital breathing space it needs to find its feet. Coalite is its most profitable business. Yet the smokeless fuel market is declining as consumers' switch to gas-fired central heating. Still, the business is highly cash generative and the synergies with Coal Products could be substantial. Anglo's need to squeeze value out of a declining market, if it is to survive, could give it a substantial edge in the bidding. Shareholders might, perhaps, be motivated to support a higher bid as a result. Ordinary shareholders do not appear to care why Anglo has been included in the shortlist. They are delighted. 'The key point is that the banks did not just say let's squeeze every last drop out of the company until it's dry and walk away,' said one investor. 'They have been prepared to work their way out of the situation, give the company time to breathe and take it forward. We are very happy.'</p>

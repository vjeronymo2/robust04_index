			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Israeli occupation forces have continued  their acts of aggression in the south. From 1100 to around 1500  today, Israeli artillery continuously shelled Kafra, Yatar,  Haris, Zibqin, Majdal Zun, al-Mansurah, Buyut al-Sayyid,  al-Hinniyah and the outskirts of al-Qulaylah. This was  accompanied by heavy machine-gun bursts and continual  overflights by Israeli warplanes.    A correspondent from the NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY reported that  the villages of the western sector are now experiencing a state  of economic, educational, and social paralysis as a result of  the repeated Israeli aggression.    Meanwhile, resistance groups carried out a strong attack  against enemy forces near al-Ahmadiyah in Western al-Biqa'.  [passage omitted]    Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Shaykh Na'im Qasim  stressed that the al-Ahmadiyah operation today is one in a  series of attacks in the confrontation with the usurper Israeli  enemy.</p>

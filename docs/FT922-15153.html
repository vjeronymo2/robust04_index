			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Labour's 'time for change' theme strikes a chord - North-west England is crucial for the Opposition IF LABOUR fails to capture most of its target seats in the north-west of England next week, even the party's most committed supporters might begin to question its ability ever again to form a government. Political gifts have been showered upon the party with such profligacy by its Conservative opponents that initial assessments made three weeks ago by experienced Labour agents have, so far, been exceeded. At the outset of the campaign they said that what they hoped would see Labour home was nothing more positive than '13 years, time for a change'. It has been a simple, very effective message and one that, on the doorsteps and during public debates, neither Conservative candidates nor Central Office have been able to counter. Going to the country hoping for a fresh mandate after 13 years in government and against a background of rising unemployment and business failures may have been stretching optimism beyond reasonable levels. Worse still for the Tories, the election campaign has brought to the surface resentments and even a sense of personal betrayal among voters who suffered for the cause in the early 1980s and came to believe in aspects of the Thatcher economic miracle. To be, as they see it, back at square one is a reversal that is hard to bear. Mr Alistair Burt, defending Bury North, summed up the dilemma for many more of his supporters when he said that what they were looking for was a reason to continue voting Conservative. With a week until polling day, it seems that while some are still searching, others may have given up. None of the key issues which Tory leaders have chosen to highlight has achieved much resonance in the north-west. Those in the region liable to be hit hardest by Labour's income tax and national insurance proposals may be assumed to be Conservatives. Most others appear ready to identify themselves as the 80 per cent whom Mr John Smith says would benefit from his first Budget as chancellor. Conservative attacks on Labour's proposals for a Pounds 3.40-an-hour minimum wage have been met with similarly little response. A few extra pence a week for the lowest paid serves what many northerners see as a need for greater justice in financial rewards. And, for Conservative candidates, opposition to a minimum wage sits miserably alongside the huge pay rises awarded to chief executives in newly privatised public utilities. Rising crime figures in the region offer equally little scope on the law and order issue, while foreign policy questions such as the Gulf war and the great themes of European integration scarcely warrant a mention. But if the Tories cannot make ground on their chosen issues, they are certainly losing it in the critical arena of the health service. Labour's broadcast last week featuring the case of Jennifer Bennett probably did not win it many votes, but it is so far ahead of the Conservatives on this issue that it mattered little. The health service in the north-west has become almost part of local folklore. Stop anyone in Greater Manchester and if they have not been subjected to a hospital waiting list then they know of somebody who has. Prompt health care is viewed as part of the British birthright, and no amount of Conservative argument has been able to shift the suspicion that the service is being undermined. Then there is the poll tax. In the modestly rated terraced houses and semi-detacheds of the north-west it produced a financial shock two years ago which has not been forgotten and, worse for the Tories, is being recalled this week as payment demands for the coming year's poll tax are pushed through millions of letter-boxes. What has checked a higher level of Conservative disaffection appears to be essentially the Labour party's lack of positive appeal. This in turn helps explain the increase noted over the past 10 days in the number of people who say they will vote for the Liberal Democrats and would welcome a parliament in which no one party has an overall majority. But the rising tide of optimism among Labour workers this week cannot disguise the modest enthusiasm for the party among voters who are switching allegiances. The most often-heard reason on the doorstep for changing sides is not that Labour is deemed to have exciting or convincing policies, but that it could not do any worse than the Conservatives. There are also serious and sometimes unresolvable doubts expressed by undecided voters over the ability of Mr Neil Kinnock to lead the country. Just as there are Conservative candidates who in their latest campaign literature have managed to avoid almost any mention of their party, so there are Labour candidates who in public speeches never refer to Mr Kinnock. Instead it is the reassuring presence of Mr John Smith who is most often invoked to underline Labour's commitment to sound finances and good housekeeping. Either side of the centre there is a desire to see politicians working together for the greater good of the nation, an invocation of the spirit of wartime. Such voters would be pleased to see Mr Major and Mr Smith co-operating while Mr Kinnock and Mr Lamont retired from public view. It was always going to be hugely difficult for the Conservatives to justify another five years when the culmination of the past 13 was so difficult to defend. If Labour does as well as it expects in the north-west, it will be primarily because it has not blocked that message from reaching the electorate.</p>

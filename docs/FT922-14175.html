			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Japanese equities plunge to lowest for 5 1/2 years JAPANESE EQUITIES plunged yesterday to their lowest levels for 5 1/2 years, taking the Nikkei index of leading shares below the 18,000 mark. The Nikkei fell 644.82 to 17,791.55, the lowest it has been since November 1986. Brokers and businessmen saw little prospect of a recovery, after last week's cut in the official discount rate and government spending package had failed to boost confidence. 'The stock market is now like a bottomless swamp,' Mr Yoshinari Yamashiro, president of NKK, the steel company, told a press conference. Any hope that last week's action by the authorities might restore market confidence has been crushed by the selling of bank shares. Yesterday the Nikkei index of bank stocks fell 6.9 per cent, compared with a 3.5 per cent decline in the overall index. In the past 10 days, bank shares have fallen by 20 per cent, the single biggest element in a 12 per cent decline in the Nikkei. The market value of Industrial Bank of Japan, the country's premier bank, has fallen by 77 per cent from its peak of Y15,000bn at the height of the bull market in December 1989. Nevertheless, brokers report few signs of panic. Turnover in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section totalled just 200m shares yesterday, far short of a sell-off. Bank shares have fallen faster than most stocks in recent weeks because they were bidded up last year by investors, principally foreign fund managers, who saw the stocks as a way of profiting from an expected decline in interest rates. Banks tend to benefit from falling rates because their profit margins widen. Rates have indeed fallen but bank shares have been hit by growing doubts about banks' capital reserves and an increasing burden of property-related bad debt. The decline in bank stocks should not in itself have much direct impact on banks' commercial operations. It will inhibit equity fund-raising but this has already been rendered almost impossible by the market's weakness. However, by pushing down the value of the market as a whole, falling bank shares erode the worth of the banks' share portfolios. Since a portion of these portfolios is counted as capital under the rules of the Bank for International Settlements, the banks' capital base is being eaten away. Under BIS rules which come into force next year, banks must have a minimum ratio of capital to assets of 8 per cent. Following the latest stock market fall, leading Japanese banks are now probably below this figure, though above 7 per cent. They can make good the difference by raising subordinated debt, as they have been doing for much of the past two years. World stocks, Page 37</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> ALGAE BLOOMS SEEN KEEPING EARTH COOL  </P> <P> Scientists associated with the National Academies of Sciences have proposed  dumping hundreds of thousands of tons of iron into the ocean to create giant  blooms of marine algae that could soak up much of the excess carbon dioxide  believed to be responsible for global warming.  </P> <P> If the massive scheme is carried out, researchers say, it would be among the  greatest manipulations of nature ever attempted. The Washington Post said the  group recommended that a large international "iron enrichment experiment" be  implemented at a cost of between $50 million and $150 million. Scientists are  unsure, however, about the negative effects of inducing algae growth.  </P></p>

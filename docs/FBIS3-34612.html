			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Netan'el Semrik, in the studio, and political </F> correspondent Udi Segal in Cairo -- live]    [Excerpts] [Segal] The signing ceremony in al-Ittihadiyah  has just ended. As you heard, we now have a signed agreement.  Here are some details. The agreement is, in fact, the same one  the parties achieved in Davos. It comprises two parts: one  addressing the border crossings issue, namely everything  pertaining to Jericho, and another addressing the other disputed  issues pertaining to Jericho and Gaza. The first, which speaks  of crossings, is an eight-page document, and the second, a  three-page document, speaks of the other security problems  pertaining to Gaza and Jericho, such as traffic axes in Gaza and  the size of the Jericho area. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres'  reply to a question indicates that the size of the Jericho area  was not established. What the sides did conclude were the  principles governing the establishment of the Jericho size. The  size of the Jericho area will be finalized only by Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat. [passage  omitted]    Many issues remain unresolved, including the powers of the  Palestinian police and the powers of the Palestinian council.  [passage omitted]    [Semrik] Udi, are we to understand that the signed document  is an agreement in principle on security issues, but not yet a  detailed agreement on security issues?    [Segal] This is indeed a detailed agreement. Some of the  clauses are phrased in great detail. For instance, each clause  on the border crossings issue and on the issue of general  control are detailed. The crossings issue was the one that  threatened to kill the whole deal. Today's document specifies  how people will cross the borders, how Palestinians will be  inspected in a way that will preserve their dignity. It  stipulates that Israel will reserve the right to inspect  suspects crossing the borders. All these matters were agreed in  detail, but agreement on other issues, such as the size of  Jericho, was achieved in principle only. [passage omitted]</p>

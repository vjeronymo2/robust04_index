			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Keeping tabs on chip-making The reliability of the manufacturing methods used to build high-temperature superconducting chips has been improved by a technique originally developed for the semiconductor industry. Thomas Swan, a Cambridge-based equipment supplier, working in conjunction with Superconductor Technologies of California, has built a chemical vapour deposition system for coating thin-film wafers with a high-temperature superconducting material. The system incorporates monitors to control the exact composition of the growing films, which will reduce the frequency of defects. Superconductor Technologies, which is developing high-temperature superconductors for microelectronic applications, says the new method will replace its existing laser-based deposition system. It expects it will increase its manufacturing capacity 20-fold and cut costs by a third. Superconductor Technologies: US, tel 805 683 7646; fax 805 683 8527</p>

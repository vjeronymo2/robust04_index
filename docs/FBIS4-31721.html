			<p>BFN     [Text] At the opening of the Croatian Embassy in Sarajevo,  Dr. Franjo Tudjman said, among other things, that he was  convinced that we were at the end of the tragedy that this town  and the Muslim and Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  Croatia have had to endure. We can be proud of the fact that  the Croatian people have contributed greatly to the preservation  of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Words indistinct], he said, so that we  can pick the fruit of the permanent unity between  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.    Today's official opening of the Croatian Embassy in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is a sign that we are implementing resolutely  the Washington agreement on the creation of the federation of  the Bosniaks and the Croats and the confederation with Croatia,  Dr. Tudjman said. He emphasized that this was a proof that, in  search of friendship with the Bosniak-Muslim people, a certain  level has been reached with the realization of the agreement on  the federation and that the future confederation is paving the  way to the end of the war, the aggression, and the tragedy of  Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

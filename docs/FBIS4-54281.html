			<p>-- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY  <F P=103> OW2705093794 </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> BFN     [Text] A multiparty signature-collecting campaign will be  conducted by lower house members who want the next general  election under a new electoral system. The campaign is to be  led by members of reformist groups in the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ].  Some coalition party members are also expected to join. The  campaign was conceived in response to a proposal from the  Committee for the Promotion of Political Reform (chairman: Masao  Kamei), a private panel organized by business and labor leaders.  Nearly 70 lower house members -- more than 40 from the LDP and  more than 20 from the SDPJ -- intend to meet on 26 May to  promote the campaign. Some LDP and SDPJ members are seeking an  early general election before work has finished on the allotment  of single-seat constituencies. The campaign is likely to  exercise considerable influence on the direction the  coalition-opposition struggle takes over the issue of dissolving  the lower house because it is being led by reformists from the  two opposition parties.    The campaigning LDP and SDPJ lawmakers have decided to  jointly conduct the collection of signatures prompted by concern  about moves to have the next election under the old multi-seat  system. They feel this would "ruin efforts so far to win  electoral and political reform." The campaign is largely  supported by those who have been trying hard to get the  political reform bills enacted.    From the LDP, more than 40 members of the Dietmen's League  on  Political Reform will join the campaign. These include Yuji  Tsushima, Takeshi Noda, Koji Hosaka, Akihiko Noro, and Takeo  Kawamura. Participants from the SDPJ include about 20 members  of the rightist "Democrats" group such as Tadayoshi Morii,  Kazunari Inoue, and Masao Sakon. In addition, several members  will join the campaign from each of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party], Komeito, the Japan New Party, the Democratic Socialist  Party, Sakigake [Harbinger], and New Party Mirai.    The Committee for the Promotion of Political Reform is  scheduled to announce on 26 May an emergency advisory report  calling for: 1) a general election under the new electoral  system; 2) further promotion of political and administrative  reform; and 3) enforcement of political ethics and the  reinforcement of anti-corruption measures. Following the  announcement, the lawmakers will hold the first meeting of the  campaign to adopt a "political reform declaration" based on the  private panel's three-point proposal.    The signature-collection campaign is intended to obtain  support from the majority of lower house members. It is  believed reformist lawmakers are trying to discourage the idea  of calling an early election under the multi-seat system before  the political scene begins to shift toward an "attempt to oppose  political reform."</p>

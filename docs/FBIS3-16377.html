According to Alizade, the actual outcome of the agreements  and the negotiation process will depend mostly on the Russias  position.    Touching on the question about the status of Upper Karabakh  [Nagorno-Karabakh] Alizade said, "We support the idea of giving  the status of autonomy to Upper Karabakh...in fact, Armenian  civilians do not live there, for the most part... [ellipses as  received] Since the ethnic cleansing of Azeris from that  territory, fascist-military control was established in Upper  Karabakh." He also noted that the autonomy does not pose a  threat to the integrity and sovereignty of Azerbaijan. "It does  not mean that federalisation of the republic will take place;  Azerbaijan will remain a united republic", he added.    The Azerbaijani National Independence Party's leader, Etibar  Mamedov, said that he was not yet acquainted with the results of  the talks.    "I am not yet aware the concrete conditions of the  agreement.  One thing is known. The Armenian party has demanded to a  guarantee prior to its withdrawal. If they mean that this  guarantee includes the deployment of the Russian army in the  territory, we are categorically against that and we shall not  give them such an opportunity", said Etibar Mamedov. In his  opinion, "one country cannot solve this problem as a mediator.  Moreover, Russia has its own interests in this matter."    According to Mamedov, the question of autonomy of  Nagorno-Karabakh could be solved on the basis of international  norms, i.e. on the level of self-governance without the  representation of a state. "It is impossible to have a state in  the state", noted he.</p>

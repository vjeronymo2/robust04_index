			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Victor Gomez: "A Crack Emerges in the Klaus </F> Facade"]    [Text] A mild-mannered parliamentary deputy from northern  Bohemia has cracked the monolithic image of the Czech Republic's  most powerful political party.    In the aftermath of Josef Jezek's resignation Jan. 19 from  the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) the governing coalition's  dominant partner looks a bit less like a well-oiled machine  walking lockstep behind its guiding leader, Prime Minister  Vaclav Klaus.    ODS is so strongly against dissent that its 1992 political  platform included a promise that no deputy would switch sides or  leave the party. The ODS leadership has called on Jezek to  resign his parliament seat, but it can't force him to leave.    The departure of Jezek, an owlish expert on the thorny issue  of devolving power to local governments, has brought  long-standing whispers of discontent within ODS to the surface.  ODS favors maintaining a strong central government.    Amplifying the air of discord caused by Jezek's resignation,  ODS parliamentary deputies have produced a study that points to  tensions between the party leadership and its elected  representatives. The issue of how to reform and structure local  governments--which prompted Jezek's departure--helped introduce  an unfamiliar level of disunity in the party.    Jezek takes a stronger view, saying that party consensus had  been lost forever.    "The ODS is today a different party than the one that worked  out its election platform in 1992," he said. "The differences in  viewpoints of individual members is sometimes so broad that it  seems a miracle that the party manages to stay together."    Until now, ODS has formed the bulwark of a stable  government,  while other parliamentary parties, especially those in  opposition, went through membership upheavals and conflicts.    Now, ODS deputies talk openly of differences, something that  was unheard of only a few months ago.    "It's no mystery that ideas in our [parliamentary] club on  land administration are not completely unified," said ODS Deputy  Frantisek Kozel. "The majority of the club understands [Jezek's  resignation] as a gesture that underlines a certain  dissatisfaction."    In contrast to this opinion, which has been carefully  articulated by some ODS parliamentarians, Deputy Prime Minister  Petr Cermak shrugged off Jezek's resignation as a personal  decision that will have only a marginal effect on the party.    "I don't think his opinion echoes to any great extent the  opinions of other deputies in the ODS club," Cermak said.    The deputy prime minister was also quick to dismiss any  notion that deep divisions were developing in the ODS over the  issue of local governance or the similarly controversial church-  and Jewish-restitution debates.    "We're simply looking for a point of view," he said. "That  doesn't mean we're dividing into factions according to who holds  what opinion."    Yet the local government issue has steadily grown in  importance as the fall local elections get closer and the  perception grows that the government is dragging its feet on  making a final decision.    Last July, Jezek was part of an ad-hoc commission that  studied the issue and drew up some proposals.    Since then, the government has failed to come out with a  single concrete point of view on the issue of land reform,  enforcing the opinion that it is opposed to sharing power with  localities. A very public debate has been waged over how many  regional administrative districts there should be, what powers  they should have and how many levels of government should exist  under central rule from Prague.    In Jezek, some believe the party is losing a credible voice  on these questions.    "Jezek was considered by people in the club as an expert who  understood this area," said Kozel.    Jiri Honajzer, ODS parliamentary chairman, said he told  Jezek  that instead of resigning over the issue, he should have stayed  on and tried to convince people of his ideas.    Instead, Honajzer said, Jezek was often away from  parliamentary club meetings because he was off talking with  local government experts and mayors.    "I think it's better to stay in the arena and convince  people," Honajzer said.    He pointed out that the only action the party can take  against a parliamentarian who votes against the majority on a  major issue is to send a letter to the member's constituents  alerting them to the fact. Honajzer said this measure has never  been used.    Despite these assertions, the ODS leadership's reaction to  Jezek's defection was to demand his resignation from parliament.  The day of his resignation, Jezek was called into a meeting of  the top parliamentary and Cabinet members.    After listening to his reasons for resigning, Klaus called  on  Jezek to resign his seat in parliament. This sparked a debate in  which some of those present argued that Jezek was fully within  his constitutional rights in resigning from the party and  following his own conscience in parliament.    Nothing came of the discussion, though, because the ODS  leadership lacks legal authority to force Jezek to resign his  seat.    Among Chamber of Deputies members on both sides, the  dominant  reaction to Jezek's leaving ODS was complete surprise.    Those who called for Jezek's resignation from parliament  cited what they said was the party's electoral platform in 1992,  in which a promise was made to the electorate that no deputy  elected under the ODS banner would switch sides or leave the  party.    For his part, Jezek said, he doesn't remember ever having  been informed of such a promise by the party.    "I didn't [make the loyalty vow] ever during the campaign,"  he said. "I don't have the least bad conscience that I've  cheated the voters or anyone else."</p>

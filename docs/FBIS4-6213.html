			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The demonstrations by workers in Medan, North  Sumatra, that degenerated into ugly riots should serve as a  lesson to all groups in the country. We all regret  demonstrations that deteriorate into destruction. The  uncontrolled demonstrations would have become more serious if  the security authorities had not acted swiftly to control them.    As reported in several newspapers, the workers in Medan and  the surrounding areas had endured difficulties since March. The  climax was reached last Friday when tens of thousands of workers  from several factories in the city held illegal demonstrations  because they thought they had been improperly treated by their  employers.    Dozens of shophouses in the North Sumatra provincial capital  were destroyed by rampaging mobs throwing stones and looting  property. One businessman was even reported to have met a  tragic death. The stampede spread to other places and was only  stopped when security authorities interfered.    The question now is who should be held responsible for the  events that degenerated into crime. The answer will certainly  emerge after authorities complete their thorough investigation.  Another question is whether there will be a repeat of these  ugly events in the future. We must also think of those who will  eventually suffer from the destruction in Medan and the stoppage  of economic activities, which will certainly have a nationwide  impact. The conclusion is that the Medan incident is highly  regretted and we do not want to see a recurrence of the incident.    As Asians who have undergone both pleasant and unpleasant  times since the colonial era, we are good at learning a lesson  from any unpleasant experience. In this connection, the  government, businessmen, and workers should work together  through existing channels and mechanisms. The rule of the game,  as stipulated in existing labor laws, government regulations,  ministerial decrees, and other labor regulations, is clear and  adequate. It now depends on how all sides understand,  implement, and put them into practice. All sides must admit that  the ugly incidents in Medan and other towns originated from  simple demands for an increase in workers' wages, a guarantee of  welfare services, and proper treatment by employers according to  existing regulations.    What is most important is how the government and businessmen  respond to such demands. As for workers, they should be  vigilant against possible interference by a third party wanting  to fish in troubled waters. A lack of response and delay in  seeking a solution will only make things more difficult. We do  not want to see a repeat of the case of Marsinah [woman labor  activist who was murdered in East Java] or the murder of another  businessman in Medan. This is especially important at a time  when we are still under the watchful eyes of foreign countries  which have placed our labor conditions under spotlight.  Meanwhile, the swift action by security authorities in coping  with any emergency anywhere within the country at any time  deserves our praise.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / International Company News: Rescue bids for La Cinq given 10-day deadline A 10-day deadline has been set for the rescue of La Cinq, the collapsed French television station which earlier this month filed for bankruptcy. Mr Hubert Lafont, who, as administrator of La Cinq, is trying to facilitate a rescue, yesterday announced that all potential rescue bids must be submitted by 6pm on Monday, February 3. So far the only potential rescuer to have stepped forward is Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media mogul who is one of the largest shareholders in La Cinq with 25 per cent. However, it is not certain that a plan spearheaded by Mr Berlusconi, a controversial figure whose Italian TV channels are notorious for showing soft pornography, would be acceptable to the French government. Mr Angelo Codigoni, who represents Mr Berlusconi's French interests, yesterday afternoon met with the Conseil Superieur de l'Audiovisuel, which regulates French television. The Berlusconi proposals are also being assessed by Hachette, the French media group which owns 25 per cent of La Cinq and ran the station before its collapse.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Oliver losses jump to Pounds 10.7m OLIVER GROUP, the shoe retailer which tried unsuccessfully to diversify just ahead of the recession, yesterday announced pre-tax losses sharply increased from Pounds 2.68m to Pounds 10.7m due to weakening sales, losses on disposals and re-organisation costs. The results were expected and followed a profits warning in January. The shares fell a further 4p to 55p, compared to last year's high of 126 1/2 p. Turnover fell to Pounds 84.9m (Pounds 98m) in the year to December 31 as consumer spending dried up. There was an trading loss of Pounds 2.95m (profit Pounds 3.48m) as costs continued to rise, mainly reflecting higher rent reviews. Mr Ian Oliver, chairman, said that last year was the most difficult in memory. He announced exceptional losses of Pounds 5.29m to cover falls in the value of some short-lease shops, losses on property sales and re-organisation costs. Losses per share emerged at 39.43p (earnings 9.54p). The company is not paying a final dividend, although the interim dividend was maintained at 1.07p. Last year's total was 5.82p. The picture framing division, acquired in 1989, continued to lose money and was sold last month. This incurred an extraordinary loss of Pounds 768,000 and took total losses for the year to Pounds 10.7m. The company defended its reserves by revaluing freehold and long leasehold properties, last valued in 1986. This led to a re-valuation surplus of Pounds 11.6m, which lifted shareholders' funds slightly to Pounds 42.3m (Pounds 41.7m). Oliver also announced that it had bought 21 units from the receiver of Tandem shoes. All these shops are forecast to trade profitably this year, the company said.</p>

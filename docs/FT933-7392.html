			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / The Long View: Money on big dipper MONEY IN Britain may soon begin to shrink in volume, normally a sign of economic depression. Should we (a) panic, (b) ignore the trend as irrelevant and distorted or (c) try somehow to massage the figures back into the government's target growth zone (now downgraded anyway into a weaselly 'monitoring range')? The clearing banks' half-year results season earlier this month featured a bounce-back in their profits as the bad debt problems eased, but also suggested underlying margin pressures as borrowers have become scarce. Net new sterling lending was no more than about Pounds 8.5bn during the first half of the year, and since some Pounds 4.5bn of that was by building societies the pickings for the clearing banks were thin indeed. These are topsy-turvy times. The Germans have been struggling to hold down the growth of broad money, which hit an annualised rate of 7.1 per cent for June; that was above the top of the Bundesbank's 4 1/2 -6 1/2 per cent target range. Yet monetary growth in the UK dipped to 3.3 per cent year-on-year, perilously close to the bottom of the Treasury's 3-9 per cent band. There is, however, money and money. The real sluggishness relates to the broadly-defined stuff, which includes a vast amount of savings deposits: private individuals, for instance, have about Pounds 250bn in interest-paying accounts in banks and building societies. But the volume of cash which actually directly lubricates day-to-day economic activity has begun to pick up, and seems to be growing at about 5 per cent a year. They have a long, technical word for the broad money problem: disintermediation. It happens when finance through banks is replaced by investment directly by the public. A perfect example will be the proposed flotation (minus Harrods) of the House of Fraser department stores chain, snatched by the Fayed brothers from under the nose of Lonrho's Tiny Rowland some 10 years ago. According to the apoplectic Rowland, the Sultan of Brunei's wealth was temporarily tapped to finance the deal, but the long-term finance came from Swiss, German, British and Japanese banks which put up capital for a private business in a classic 1980s debt financing exercise. But in this and many other cases the banks found that the lending proved riskier than they had expected. Thus in the past few years the takeover game has seriously slowed: spare a thought for the poor old City Takeover Panel, which complained in its annual report last month that it dealt with only 88 takeover proposals in 1992-93 against an annual average of 225: like the clearing banks the panel is having to reduce its staff. Next year House of Fraser is to be floated back on to the stock market from whence it came. Investors will raid their deposit accounts to pay for the shares, and some of the Fayeds' bank loans will be paid off. If M4 shrinks for this kind of reason, it is hard to see that there will be any adverse economic consequences. Indeed, there are reasons to believe that public companies will be run better than private businesses collapsing under the weight of indebtedness. Certainly, bank loan demand from the corporate sector is seriously weak. Industrial and commercial companies repaid bank loans in the first quarter of the year to the extent of over Pounds 5bn. This reflected their return to financial balance at the end of the recession, and their ability to tap the securities markets. Equity issues, for instance, raised more than Pounds 8bn in the first half-year. In this respect the UK is following the trend established last year in the US, and continued with a vengeance so far in 1993. Corporate bond issues there are heading for over Dollars 800bn this year, and equity underwritings are running ahead of last year's record Dollars 102bn. After the leveraging of corporate America during the late 1980s, when company equity was being bought back from the public at up to Dollars 125bn a year, net equity issuance is running at about Dollars 70bn annually. This sidelining of the banking system has led to a stagnation in the US money supply, with M2 up 1 per cent over the past year (a small drop in real terms). Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, has dismissed M2 as a distorted measure, and prefers to chase even more shadowy concepts, such as real interest rates. Does a falling money supply matter, in these circumstances? You can either argue that the weakness of the US monetary aggregates has not prevented an economic recovery, or that it is the explanation for the weakness of the upswing. At least the US is making good progress in cutting private sector indebtedness. In the UK the overhang of record levels of personal debt remains a problem which has hardly been tackled. Indeed, mortgage lending continues to show modest growth. Here is the puzzle, that while the Germans struggle to control monetary growth through high interest rates, low US rates have coincided with exceptional monetary weakness. The answer lies in time lags. The short-term consequence of high interest rates is a rise in deposits, until the economy slumps and loan demand collapses. The short-term consequence of low interest rates is a flight of savings from banks, and thus a monetary contraction, until eventually the economy expands vigorously under the influence of cheap money and the borrowers return in numbers. That will be a tricky period indeed for the Federal Reserve, and the prospect is viewed with apprehension by Wall Street. In these big dipper circumstances the monetarists prescribe that the monetary aggregates should be persuaded to grow steadily and smoothly. It might have to be done by financing the public sector deficit through the banks. But if the British banks grew too fat on excessive private sector indebtedness in the 1980s should they not now be allowed to grow thin? My preference is for (b) but I dare say that in due course the government will try (c) before resorting to (a).</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment stated that coverage under an OPA 90 vessel response plan should satisfy the requirements of &sect;151.26(b)(5), provided the list of agencies and contacts required in &sect;151.26(b)(6) are included for all of the vessel's operating areas. Another comment argued that combined shipboard oil pollution emergency plans and vessel response plans required by this part must be prepared in accordance with 33 CFR part 151. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment and maintains that Regulation 26 requirements should remain consistent with international standards. However, the OPA 90 vessel response plan allows for submission of a combined plan that includes information from both the vessel response plan and the shipboard oil pollution emergency plan, provided the single plan complies with both sets of requirements. A combined plan must be prepared in accordance with 33 CFR section 155.1030(j).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three comments recommended that the section requiring detailed information for specific areas should be required and not optional. Another comment suggested that the appendices should include detailed information for specific areas, including which resources to call and which countries will respond to an incident and which will not. The Coast Guard disagrees with these comments and will not require detailed information on specific areas. This information will remain optional in accordance with IMO guidelines. However, the Coast Guard encourages shipowners to voluntarily include this information to be better prepared in case of an oil spill emergency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Appendices. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Four comments argued that the requirement to list and inform ``all parties with a financial interest in the ship'' should be deleted. One comment suggested that the entire appendix be omitted because the responsibility for informing parties with a financial interest in the ship usually rests with management. Furthermore, they argue that the master should only be concerned with notifications and actions necessary to mitigate the emergency, not managing business that can be handled by the shoreside crisis management team. Another comment stated that the operator's staff should determine and make the necessary contacts in regard to insurance and salvage interests. One comment believes that the list required be limited to ship and cargo owners and insurers only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard has revised the language of the rule to be more consistent with IMO guidelines. However, the Coast Guard maintains its position that the plan should provide details of all parties with a ``financial interest'' in the ship who are to be advised in the event of an incident. The required information should be provided in the form of a contact list. The Coast Guard recognizes that in the event of a serious incident, ship's personnel will be fully engaged in saving life and taking steps to minimize the effects of the casualty. The comprehensive list of contacts may be maintained in the corporate office if so noted in the plan. While procedures may vary between companies it is important that the plan clearly specifies who will be responsible for informing the various interested parties such as cargo owners, insurers, and salvage interests. It is also essential that both the ship's plan and its shoreside plan are coordinated to guarantee that all parties having an interest are advised and to avoid duplication of reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

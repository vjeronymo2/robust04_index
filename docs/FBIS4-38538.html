			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report from Kazan by correspondent Andrey Murtazin, </F> including recording of remarks made to journalists by President  Boris Yeltsin; from the "Novosti" newscast]    [Excerpt] [Murtazin] [passage omitted] Replying to  questions from journalists, Boris Yeltsin noted that treaty  relations between the Tatarstan and the center are being  implemented. True, since the beginning of the year Kazan has  incurred a debt of 43 billion rubles, but this is mainly because  of mutual non-payments between enterprises.    [Yeltsin] We are living in accordance with the treaty. You  understand? In the treaty we have divided up the functions  between the state powers of Tatarstan and the Russian  Federation. Each has undertaken certain functions which it is  performing and for which it must be responsible, and for which  it must receive money. So sources are obtained from here and  from there. So it cannot be called subsidies. It is simply the  correct distribution of labor and finance. [passage omitted]</p>

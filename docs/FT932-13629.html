			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Pehr Gyllenhammar motors on at Volvo - Concessions and defiance at the Swedish carmaker's AGM MR PEHR Gyllenhammar, chairman of Swedish vehicle maker Volvo, threw out some notable concessions to small shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting in Gothenburg. But he offered little sign of retreat when it came to his own position at the lossmaking company and the strategies he is pursuing. Indeed, there were were flashes of flamboyance from the man who has been the driving force at Volvo for 22 years. Arriving for a press conference before the shareholders' meeting, he cut a dashing figure in a felt fedora hat. He cheekily told shareholders that the leaders of Aktiespararna, the Swedish shareholders' association which has pursued him recently, had themselves refused to reveal to their congress what remuneration they received - a revelation they were demanding of him. Mr Gyllenhammar then went into detail about the pay and benefits Volvo has paid him and other senior executives. He announced the Volvo board was setting up an audit committee and a committee on management development and remuneration, in line with the UK Cadbury report on corporate governance. Aktiespararna has said the report should serve as a model for Swedish companies. The Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, which prepared the so-called Cadbury report, concluded that the best practice was for executive directors' pay to be subject to the recommendations of a remuneration committee made up wholly or mainly of non-executive directors. Also, there should be full and clear disclosure of directors' total executive pay, including pension contributions and stock options. But Mr Gyllenhammar was less defensive on where Volvo is heading after a turbulent 1992. The company posted record losses last year of SKr4.75bn (Dollars 610m) and announced the closure of two of its three Swedish plants, with the loss of 11,000 jobs. The crisis at Volvo, Mr Gyllenhammar insisted, was 'partly a myth'. He said: 'It is more a crisis of Sweden than anything else and, because we have invested so much in our country, we have suffered. We have therefore been forced to a brutal adaptation to new realities.' He tackled head-on the two strategic questions troubling Volvo shareholders: the company's three-year-old alliance with Renault, the French car and truck maker; and what its plans are for Procordia, the Swedish food and drugs group in which Volvo, with 45 per cent of the voting rights, is the largest shareholder. Mr Gyllenhammar said Volvo did not intend to retreat from either relationship. He announced that he had held 'constructive' new discussions with Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, about Procordia, in which the state holds a 40.4 per cent stake. Last year, the government blocked Mr Gyllenhammar's attempt to merge Volvo and Procordia. Mr Gyllenhammar acknowledged concern that Renault, which owns 10 per cent of Volvo group and 25 per cent of the car company, might swallow its partner. He said the two companies would become 'ever more interwoven'. But he insisted there was no alternative to the alliance. There were few hints that, with his 58th birthday approaching next week, he was contemplating stepping down.</p>

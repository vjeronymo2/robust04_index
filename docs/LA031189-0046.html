			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORMER SERGEANT AWAITING TRIAL;  </P> <P> FIVE EX-GIS IMPLICATED IN PROBE OF EUROPE SPY CASE  </P> <P> Five retired American soldiers are under investigation in an expanding European  espionage case involving Clyde Lee Conrad, a former U.S. Army sergeant with  access to North Atlantic Treaty Organization secrets, officials confirmed  Friday.  </P> <P> The other soldiers' names could not be learned immediately. But the widening  number of suspects and reports that Conrad passed documents of a higher secrecy  classification than he possessed indicates that Conrad's case is more serious  than reported after his August arrest. Still, "it could have been a lot worse,"  a Pentagon official said.  </P> <P> Conrad, awaiting trial in West Germany on charges of selling NATO war plans,  was recruited to spy for the Hungarian Intelligence Service by Zoltan Szabo, a  Hungarian-born American soldier, officials said. All the information provided  by the alleged spies is presumed to have been passed on to Moscow.  </P> <P> A bizarre new aspect of the case is that Conrad, posing as a Hungarian  intelligence agent, was paid $100,000 by the CIA for information about an  alleged U.S. Army spy ring working for the Hungarians, officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Native of Ohio  </P> <P> The FBI, the chief U.S. agency now handling the case, refused to comment on it,  as did the Defense Department. West German authorities are handling most of the  investigation, a source said.  </P> <P> Conrad, a 42-year-old native of Sebring, Ohio, was arrested in August by West  Germany authorities. He had retired from the Army in 1985 after 20 years but  remained in West Germany where he had spent most of his career and had married  a West German woman.  </P> <P> In his last five years of service, Conrad had access to secret NATO contingency  plans for repelling a Soviet invasion and other information. He allegedly sold  it to the Hungarians for as much as $2 million.  </P> <P> He was arrested along with two Hungarians, Imre Kercsik, 34, and Sandor  Kercsik, 48. The Kercsik brothers, medical doctors living in Sweden, acted as  couriers for the ring throughout Western Europe. They were convicted in Sweden  last fall of espionage. Though they received relatively light sentences because  they were not spying against Sweden, the brothers did talk at length about  their activities, both to Swedish authorities and at their trial, U.S.  officials said.  </P> <P> Sandor Kercsik said that the espionage ring began with Szabo, whom he first met  in Vienna in 1967. He transmitted military secrets stolen by Szabo for several  years. Szabo introduced Kercsik to Conrad around 1974, before Szabo retired  from the military in the late 1970s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coded Messages, Drop Boxes  </P> <P> Szabo lived in Austria after retirement but since has fled to Hungary, where he  cannot be reached by American or West German authorities, officials confirmed.  </P> <P> Conrad, meanwhile, transmitted hundreds of documents through the Kercsiks in  more than a decade of espionage. The doctors used an elaborate system of coded  messages and drop boxes to move the stolen papers. When they were arrested,  code books and telecommunication equipment were found in their home.  </P> <P> Some documents reportedly deal with U.S. nuclear missiles and their bases,  pipeline supply systems and NATO troop strengths. Conrad had top-secret Army  clearance, so the papers of a higher classification that he transmitted  apparently came from the five other soldiers whom he recruited, officials  speculated.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Offer to Testify  </P> <P> The Kercsiks have identified pictures of some American soldiers and have  offered to visit the United States to testify against them, officials  confirmed. All the suspects reportedly live in the United States.  </P> <P> While Conrad worked for the Hungarians, officials said, he approached CIA  agents in the guise of a Hungarian intelligence officer, offering to provide  information on a U.S. Army spy ring selling documents to the Hungarians.  </P> <P> He received money for fictitious information, but paradoxically, the Hungarian  intelligence service learned of his brazen action and ordered the Kercsiks to  break off contact with him.  </P></p>

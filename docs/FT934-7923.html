			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Dawn of the new South Africa: Last-minute climbdown by De Klerk seals deal on constitution IT HAS BEEN one of the most extraordinary revolutions of modern times: a negotiated revolution, which was sealed last night when South African politicians put the final touches to a constitution to end 350 years of minority government and replace it with majority rule. After a dramatic last-minute capitulation, the ruling National party accepted a provision of the constitution which effectively strips the white minority of almost all entrenched powers in the proposed government of national unity. President F W de Klerk, who has promised since the day he took office that he would never allow majority domination to replace minority rule, clearly decided sometime on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning that voluntary power-sharing was the way to achieve this - not the kind of entrenched co-rule which his supporters have long been promised. National party ministers will serve in the new cabinet, in proportion to their share of the national vote in the April 27 elections; they may well control pivotal ministries such as finance. But when it comes to decision-making in cabinet, the president (likely to be Mr Nelson Mandela of the ANC) will ultimately decide. He will try first to seek consensus on his decisions 'in the spirit of national unity'; but when the chips are down, his will shall prevail, and the National Party will be powerless to stop him. Until late on Tuesday night, Mr de Klerk had been insisting that this would not be so: where consensus could not be reached in cabinet, a 2/3 vote would be required to pass certain important decisions (this might have allowed the National Party, with allies, blocking power). But in a late night meeting, Mr Mandela apparently insisted that the ANC would accept only a 50 per cent majority to break deadlocks - a figure they are almost certain to command - and Mr de Klerk decided instead to drop percentage voting altogether, in exchange for a commitment from Mr Mandela to a 'consensus-seeking spirit'. National Party negotiators defended this deal, which was struck by exhausted negotiators after weeks of almost sleepless nights. They acknowledge that their role in cabinet will depend on the goodwill of Mr Mandela, and repeatedly stress their reliance on the 'spirit of reconciliation' which has developed, especially over the past year, between politicians from opposing sides. They believe the National Party does not need entrenched constitutional provisions to play a powerful role in restraining the ANC: the ANC has assured Mr de Klerk that it does not wish to govern alone (and does not believe it could do so effectively); and he has accepted those assurances, bolstered by his party's substantial power base in the civil service and military, and in the electorate at large. It is a gamble, but one which is probably inevitable: as a minority government whose power diminishes by the day, negotiators clearly calculated that a deal done now would be preferable to that available next month or next year. Only time will tell whether they are right to prefer a voluntary arrangement to entrenchment of some powers for minorities; but precedents from the rest of Africa suggest that powerful ruling parties tend to abuse their power, unless forcefully prevented from so doing. Mr de Klerk promised last week that 'only the National Party can stand fast against the lust for power of the ANC'; that claim is substantially undermined by last night's agreement, which could further strain National Party support which stands at only 11 to 13 per cent in recent polls. One political commentator assessed the deal in this way: 'If the ANC believes the National Party are gatekeepers to white confidence, they'll stick to the deal. If not, they won't. At the end of the day it will depend on politics, not the rules.' Negotiators argued last night that this much weakened form of power-sharing is part of a larger package which provides other safeguards against the abuse of power: a bill of rights, a second chamber in the legislature which provides for regional representation, a guarantee that the government of national unity will remain in force for five years, and agreement that a final constitution (to replace the document now being finalised) must be passed by at least a 60 per cent majority. But overall, the National Party has settled well below its bottom line on checks and balances. The party's 1991 constitutional proposals called for political power to be divided between three tiers of government - central, regional and local - with each tier to have 'original and entrenched authority with which other tiers of government may not interfere'. In fact, central government retains wide powers to 'interfere' with regional governments: though the regions (to be called provinces) are to be granted primary responsibility for areas such as primary and secondary education, housing, health, policing, etc, central government reserves the right to intervene in these areas to impose uniform national standards, to ensure proper regulation, to protect the national economy or national security, and where there are implications for national economic policy; in short, the constitution authorises central government to intervene in terms so vague as seriously to undermine regional autonomy. And with regions barred from imposing taxes without central government approval, it is hard to accept Mr de Klerk's claim that the new state will be 'federal'. In the end, democracy in South Africa may well only be viable if the stakes attached to winning or losing an election are reduced, and that can only happen if losers continue to have a powerful say in government.</p>

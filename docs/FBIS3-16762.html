In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Filatov said that  public accord is achievable on the basis of the memorandum. He  expressed bewilderment over the attempts by some politicians to  set up a new political bloc, "Accord for Russia." The  participation of Constitutional Court member Valeriy Zorkin in  this bloc revives the dispute about his inappropriate political  activity which has already cost him his post of Constitutional  Court chairman.    "There cannot be two consensuses. There can be only one  consensus," Filatov said. Additionally, the idea proposed by  Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, Zorkin, former  vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy and others looks "militant."  "One has to dislike his nation particularly strong in order to  whip up fear in society," he added.    President Boris Yeltsin's senior adviser Georgiy Satarov  said  that a joint team of experts will hold a meeting on Wednesday to  discuss the memorandum. On Thursday, the text of the document  will be handed over to Yeltsin who is expected to return from  vacation by the end of the week. "The achievement of civic  accord is not a one- time process," he said. It is open to all  who want to join it, Satarov said.</p>

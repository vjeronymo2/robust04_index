Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> LARRY (BIG TWIST) NOLAN, 53, DIES  </P> <P> Larry (Big Twist) Nolan, a mountainous rhythm and blues singer who described  himself in a lyric as "300 pounds of heavenly joy," has died at age 53.  </P> <P> Nolan, whose nickname came from a rumored songwriting credit for the  dance-inspiring song "The Twist," played concerts for two decades throughout  the United States and Canada with his band, "Big Twist and the Mellow Fellows."  </P> <P> He died of heart failure Wednesday after the band returned to their home base  here from a weekend gig in Aspen, Colo., said Alligator Records President Bruce  Iglauer, who produced two of Nolan's four albums.  </P> <P> "He was one of the great musical personalities in rhythm and blues," Iglauer  said of the falsetto-voiced singer. "He built this guy, this persona, of a  superconfident guy in a white suit. He really was 300 pounds of heavenly joy."  </P> <P> Nolan, who was born in Terre Haute, Ind., and grew up in southern Illinois,  left a wife and seven children.  </P></p>

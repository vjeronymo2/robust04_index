			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Italian milk row could disrupt Corfu summit The row over the way Italy exceeds its EU milk production quota threatens to disrupt the Corfu summit of EU leaders which begins tomorrow and jeopardise the agreement reached at the 1992 Edinburgh summit to increase the EU revenue base from next year. After three days meeting in Luxembourg, agriculture ministers of the 12 looked unable to resolve the controversy. 'I can't see that it's going to be done except at Corfu,' a European Commission official said. Ministers at the meeting said Italy's delegation appeared to be under instructions from prime minister Silvio Berlusconi to stick to its guns. The ramifications of the conflict are wide. After former prime minister Giulio Andreotti startled his partners by forcing milk on to the Lisbon summit agenda two years ago, Rome agreed to cut its excess output in exchange for a quota increase tonnes. But in March, Brussels said Italy had not cut enough. Italy then produced new figures saying its output had all along been overestimated. The UK meanwhile had taken the Commission to the European Court, because it had reduced the fine for excess output by Italy, and to a lesser extent Greece and Spain, from Ecu3.2bn to Ecu1.3bn (Pounds 1bn). Mr Berlusconi wants the case dropped, and the new quota arrangements made retroactive to take account of the revised output figures. This would wipe out a large part of the fine, a move Germany opposes, saying it would cost its taxpayers Ecu800m. But Italy says that unless it gets satisfaction, it will not ratify the Edinburgh agreement on revenue, necessary to increase flows of regional aid from next year. Senior officials from Germany and the UK - the two largest contributors to the EU budget - hint that this would not make them unhappy. But it would be 'a bit of a mess', as a British official understated it. The EU would be unable to agree a budget for 1995. The row could also affect ratification in other countries, notably the Netherlands, set to become the largest net contributor to the EU budget on a per capita basis. Officials in Brussels and at Luxembourg are speculating that Mr Berlusconi may have reached a deal with Chancellor Helmut Kohl at their recent meeting. This would include milk, Italian backing for Belgian prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as Commission president, and German efforts to mobilise the EU behind an Italian candidate - former trade minister Renato Ruggiero - to head the new World Trade Organisation. That would still leave the British court case to be resolved. But senior EU diplomats note that the UK is anxious to cement an alliance with the more Eurosceptical Berlusconi government.</p>

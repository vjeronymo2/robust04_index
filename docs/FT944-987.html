			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Brierley lifts Air NZ stake Brierley Investments, the hotels and investment group, is to buy Japan Airlines' 5 per cent stake in Air New Zealand for NZDollars 101.7m (USDollars 64.8m), Reuter reports from Wellington. The purchase of 22m B shares, at NZDollars 4.55 a share, takes Brierley's total stake to in Air New Zealand to 42.5 per cent. However, analysts believe that the move is opportunistic rather than strategic. The A shares, which cannot be held by foreigners, traded on Wednesday at NZDollars 3.50, off their year's high of NZDollars 4.10. The B shares, which can be held overseas, last traded at NZDollars 4.50 a share, down from a year's high of NZDollars 5.90. Air NZ said the departure of JAL from the share registry was amicable.</p>

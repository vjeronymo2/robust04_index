			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / FT Law Report: Secret recording not a document ITALIA EXPRESS Court of Appeal (Lord Donaldson, Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Balcombe and Lord Justice Staughton): December 20 1991 STATEMENTS recorded surreptitiously on tapes without the speaker's knowledge or intention are made orally, not in a document, and are therefore not admissible in civil proceedings unless proved by direct oral evidence by the person who made the statements, or by someone who heard them made. But a statement recorded with the speaker's knowledge and intention is made in a document as well as orally and is therefore admissible as an out of court statement, subject to production and proof of the tapes or copies by direct oral evidence or by a second out of court statement as to how they were made. The Court of Appeal so held when allowing in part an appeal from a decision of Mr Justice Hirst (FT, December 20 1991) refusing to admit taped conversations as evidence for the defendant representative underwriter, Mr Trevor Rex Mountain, in an action by the plaintiff, Mr Apostolos Konstantine Ventouris. Before the judgments on the appeal were handed down, the underwriters withdrew the allegations against Mr Ventouris which had formed the background of the appeal. The Master of the Rolls said the judgments should be read in the light of that withdrawal as far as Mr Ventouris's reputation was concerned, but it had no other effect on the judgments. LORD DONALDSON MR said Italia Express was sunk by explosives while undergoing repairs at Drapetsona outside Piraeus harbour. Mr Ventouris owned the vessel. He claimed under a war risks insurance policy. The defence was that the loss was caused by his wilful misconduct. The underwriters alleged that in January 1988 a plot was hatched between Mr Ventouris and his cousin, George Dimitrios Ventouris (GDV), whereby in return for a very substantial payment GDV was to recruit divers to blow up the vessel. The enterprise was abandoned on February 13 1988. It was alleged that Mr Ventouris then engaged divers himself, without involving GDV, and that they achieved the desired objective five weeks later. The underwriters wished to prove the original conspiracy between GDV and Mr Ventouris by surreptitious tape recordings of conversations between those alleged to have been involved, including the divers. The tapes had been provided by GDV who featured in all the conversations. He was unable to come to the UK to give evidence, being on bail in Greece on terms which precluded his leaving the country. Section 1 of the Civil Evidence Act 1968 provided that hearsay evidence was admissible in civil proceedings only by virtue of the Act and other statutory provisions, or by agreement. Section 2 provided for admissibility of out of court statements made orally or in a document as evidence of facts stated therein. Section 2(3) provided that where a statement 'made otherwise than in a document' was admissible by virtue of section 2, no evidence other than direct oral evidence by the person who made the statement or who heard or perceived it being made, was admissible for the purpose of proving it. By section 4 a statement contained in a document was admissible if the document formed part of a record compiled by a person acting under a duty. By section 10(1) a 'document' included any 'tape . . . or other device in which sounds . . . are embodied'. The underwriters sought to introduce the tapes or copies in evidence as 'out of court statements' and to verify and explain them by written 'out of court statements' by GDV and others. The first question was whether the tapes were admissible as evidence of facts stated by the interlocutors other than GDV. That depended on whether the statements were made 'orally', or 'in a document' or both. The answer must depend on what the maker of the statement thought he was doing and intended to do. The statute looked at the matter from the point of view of the maker of the statement, not from that of his audience. It was assumed that the interlocutors, other than GDV, were wholly unaware that their statements were being taped. It followed that the tape was GDV's record of the conversations. The other interlocutors were intending to make and were making statements orally, not in a document. That conclusion differed from that of Mr Justice Hirst, who regarded the statements as having been made in a document. In the light of that conclusion, section 2(3) applied and the statements recorded on the tapes could only be proved by direct oral evidence by the person who made each statement, or someone who heard them made. Those conditions could not be met and accordingly the tapes were not admissible as evidence of the facts stated by the interlocutors other than GDV. The second question was whether the tapes were admissible as evidence of facts stated by GDV. Here there was a vital difference. GDV knew the conversations were being taped. So far as his own statements were concerned, GDV was quite deliberately making simultaneous statements both orally and in a document. Subject to production and proof of the tapes or authenticated copies, the statements made by GDV would be admissible as evidence of the facts so stated. The statements of the other interlocutors would not be evidence of facts thereby stated but, in so far as they provided the context in which GDV's statements were made, would be evidence of that context. The third question was whether an out of court statement could be proved by another out of court statement. There was no reason why not - though direct oral evidence was always preferable and had greater weight. Section 2 was designed to render out of court statements admissible as evidence of the facts stated therein. Here the maker of the second out of court statement was stating facts concerning the making of the first out of court statement, not about the truth of anything therein contained. Mr Justice Hirst held that was not permissible. He relied on Cross on Evidence 7th ed 541-2 which stated that a principal object of the 1968 Act was to ensure that all first-hand hearsay statements were admissible, provided certain conditions were fulfilled; and to allow second-hand hearsay to be received if contained in a record. Cross said 'first-hand' meant a statement proved by the maker's direct oral evidence or by production of the document in which he made it, or by direct oral evidence of a witness who heard him make it; and 'second-hand' included all hearsay statements which were not first-hand. Mr Justice Hirst concluded it was fundamental to section 2 that the statement, whether oral or in a document, should be first-hand. He said it would be highly anomalous if the section 2(3) principle for oral statements, did not apply to documentary statements. There was no trace in the wording of the Act of Professor Cross's distinction between first-hand and second-hand hearsay except in section 2(3), where restrictions were imposed on the way in which second-hand hearsay could be adduced if the underlying first-hand hearsay was contained in a statement made orally. That pointed strongly to the policy of the Act being to permit second-hand hearsay in all other cases. The rationale for that limited restriction was no doubt that evidence of a statement made orally was inherently more unreliable than evidence of one made in a document. The fourth question was whether the tapes were admissible under section 4 as forming part of a record compiled by a person acting under a duty. In February 1989 GDV appeared before an investigating judge in Greece and deposited nine tapes with the judge. At the same time he made a statement under oath, identifying the interlocutors involved in the recorded conversations. As Mr Justice Hirst pointed out, section 4 only provided for admissibility of the record itself, not for admissibility of information tendered to the recorder who did not include it in his record. The appeal was allowed to the extent indicated. Their Lordships gave concurring judgments. For the underwriters: Christopher Clarke QC and Andrew Popplewell (Ince &amp; Co) For Mr Ventouris: Stephen Tomlinson QC and Stephen Hofmeyr (Hill Taylor Dickinson)</p>

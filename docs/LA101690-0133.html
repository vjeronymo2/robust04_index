			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> 'MISSING' WOMAN CONTACTS POLICE  </P> <P> A 20-year-old woman reported missing more than two weeks ago recently notified  police that she is safe and living with a family in Los Angeles County,  authorities said Monday.  </P> <P> Tufa Petelo arrived at the Anaheim Police Station on Friday and told officers  that she left home Sept. 26 after receiving a severe beating from the woman who  reported her disappearance, Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said.  </P> <P> Petelo informed police of her whereabouts when she heard that they were  conducting an extensive missing-person search but declined to press charges in  the alleged beating, Hedgpeth said.  </P> <P> "We have confirmed that she was beaten severely on Sept. 25 or 26 by the same  person who reported her missing," Hedgpeth said. "This caused (Petelo) to run  away. In her mind, she left for her own safety."  </P> <P> Futatia Tausili, 48, the Anaheim woman who reported Petelo missing, originally  told police that she is Petelo's aunt. Police have since confirmed that the two  women are not related. Tausili could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> A police investigation revealed that Tausili was named two years ago in a  felony assault case involving Petelo in a neighboring city, Hedgpeth said. He  would not name the city or provide further details on that incident.  </P> <P> Petelo, who police said is mentally disabled, was apparently sent by her  parents in Samoa to live with Tausili.

			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURNS WINS BY 2 STROKES; CSUN 3RD  </P> <P> Bob Burns of Cal State Northridge held on Friday to post a two-stroke victory  in the NCAA Division II golf championships at Loxahatchee Country Club.  </P> <P> Burns, who opened a six-stroke lead after Thursday's play, was the only player  to match par on the 6,850-yard, Jack Nicklaus-designed course, earning medalist  honors at 288 after a final-round three-over-par 75 Friday.  </P> <P> His teammates were not as fortunate. The Matadors shot a closing 300 for 1,198  and slipped from a second-place tie to third in the 17-team field. As expected,  Florida Southern rolled to its fifth title in the past 10 years, posting a  one-under 287 for 1,170 and a 26-stroke victory.  </P> <P> All five Florida Southern players placed among the top 10. Columbus College of  Georgia, the 1989 champion, closed fast with a 294 and took second at 1,196.  </P> <P> Diego Ventureira, a native of Buenos Aires, shot 70 and finished second, two  strokes behind Burns at 290.  </P> <P> "We knew it would be difficult to get the (team) victory," said Northridge  Coach Jim Bracken, "but it's disappointing that we didn't stay in second place.  . . . Our guys played hard all week, and our hats are off to Florida Southern."  </P> <P> Burns' victory was the third in Northridge's history. Corky Bassler shared the  title with Mike Spang of Portland State in 1969 and Vic Wilk won outright in  1982.  </P> <P> Northridge, which won Division II team titles in 1969, 1973 and 1974, will play  in Division I next season.  </P> <P> Burns, who missed only 10 greens in 72 holes, did not make a birdie Friday.  </P> <P> "I wasn't scrambling," the junior from Granada Hills said. "I just didn't make  any putts. I heard at the 16th green that I had a three-shot lead and I just  tried to par in."  </P> <P> Other results for Northridge on Friday: Sang Hyun, 73-303; Jeff Sanday, 79-304;  and Corby Segal and Wayne Merich, each 76-312.  </P></p>

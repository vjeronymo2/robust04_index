			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Birmingham Midshires buys Pounds 550m mortgages Birmingham Midshires, the UK's 13th largest building society, has acquired the Pounds 550m UK residential mortgage business of the UK subsidiary of Credit Agricole, the French mutually-owned bank. The purchase is more than three times larger than any of Birmingham Midshires' mortgage book acquisitions to date and is a further example of the departure from the UK market of the centralised lending subsidiaries of overseas groups. It represents more than 10 per cent of the society's assets, taking them to just over Pounds 5bn. The society would not disclose the price, which is thought to be less than Pounds 20m. The Credit Agricole business is administered from Richmond, Surrey. Staff based there will continue with the day-to-day management of its 11,000 customers for the time being. Birmingham Midshires said, however, that in the longer term management of the business would be integrated with that of the other mortgage books it has acquired and managed from its Wolverhampton office. Credit Agricole Personal Finance said yesterday that the decision to sell had been strategic. The company considered a customer relationship limited to mortgages alone to be insufficient in the UK. Credit Agricole is the largest bank in France with total assets of FFr1.67bn (Pounds 199m). In a similar move, Banque Nationale de Paris is leaving the UK market: further progress of the sale of its outstanding mortgages of Pounds 1.5bn to Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, is expected to be announced later this month. In a generally flat UK mortgage market, where margins are low, acquisition of mortgage books and businesses is a popular way for mainstream lenders to gain market share. Last week Abbey National, the mortgage lender and banking group, announced that it was buying Household Mortgage Corporation, the UK's largest centralised lender with about Pounds 1.6bn in outstanding mortgages, in an agreed cash offer of Pounds 56.3m. Centralised lenders sell through intermediaries rather than through branches, so for the purchaser there is the prospect of growth without the task of reconciling two branch networks. Many centralised lenders entered the UK housing market in the boom years of the 1980s and have found conditions much more difficult since. Where they are owned by foreign banks, the UK is often seen as no longer a core area of business.</p>

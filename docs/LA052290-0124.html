			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHARE REAPS BENEFITS OF ANNUAL BOOMTOWN  </P> <P> For 36 years SHARE (Share Happily and Reap Endlessly) has thrown its  Western-themed Boomtown party -- a chance to leave the gowns and jewels in the  vault and drag out the denim and leather. (This being Los Angeles, much of the  denim and leather costs more than the usual silks and sequins.)  </P> <P> This year's event, held Saturday night at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium,  featured a raffle and auction with Marjoe Gortner at the mike enthusiastically  conjuring up memories of his child evangelist days as he squeezed bids from the  party-goers. "Say hallelujah!" he screamed at the crowd. "We're going to have a  good time tonight because I feel the spirit!" His exhortations brought top bids  for unusual merchandise, like dinner for 50, prepared by Wolfgang Puck -- which  went for $22,000.  </P> <P> The SHARE women were dressed in identical black suede dresses with silver  buckles. Ann Miller wore red suede and a gold lame shirt; Marvin Davis wore a  brown bomber jacket. Also there: Ed Begley Jr. and Camilla Sparv, Milton Berle,  Tom Bosley, Bruce Boxleitner, Stephen J. Cannell, Jackie Collins, Barbara and  Marvin Davis, Suzanne de Passe, Kirk Douglas, Freddie Fields, Budd Friedman,  Ava and Chuck Fries, Constance Towers and John Gavin, David Horowitz, Quincy  Jones, David Nelson, Madlyn Rhue, Ann Jeffreys and Cesar Romero, Jaclyn Smith,  Candy and Aaron Spelling, Rosemarie and Robert Stack, Loretta Swit and Cristina  Ferrare and Tony Thomopoulos.  </P> <P> The auction was followed by a dinner party chaired by Sandra Scully, and a  revue chaired by Abbe Lane Leff, who assembled singers Wayne Newton, Marilyn  McCoo and Clint Holmes, as well as the children's group Universal Dance  Theater.  </P></p>

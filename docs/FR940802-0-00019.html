			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In an attempt to address the role of ethanol, the Agency subsequently proposed a renewable oxygenate program (ROP) (58 FR 11722, February 26, 1993) to provide incentives for the use of ethanol and other renewable oxygenates in reformulated gasoline. The objective of the ROP was to provide incentives for the use of renewable oxygenates in the reformulated gasoline program in the summer while maintaining the overall environmental benefits of the program. Ethanol was considered a renewable oxygenate because it is produced primarily from agricultural sources such as corn, which can be regenerated. Other oxygenates such as MTBE are produced primarily from nonrenewable resources, such as petroleum and/or natural gas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a variety of reasons, as explained in section II of the preamble and section I of the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the reformulated gasoline final rule, EPA decided not to promulgate the ROP. First, EPA received comments from virtually all constituencies affected by the rulemaking, including the ethanol industry, stating that the ROP as proposed was neither feasible nor workable. While EPA believed that a feasible program could be structured, EPA also acknowledged that it could represent a considerable burden on the industry. Second, the ROP would have reduced the RFG program's VOC emission control benefits because it provided an incentive for the use during the summer months of an oxygenate which exhibited commingling-related emission increases. (Combining ethanol blends and non-ethanol blends in consumer fuel tanks, even if both have identical low RVPs, results in a mixture with significantly higher fuel volatility and hence significantly higher VOC emissions. This effect is referred to as commingling.) The commingling effect, along with other unique distillation effects of ethanol on evaporative emissions and other provisions of the ROP as proposed, were estimated in the RIA for the RFG final rule to result in approximately a 6.0&hyph;7.5 percent increase in VOC emissions compared to an RFG program without such incentives. While difficult to estimate due to uncertainty in future ethanol and ETBE market shares and lack of sufficient data to reliably quantify the distillation effects, such an increase in VOC emissions amounts to a loss of about 40 to 50 percent of the minimum VOC control that is required under section 211(k)(3) for reformulated gasoline during the summer, even though the average RVP of the RFG produced by refiners remained the same. Thus, EPA's analysis indicated that the proposal would not maintain the environmental benefits of reformulated gasoline. A third concern with the ROP was that the program would have created an incentive for the use of renewables but in no way assured their use. Upon consideration of these and other factors, the Agency decided not to finalize the ROP. Other options considered did not resolve the concerns raised with the ROP as proposed. (The reader is referred to section II of the Preamble and section I of the RIA for the reformulated gasoline final rule for a description of the options and alternatives to the ROP considered.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hence, the final rule for reformulated gasoline does not include provisions to provide incentives for the use of renewable oxygenates. This left substantial uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the role renewable oxygenates would play in the roughly 35 percent of the U.S. gasoline market expected to be covered by the RFG program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Renewable Oxygenate Requirement Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To address the issues discussed above, at the same time EPA issued the final rules for RFG, it also proposed (58 FR 68343) a year-round requirement that 30 percent of the mandatory oxygen content specification for reformulated gasoline be obtained from renewable oxygenates. To ensure that the ozone benefits from the reformulated gasoline program are not adversely affected by that requirement, EPA proposed that during the VOC control period (i.e., the summer months) only renewable oxygenates that do not exhibit volatility-related commingling effects when mixed with gasoline would receive renewable oxygenate credit. All approved renewable oxygenates, including ethanol, were expected to be acceptable during the non-summer months when commingling-related volatility increases have relatively little effect on VOC emissions and when ozone exceedances are rare. Also included in the proposal were provisions for averaging and credit trading in order to provide maximum flexibility to refiners and fuel importers in complying with the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA presented several justifications for proposing a renewable oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline. The Agency concluded that expanding the use of renewable fuels produced from resources such as corn, grain, wood, organic waste products, and municipal solid waste could help cut dependence on foreign oil and reduce primary energy use by 20% or more as compared to nonrenewable oxygenates. The Agency also believed that renewable oxygenates offered potential air quality advantages (such as lower emissions of VOCs and greenhouse gases) as well as jobs-creation benefits. The Agency also stated its belief that the 30 percent requirement for renewable oxygenates was an appropriate level to ensure that renewables were not excluded from the reformulated gasoline oxygenate market while allowing the remaining 70 percent of the market to be open to all fuels, regardless of their renewables content.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

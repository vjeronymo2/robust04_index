			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIGHT RAIN CREATES HAVOC ON FREEWAYS  </P> <P> A misty shower extended its gentle embrace over the Los Angeles area Monday,  slowing traffic to a crawl, causing scores of accidents and bringing wind gusts  to canyons and deserts.  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol said its officers were "extremely busy" with  between 75 and 100 accidents -- about twice as many as normal -- on area  freeways by early evening.  </P> <P> "There haven't been any fatalities, but there have been several with injuries,"  said CHP Officer Harold Daily. "Almost all of the freeways are affected.  Traffic has been either stopped, or it has slowed below 30 m.p.h."  </P> <P> As badly as Southern California needs rain, forecasters said Monday's drizzle  would amount to no more than two-tenths of an inch -- hardly enough to proclaim  an end to the drought.  </P> <P> Some showers will persist through this afternoon before skies begin clearing,  said Steve Burback, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides  forecasts for The Times.  </P> <P> For all the havoc the rains played with Southland freeways, winds threatened to  compound motorists' misery with gusts ranging from 30 m.p.h. to 45 m.p.h. in  canyons and below mountain passes.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service issued a wind advisory for Monday night and today  in the upper deserts, where gusts are expected to reach 35 m.p.h. with some  blowing dust and sand.  </P> <P> Visibility will be as low as 200 to 300 feet on occasion, and drivers on  Interstate 15 to Las Vegas or Interstate 40 to Needles should use caution  because the winds will affect both highways, the Weather Service said.  </P> <P> Monday's rain, which began about 1 p.m., came compliments of a cold front  sweeping down from Central California and a developing storm system in the  upper atmosphere, Burback said.  </P> <P> As the showers move east today, a warming trend will begin, he said.  </P></p>

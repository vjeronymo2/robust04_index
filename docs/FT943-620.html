			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: ICG meets flotation forecasts with Pounds 9.7m Intermediate Capital Group, the specialist lender of mezzanine finance, reported first-half pre-tax profits up 60 per cent at Pounds 9.7m, in line with expectations at the time it floated in June. Earnings per share were 13.8p, up 59 per cent on the pro forma figures for the six months to July 31 1993. Mr James Odgers, managing director, said the companies in which ICG had invested were performing strongly. The group had made Pounds 50m of new loans in the first half in the UK, France, Italy and Sweden. Some Pounds 36.5m of these loans were on ICG's own balance sheet with the balance taken up by clients for whom the group is managing funds. After loan repayments, there was a net increase in lending of 7 per cent. ICG lends to unquoted companies and takes an equity stake or right to an equity option. It receives net interest and dividends, which it describes as its core income, and which in the first half rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 4.5m. It also realises some of the capital gains it makes on shares in investments that float. Profits from this were Pounds 5.5m from five flotations and one trade sale. ICG said the rate of increase in profits was beneficially affected by the high level of capital gains and was not representative of the increase likely for the full year. ICG's share price has hardly moved from its flotation price of 225p. 'This is not a stock for the short term or the unsophisticated,' said Mr Odgers. 'We think we had a very good start and are gradually talking to our investor base - but the passage of time is as important as talk.' A 3.75p dividend is declared.</p>

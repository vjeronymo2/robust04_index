			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Texas voters rebuff Democrats MRS Kay Bailey Hutchison, Texas's Republican state treasurer, won a landslide victory in a by-election on Saturday for one of the state's national senators. Her election will narrow President Bill Clinton's already shaky Democratic majority in Congress and perhaps decisively mark the big south-western state's move away from its Democratic party traditions and into the Republican camp. Mrs Hutchison won by a two-to-one margin over the Democrats' Bob Krueger, who was appointed as interim senator when Mr Lloyd Bentsen left his seat to join the Clinton administration as Treasury secretary. Senator Robert Dole, leader of the Republicans in the Senate, said the vote would send shock waves through Washington and warn members of Congress against voting for higher taxes. The Democrats now have a notional 56:44 majority in the Senate, but with questionable friends such as Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama or Senator David Boren of Oklahoma Mr Clinton must in fact work with a narrower margin in seeking to win passage for his legislative agenda. If other senators do indeed read the vote as a message against taxes, it could make it harder to push through the Clinton budget package, including the controversial energy tax which is stalled in the Senate. Mr Clinton insisted after a strategy meeting with top advisers yesterday that he would 'stick to the basic principles of the plan,' but he has given Mr Bentsen some leeway to negotiate modifications with his former colleagues on the Senate finance committee. The administration remains committed to the energy tax, but officials say they are willing to reduce its impact by as much as 30 per cent. In one respect Mr Krueger's defeat could make it easier for the president to meet demands for deeper cuts in government spending while demonstrating some of the toughness that his supporters wish he would show his opponents: Senator Daniel Moynihan, Mr Bentsen's successor as chairman of the finance committee, said yesterday that if Texas voters wanted spending cuts rather than tax increases it would be easy to start on two big Texas projects, the superconducting supercollider, a costly science project under construction at Waxahachie, and the space station, for which Nasa is due to present its new designs this week.</p>

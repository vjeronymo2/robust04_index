			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Letter: Special interest lobbies given too much weight in trade talks Sir, It is interesting to read from your articles (World Trade News, December 11 and 15) that 'consumer, citizen and environmental groups' have been protesting about the Uruguay Round and the prospects for a Multilateral Trade Organisation. We, too, have been critical of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations, but for precisely the opposite reason to that given in your report - because there has been far too much foot-dragging and far too much weight given to protectionist special interest lobbies. A number of question marks remain over the detailed operation of any future MTO but these are completely dwarfed by the issues of the Gatt round as a whole. Consumers have everything to fear from a collapse of Gatt negotiations, and everything to gain from their success, which should help to bring about increased competition, choice and value for money in most product markets, as well as hopes for an earlier end to the world recession. Consumers' organisations in the UK are joined in this view by many counterparts overseas, under the umbrella of the International Organisation of Consumer Unions which represents 170 consumer organisations in more than 60 countries. The Gatt will not solve everything - big issues to be dealt with once the round is complete will include the link between trade and environmental policy, and the development of worldwide rules for competition policy. But the trade war that would follow any failure to complete the Gatt would obscure, rather than enlighten, these fundamental issues and ensure that they never get tackled.

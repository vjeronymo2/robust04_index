			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Strike disrupts mail service THE POSTAL service in Cardiff was seriously disrupted last night after 900 workers went on indefinite strike over new working arrangements. About 5,000 bags of mail were lying unsorted at Royal Mail's Penarth Road headquarters as managers sealed about 2,500 post boxes in the city and outlying districts. The decision to extend an earlier 24-hour stoppage came after a meeting called by the Union of Communication Workers. The union says a system of fixed shift patterns would force many postal staff to work unsocial hours permanently. Mr Steve Bell, the union's Cardiff branch secretary, said: 'These new working hours would have a disastrous effect on the social lives of many of our members.' Managers said the sides had been close to agreement before talks were broken off and that more than 75 per cent of staff in south Wales and the south-west were working the new system.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / TV advertising limit raised The Independent Television Commission has decided that television advertising sales houses will be allowed to sell airtime for TV companies up to a limit of 25 per cent of UK television advertising revenue. The current limit, set more than three years ago, is 25 per cent of ITV revenue. The liberalisation follows the line adopted by the Office of Fair Trading when it considered the advertising sales implications of the recent spate of ITV takeovers. The takeovers were not to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission as long as by August 1995 none of the sales houses accounted for more than 25 per cent of total television advertising sales. Mr Frank Willis, ITC director of advertising and sponsorship, said yesterday that action was being taken because 'we are conscious that Pounds 2bn of business will be done between now and August 1995. We have a regulatory responsibility and believe that people should not feel they can do what they like between now and 1995'.</p>

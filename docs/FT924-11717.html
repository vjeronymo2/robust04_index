			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Rover returns to five-day working ROVER, the UK carmaker, is returning car production to a five-day week at its assembly plant at Longbridge, Birmingham, after two months of short-time working. The move is in contrast to action taken this week by Ford, the leading UK vehicle maker, which plans to work only a 2 1/2 -day week for most of November at its plant in Dagenham, east London. Rover said it would resume five-day working on its Rover 200/400 assembly line in the week beginning November 2 with output rising to 4,500 a week from the 3,840 implemented in early September. Rover is also resuming five-day working on its Metro and Mini assembly lines at Longbridge, which had been cut to only three-day working in mid August. Metro output will be raised to 1,900 a week from 1,560, while production of the Mini will rise from 300 to 500 a week. Alvis Industries of Coventry, best known for its armoured vehicles, announced 230 redundancies yesterday - about 30 per cent of its workforce. The company, which already cut 100 jobs a year ago, laid the main blame on reduced spare parts orders from the Ministry of Defence. The company belonged to British Leyland until it was sold to United Scientific Holdings in 1981.</p>

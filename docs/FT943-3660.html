			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Prevention rather than painful cure: The UK interest rate rise shows the government sees political gain in controlling inflation The scene was probably unique in Britain's post-war history. Yesterday morning a supremely confident - some might say ebullient - Chancellor Kenneth Clarke called the press into the Treasury to hear him explain an increase in UK interest rates. Under past Tory chancellors, such moves were usually made in response to financial market crises and associated with policy failure. Mr Clarke was unabashed in presenting it as a sensible step towards securing the economic recovery and expanding employment. Although some increase in UK borrowing costs had been widely expected for some time, the significance of Mr Clarke's move should not be underestimated. Yesterday's rise of half a percentage point in bank base rates to 5.75 per cent is the first increase in officially inspired lending rates for nearly five years. As the last Tory chancellor to begin raising rates after a period of falling borrowing costs - Mr Nigel (now Lord) Lawson) - was forced to keep ratcheting rates upwards to 15 per cent, it would be unnatural if Mr Clarke's decision did not stir troubling folk memories in the Conservative party and the nation at large. But the reason that Mr Clarke appeared so cheery as he fielded questions yesterday was that he hopes and believes his move will spare him the agonies suffered by Mr Lawson between May 1988 and October 1989 when base rates soared from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent. The smiles on the faces of Treasury officials - and across town among senior Bank of England staff - show that his advisers think he could be right. To an important extent Mr Clarke has grabbed the policy initiative and further defined his chancellorship. We knew that he always said he was opposed to inflation. We knew that he was prepared to be tough on fiscal policy, not hesitating to push up taxes last November. Yesterday, he reinforced his reputation for fiscal prudence by explicitly ruling out tax cuts in his forthcoming Budget on November 29. But there were doubts about whether this self-styled son of the industrial Midlands understood the need for timely and hard decisions on monetary policy, not least because of his insistence last February on a base rate cut when Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, and most of his officials in the Treasury were opposed. Yesterday, Mr Clarke showed he will take potentially unpopular action based on a medium-term view of the economy when current indicators of inflation are subdued. Underlying inflation, as measured by the retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments, was just 2.2 per cent in July. This was its lowest level for 27 years - and in the lower half of the 1-4 per cent target band, where the government is committed to having inflation by the end of this parliament. The strategy is not without risks. Mr Clarke admitted that the decision to raise rates - taken finally at lunch time last Friday - was 'finely judged'. When Mr Clarke and Mr George held the first of their monthly monetary meetings after the summer break last Wednesday they agreed that the economy was 'poised' for an interest rate increase, but still had some doubts over whether to act straight away or after their next meeting at the end of this month. The final decision came after a two-day pause for reflection. While the two men agreed that inflation is currently very low, they noted that some indicators - such as commodity prices, manufacturers' input prices and CBI surveys of corporate pricing intentions - suggested that cost and price pressures had begun to pick up. Monetary indicators were mixed, although continued strong growth of M0, the narrow measure of notes and coins in circulation, continued to be a worry. Principal among the factors persuading the two to raise rates was evidence of stronger than expected growth in the first half, when gross domestic product rose at a year-on-year rate of 3.7 per cent. This was well above the the 2.75 per cent growth rate forecast for this year by the Treasury in June and the UK's estimated 'trend' growth of about 2.25 per cent at which the economy can expand without stimulating inflationary pressures. The decision was also influenced by last month's latest CBI survey of industry pointing to a further acceleration of output and above average capacity utilisation, as well as growing evidence of faster growth in continental Europe and signs of recovery in Japan. Core data about the economy published in August and relating to the first half of this year appears to have weighed more with the chancellor and governor than more recent indicators suggesting that consumer demand might at last be slowing in response to tax increases that took effect in April. The subdued state of the housing market, where estate agents have complained of weak turnover and mortgage lenders have been scaling down their forecasts of price rises this year, did not stand in the way of the rate rise. The Bank's view in any case is that the housing market is 'steady' and not weak. The decision shows how closely attuned Mr Clarke and Mr George now are. Mr George did not have to mount a long campaign to persuade Mr Clarke to act. True, in the summer the governor was the first to warn that rates would have to rise. But it is understood that last Wednesday's meeting was the first at which Mr George specifically recommended a rise in rates. By Friday at the latest, the chancellor was on the same wave-length. Yesterday Mr Clarke was sounding for all the world like the author of the Bank of England's quarterly inflation reports, underlining the need to act in a timely manner to influence inflation in 18 months to two years' time. Quite what effect a 0.5 percentage point rise in rates will have on the economy is open to question. Given the wide gap between the old base rate of 5.25 per cent and most mortgage rates, yesterday's prompt action by the Nationwide Building Society and the Abbey National bank in raising mortgage rates was probably not in the authorities' scenario for developments after the rate increase. However, the hesitancy of other mortgage lenders to follow suit could point to a patchier than usual response among mortgage lenders. While many business organisations were predictably critical of the move, the higher rates may not have too great an impact on corporate borrowers because market rates had already discounted such a step. The chancellor's move was politically brave. With the Tory party conference four weeks away, the absence so far of a 'feel good factor' in the recovery and the party's lamentable performance in the opinion polls had argued against any increase in rates before November. Instead, Mr Clarke yesterday clothed himself in monetary statesmanship. Using vocabulary suitable for a Bundesbank council meeting, Mr Clarke stressed the importance of low inflation for strong and lasting growth. He had taken action now to avoid more drastic action later. Businessmen would welcome the move because it promised stability. He hoped it would reassure home buyers of the government's counter-inflationary resolve and influence wage bargainers. Indeed, the chancellor made clear that he believes there is political advantage to be gained from running the economy in a way that keeps inflation under control. His vision is of a Britain that is 'one of strongest European economies', that 'is firing on all cylinders' and which no longer is brought grinding to a halt by the need to bring down inflation from double-digit levels. It is unclear whether yesterday's rise in interest rates will achieve this goal or whether further increases are in store. One senior official suggested that the November meeting of chancellor and governor will be time for a stock taking of its effect on the economy. What is clear, however, is that UK monetary policy has embarked on a new era of anticipating problems rather than responding to disaster.</p>

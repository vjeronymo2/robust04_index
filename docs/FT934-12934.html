			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Arts: Onegin proves difficult to capture - Richard Fairman reviews the revival at Covent Garden of John Cox's production IT WAS Tchaikovsky's express wish that the first performance of Eugene Onegin should be given by students. He feared that practised opera singers would find it difficult to capture the ingenuousness of the young people in Pushkin's tale, whose inability to control their emotions destroys the lives of those they love and - ultimately - themselves. After 20 years of a traditional staging the Royal Opera decided this summer to try something new. John Cox's new production went as far as the borders of the non-representational, which proved very sparing on visual beauty and, presumably, cost. With a fine cast of big-voiced Russians and a noted Tchaikovsky expert in the pit it won enthusiasm. But in revival, less carefully rehearsed, less opulently played and sung? The irony is that visiting singers need to work doubly hard on these characters if they are to look natural, believable young people. When Onegin is delivering his insufferably superior rebuff to poor Tatyana, it is unhelpful to ask her to sink to her knees and finally crumple in a heap on the ground - the standard reaction of a rejected prima donna. What is Onegin to do: offer to help her up or leave her there? Dmitry Hvorostovsky left her, but without sufficient disdain as to make her grand opera gesture seem appropriate. As Onegin, he cuts a handsome figure, at once proud and callow (the head is held at just the right angle to suggest assumed superiority.) All told, Onegin must be Hvorostovsky's best role. But he is short on specific insight and the voice runs out of power at the top, however beautiful it can be on sustained notes lower down. The Tatyana from whom he walks away is Catherine Malfitano. Not so long ago she was a Royal Opera Tosca, but the voice is better suited to Tchaikovsky's youthful heroine, easily able to take the climaxes in its stride. During the Letter Scene, the shadings of vocal colour, the conscious mirroring of the music in her movements, all spoke of an intelligent artist who had thought long and hard in her preparation. Too hard, perhaps: the very awareness of what she was doing robbed her Tatyana of naive sincerity. Giuseppe Sabbatini's Lensky is easier to deal with - straightforward, not much inner life suggested. His tenor is reedy, sometimes constricted, but he is able to scale it down nicely to express affection and intimacy; the end of his aria, at least, was the work of a poet. Eirian James, a sparkling presence in primrose yellow, was a delightful Olga. Gwynne Howell was a picture of wise old dignity as Prince Gremin, leaving this Onegin with his wings visibly clipped. A sharper cut, however, to the orchestral ensemble would be desirable. The scrambled string playing that led into the second scene was only one example of the general laziness that robbed Mark Ermler's conducting of its stock Russian strength. Faced with such a succession of unimaginative and ugly designs, perhaps even a stock Russian production would be preferable. These sets are due to go to Monte-Carlo and Madrid. Lucky them] - but may the boat please sink on the way back. Further performances at the Royal Opera House until November 11; there will be a Radio 3 live broadcast on November 6</p>

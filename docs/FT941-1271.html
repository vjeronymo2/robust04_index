			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Cheung Kong profits surge 56% Cheung Kong, the flagship of Mr Li Ka-shing's listed Hong Kong empire, yesterday surprised the market with a 56 per cent growth in net profits last year. Earnings came in at HKDollars 9.8bn (USDollars 1.3bn), compared with HKDollars 6.3bn in 1992. Cheung Kong derives some 85 per cent of net profits from property development - broadly Laguna City, South Horizons and Kingswood Villas  - and its 43 per cent stake in Hutchison. Analysts say its performance was lifted by investments and share dealing, such as the sale of 100m Hopewell shares. The pre-tax contribution from associated companies last year stood at HKDollars 7.64bn, compared with HKDollars 4.2bn the previous year. Turnover was flat at HKDollars 10.7bn, compared with Dollars 10.3bn. The cement operation, Green Island Cement, showed an increase over 1992, but conversely competition in the concrete and quarrying products market hit Anderson Asia. Earnings per share rose 56 per cent to HKDollars 4.45, up from HKDollars 2.85 in 1992. Mr Li, chairman, said the group had been actively expanding its land bank, and had already signed deals to purchase or jointly develop several projects with large land areas. 'This will build a good foundation for the group's business developments after 1997,' he said. Further contracts have been secured with mainland companies in infrastructure, power, property and hotel businesses, and funds have already been directed into these projects. These mainland investments would likewise provide a stable source of income for the group in the future, Mr Li said. The directors are proposing a final dividend of 76 cents a share, giving a total payout of HKDollars 1 a share for the full year, an increase of 25 per cent over the 80 cents paid in 1992.</p>

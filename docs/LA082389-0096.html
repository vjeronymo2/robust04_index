			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRL, 9, IS SHOT WITH .44 REVOLVER BELIEVED LEFT IN HOME BY WORKER  </P> <P> A 9-year-old girl was shot in the neck Tuesday after she and her sister found a  .44-caliber magnum revolver that was apparently left in their Tustin-area home  by a workman, Orange County sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> The girl, identified as Melissa Delfrancia, was taken to United Western Medical  Center-Santa Ana, where she underwent emergency surgery and was reported in  stable condition Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department Lt. William Francis said the Delfrancia home in the 18500  block of Auburn Avenue, in an unincorporated area north of Tustin, is being  extensively remodeled and that during the project several of the workers have  been living in the house.  </P> <P> Francis said one of the workers apparently stored the powerful handgun under  his bed, where Melissa's 8-year-old sister, Natalie, found it just before 3  p.m. Tuesday. As Natalie held the gun, it discharged, striking Melissa in the  neck, Francis said.  </P> <P> "We think the girl is going to be OK," Francis said Tuesday evening. "She never  lost consciousness. She was talking all the time. There was a great deal of  bleeding."  </P> <P> Francis said the girls' parents were home at the time of the shooting, but were  unaware that there was a gun in the house. The house is listed as the residence  of Dana Delfrancia. A family member declined comment on the shooting.  </P> <P> Investigators were waiting to question the workman who owns the pistol, who was  thought to have traveled out of town.  </P> <P> "We just want to ask some questions," Francis said. "We're treating it as an  accident."  </P></p>

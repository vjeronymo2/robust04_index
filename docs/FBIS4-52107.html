			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- Foreign investment in Korea  totaled 192 cases worth 519 million U.S. dollars in  January-April, increasing 39.1 percent and 35.9 percent,  respectively, from 138 cases worth 382 million dollars in the  same period last year, the Finance Ministry said Friday.    This year's active foreign investment can be attributed to  increased facility investment following the country's economic  recovery and easing of various rules and other moves to attract  foreign investment, the ministry officials said.    As a result, new foreign investment surged 61 percent in  case  and 224.5 percent in value.    In manufacturing, investment stopped at 78 cases worth 157  million dollars during the first four months, up 30 percent from  a year earlier but off 41.2 percent in value.    Investment in non-manufacturing industries, in contrast,  rose  46.2 percent to 114 cases and 214.8 percent to 362 million  dollars.    Investment from the United States and Japan decreased 13.5  percent and 20.6 percent, respectively, in value, while  investment from the European union soared 178.7 percent.  Investment from Europe centered on the high-tech auto parts  industry.</p>

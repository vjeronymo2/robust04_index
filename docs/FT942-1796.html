			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: CBOE to trade options on Mexican companies index The Chicago Board Options Exchange plans to create an equity derivatives product to mirror the performance of the Mexican economy. It is to trade options on an index of 10 Mexican companies. Pending regulatory approval, the launch date is set for later this summer. The CBOE already offers options on the American depositary receipts of nine of the 10 stocks in the index. All of the shares trade as ADRs or American depositary shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr Alger Chapman, CBOE chairman, said: 'No proxy for the performance of the Mexican economy is currently available in the US derivative markets, and options on the index will provide investors with a low-cost means to participate in the performance of Mexico or to hedge against the risk of investing in the economy.' After a strong performance late last year following US approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexican share values have fallen back this year. However, recent US trade figures show that foreign investment in Mexico is growing, theoretically creating a positive environment for the CBOE's options. The CBOE has been in the forefront in attracting derivatives business on Latin American ADRs. The exchange launched options on the ADRs of Telefonos de Mexico, the telephone company, in 1991. They have since become the most actively traded equity options in the US. The 10 companies in the Mexico index are truck maker Dina; three construction concerns; Telefonos de Mexico; media company Grupo Televisa; Coca-Cola's Mexican division; the cigarette company Empresas La Moderna; banking company Grupo Financiero Serfin, and shipbuilder Transportacion Maritima Mexicana.</p>

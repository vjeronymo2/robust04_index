			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Joint ventures gleam amid economic gloom FOREIGN joint ventures, a tiny and embattled part of the Soviet economy, are growing strongly in spite of the surrounding collapse of the state sector. Figures published by the State Statistics Committee show that the production of all joint ventures increased nearly fivefold from 1989 to 1990, to reach a value of Rs4.3bn (Pounds 1.37bn at the commercial exchange rate). Industrial production by joint ventures quadrupled, to reach Rs2.3bn. This is a tiny niche in an economy whose gross output (net material product) was estimated last year at over Rs1,600bn. Nevertheless, the rate of growth and the areas occupied by the joint ventures - usually services and high technology - are pushing the sector from negligible proportions into the category of small-but-important. The total capitalisation of joint ventures last year was estimated at Rs7bn, with the foreign partners owning 38 per cent of the total. The committee's figures show the modest size of most of these enterprises - 64 per cent are capitalised at below Rs1m, with 90 per cent below Rs5m. Some 2,905 joint ventures are now registered, of which only around one third, 1,027, are operating. They employ 103,700 workers. Almost half of the value of output, Rs428m, is in industrial production, of which Rs199m was accounted for by information technology and spare parts. Trade and catering accounted for Rs103m, and research and development Rs79m.</p>

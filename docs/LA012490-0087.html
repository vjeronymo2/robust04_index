			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 SENATORS CALL FOR EPA IN CABINET  </P> <P> Two senators proposed legislation Tuesday to elevate the Environmental  Protection Agency to Cabinet-level status, saying it would assure that the  government gives the environment the priority it deserves.  </P> <P> The bill by Sens. John Glenn (D-Ohio) and William V. Roth Jr. (R-Del.) would  change the name of the EPA to the Department of the Environment and allow the  EPA administrator to regularly attend Cabinet meetings with the President.  </P> <P> President Bush reportedly is leaning toward supporting the idea but he has  resisted expanding the Cabinet in the past, saying it could become unwieldy.  However, Administration officials say the political benefit of highlighting the  government's environmental commitment could override such reservations.  </P></p>

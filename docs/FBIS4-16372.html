			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- Two years of military talks  between Russia and Moldavia [Moldova] have resulted in the  signing and implementation of seven bilateral agreements and the  withdrawal of three Russian units from Moldavia and disbandment  of 18 more located in the republic, Colonel-General Eduard  Vorobyov, first deputy commander of the Russian land forces,  said.    Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday,  Vorobyov  said that currently six new agreements are being prepared for  signing, including on the legal status and terms of and  procedure for the withdrawal of Russian troops temporarily  stationed in Moldavia.    These issues were in the centre of attention at the seven  round of talks between the governmental delegations of Russia  and Moldavia held in Kishinev [Chisinau] on April 5-6, Vorobyov  said.    It is hard to set the time of the withdrawal of the 14th  Russian Army from Moldavia because of the absence of progress in  resolving the Dniester conflict. The self-proclaimed Dniester  Republic has been insisting on special political status for  itself.    Another reason for disagreements at the talks is the  legislation of the Dniester Republic which contradicts Moldavian  laws. "We are criticised that the talks are moving slowly, and  this is fair enough," Vorobyov said.    Asked about the disagreements between the commanders of the  14th Army and the Dniester leaders, Vorobyov stressed that they  are not crucial and cannot affect the course of talks.    Both the leaders and the population of the Dniester Republic  are interested in Russian military presence in the region,  Vorobyov continued. "But we are interested in bringing the  armed forces within Russia's borders, so that the troops were  gathered together and sorted out," he said.</p>

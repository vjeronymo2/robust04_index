			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hogg Robinson falls to Pounds 7.9m - Absence of exceptional gains this time has impact on interim results Hogg Robinson, the travel, transport and financial services group, yesterday reported sharply lower first half pre-tax profits refecting the absence of exceptional gains. Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 fell to Pounds 7.91m, against Pounds 14.3m when the results included a Pounds 6.7m exceptional gain from the sale of the leisure travel business to Airtours for Pounds 25m last year. However, excluding exceptional items, all three core businesses showed significant growth over the period, helped by the performance of the five acquisitions reported earlier this year. Turnover grew to Pounds 95.1m (Pounds 78.8m) including Pounds 5.05m from acquisitions and operating profit increased to Pounds 7.48m, compared with Pounds 6.75m last time when discontinued operations contributed Pounds 1.2m. The interim dividend is increased to 2.95p (2.75p), payable from earnings of 7.25p (17.28p) per share. The shares closed down  1/2 p at 201p. Mr Brian Perry, chairman, commenting on the results, said progress so far had been, 'in line with plan' and added that the group was, 'looking forward to a traditionally strong second half with attractive contributions from the successful integrations of the acquisitions made earlier in the year.' Underpinning the strong operating performance, the business travel division increased its profits by almost 50 per cent to Pounds 2.41m (Pounds 1.62m) on sales which grew from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 19.9m. Transport improved its market share in its European trailer operations and posted a 35 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 2.5m) aided by healthy contributions from its two new acquisitions, Nippress and Snel coupled with a recovery in the Shipping Services business, which mainly undertakes cargo movements between the UK and the Falklands Islands. Meanwhile the financial services division reported a 15 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 2.35m), aided by contributions from the acquisitions of Skillbase and Claybrook. Mr Perry said the recent acquisition of Bain Hogg's financial services business from Inchcape positioned the group, 'as one of the leading independent financial advisors in the UK.'</p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Arts: Today's Television It appears to be David Nobbs' Benefit Night. His comedy drama series A Bit Of A Do, so popular when first shown on ITV, continues its repeat run on C4 (10.00). An hour earlier ITV begins another comedy drama adapted by Nobbs from his own book, The Life And Times Of Henry Pratt. This is set in a small Yorkshire town in 1935 and chronicles a young man's journey through the British class system. I still don't think there is anything funny about the Gestapo, and I suspect some members of the resistance may be rightly offended at the idea that, less than a full generation later, we can consider all parties in World War Two equally ludicrous, equally hilarious. That said, even against my better judgement, 'Allo 'Allo still makes me laugh. Tonight brings the first in what we are told will be the last batch of this utterly British pantomime (8.00 BBC1). Cutting Edge (9.00 C4) investigates the Militant Tendency and Panorama (9.30 BBC1) Satanic abuse, phenomena which have received more than their fair share of attention already. Let's hope today's programmes push both subjects back where they belong.</p>

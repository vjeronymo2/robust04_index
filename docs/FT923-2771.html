			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Foreign Affairs: Cold war's final frontier - The North Korean iceberg may be beginning to melt under the impact of global warming Europeans have often been accused, in recent years, of being excessively absorbed in their own affairs, and expecting everyone else to find those affairs equally absorbing. The complaint was heard during the cold war, when Iraqis or Iranians could die by the hundred thousand without disturbing the global strategic balance but a single shot fired in Berlin would have the whole world transfixed. That particular spot of bother has been disposed of, but now Europeans cannot confront even smaller-scale problems such as Yugoslavia without calling in the UN to do the dirty work. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, was complaining about that, quite rightly, back in July. It was salutary, therefore, that this year's annual conference of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) should have been held last week a long way from Europe - in the South Korean capital, Seoul. The IISS is recognised as the leading think-tank in its field, but it is based in London and its directorial baton has just passed from a Frenchman to a Swede. So it did well to accept the invitation of its Korean members, reminding itself and the world that Asia, too, has its own security problems. Although the conference was supposed to be about 'Asia's international role in the post-cold war era', it was not until the final session that anyone said anything about the contribution that east Asia, home of the fastest-growing economies in the world, could make to global security. One of the points made was that Japan has made a contribution, at the price of a traumatic internal debate, by amending its constitution to allow Japanese troops to join in UN peacekeeping operations. I agree, but it was clear that some Asians present (not least those from Korea itself) saw even this as an extra problem, since the memory of what Japanese troops got up to last time they went overseas is still too fresh and too painful. Anxiety and suspicion left over from old conflicts, and the second world war in particular, can hardly surprise the European visitor. But what does strike anyone used to thinking about security in a European or Atlantic context is the lack of any regional structure designed to overcome or even manage these problems. No Nato, no EC, and for that matter no Warsaw Pact. The cold war in these parts was waged, on both sides, through an untidy set of bilateral relationships. On the communist side there was open hostility between China and the Soviet Union from 1960 onwards: local communist powers such as North Korea and North Vietnam were obliged to maintain a delicate balancing act between the two. On the western side there was the ill-fated South-East Asia Treaty Organisation (Seato), but even the great 'pactomaniac' of the 1950s, John Foster Dulles, did not attempt to form a Neato between Japan, South Korea and nationalist China (Taiwan). So it is hardly surprising that Asians are not very receptive to the suggestion, insistently pressed on them by Europeans, that they should deal with the residue of the cold war by forming a 'CSCA' (conference on security and co-operation in Asia), modelled on the CSCE, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The CSCE in its present form is not much to write home about, in any case: it is doing precious little to resolve the conflicts breaking out all over eastern Europe, and has not even got round to filling the post of high commissioner on national minorities, which it decided to create more than two months ago. The CSCE came into existence originally as the result of complex negotiations between two already highly structured blocs. No such building blocs are visible in Asia today. But the alarming result is that almost every Asian state, faced with the prospect that the US might lose interest in the region in the absence of a Soviet threat, is stepping up its military expenditure and nervously eyeing that of its neighbours. Koreans, for their part, are especially unreceptive to suggestions that the reunification of their peninsula could be managed through a '2 plus 4' process on the German model - the four being, in this case, the US, Russia, China and Japan. It is true that South Korea is now officially on good terms with these four, having established diplomatic relations with China last month. But Koreans are quick to point out that the four do not have the legal status in Korea that Britain, France, the US and the Soviet Union had in divided Germany. Korea was not a defeated power in 1945. On the contrary, as a 'liberated' Japanese colony, it was on the side of the victors. Its division only came about because Mr Dean Rusk, then a middle-ranking US state department official, drew a line along the 38th parallel. South of it, the Japanese surrender would be accepted by American forces; north, by Soviet ones. The Soviet Union took advantage of this arrangement to install a communist regime in the north under President Kim Il Sung, who is still there. Mr James Baker, when still US secretary of state, described the Korean peninsula as 'the last glacier of the cold war'. That is certainly a good description of Kim Il Sung's regime, which has done a more thorough job of isolating and repressing its people than any other communist regime since Stalin's death. Radio and TV sets are pre-tuned to government stations, and those few North Koreans who travel abroad on official business are forbidden to talk about their experiences when they return home, on pain of dire consequences. It is assumed, therefore, that North Koreans know far less about South Korea than East Germans did about West Germany; and South Koreans admit to knowing very little about the lives and opinions of ordinary people in North Korea. Talk of 'managing reunification', therefore, may seem premature. Kim Il Sung is not volunteering for the fate of Mr Erich Honecker. No Gorbachev, and probably no Deng Xiaoping, is in a position to topple him from power. But he is 80 years old and his chosen successor, his son Kim Jong Il, cuts a less than convincing figure. Even the North Korean glacier may be beginning to melt under the impact of global warming. In the past two years Mr Kim has embarked on barter trade and political dialogue with the South (the eighth 'high-level meeting' is being held in Pyongyang this week); and this summer, yielding to intense pressure from the US, Mr Kim has allowed the International Atomic Energy Agency to carry out a thorough inspection of his country's nuclear facilities. That is still a long way from unification, and the South would be happy to keep the process as gradual as possible; it is well aware of the havoc wrought by rapid unification in Germany, which in many ways was better equipped for the task. But many South Koreans are also aware that they may have no choice in the matter, if the regime in the North cracks and its people begin to flock southwards as East Germans flocked west. If that happens, the new Korea will need a lot of help and understanding from its neighbours. Surely some sort of multilateral framework, with the US as a full participant, would help the states of the region to approach this and other looming security problems with greater confidence and less mutual distrust.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Lex to import Komatsu trucks Lex Service, the UK's largest car distribution and leasing group, has become the sole importer of Komatsu lift trucks into England and Wales after paying a total of Pounds 6.5m to acquire the lift truck distribution business of Handling Analysis. Lex has paid Pounds 5.9m out of its own cash resources for the distribution business and importership, and a further Pounds 600,000 for an associated transaction involving Handling Analysis' 60-strong fleet of contract hire lift trucks and service facilities. The net assets being acquired were Pounds 3.5m after a pre-sale dividend of Pounds 2m. Handling Analysis, a subsidiary of Northampton-based AJ Mackaness, imports and distributes lift trucks through a network of 12 independent dealers. In the year to October it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 900,000 on turnover of Pounds 13m. The company's biggest customer, representing about 40 per cent of UK sales, is Harvey Plant which is managed by Lex and jointly owned by Lex and Lombard North Central. Harvey has 7,500 lift trucks on long term contract hire and is the largest company in the sector in the UK with 19 depots around the country. Harvey buys about 1,000 lift trucks a year of which about 40 per cent are Komatsu. The Japanese-based group is the third-largest lift truck manufacturer in the world having risen from sixth place in 1990. Last year Komatsu's share of the UK market was about 8 per cent. The UK is Komatsu's most important European market. In order to offset the rising yen the Japanese group has shifted production to Europe in recent years. Lex said yesterday that despite the close links between Handling Analysis and Harvey Plant, the two companies will continue to be managed independently with Lex emphasising the development of Handling Analysis' dealer network.</p>

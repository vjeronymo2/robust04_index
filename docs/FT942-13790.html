			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (11): Battle of wits develops - Hard bargaining between Suez Canal users An intriguing battle of wits is developing as more participants vie for the cheapest way to transport crude oil - and natural gas later on - from Gulf states to European markets. In the end the result will be dictated by the market, traders and end buyers, rather than by intermediaries such as Arab Petroleum Pipelines Company (Sumed) and the Suez Canal Authority (SCA). But these two, Sumed and the SCA, will be at the centre of any hard bargaining if they are not to lose their respective market shares. New entrants on to the regional oil and gas scene could include an expanded Israeli-managed Eilat-Ashquelon oil pipeline (Tipline), if and when the Arab boycott on Israel is lifted. Tipline has a capacity of 900,000 b/d. (Iran owns 50 per cent of Tipline, from a deal going back to the days of the Shah.) Another potential competitor for transporting crude would be a revived Trans-Arabian pipeline (the old Tapline), which had a capacity of 500,000 b/d before it was closed in the Arab-Israel war of June 1967. It has remained closed ever since. US oil contractors are reported to have already discussed the feasibility and costs of restoring the line from the Jordan section, 50 kms east of Mafraq, where the line divides into two. One spur goes through Syria to Sidon in Lebanon; the other passes through Israel north of the occupied West Bank to Haifa on the Mediterranean. Reviving or expanding these two lines would seriously affect both Sumed and SCA. Sumed is 50 per cent owned by Egypt. Fifteen per cent each is held by Abu Dhabi (through Abu Dhabi National Oil Company), Saudi Arabia (through Saudi Aramco), and Kuwait (via three state-owned companies). The remaining 5 per cent is held by Qatar through Qatar General Petroleum Corporation (QGPC). The 320-km pipeline started transporting crude in January 1977 from Ain Sukhna, on the Red Sea, to Sidi Kerir, west of Alexandria. It serves tankers up to 500,000dwt with draughts up to 75 feet - too deep to pass through the Suez Canal. Egypt gets 85 per cent of the revenue from Sumed by virtue of its equity share, together with money from customs, taxes and end-ownership rights. According to Dr Aly Nazih, Sumed's chairman, last year's daily throughput was 84m tonnes, equivalent to some 1.6m b/d, - up from 77.6m tonnes in 1992. The capacity is already there to provide for a throughput of 117m-120m tonnes a year (equivalent to 2.3m b/d), but will not be operational until completion and testing of the Dollars 120m boosting stations south of Cairo. The new pumps will enable Sumed to increase its share of the Mediterranean and European markets. Although traders are reported to have complained that the extra capacity would mean more delays for tankers off-loading at Ain Sukhna and a resulting increase in spot prices for their clients' crude, Dr Nazih curtly refutes suggestions that there had ever been delays at either Ain Sukhna or at Sidi Kerir. Officially Sumed does not compete with the SCA - by not catering for tankers of less than 150,000dwt, the maximum that can pass fully laden through the Suez Canal. Instead, Sumed concentrates on very large crude carriers (vlccs) and ultra large crude carriers (ulccs), which discharge at Ain Sukhna, pass through the Suez Canal in ballast (empty) or partly laden, and reload at Sidi Kerir. To take tankers of less than 150,000dwt would deprive the SCA - and the Egyptian government - of much-needed revenue. 'Everyone thinks there is competition with SCA for the smaller tankers, but there is none whatsoever,' Dr Nazih insists. 'We are only dealing with tankers which cannot be accommodated by SCA.' This may not make commercial sense to Sumed's non-Egyptian shareholders. Sumed's expansion plans and increased capacity will inevitably lead shareholders to push for a greater market share. In fact, as Mr Mohamed Ezzat Adel, chairman of SCA, explains, the SCA/Sumed relationship rests uneasily on an oral 'professional agreement' that Sumed should offer enough incentives for buyers and traders to load all the extra capacity on to vlccs and ulccs, not on to medium-size tankers which could be using the Canal. In an interview with the Cairo daily Alam el Yom on April 10, Mr Adel pointed out that 'last year the Suez Canal transported 41.2m tonnes of oil from the Gulf to Europe. By contrast, Sumed carried 76.9m tonnes through the pipeline. Sumed should concentrate on oil for the US and Europe, and leave the Mediterranean ports for the Canal.' At the beginning of April the SCA began to accept loaded vessels with a beam (width) of 158 feet drawing 53 feet, instead of 144 feet drawing 55 feet. On June 1, the beam limit will be kept constant but the permissible draught will increase to 54 feet. For vlccs and ulccs in ballast, SCA has begun to accept a beam of up to 210 feet instead of 190 feet. This extra capacity will marginally help to make SCA more attractive, underpinned by the new 'long-haul rebate scheme' to tempt long-distance traffic away from the alternative Cape Route. At present, SCA worries about being able to maintain revenue; any business Sumed might take away would be sorely felt. 'Oil represents a big slice of our revenue, so I should be worried not only about competition from Sumed, but also from other lines in oil and gas cargo,' Mr Adel said on April 3. SCA's revenues for the calendar year 1993 were Dollars 1.965bn, compared with 1991-1992 fiscal year revenues of Dollars 1.752bn. The 1993 results were a disappointment. 'We were anticipating more than Dollars 2bn; and this year has so far started miserably because of the recession in the west,' Mr Adel said. A ship from Jeddah to, say, the Black Sea saves 83 per cent on distance by using the canal. But a ship from Tokyo to, say, Rotterdam, which makes use of the canal, saves only 23 per cent. Incentive rates or rebate schemes can tempt these into using the canal. Low prices for bunker fuel mean that freighters and tankers from Asia can steam around the Cape at slower speeds and save money. Moreover, the SCA must operate in SDRs, and has been losing out because of the progressive decline of the US dollar. If the dollar gets weaker, then a ship which contracted for Dollars 100,000 will actually be paying Dollars 110,000-Dollars 115,000, depending on the devaluation of the dollar. A further worry for the SCA is the possible resumption or expansion of the Tipline. Tipline is severely under-used. It is taking 50,000 b/d of Egyptian crude. Total Israeli domestic consumption is about 200,000 b/d. 'At present this line is being used only for local consumption,' Mr Adel says, 'but there are studies being done to link this line with others or to build a new one. If this happens, it will cause problems for both the SCA and for Sumed.' Dr Nazih obliquely concurs: 'So far we have no problem with the Israeli pipeline. Their economy has to grow a lot before they are competing with us.' It is too soon to say how Sumed and the SCA will respond to the possibility of Qatar, and perhaps Iran, wanting to pipe their gas through to a Mediterranean terminal. A multi-national natural gas consortium similar to Sumed's for crude is one possibility - if the potential Arab shareholders ever reach agreement on structure and pricing. Mr Adel said in the same interview with Alam el Yom: 'If Qatar extends a gas pipeline to Israel for the latter's domestic use, then fine; but if this pipeline for Israel is to export gas to Europe, then this is hitting below the belt as far as the Suez Canal is concerned.'</p>

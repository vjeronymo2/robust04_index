			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Brazilian companies hit by accounting rules THERE could be some unpleasant surprises in store for those foreign investors who have rushed to buy shares on the Brazilian stock market or take up more than Dollars 2bn in bonds and other paper issued by Brazilian state companies over the past six months. Over the next few weeks, many Brazilian companies will be posting appalling results and surprise losses for 1991. This is partly a result of the country's harshest recession for a decade, provoked by the tight monetary policy the government is using to tackle inflation. The main reason, however, is a new accounting regulation (Law 8200) requiring companies to revalue assets to reflect the fact that inflation has been running at a higher rate than previously recorded in official figures. In effect, companies are having to compensate for the government's under-estimation of inflation in 1990. The first victim was Petrobras, the giant state oil monopoly, which recent-ly announced its first losses. Mr Antonio Claudio Pereira da Silva, the superintendent of finance, claims the company would have had a Dollars 1.2bn profit rather than its posted losses of Dollars 237m were it not for the change in accounting practices. 'The new law is basically an admission that the government has been manipulating the (official inflation) figures,' says one analyst. For the past six years of high inflation, successive economic teams have been giving figures for monetary correction of assets below that of actual inflation, in an attempt to suppress inflationary pressures in the economy. This has made corporate profits appear higher, and has enabled the government to collect more taxes. The situation reached an extreme in 1990 when there was a 100 per cent lag between the figures used to adjust reported asset values and actual inflation. This caused many companies to show profits when, in fact, they had made losses in real terms. Many companies went to court refusing to pay tax on these so-called profits, thus forcing the government to correct the situation. Under the new law, companies must now revise their figures for 1990. This is leading to a huge increase in depreciation costs: by last year, fixed assets were shown on average at just one-third of their real value. Companies can also revise their figures for previous years, although they are not required to and will not receive tax credits. This option is already causing confusion over what 1991 results really mean. Petrobras, for example, revised its figures back to 1987 whereas Bradesco, the largest private sector bank, only went back to 1989. The average effect has been a 100 per cent jump in net asset values and a fall in profits to one-third of previous forecasts. Particularly hit are those companies with large assets such as Petrobras, Telebras, the state telecommunications company and Electrobras, the state electricity company, all of which have or are likely to report losses. Finance directors argue that as this is an accounting change the figures may be worse on paper than in reality, but Ms Sonia Villa Lobos, a researcher at Banco Garantia, points out: 'This law is just adjusting net assets to their real value - what was wrong was their previous results.' The changes do not affect cash-flow, so there should be no reduction in capacity to meet obligations. However, Mr Roger Maudsley, an investment analyst at Banco Bozano Simonsen, says, 'Brazilian companies are suddenly looking very uncompetitive when one considers net return on equity.'</p>

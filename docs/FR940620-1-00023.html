			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Clause (XI) in the matter following section 1902(a)(10)(F), as amended by section 4713(a)(1)(D) of OBRA '90, requires that medical assistance available to an individual defined in section 1902(u)(1) who is eligible for medical assistance only because of section 1902(a)(10)(F) be limited to medical assistance for COBRA continuation premiums (as defined in section 1902(u)(2)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1905(a)(x), as added by section 4713(b) of OBRA '90 amends the definition of medical assistance to include the new group of individuals described in section 1902(u)(1) who may be eligible for Medicaid through payment of premiums for COBRA continuation insurance coverage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1902(u)(4) specifies that, for individuals who may qualify for Medicaid payment for COBRA continuation coverage and who are receiving an optional State supplementary payment, the State must apply an income standard (as determined under section 1612 of the Act) of no more than 100 percent of the Federal poverty level applicable to a family of the size involved. In determining income, except for costs described under section 1612(b)(4)(B)(ii) of the Act for certain functionally disabled individuals, the State must exclude costs incurred for medical care and for any other type of remedial care under this provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because individuals identified in section 1902(u)(4) are by definition already eligible for Medicaid, we are unaware of the relevance of this provision to individuals eligible under section 1902(a)(10)(F). Moreover, we are unaware of anything in the legislative history of section 4713 which indicates what Congress intended to accomplish by this provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Eligibility Conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In interpreting the provisions of section 1902(u)(1), we propose to require that a CCB must also meet the existing general non-financial requirements or conditions of eligibility for medical assistance contained in our regulations in 42 CFR part 435. These general requirements include, for example, the filing of an application for Medicaid (&sect;435.907), furnishing a social security number (&sect;435.910), providing citizenship and residency information (&sect;&sect;435.406 and 435.408), and assigning rights to third party payments to the State Medicaid agency (&sect;435.604). However, these individuals do not have to meet the categorical requirements of either the SSI or AFDC programs. An individual who is otherwise eligible for Medicaid under the State plan may also be eligible as a CCB. An individual who is eligible for Medicaid as a CCB as well as under some other Medicaid eligibility group may choose, as specified in &sect;435.404, to have eligibility determined only under one category. However, the individual is not required to make such a choice. The individual is entitled to have eligibility determined under all categories for which he or she may qualify.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an individual does not specifically and voluntarily choose to have his or her eligibility determined under a specific category, and if he or she is eligible both as a CCB and under another group in the State plan, the individual is designated as being eligible both as a CCB and the other group for which he or she is eligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Determination of Financial Eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining the income and resource eligibility for CCBs under section 1902(u)(1)(B) and (C), we would require the State to use the income and resources methodologies of the SSI program under sections 1612 and 1613 of the Act, respectively. By methodologies, we mean the methods for determining the individual's countable income and resources, that is, the amounts that may be considered to be available to the individual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Determination and Redetermination of Eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rules for timely determination of eligibility and periodic redetermination of eligibility set forth in existing &sect;&sect;435.911 and 435.916 would apply to determinations and redeterminations of CCB eligibility. Specifically, &sect;435.911 requires the State to establish time standards for determining eligibility, and inform the applicant of what they are. Section 435.916 requires the State agency to redetermine Medicaid eligibility, with respect to circumstances that may change, at least every 12 months or when it has knowledge of changes that may affect eligibility, and requires States to have procedures for recipients to report changes that may affect their eligibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Military interests don't belong in politics Sir, Readers concerned about developments in West Africa will welcome the balanced approach and relevant conclusions of your editorial, 'Time to help Nigeria' (August 3). As you pointed out, it is for Nigerians, soldiers and civilians, to resolve the present crisis. This does not exclude appropriate measures by British and other governments to ensure a speedy end to military rule and installation of a civilian coalition under Chief Moshood Abiola as president. He was the victor of the presidential election, organised on June 12 1993 by the military regime. His alleged 'treason', resulting in arrest and trial, derives from the fact that he won the contest, against the preferred candidate of the military leadership, while his Yoruba affiliations aroused misgivings in parts of the north. He won a clear majority in Kano State, home to the opposition candidate and also to General Sani Abacha, current head of state. After a year that has seen the military reject the election results, then 'withdraw' only to resume power shortly afterwards, Abiola has recently asserted his right to assume the presidency under the military-approved constitution. At the time of the election his support bridged the religious and ethnic divisions within the country. His insistence on a negotiated outcome and his rejection of violence has kept open the possibility of peaceful compromise. I have recently returned from South Africa and your comparison with the successful transition in that country is apposite. The military will best serve its own interests and those of Nigeria by distancing itself from politics, as in 1979, and giving loyal support to an incoming civilian regime, restoring the freely elected legislatures, state and national, as well as the elected state governors. The new regime would be transitional only in the sense that, after a suitable interval, two or three years, new elections should be held but no longer restricted to only two parties.

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: European equities On its own, turmoil in the foreign exchange markets seems an unsatisfactory explanation for the weakness of European equity markets. After all, sterling's difficulties seem most acute, yet yesterday's fall in the UK market was again mirrored in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and elsewhere. Most European equity markets are, like the FT-SE, some 15-20 per cent below their May peaks. The precarious position of sterling, and recent French opinion polls, underline that progress towards monetary union may be two-speed. Currencies in the slow lane will, presumably, be seen as more volatile and investors may demand a risk premium. The bond markets seem to be discounting this, yet the risk to equity markets is less obvious. Higher bond yields in slow-track economies could act as brake on recovery, but against this short-term interest rates might fall. A better explanation for falling shares may be that doubts about monetary union have refocused attention on economic fundamentals. Interim results from Mannesmann to Peugeot have been disappointing and earnings forecasts have been scaled back - most aggressively in Germany. The weakness of the dollar has inflicted further damage in this regard, and if a cut in German interest rates was factored in to equity prices in May, it has now been factored back out. Sooner or later, though, European equity markets may find it impossible to believe both that Germany is leading Europe into downswing and that interest rates set by Germany will not be cut.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The time is 1033; sorry for the delay. We have just  received a recorded report by our correspondent Venediktov at  the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by the Kremlin Wall in the  Aleksandrovskiy Gardens. President Boris Yeltsin of Russia is  answering questions from journalists.    [Begin recording] [Yeltsin] In 1945, Russia, as a country,  the former Soviet Union, did indeed save Europe and the world  from the plague of brownshirts, and it is hard to imagine what  would have happened had it not done so. The whole world should  therefore bow its head first of all before our Russian soldiers,  officers, commanders, that is, before those who took part in the  Great Patriotic War, should honor the memory of those who  perished and express gratitude to those who are alive.    But now is a new stage, a stage of partnership between our  previously conflicting countries, especially Russia and the  United States of America. Now partnership is of course  introducing an entirely different stage. Now there is no  confrontation as such. But nor must we lose our vigilance.  Therefore, while we are gradually lowering the threshold of  armaments and armed forces, nevertheless we will constantly keep  it in parity with the United States, with NATO, and so on. At  the same time, of course, we will cooperate more, perhaps  carrying out joint exercises, although they have not been  carried out before, to make our partnership really that of  comrades at arms [druzhestvenno-boyevoy].    I think that there are more guarantees of peace now than  ever  before, all the more so since this anniversary -- the 49th -- is  being marked precisely at a time when the political situation in  Russia is becoming stabilized, when there are grounds for calm,  when there are grounds for different parties and factions  sitting down at the negotiation table together to discuss  questions and to hold a dialogue. It is the year when, as you  know, the Social Accord Treaty was signed. I think it will give  Russia a great deal, and not just Russia but the whole world,  too.    I am sure that Russia will still help the West. That will  come.    [Unidentified voice: "If God is willing"]    [Yeltsin] If God is willing, yes indeed, since the hopes --  and belief and hope are the most important things -- cherished  by every soldier during the war -- the belief, the belief namely  in victory, was the decisive factor which brought about 9 May  1945.    I think that Muscovites were very glad, specially those who  participated in the Great Patriotic War, that the glorious  museum on Poklonnaya Gora, which we will visit today, was  finished in time. It is, of course, a unique building. It is  truly a tribute to the memory of all those who took part, to all  those who did not live to see this day.    [Unidentified voice] Thank you to the press. We'll meet on  Poklonnaya Gora [words indistinct]. Thank you Boris  Nikolayevich. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Cabinet denies leaking Ashdown smear to paper THE government was thrown on to the defensive yesterday after allegations of 'dirty tricks' during the general election forced Conservative Central Office to hold an inquiry which produced denials of involvement from every member of the cabinet. The claim by Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, that an unnamed 'prominent cabinet minister' had offered him inaccurate information concerning Mr Paddy Ashdown prompted an immediate row at Westminster. It came as Mr David Mellor, the embattled national heritage secretary, struggled to resume normal working at his department in spite of continued press investigations into his relationship with 31-year-old actress, Miss Antonia de Sancha. After a day-long inquiry including emergency talks between Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, and Mr John Major yesterday afternoon, Central Office released a statement last night rejecting The Sun's charges. It said Mr Chris Patten, the Hong Kong governor and the then party chairman, and Lord Wakeham, who was also responsible for press liaison during the election, had 'categorically' denied the claim, as had every other cabinet minister. Mr Kenneth Baker, retired from the cabinet, associated himself with the statement and efforts were underway to contact Mr Peter Brooke, Lord Waddington and Mr Tom King. The denials are unlikely, however, to satisfy opposition parties who earlier yesterday demanded an explanation from the government. Mr John Smith, the newly-elected Labour leader, called on Mr MacKenzie to reveal the name of the minister, saying that if the charge was true it was 'quite disgraceful'. He added: 'I don't know how a cabinet minister who did anything like that can possibly remain in his post.' The Liberal Democrats, in a statement, said: 'It is now up to the Conservative party to clear this matter up and they should do so as soon as possible.' One senior cabinet minister privately agreed that the claim by the editor of the Sun, made in an editorial yesterday, had come as a severe embarrassment to the government after widespread Conservative indignation at newspaper reporting of the affair. Admitting that a resignation would be inevitable if Mr MacKenzie's claim was substantiated, he added: 'These are dangerous times.' In his editorial, Mr MacKenzie alleged that in the second week of the election campaign he received a telephone call from a cabinet minister offering the names and addresses of three women allegedly linked to the Liberal Democrat leader. It went on: 'It was no coincidence that the smear on Mr Ashdown was planted at a time when the Tories' election campaign was at a low ebb.' Subsequent checks revealed the allegations to be untrue, the editorial said. Yesterday Mr MacKenzie also claimed that during the general election a Labour MP had made serious allegations to him about Mr Neil Kinnock, then leader of the party. 'They turned out not to be true but Neil Kinnock then started accusing us of trying to smear him,' Mr MacKenzie told ITN. A Labour spokesman said there seemed to be 'no basis' for the accusation.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The secretariat of the central committee of workers  of the agro-industrial complex, whose representatives, alongside  the Federation of the Independent Trade Union and other trade  unions, are to sign the treaty on civic accord, decided  Wednesday not to sign the document on May 5, Interfax was told  by deputy chairman of the trade union's central committee,  Anatoliy Biryukov. He said that the trade union will not sign  the treaty until "we see for ourselves its text with the  farmers' amendment and the protocol of an agreement between the  trade union and the government."    The farmers trade union uniting at present 13 million people  joined the demands advanced by the Agrarian Party and the  Agrarian Union to supplement the text of the draft treaty with  government commitments on the creation of acceptable economic  conditions for the trade union functioning, as well as to  conclude an agreement with the government on the main guidelines  for the agrarian policies for the next two years.    The conditions were accepted. However, no corresponding  documents were received by the central committee except for  media reports, said Biryukov.    The secretariat will consider without delay the documents as  soon as they come and if they fully correspond to the conditions  advanced by farmers, will give powers for the trade union leader  to sign the document.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Mesut Yilmaz, leader of the </F> Motherland Party, by NOKTA KIBRIS correspondent Nedret Ersanel  in Ankara; date not given]    [Text] [Ersanel] Can you make a general assessment of the  "Cyprus problem," which has continued for many years and has  become more and more intricate as new developments arise? In  particular, can you comment on TRNC [Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus] President Rauf Denktas' statement to the  Turkish parliament that "the TRNC will move to integrate with  Turkey if the Greek Cypriots are allowed to join the European  Union [EU]"?    [Yilmaz] I attended the EC ministerial meeting as Turkey's  foreign minister in Luxembourg in 1988. I disagreed with then  Foreign Minister Genscher when he described the Cyprus problem  during the opening session of that meeting as a determining  factor in EC-Turkish relations. The meeting broke up because of  that. Unfortunately, the same view was adopted during the  summit in Dublin as official EC policy. Consequently, we have  to considere EC policy on Cyprus in our relations with that  organization. Actually, that was a step the EC considered but  failed to take for many years. That approach was adopted as the  EC's official policy in 1990. The second step the EC plans to  take at the present time is to allow Cyprus to join that  organization. Purporting to be the legal government of all of  Cyprus, the Greek Cypriot Republic of Southern Cyprus [title as  published] has signed a partnership agreement with the EC. The  question of Cyprus becoming an EC member is now on the agenda.  Contacts are being held on when the talks should begin. As far  as Turkey and the TRNC are concerned, the matter is extremely  important. Turkey was one of the first countries to sign a  partnership agreement with the EC. It officially applied to  join that organization as a full member in 1987. However, its  application has been suspended during the past seven years.  Considering all that, Southern Cyprus joining the EC as an  entity that represents the entire island will be an EC move  against Turkey. Furthermore, it will make a solution of the  Cyprus problem more difficult.    [Ersanel] Will the EU fail to realize that? It seems that  President Denktas has a clearer approach to the matter.    [Yilmaz] The EC will definitely feel the need to make an  assessment to avoid having the Cyprus problem placed within its  framework. Turkey's stance is an important factor. I am  convinced that Turkey must clearly explain Rauf Denktas'  argument. This will contribute to the EC's assessment. The EC  must be informed immediately that Southern Cyprus joining it  will mean the "de facto" solution to the Cyprus problem because  north Cyprus will move to fully integrate with Turkey.  Consequently, the effort made within the UN framework to  resolve the Cyprus problem will have failed.    Meanwhile, it must be recalled that the 1960 agreements,  which provided for the establishment of a partnership government  in Cyprus, contain a provision that Cyprus can become a member  of international organizations only with the consent of Turkey  and Greece, the guarantor powers of the partnership. A legal  debate can be held on the validity of a partnership between  Southern Cyprus and the EC, which Turkey will not approve.    [Ersanel] It seems that you regard this stance as a  "diplomatic trump card."    [Yilmaz] Yes, I do. That is what I am saying.    [Ersanel] Can an argument be made on its validity?    [Yilmaz] Two factors must be established if effective steps  are to be taken to find a solution to the Cyprus problem.  First, the two communities in Cyprus must be regarded as two  separate entities. That is not the case at the present time.  The existence of the Turkish Cypriot community as a separate  entity is a reality that is ignored by the world. The second is  the removal of the differences, economic differences in  particular, between the two communities in due course of time.  The outcome of integration with the EC will an very negative  effectson these issues. The economic imbalance between the two  sides will worsen.    [Ersanel] Can you comment on the U.S. approach to the  Cyprus problem?    [Yilmaz] The United States has always regarded the Cyprus  problem as a priority issue that has a bearing on its domestic  politics. In view of the Greek lobby's influence, the U.S.  Administration has always focused attention on the Cyprus  problem and regarded it as a priority issue that has a bearing  on domestic politics. Meanwhile, the views the U.S.  presidential candidates expressed on the Cyprus problem during  past election campaigns were modified in accordance with U.S.  foreign policy after they were elected.    However, the matter is completely different from Turkey's  viewpoint. The Cyprus problem does not concern domestic  politics in Turkey, it is a national issue. I have always  argued that the Cyprus problem does not concern Cyprus alone.  It is a matter that tests Turkey's will to defend its  legitimate rights and interests. Turkey has maintained the  right approach on the Cyprus problem and its intervention on the  island was legally justified. Otherwise, the problem would not  have continued for 30 years. If Turkey agrees to a solution,  which would conflict with its interests and with those of its  kinsmen in Cyprus, the implications of that approach will not be  limited to the island. In fact, it would set an example for  similar problems in other parts of the world.    [Ersanel] Can you give an example?    [Yilmaz] A very important example is the problem in the  Aegean Sea.    [Ersanel] Can you comment on Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's  Cyprus policy? She has said that the "Cyprus problem will be  solved."    [Yilmaz] I do not believe that Mrs. Ciller is aware of the  historical perspectives of the problem. She has already said  that the Cyprus problem is an obstacle for Turkey and has  described the existing state of affairs on the island as a  no-win situation. She has said that this harms Turkey.  Furthermore, she has claimed that the effort made to resolve  the problem has been deliberately obstructed in the past and has  noted that she is determined to solve the Cyprus problem.    What Mrs. Ciller has said in a diplomatic way is that Turkey  has significantly suffered because of the Cyprus problem.  Therefore, it is ready to make concessions to have it solved.  Naturally, that approach will stimulate more pressure on  Turkey. In view of that, I believe that her approach is very  wrong. It conflicts with the policies of the governments that  have come to power in Turkey during the past 30 years. The only  hopeful factor is that her approach is not shared. It is not  shared even in her own party and government. Therefore, I hope  that she will refrain from making new assessments and  initiatives on the matter.    [Ersanel] Can you explain the solution you have in mind for  the Cyprus problem?    [Yilmaz] Considering the Greek Cypriot intentions and  approach, I believe that Turkey must clearly say that it is  convinced that the continuation of the negotiating process is  useless. I believe that we must send a clearer message on the  matter to the United States, the United Nations, and the other  countries that are related to the problem. The Turkish Cypriots  responded positively to the two packages former UN Secretary  General Javier Perez de Cuellar proposed in the past. The  packages were rejected by the Greek Cypriot side. Regarding UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's confidence-building  measures, the Greek Cypriot side has disclosed that it is  prepared to agree to that package only if certain changes are  made. That indicates that the Greek Cypriots intend to use the  confidence-building measures to achieve their objectives. In  view of that, I believe that the Turkish Cypriot side must  inform the world that it is convinced that maintaining the  present process is useless. Meanwhile, it must use the  political developments in the world to strengthen its case. The  adoption of a determined approach by Turkey may create an  opportunity for new efforts to find a realistic solution to the  problem. Of course, the pressure on Turkey may be intensified.  That, too, must be considered.    Nevertheless, the future of Cyprus may be hopeless if the  effort that is made to solve the problem through the concessions  the Greek Cypriots demand is maintained. Cyprus may turn into a  country like Bosnia.    In short, Turkey must clearly inform the world about what  can  and cannot be achieved in Cyprus in light of the Greek Cypriot  approach and international opinion on the problem. I am  convinced that initiatives that are only aimed at gaining time  are useless.</p>

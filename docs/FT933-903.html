			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Public-sector tenders rule may ease THE TREASURY may relax its insistence on competition in the awarding of public-sector contracts in a bid to kick-start the government's private finance initiative. This is one of three steps ministers are considering to overcome companies' reluctance to devise schemes for the initiative, which seeks to involve private capital in public-sector projects. Companies have been unwilling to commit resources to devising new proposals as, once adopted, they are required to go to competitive tender for implementation. This means that the tender to implement one company's innovation could be won by a competitor. This partly explains why the initiative has had a slow start since it was announced in the Autumn Statement. Under a tentative framework to be set out today by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, the competition requirement may be relaxed in 'exceptional' cases where a contract cannot proceed without access to the physical and intellectual property of a contractor and the contractor is not willing to grant this to competitors. This could be done only in cases not covered by European Community procurement rules requiring competition. A string of conditions would apply, including that the terms of the contract be published 90 days before it came into force. Other steps under consideration by ministers include the offering of design-only contracts and the partial reimbursement of tendering costs. This would be limited to no more than half an unsuccessful bidder's expenses and the bidder would then be required to let others use its intellectual property. The Treasury's framework is to be published in the form of a consultation note, with comments invited by October 29. The Treasury also suggests that government departments should consider setting up independent panels of experts to advise on the value of particular types of intellectual property. Today's move comes less than three weeks after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced the formation of a taskforce representing both public and private sectors to identify suitable projects and willing investors. Mr Clarke also promised more guidance for businesses that wanted to invest in the public sector.</p>

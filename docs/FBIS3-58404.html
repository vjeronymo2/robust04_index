During his two-day stay in the Irish capital, the Iranian  minister is scheduled to hold talks with Ireland's President  Mary Robinson, Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, Foreign Minister  Dick Spring, and various other senior officials in a hectic  timetable.    The joint commission was first established in April 1992,  during a visit by the then Irish foreign minister, David  Andrews, when a memorandum of understanding for political and  economic cooperation was signed by the two countries.    In April last year, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for  Euro-American Affairs Mahmud Va'ezi paved the way for the  holding of the second commission, which was original scheduled  for November but delayed until this month.    Velayati's visit is expected to culminate in the inking of a  further cooperation agreement, in such areas as electronics,  computer technology, scientific and cultural exchanges, in which  Ireland has already expressed its interest.</p>

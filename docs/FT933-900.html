			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Kuwait 'to review' purchase of stake in BP KUWAIT said over the weekend that it is to carry out a review of the 'historical background' to its purchase of a 21.7 per cent stake in British Petroleum in the late 1980s. It was responding to a report in the Financial Times that it misled the UK government about the identity of the purchaser of the Dollars 1.7bn BP stake and may have received Pounds 600m in tax refunds to which it was not entitled. The Kuwait Investment Authority, the Kuwait government department in charge of state investments, said: 'We cannot accept the allegations . . . The State of Kuwait never had the intention to mislead the British Authorities'. However, the KIA added: 'In view of the seriousness of the matter and the fact that it took place over five years ago, the Kuwait Investment Authority shall make a review of the historical background prior to making any further comments'. A KIA official said that he was not sure how long the review would take, but it could be completed in as little as a week. Though he was not sure whether the KIA's conclusions would be published in full, he expected a statement to be made when the review was finished. The British government will make the 'necessary investigations' into the report, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said yesterday. But he declined to comment further on the case, citing the confidentiality that surrounds relations between the Inland revenue and taxpayers. A KIA official said that as yet there had been no meetings between Kuwaiti and British officials to discuss the case. The FT reported on Friday that the purchaser of the BP stake, which was bought in late 1987 and early 1988, was the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, the Gulf state's national oil company. At the time of purchase, Kuwaiti officials insisted that the buyer was the Kuwait Investment Office, which is responsible for Kuwait's international investments, on behalf of the state fund, the Reserve for Future Generations. KPC ownership of the shares may mean that more than Pounds 600m of tax refunds which Kuwait received on income from the BP shares is repayable. Kuwait received the Pounds 600m of tax credits because the KIO, as an arm of the Kuwaiti government which makes investments for the state fund, is treated as a sovereign for tax purposes. Under an international convention, sovereigns do not pay tax. However, companies set up by issuing shares, such as KPC, do not qualify for sovereign tax immunity. Meanwhile BP is in a difficult position. On the one hand, it is concerned to be given confirmation of the identity of the purchaser of the shares. But it is equally conscious that one or other Kuwaiti institution is its biggest shareholder with a 9.7 per cent stake.</p>

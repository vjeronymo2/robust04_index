			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Golden touch on brands After Gold Blend, the American Express gold card, St Ivel Gold and Capital Gold, comes Andrex Gold. The toilet, too, can now become the repository of a superior premium product. Scott, the US-owned company which was an early pioneer of a comfortable alternative to scratchy loo paper in the 1940s, is launching in the UK the 'softer, thicker, more absorbent tissue' manufactured using new 'air-dry technology'. While some manufacturers of branded goods are responding to pressure from supermarkets' own-label products by cutting prices, Scott is doing the opposite. Its Andrex Gold will cost about 7 per cent more than ordinary Andrex - already sold at a premium of up to 40 per cent on own-brands. So who is going to buy it? Scott believes purchasers will be 'more downmarket than up, older rather than younger, and more likely to live in the Midlands or the north'. The typical purchaser 'needs reassurance' that she is providing the very best for her family. She - women use a lot more toilet paper than men, as well as being generally responsible for purchasing - will recognise the product's benefits by its name. In spite of a search for alternatives, Scott has fallen back on gold as the most clearly identifiable symbol of superiority. The new sub-brand will be supported by a Pounds 2m advertising and promotional campaign over the next six months. The shock news is that advertisements for Andrex Gold, created by J Walter Thompson, will not feature the puppy. The puppy stands for 'functional, family values' and will be reserved for the standard tissue; the Gold campaign will emphasise 'indulgent, luxurious, stylish' qualities of the new product. The puppy is, however, currently getting a good run on UK television in ads for the main Andrex brand and in an on-pack promotion for Puppy Tales books written by Gerald Durrell. For viewers puzzled by the use of the 'JR Hartley' Yellow Pages music, the plot is as follows: puppy and boy search book shops for Puppy Tales books but find that they are available only through Andrex.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Jakarta, June 27 (AFP) -- Baton-wielding police  and soldiers violently broke up a demonstration Monday involving  some 300 demonstrators protesting the Indonesian Government's  suspension of three popular weekly newspapers.    At least 10 people were arrested and at least several were  injured and bleeding after being struck by security personnel in  a main street here, witnesses said.    Police said there were only four arrests, however.    Hundreds of police in anti-riot gear and soldiers in combat  fatigues and black T-shirts with "Operation Cleansing 1994"  written on them descended on the demonstrators as they marched  toward the Information Ministry.    Many of the marchers were seen being beaten and kicked.    The head of the Central Jakarta police station,  Lieutenant-Colonel Dadang Garnida, said at the site of the  protest that security personnel had no choice but to use "force"  because the demonstrators ignored their demand to disperse.    The demonstrators -- students, human rights activists and  journalists -- held similar protests in front of the information  ministry on the three previous days after the government revoked  the licences of three popular weekly newspapers last Tuesday.  [passage omitted covered by previously filed items]    About two kilometres (a mile) away from the site of the  demonstration, a group of 150 pro-government supporters  favouring the ban on the weeklies gathered for about 45 minutes  before dispersing peacefully, witnesses said.    At the same time, lawyer Adnan Buyung Nasution of the Legal  Aid Foundation, a human rights organisation, was supposed to  lead representatives of three weeklies to new talks with  Information Ministry officials. A first meeting, with  Director-General Subrata, took place Thursday.    Nasution warned earlier that protests against the ban would  spread across Indonesia unless it was lifted.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Green issues take off - Airports are taking pollution to heart Noise pollution is the environmental hazard most people associate with air travel, especially those living close to airports. Other environmental problems, however, may cause an even bigger headache. A wide-ranging report* on airports and the environment published recently set out the issues currently facing the industry. These include the impact on water quality and waste management and the growing concern over the effect of emissions on air quality. It points out that whereas noise is the most noticeable form of pollution, a great deal has been done to reduce it in the last 20 years  - a definition of acceptable noise levels has been set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, a United Nations agency that governs global air transport. In contrast, the complex impact on air and water quality is only just starting to be reviewed and regulated. Civilian aircraft are thought to emit 3 per cent of the carbon dioxide created by humans each year, as well as a similar percentage of nitrous oxide and sulphur dioxide. Although a small percentage, its impact on the ozone layer is likely to be great because it is emitted at a high altitude. The aviation proportion of overall emissions is set to rise as other industries have taken action to reduce emission levels by switching to alternative fuels or introducing devices such as catalytic converters. Anne Paylor, the author of the report, writes: 'It has been said that for every word spoken about noise problems in the aviation industry over the past decade, 10 will be spoken about emissions in the next decade.' The predicted boom in capacity also worries environmentalists. According to the report, global air travel is set to double by the end of the century and treble by 2005. The industry is concentrating on trying to improve air traffic control which would cut delays and excess fuel consumption. A number of airports are also changing their environmental management plans. Manchester airport, the third biggest in the UK, is to launch an environmental strategy document this month which will set out targets in key areas such as emissions, noise, water quality and waste management for airport staff and users, including airlines. While cagey about the exact details of the document, the airport's environment department says it will penalise those who do not operate by its environmental rules. Over the last five years, the airport has spent Pounds 30m on environmental work. It has built a new drainage system to deal with the problem of surface water contamination - particularly that caused by the chemicals found in conventional de-icers - and has a patent application for an infra red-based alternative to chemical-based de-icers. Alan Melrose, environmental control manager at Manchester, says the benefits of such expenditure far outweigh any costs involved. 'The beauty of environmental management is that not only is it self-financing, but certain aspects are the most profitable activities in the business plan.' These include low revenue costs, lower capital costs, improved customer service and working conditions, and publicity. The report concludes that self-regulation and financial investment by airports can represent a high rate of return on investment because of improved efficiency and customer relations. Paylor says: 'Airports have taken this issue to heart because they know that if they don't start acting responsibly now, other people will start to impose horrendous restrictions on them. If they want to grow, they have got to take the initiative.' *Airports and the Environment, MDIS Publications, 8 Eastgate Square, Chichester, West Sussex PO19 1JN. Price Pounds 425.</p>

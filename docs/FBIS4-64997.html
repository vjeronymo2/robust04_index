			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Lentini Case: Borrelli Denies </F> Rumors: No Investigation Notice for Berlusconi"]    [Text] Rome -- Milan's district attorney, Francesco Saverio  Borrelli, yesterday denied the rumors that Prime  Minister-designate Silvio Berlusconi is the subject of an  investigation notice within the context of the inquiry into  Milan soccer club's purchase of Turin player Gianluigi Lentini.  Over the past few days there have been rumors of Berlusconi's  involvement in a deal that prompted the Milan District Attorney  to consider bringing charges of fraudulent accounting against  the club's manager, Adriano Galliani. Yesterday these rumors,  originating from political circles, reappeared, and were  promptly followed by a denial, first from a deputy prosecuting  attorney who is dealing with the case, Francesco Greco, and then  officially, from Borrelli himself.    Wednesday afternoon [4 May] Galliani, Milan's manager, who  is  under investigation in connection with the Lentini case, was  questioned for an hour and a half by [Judges] Di Pietro,  Colombo, Greco, and Davigo. Galliani opted not to answer. The  affair in which he is implicated stems from the purchase of the  player, Lentini, whom Turin sold to Milan for the astronomical  fee of 16.5 billion lire, according to the contract deposited  with the Soccer League, though it seems that considerably more  than that was paid secretly. Colombo dealt with the matter  first; his suspicions were aroused by 6.5 billion lire paid from  abroad. Part of the money came via Switzerland to Borsano, a  Socialist deputy from Turin. The rumors of Berlusconi's  involvement stem from the fact that he has a legal obligation to  monitor any possible irregularities.</p>

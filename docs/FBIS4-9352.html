			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cajnice, 25 Apr (TANJUG) -- The cease-fire on  the Gorazde front is today being violated only by Muslim snipers  firing from the town center in a vain attempt to provoke the  Serbian army, it has been announced in the command of the  Herzegovina Corps [of the Bosnian Serb forces]. The command  says that, in line with the Karadzic-Akashi agreement, the  Serbian forces are today continuing to withdraw to 3 km from the  center of Gorazde, while heavy weapons have been withdrawn to  the agreed distance of 20 km. [passage omitted] Serbian  military sources say that scattered Muslim forces are  withdrawing from the center of Gorazde and regrouping in  Orahovica, northwest of the town, probably planning to link up  with their forces on Mount Igman near Sarajevo.</p>

Among the 1,500 participants in the "Northern Territories Day"  rally at Kudan Kaikan in central Tokyo were Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata and Koshiro Ishida, head of the Management and  Coordination Agency.    A slide presentation on visa-free exchanges between Japan  and  the islands, which were initiated in 1992, and a signature drive  for a petition demanding the return of the islands are scheduled  for Monday afternoon.    Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai group of islets  were seized by Soviet troops at the end of World War II. Japan  has refused to sign a peace treaty or normalize relations with  Moscow without a resolution of the islands issue.    February 7 was the date of the signing of the 1855  Russian-Japanese treaty of commerce, navigation and delimitation  that set the border between Japan and Russia between the islands  of Etorofu and Urup in the Kuril Archipelago.</p>

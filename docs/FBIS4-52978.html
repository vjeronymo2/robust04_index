			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- Some 800 students  affiliated with the South Korean Federation of General Student  Councils (Hanchongnyon) held a rally at Hanyang campus on May 14  demanding the investigation into the Kwangju massacre and the  punishment of those responsible for it, a Seoul-based radio  reported.    Noting that the truth behind the massacre has not yet been  made clear, the ralliers strongly demanded the punishment of  those responsible for it including two former "presidents," Chon  Tu-hwan and No Tae-u.    After the rally, they went out of the campus demanding the  "government"-level investigation and the punishment of the  culprits.</p>

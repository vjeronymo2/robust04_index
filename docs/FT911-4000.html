			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Bush may seek UN forces for northern Iraq THE US may seek United Nations Security Council approval for a UN peace-keeping force in northern Iraq to provide security guarantees to the Kurdish refugees, Vice-president Dan Quayle said yesterday. This would allow the early withdrawal of US marines and other allied forces  -whose presence has drawn protests from Baghdad - in spite of their lead role in erecting the first refugee camps for hundreds of thousands of Kurds trapped in the mountains. Mr Quayle stressed in a television interview that the US presence in northern Iraq was temporary, possibly lasting between 60 and 90 days. Last week, President George Bush abruptly reversed policy and ordered US troops to take up positions inside northern Iraq, to take the lead in the international relief effort and toprovide security to the Kurds. A US military convoy of 50 vehicles moving into the northern town of Zakho to help build a refugee settlement was confronted yesterday by 200 armed Iraqi police whose deployment, the US military said, violated an agreement for Iraqi security forces to withdraw from the town. US and allied commanders met Iraqi army officers on the Iraqi side of the border on Friday and told them to withdraw their forces to a line 30km south of Zakho to make way for refugee havens and to allow residents to return home. Both the marines and the Iraqi police, who seemed to have just emerged from several coaches parked in the town centre, were taken by surprise by the encounter. Moments later, two marine armoured vehicles drove up to the scene and the Iraqi police withdrew. In Baghdad, a delegation of Kurdish leaders started surprise autonomy talks with the Iraqi regime believed to focus on ways of encouraging the return to their homes of some 2m refugees. The leader of the delegation, veteran guerrilla chieftain Jalal Talabani who arrived in Baghdad at the weekend, wants the revival of a 1970 agreement on autonomy for some 4m Iraqi Kurds. A spokesman for the group,which includes representatives of all the main opposition groups, said it would insist that any autonomy agreement to end conflict between Kurds and Baghdad be backed up with guarantees from the international community, preferably the UN. Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the UN delegate in charge of the refugee programme in Iraq and Kuwait, called for 'reconciliation and convergence' between the US desire for early withdrawal and the need for an effective police force to protect the Kurds. The UN effort is centred on providing safe passage for the Kurds to enter refugee camps where they can be fed, sheltered and treated for disease. The next vital step was to encourage the Kurds to go home, said Prince Sadruddin. He came close to hinting that the only country with the authority to persuade the Kurds to go home was the US, with its 'thousands of troops and hundreds of helicopters'. The alternative was to risk creating a permanent Kurdish refugee camp like the Gaza Strip, home of thousands of Palestinians. Iran, meanwhile, voiced strong reservations about the involvement of western governments in the establishment of Kurdish sanctuaries in northern Iraq.

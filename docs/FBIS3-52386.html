			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "The Somali Quagmire and the </F> Pentagon's New Temptations"]    [Text] The Zionist newspaper THE WASHINGTON TIMES,  continuing its reporting on threats by pro-Zionist elements  against the Islamic Republic of Iran, has carried an article  alleging that "America is planning a conflict with Iran and a  war with the Islamic Republic of Iran will be unavoidable."  This newspaper, which has always been run by Zionist  institutions and Jewish American shareholders, especially for  the past half century [as published], cited a Pentagon official  as saying: "During the past 10 years Iran has purchased  billions of dollars of arms; and if we disregard the U.S.  presence in the Persian Gulf, Iran is today the most powerful  military strength in the Persian Gulf."    Such views and comments precisely reflect efforts by a large  segment of the Zionist officials in the U.S. ruling system to  create tension in the Persian Gulf and to prepare the necessary  grounds for a new adventurism in the Middle East.    The article in the Zionist newspaper THE WASHINGTON TIMES  appears after a year of unsettling militarism in the Horn of  Africa. After drawing in most of their Asian and European  allies and treating the United Nations like a puppet in their  hands, the Americans are disgracefully trying to save themselves  from the Somali quagmire. THE WASHINGTON TIMES article comes at  a time when Secretary of Defense Les Aspin has resigned in view  of the defeat of America's unrestrained diplomacy in Somalia and  when, under the crushing pressures of American public opinion,  the President had no alternative but to immediately accept his  resignation.    This is one side of the coin. But the other side should be  sought in the torturing loneliness that America is facing in its  confrontation with the Islamic revolution. The Zionist circles'  propaganda in America is a reflection of the failure that  America has constantly met when seeking Europe's cooperation in  confronting the Islamic revolution.    At least before the U.S. presidential elections, some  political analysts believed that such American pressures on its  allies to encourage them to side with America against the  Islamic Republic of Iran was only the policy of the Republicans  and that the Democrats were not as insistent as the Republicans  on this. But now it has become clear that basically such  methods constitute American policy in general and not the policy  of either Bush or Clinton in particular. In other words, from  the point of view of the White House, hostility to the Islamic  Republic of Iran is not a tactic but a strategy.    America's strategy is to portray Islamic Iran as a regional  and world threat; and they use the tactic of saying that the  Islamic Republic of Iran is a threat to the region, to its  neighbors, and to world peace and security, and that it should  be confronted. The Americans believe that through this policy  they can apply all-around economic, political, and especially  military pressure and thus hinder Iran's economic growth.    The 15-year experience of hostile American stances  vis-a-vis the Islamic revolution and, especially, the eight-year  experience of the oppressive and imposed war against the Islamic  Republic of Iran were testimony to two realities. The first one  is that in a world filled with profit-seeking economic rivalries  and competitions, the breaking down of economic, political, or  military walls and neutralizing hegemonistic plots is not a  complicated matter; the other fact is that there is a basic  necessity for a country in a region which has been the scene of  American-made crises for a decade to strengthen its defensive  structure and strive to achieve military and economic  self-sufficiency. Under such conditions, the Islamic Republic  of Iran cannot be indifferent to issues that are directly linked  to the country's fate and the independence, freedom, territorial  integrity, and security of its people. Therefore, during both  the war and the so-called era of sanctions and today, our  efforts have always been aimed at seriously preserving our  military and operational skills and power and our economic  growth.    The Islamic Republic of Iran wants to achieve a degree of  economic and military strength where no one could be tempted to  start a fresh show of strength and mischief in the region. And  precisely because of this, the belief is that the stronger the  Islamic Republic of Iran's combat ability and economy are, the  more regional peace and stability will benefit, and that this is  the only way that it can maintain its effective role in  preserving regional security. This is a reality of which the  Western world on the one hand and the regional Arab rulers on  the other are aware, despite their propaganda. The Zionist  circles in America are concerned precisely because they know  that with the increasing defensive capability of the Islamic  Republic of Iran, the White House's plans to create chaos in the  region will be foiled. If the regional countries are realistic  and look at past history and regard their situation with  insight, then they will accept this reality more confidently and  will realize that the greater the military strength of Iran, as  the guardian of the longest borders in the Persian Gulf, the  more efficient security in the region will be.    The Americans are trying to put economic, military, and  political pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran specifically  at the Middle East regional level and are pursuing two major  objectives in this process. One is to portray Iran as a threat  and thus to pave the way for their continued illegal presence in  the region and the continued dependence of regional Arab  countries on them; the other is to promote more arms sales.  Thus, on the one hand the return flow of the astronomical sums  from purchases of Persian Gulf oil back into the pockets of  American banks will be ensured, and on the other hand, the  arming of regional regimes will create favorable conditions for  Israel to make excessive demands.    It should be noted that some time after the oil war, the  United States sold billions of dollars of arms--quantities  unprecedented in U.S. history--to the regional Arab countries on  the pretext of creating a balance in the Persian Gulf and  through its extensive propaganda about the Iranian threat.    Nevertheless, the experience of the past 15 years have  proven  that neither economic sanctions nor political, economic, and  military threats by America against the Islamic Republic of Iran  have ever yielded the favorable results that the Americans  expected.    The Islamic Republic of Iran has found its way in an arena  that is filled with world plots, so such ploys will never be  able to force a review of our stances and activities on this  great nation that has tread the path of revolution and the path  of integrity and emerged intact from the most dangerous and  deadly plots.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Arts: Edinburgh circus Look on this circus and on this. Here we see smiling fresh-faced young performers, dressed in fairy tale costumes juggling cheerfully as they spin across the ice. There we see a grotesquely tattooed man known as The Enigma, crunching live locusts and chewing worms. Circus has always been generous in its range, presenting the height of human endeavour in the ring while embracing freaks in its side shows. Today political correctness has forced circuses to specialise and the great Russian Circus on Ice offers escapist delight for children, while Jim Rose's American Circus Sideshow provides acts that usually surface in a Hammer move. Both have their attractions. A man on a monocycle (yawn, yawn); a man on a monocycle skipping (yawn); but a man on a monocycle skipping on ice - now that's entertainment. The performance is sugary in the extreme, but its expertise and physical precision hold the interest, and you expect some camp in a tent. I only closed my eyes once in Jim Rose's tent, erected on Carlton Hill with its stunning views over Edinburgh. That was when the Torture King put needles through his eyes. But it is all done against a backdrop of Rose's genially hysterical commentary which by the end had convinced me with its mock Gothic that at least some of the bodily defying deeds were tricks. This 'circus of the scars' was in its way as camp as its rival in The Meadows.</p>

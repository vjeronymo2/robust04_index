			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Rumours fly as N America trade talks enter critical phase: Officials are meeting to iron out differences TALKS on the North American free-trade agreement (Nafta) reach a critical stage this week, as senior trade negotiators from Canada, Mexico and the US meet in Dallas to bridge differences symbolised by the hundreds of brackets containing individual positions in the current negotiating texts. Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexico's trade minister, said in an interview that if this week's Dallas talks went well, he 'would not be surprised if an agreement was initialled in March'. Nevertheless, he insisted the natural pace of negotiations would determine the timing of the treaty, and not the other way round. Mr Serra seemed unruffled by the possibility that a treaty will be postponed until after the November US congressional and presidential elections. 'Is there a big deal between having a treaty in December rather than July?' he asked, pointing out that a deal was designed to make North America more competitive over decades, not months. His acceptance of political realities is fortunate in view of the message sent to US President George Bush in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary. While it is by no means certain that the protectionism espoused by Mr Pat Buchanan won him a 40 per cent vote in the Republican primary, it is clear that voters are very angry. The president will have to think hard about sending to Congress a treaty which opponents will say would cost American jobs. Under US law, Congress is notified after a treaty is initialled, and 90 days after notification the heads of state sign the (possibly amended) agreement. Assuming the treaty was initialled in mid-March, it would be signed in mid-June. Congress has another 90 working days to vote on the signed treaty; however, this could in effect take anything up to six months to go through, stretching the process up to December 1992. Whether the vote on the treaty was before or after the November elections was, said Mr Serra, largely a question for US congressional Democrat leaders and Mr Bush. The relevant congressmen could hole the treaty up in a committee until after elections or, alternatively, release it early. First the three sides have to initial a treaty, and important differences remain. US representatives insist that concessions must be made by the Mexicans  - in financial services, investment, energy, and agriculture - if the talks are to reach a successful conclusion this year. Mr Serra is adamant that, among other concessions, the US should reform its anti-dumping laws with respect to Mexico and Canada. Unless a substantial number of these differences are hammered out in Dallas, there would be little chance an initialled agreement would be reached by mid-March, says a senior Mexican business executive. Mr Serra generally agrees with this. With the ministers and their working groups in seclusion, opponents of the talks have been reduced to complaining about the secrecy and passing rumours about the status of negotiations. 'The question must be asked: what exactly are the negotiators hiding from the public?' said Mr Pharis Harvey, director of the opposition Mobilisation on Development Trade, Labour and Environment. 'Despite the secrecy and the rosy scenarios painted by officials involved in the negotiations, we do have a clear indication that the impact of a Nafta would be, in fact, quite dire.' In the atmosphere of paranoia it was rumoured that congressmen were being allowed to view the famed 'bracketed text' only by entering alone  - without any materials to take notes - into a guarded, hermetically sealed chamber in the capital. This was disputed by others on Capitol Hill, who insisted that no one had been given access to the negotiating text. An environmentalist closely monitoring the talks reported rumours that the trade representatives were making swift progress. There are really two texts, it is also being claimed. One is for congressional eyes and the other - a 'ministerial text' - will only be revealed at the right moment to stun opponents and speed through the congressional approval process. Mr Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs in Washington and 'a long-time treaty watcher,' said no one had seen a text. 'I've never seen anything like this. Usually we have a verbatim text by now or enough leaks to create a verbatim text.' One industry source said the secrecy was designed to keep the text free of controversy in order to get the job done quickly. However, there was no sign of movement to comply with the two con-ditions congressional Democrats say must be met: an environmental agreement and a workers' adjustment package. Mexican newspapers, by contrast, are filled daily with news on the agreement. Mr Serra has addressed the Mexican Senate seven times on the talks' progress, and has invited almost every important Mexican businessmen to join in the nego-tiations. The trouble is most independent Mexican newspapers seem to take it for granted that the US will decide when the treaty is signed, if it ever is, and what concessions the Mexicans can afford to make. So for them, the relative openness of Mexican officials does not count for much. Instead the US negotiators are treated with reverence, and Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, accorded star status.</p>

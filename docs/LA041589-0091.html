			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ SOCIETY SPECIALIZATION  </P> <P> As president of the Southern California Hot Jazz Society, I feel I must respond  to Leonard Feather's article about the American Federation of Jazz Societies'  annual convention ("Societies Lock Horns Over Image," April 3).  </P> <P> Feather seems to feel that vintage jazz styles no longer have anything to do  with the idiom and that anyone enjoying such music must be ignoring the changes  that have taken place over the years.  </P> <P> No other art form has to carry the burden of arbitrary obsolescence that  Feather requires.  </P> <P> Young artists do need to be recognized. But surely we can accomplish this  without the forced retirements of older artists or those wishing to follow in  their footsteps.  </P> <P> If Leonard Father were the advocate of jazz that he purports to be, he might  refrain from taking gratuitous potshots at some of its more accessible  versions.  </P> <P> JACK WIDMARK  </P> <P> San Pedro  </P></p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Plea on livestock granted Exporters of veal calves yesterday won permission to bring an early High Court challenge to a ban on using Coventry airport to fly livestock to the Continent. Phoenix Aviation and CC Freight, a consortium of farmers and cattle dealers, said they were given permission to use the airport this month. But the Labour-led city council, which owns the airport and has come under pressure from animal rights activists, said no decision had been taken and it was entitled to suspend flights. Sir Christopher Prout QC, for Phoenix and CC Freight, told the High Court that farmers faced losing long-established Continental markets. He told Mr Justice Tucker the trade had been hit by the refusal of ferries to ship live animals. Sir Christopher asked for leave to seek judicial review on the grounds that the council had acted unlawfully and unreasonably. Mr Stuart Isaacs, for the council, said no decision had been taken on the transportation of veal calves from the airport, and the council was still considering the issue. Mr Justice Tucker ordered that a full court hearing be expedited and extended an injunction allowing Phoenix to continue the flights pending the High Court's ruling. Ferrylink Freight Service has halted livestock shipments to the Continent after taking one such shipment from Sheerness, Kent, to the Netherlands last week.</p>

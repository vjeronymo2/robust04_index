			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Feel-not-too-bad factor helps the CDU To many Germans, the Cottbus region of eastern Germany, close to the border with both Poland and the Czech Republic, represents declining brown coal industry, spiralling unemployment and rampaging skinheads. But if Chancellor Helmut Kohl wins the election this Sunday it will be partly because life is a good deal better than it seems in places like Cottbus. The Chancellor himself is criticised for promising more than he could deliver in 1990 and this week drew only 4,000 people to the town centre, compared with 100,000 in 1990. Nevertheless, Chancellor Kohl's 4,000 was ten times larger than the crowd attracted two weeks before by Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the Social Democrat deputy leader. Voting for the local council is divided evenly between the Christian Democrats, Social Democrats and the PDS, the former communists, but politics is characterised more by apathy than extremism. Unemployment is high but the men who drink beer at the snack bars all day are not representative. Indeed, at 14.6 per cent, unemployment is high, but is down from 18 per cent. Seventy per cent of the 42,000 registered unemployed in the region are women, according to Mr Karl Fuhrmann, head of the federal labour office in Cottbus. For men it is only 8.2 per cent - around the all-German average - but for women it is 21.4 per cent. This is surprising given the recent restructuring of coal mining and other heavy industries. Part of the explanation is that women used to dominate in the now-decimated textile and chemical industries. They also tended to occupy the least qualified jobs in public administration which were the first to be cut. The social net is more than holding together, albeit at high cost to Germany's public finances. 'There is no classical poverty here, and the unemployed are a lot better off than the people in Poland just a few miles away,' says Mr Fuhrmann. According to Ms Karin Tesker, a west German who works helping with unemployed east German women, some married women are relieved that the enforced full employment of the old regime is past and they need not work. Mrs Uta Langfeld, from the local club for the unemployed, agrees that the stress of unemployment is more psychological than financial. The real pain of adjustment, she says, has fallen on the 40-50 age group. Pensioners are far better off and the young find it easier to adapt.</p>

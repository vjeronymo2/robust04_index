			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Curtailing Farm Price Rises Urged"] </F>   [Text] The State Administration for Commodities Prices is  urging its provincial branches to slow the spiralling prices of  farm products.    The administration has issued a circular asking its branches  to consider various maximum price increases for major  agricultural products.    Administration officials cautioned that retailers should not  violate the administration's ceilings for price rises since the  limits already take into account retailers' costs, such as taxes  and transportation, and profit margins.    Domestic prices of edible oil, cotton and chemical  fertilizer  have been increasing by big margins, according to the Ministry  of Internal Trade.    The ministry's figures show the average price of soya-bean  oil, peanut oil and rapeseed oil jumped 43.2 per cent to 7,014  yuan ($806.20) a ton from November to last month the off-season  in the year-round agricultural production cycle.    Last month the administration's Harbin branch in  Heilongjiang  forged ahead of other provincial-level branches to hold down  local prices of edible oil by setting the maximum increases at  7.40 yuan ($0.85) per kilogram.    Cotton prices, too, are spiralling because of a severe  shortage of supply. In mid-April, a ton of 21-count yarn  fetched an average 24,000 yuan ($2,758.60), up 2,000 yuan ($230)  from the beginning of 1993.    Because of the soaring costs, most of the country's  cotton-spinning factories are on the verge of suspending  production.    The situation is worst in Sichuan Province, where at least a  third of all cotton-spinning factories have already stopped  production because of the cotton shortage.    Prices are also on the rise for chemical fertilizer.  Analysts blame the rocketing costs of production materials and  imports for the 11.9 per cent jump since last year in the  average price for imported and domestically made carbamide. The  price now stands at 1,240 yuan ($142) a ton.</p>

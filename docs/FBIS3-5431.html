He told reporters at the Bishan East  PAP [People's Action Party] Women's Wing function: "Whether it  is a large group of foreign workers or one individual being  caned, it doesn't affect bilateral relations that countries  build up over the years. There are broader interests between  countries than just the behaviour of individual citizens. Every  country looks at relations based on national interests."    He added that, ultimately, it was the prerogative of each  country to administer the law in its own way. "And that, we  expect of America, whose citizens are here. And similarly, we  expect the same of Singaporeans when they go abroad."    Fay was sentenced to four months' jail, six strokes of the  cane and was ordered to pay a $3,500 fine after he pleaded  guilty to two charges of mischief and one charge of dishonestly  retaining stolen property. The American community, through the  embassy and its business council, has expressed concern over the  caning sentence.</p>

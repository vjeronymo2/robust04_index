			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Clinton to press for troops pullout from Baltics President Bill Clinton's meeting in Riga today with the presidents of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia marks a renewed effort by the US to complete agreements for the withdrawal of Russian troops from the three Baltic countries by August 31. US officials say the visit to the Latvian capital - the first by a US president to a Baltic country - is a signal of the Clinton administration's commitment to the three countries. Their annexation by the Soviet Union was never recognised by the US. 'This trip is meant to say: we support the independence of the Baltic countries and their future is important to the US,' a senior administration official said. Russian troops have already withdrawn from Lithuania and an agreement was signed in April for a withdrawal from Latvia. 'What is missing in this equation is an agreement between Russia and Estonia,' a US official said. Negotiations are under way this week in Geneva and Mr Clinton is expected to use his meeting later in the week with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia at the Group of Seven industrialised nations' summit in Naples to press for an agreement. Issues unresolved include the status of retired Russian military personnel who have settled in Estonia; the status of a naval research base; and the availability of housing for Russian officers returning from Estonia. Mr Clinton is also expected to raise US concerns about the restrictive citizenship law recently passed by the Latvian parliament which raises anxieties in Moscow over the status of ethnic Russians. The law has been rejected by Latvia's president.</p>

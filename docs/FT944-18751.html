			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Arts: A momentous 'Salome' in Leipzig - Since unification Udo Zimmermann has given the Opera a distinctive profile Five years after the fall of Communism, Leipzig has emerged as east Germany's operatic success story. Unlike numerous counterparts in west Germany, the Leipzig Opera has not allowed financial pressure to sap morale or artistic vitality. Seizing its new-found freedom, it has staked its claim to an international reputation with a string of notable productions, the latest of which is Salome. The Leipzig Opera spent most of the Communist era out of the international gaze. With standards that were no more than provincial, it was content to play second fiddle to the world-renowned Gewandhaus Orchestra. German unification brought job losses and a fall in audience  - but there has been no navel-gazing. Thanks to dynamic leadership by the east German composer Udo Zimmermann, the company has emerged leaner, fitter and with a keen sense of purpose. This has been achieved against considerable odds. The DM73m (Pounds 30m) budget is considerably less than Dresden, and will almost certainly be cut in the coming year. As well as a full opera and ballet programme, the company runs a separate theatre devoted to operetta - the only German opera house to do so. The Leipzig public is conservative and its politicians want value for money. That has not stopped Zimmermann taking risks. Since his arrival in 1990, the programme has been dominated by 20th century operas and unconventional directors. In his first two seasons, there were strong productions of Busoni's Doktor Faust and Ligeti's Le grand macabre. For its 300th anniversary last year, the company laid on eight weeks of ambitious programming, including Stockhausen's Dienstag aus Licht and a staging of Boris Godunov by the film director Istvan Szabo. Leipzig basked in the publicity this generated. After a pause for breath last season, the company has returned to the offensive. Salome had a hand-picked cast of international singers, most of them undertaking their roles for the first time. The next production is Schoenberg's Moses und Aron, to be staged by the Hungarian-Jewish dramatist George Tabori. The radical east German producer Peter Konwitschny will tackle Tchaikovsky's Onegin in January, and Leipzig hosts its first Festival of Contemporary Music Theatre next March. Zimmermann is now negotiating with Covent Garden to co-produce Henze's Das verratene Meer. Without losing sight of bread-and-butter repertoire, Zimmermann wants to give Leipzig a distinctive profile. He says the most successful opera houses are not necessarily those with the biggest budget. 'You can't make sensible judgments by comparing DM73m here with DM110m there. What counts is the amount of fantasy and innovation you see on stage. We want to show that in art, as in business, Leipzig is a city which is open to the world - that we are catering for a European public as well as the local taxpayer.' Salome had an incontrovertible grandeur - the kind of performance that generates an enthralling momentum and transforms one's view of a work. It had the advantage of the Gewandhaus Orchestra in full cry, and a conductor - Jiri Kout - who was in complete command of the score and of the forces in front of him. Rarely does one hear so many unforced instrumental subtleties combined with such an effortless surge of sound, all placed at the service of the stage drama. Nikolaus Lehnhoff updated the story to the present - but unlike so many other German producers who adopt the same technique, he offered fresh insights, while preserving the opera's fundamental dramatic relationships. Here was a decadent ruling order in the process of collapse - a timeless portrait with clear echoes of our own late-20th century world. The action unfolded in the backyard of a concrete palace. Herod, his family and courtiers wore chic evening dress. Jochanaan was a long-haired preacher, guarded by a half-naked muscle-man who doubled as the angel of death. The designs by Hans-Martin Scholder and Jorge Jara included a few kitschy details, but each character was skilfully drawn, and the climactic moments were targeted with bull's-eye accuracy. The Danish soprano Inga Nielsen was an unexpectedly strong Salome. The voice may not be big, but it has a pure timbre and ample penetration. Her pacing was immaculate - the final soliloquy was a tour de force - and she built the Dance of the Seven Veils into a powerful crescendo, whipping Herod with jewels before stripping as she withdrew. With short, sleeked-back hair and an imperious manner that spoke volumes, Anja Silja made an unforgettable Herodias, while Jacque Trussel's suave Herod was a refreshing change from the usual character-tenor caricature. As Jochanaan, Falk Struckmann confirmed his status as Germany's leading younger-generation bass-baritone. Christopher Ventris's Narraboth and Annette Markert's Page - not to mention a brilliant quintet of Jews - were a tribute to the quality of the home ensemble.</p>

Department of State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Summary of Response Mission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of State (DOS) is responsible for the conduct of relations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the U.S. Government and other governments and international organizations and for the protection of U.S. interests and citizens abroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a radiological emergency outside the United States, DOS is responsible for coordinating U.S. Government actions concerning the event in the country where it occurs (including evacuation of U.S. citizens, if necessary) and internationally. Should the FRERP be invoked due to the need for domestic action, DOS will continue to hold this role within the FRPCC structure. Specifically, DOS will coordinate foreign information-gathering activities and, in particular, conduct all contacts with foreign governments except in cases where existing bilateral agreements permit direct agency-to-agency cooperation. In the latter situation, the U.S. agency will keep DOS fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informed of all communications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a domestic radiological emergency with potential international trans-boundary consequences, DOS will coordinate all contacts with foreign governments and agencies except where existing bilateral agreements provide for direct exchange of information. DOS is responsible for conveying the U.S. Government response to foreign offers of assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Capabilities and Resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The State Department maintains embassies, missions, interest sections (in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> countries where the United States does not have diplomatic relations), and consulates throughout the world. The State Department Operations Center is capable of secure, immediate, around-the-clock communications with diplomatic posts. The diplomatic personnel stationed at a post are knowledgeable of local factors important to clear and concise communication, and frequently speak the local language. The Ambassador is the President's personal representative to the host government, and his country team is responsible for coordinating official contacts between the U.S. Government and the host government or international organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

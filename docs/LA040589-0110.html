			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE GET BREAK WITH PHOTOS OF GANG ATTACK; 2 YOUTHS STABBED, 5 ARE ARRESTED  </P> <P> In what Santa Monica police detectives described as a rare break in their  efforts to stem gang violence, a passer-by captured on film an attack on the  edge of Santa Monica College that left two juveniles in critical condition with  stab wounds.  </P> <P> Five people were arrested in connection with the attack and booked for  investigation of attempted murder. Police said the photographs, released  Tuesday, will be used as evidence.  </P> <P> "You just don't find this kind of evidence," Detective Shane Talbot said. "The  only thing that would be better is a video camera."  </P> <P> The fight broke out at 7 p.m. Monday at a hamburger stand near Pico Boulevard  and 18th Street, across the street from the campus. Police said several members  of a Venice gang jumped two Santa Monica youths as "pay-back" for an alleged  earlier attack by Santa Monica gang members on Venice rivals.  </P> <P> One 16-year-old boy from Venice was stabbed in the first minutes of the fight  and staggered, bleeding, across the street to fall a few yards from the office  of the college's president, police and witnesses said. A second youth, a  17-year-old from Santa Monica, was tackled by five Venice gang members near a  crowded bus stop, beaten and kicked before one of his attackers stabbed him,  Talbot said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called to Scene  </P> <P> Police were called to the scene by a city bus driver. The youths fled onto  campus and down an alley near 20th Street. Police chased them, an officer fired  a shot and the youths stopped and were arrested, Santa Monica Police Sgt. John  Meihle said.  </P> <P> Only later did officers learn that a passer-by had captured part of the  incident on film.  </P> <P> One of the passer-by's photographs showed five youths crouched over a sixth, in  what police said was a beating that preceded the stabbing. Police said another  of the at least five photographs showed youths carrying long sticks as they  fled the scene.  </P> <P> Police refused to identify the photographer. In a brief telephone conversation  with The Times, the photographer declined to be interviewed, citing fears of  retaliation.  </P> <P> Police released only one of the photographs, inking out the faces of juveniles  in the picture. Talbot said the picture was released to "encourage people to  come forward and . . . put the message out to other gang-bangers to go  somewhere else."  </P> <P> Authorities said it often is difficult to find witnesses to Southern  California's gang stabbings and drive-by shootings. Police and prosecutors said  the photographs of the Santa Monica attack have allowed them to identify  potential witnesses and have armed them with extraordinary evidence.  </P> <P> "Generally, it's hard enough to get witnesses to come in and tell us what they  saw with their own eyes," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Paula Palmer, who will handle  the case.  </P> <P> She had not yet seen the pictures, but said, "I anticipate the photos will be  very helpful."  </P> <P> Initially, seven men and boys were arrested. One juvenile was released when it  was determined that he had not been involved in the fight, and one adult was  held on unrelated allegations of parole violations.  </P> <P> The other five -- plus the 16-year-old who is in the hospital -- are expected  to face counts of attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon, police  said. Arraignment was scheduled for today.  </P> <P> The three adults who were in custody were identified by police as Lucio Miguel  Raygosa, 24; Kenneth Hernandez Waller, 19, and Miguel Morales Sanez, 18, all of  Venice. Names for the juveniles in custody -- a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old  -- were not released. The names of the two youths being treated at UCLA Medical  Center and Santa Monica Hospital were also not released.  </P> <P> Santa Monica College is located on the border of the city's Pico neighborhood,  a traditionally low-income area troubled by sporadic gang violence and drug  peddling.  </P> <P> Police said the scale of crime in no way compares to other parts of the Los  Angeles area, but gangs are known to frequent the neighborhood.  </P></p>

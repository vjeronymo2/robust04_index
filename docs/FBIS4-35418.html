			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ayman al-Safadi] </F>   [Text] Amman -- A senior government official Monday [30  May] reasserted Jordan's neutrality on the civil war in Yemen,  saying the Kingdom only supports the unity of the Yemeni people  and the quest for a peaceful settlement to the conflict.    "We are with legitimacy in Yemen, with the unity of its land  and with respecting the reconciliation accord" which was signed  in Amman in February by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  and his then-Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Information  Minister Jawad al-'Anani told the Jordan Times Monday.    Dr. al-'Anani said the Kingdom has not taken sides with  either of the parties to the conflict, which developed into  civil war on May 4. He said the official media's reference to  the government in Aden as "the legitimate government" and to the  forces of Mr. al-Bid as the "secessionists" does not mean that  the Kingdom has sided with Sanaa against Aden.    "Jordan supports the unity of Yemen," he said. It did not  therefore refer to the warring parties as north and south  because that "would mean you have accepted the secession," Dr.  al-'Anani said.    "We will not take a stand against legitimacy and say north  and south," he said.    The position of the official media is right. They are  calling things by their name because those who declared  secession are secessionists," former foreign minister, Deputy  Abdallah al-Nusur told the Jordan Times.    Insisting that this position does not mean the Kingdom has  taken sides with either of the conflicting parties in yemen, Dr.  al-Nusur said "Jordan has a record of not interfering in the  internal affairs of any other country."    Though blaming the south for seceding, Islamic Action Front  (IAF) deputy 'Abd al-Rahim 'Ukur said: "We did not hear any  Jordanian official saying the Kingdom has taken sides in the  conflict."    Dr. 'Ukur blamed Arab regimes that he said have supported  one  party in Yemen against the other, adding that "these attitudes  only serve the objectives of the United States and its satellite  states in the region.    Jordan supports the unity of the Yemeni people and land but  does not work to impose anything on them, Lower House of  Parliament member Salih Irshaydat said.    If this support of unity was interpreted to mean that the  Kingdom has taken sides in the conflict then that is a wrong  interpretation, he said.    "We are with unity as long as it is the wish of the Yemeni  people," Dr. Irshaydat said.    His Majesty King Husayn had earlier said that the Kingdom  will provide humanitarian assistance to Yemen but will not  interfere in the internal affairs of the war-torn Arab peninsula  country.    North Yemen has previously rejected any foreign intervention  in the civil war, which has been raging for over three weeks  without leading to a decisive military victory.    Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali had said that Jordan  would not mediate in the conflict unless both parties to it  agree on its role, adding that the Kingdom would not "interfere  in support of either parties to the crisis."    AKHIR KHABAR Arab daily Monday reported that a group of  journalists it did not name have protested to Dr. al-'Anani what  it called "the biased coverage of the Yemeni war by the official  media."    The paper quoted the group as telling the minisiter in a  statement that such an attitude would not allow Jordan to play  any positive role in trying to mediate the conflict in the  future.</p>

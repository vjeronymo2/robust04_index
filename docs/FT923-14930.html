			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / How to Spend It: Room to spare on a trip of a lifetime IF THE gloom and doom in the last few months has got you down, if you feel in need of a treat, there are now a few places available on the very last Weekend FT safari to Zimbabwe. Last year's safari - led by John Stevens and Gavin Ford, whom I consider two of the finest guides in Africa - was such a success that we set up a second one, with the same two fine guides, for this September (from the 12th to the 28th). A few readers have, for personal reasons, had to cancel, so anybody longing to get away and with Pounds 3,028 to spend on the safari of a lifetime now has a chance. Remember that the price is inclusive of almost everything, including canoeing down the Zambezi, tented camps in the bush and beside the river and a three-day walking excursion in the middle. You will be happy to hear that in the Zambezi valley, where this safari is based, the rains have been normal - it is Southern Zimbabwe that is suffering so terribly. More details either from this office (071-873-3000) or Primrose Stobbs at Abercrombie &amp; Kent (071-730-9600).</p>

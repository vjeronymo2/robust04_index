			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Gatt sounds warning over EC preferential trading - How fears of a 'fortress Europe' have proven unjustified as markets become more open THE European Community's single market programme has generally made its markets more open to foreign trade and fears of a 'fortress Europe' have so far proved unjustified, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade concludes in its second review of EC trade policies. However, Gatt's economists remain concerned about the extension of preferential trading arrangements, which apply to three-quarters of EC external trade. The report also warns that economic recession, compounded by problems related to German reunification, eastern Europe and the stalemate in the Gatt trade talks, 'has increased the risk that more defensive trade policies will be followed'. The cautiously favourable tone of the report is in marked contrast to the highly critical approach of Gatt's first EC review in April 1991. EC officials, calling the latest assessment 'pretty fair', said this reflected trade liberalising developments over the past two years and a less severe attitude on Gatt's part towards preferential trade accords. The single European market, designed to ensure the free flow of goods, services, capital and labour from January this year, has 'improved access, transparency and legal security in many sectors,' the report says. Many national import restrictions, especially on goods from Asia or eastern Europe, have been scrapped. The Community has also taken steps to liberalise a number of industrial sectors - notably telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and coal - by harmonising standards and regulations, reducing entry barriers and introducing competition into previously strictly controlled areas. In several sensitive areas, however, the picture is less clear cut. In steel, Gatt notes that subsidies have been curbed and voluntary restraint arrangements with the US abandoned. At the same time, 'the EC's resolve to defend these achievements is under challenge' from stronger import competition, a 'dramatic decline' in domestic demand and deteriorating export markets, exacerbated by countervailing and anti-dumping actions in the US and Canada. EC import surveillance remains in force and some steel imports from central Europe and Egypt have recently been subjected to anti-dumping duties or price undertakings, the report notes. Elsewhere, Community-wide restraints have replaced the previous maze of national import curbs, for example on cars, bananas and canned tuna and sardines. The uneasy 'consensus' with Japan on cars is intended to provide temporary and declining relief for EC producers until full liberalisation by the year 2000. However, the new banana import regime is under challenge in Gatt from Latin American producers who face tougher restrictions in the unified market. EC agriculture in general remains highly protected, with about one-half of farm income coming from price and other supports, according to Gatt. The reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy agreed last year imply a significant decline from 1993-94 onwards in levels of price support for cereals, beef and veal. But while reduced support may cut overproduction and exports, the impact on import demand is less clear. Other subsidised products, especially milk and sugar, 'are largely unaffected by the reform package,' the report says. Gatt has similarly equivocal views on the extension of EC preferential trading arrangements to the European Free Trade Association, central and eastern Europe, and Mediterranean countries. This has led to 'a complex hierarchy' of overlapping preferential trading systems within Europe, spreading outwards from the EC to the European Economic Area agreements with Efta countries (except Switzerland), the Europe Agreements with central and eastern European countries and parallel agreements among the Ceecs and between them and Efta members. While these moves liberalise trade in many products, they depart further from Gatt's non-discriminatory trading principles, the report says. EC officials counter that less than 30 per cent of imports actually benefit from preferences and that, with trade representing a quarter of GDP, the Community is a more open economy than either the US or Japan. Easy access to the EC market is seen as vital for eastern and central Europe. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria sent 75 per cent of their total exports to the Community in 1991, roughly half of which entered duty-free. Gatt's economists praise the EC for its commitment not to take unilateral action in pursuing trade grievances where multilateral remedies exist (making an implicit comparison with the United States). However, they are concerned about frequent EC recourse to anti-dumping action, and the use of safeguard provisions under the new Europe Agreements which Gatt says may be contrary to international fair trade rules. The report warns that recent moves to give the executive European Commission more powers in trade policy matters, for example in anti-dumping cases, may increase flexibility but may also make decision-making more vulnerable to short-term pressures and vested interests. That danger, Gatt argues, makes it all the more vital to conclude a successful Uruguay Round agreement that would put in place a stable and effective framework of multilateral rules and disciplines.</p>

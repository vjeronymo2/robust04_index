			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Arts: The Bolshoy exposed - The difficulties of dancing at the Albert Hall WATCHING the Bolshoy Ballet in the Albert Hall is an odd and slightly disorientating experience. There, exposed on a large and unflattering thrust stage, is one of the world's greatest dance companies - or two-thirds of it: this is not the full 250-strong ensemble - straining every muscle to tell us about the physical exhilaration of its way of moving. And there, brightly visible, is the BBC Concert orchestra, playing excellently, and providing an alternative spectacle when - as during the infinitely tedious Legend of Love on Friday night - you have to look away from a horde of rhubarbing men dressed like Ali Baba and his forty chums. (Compliments to the two trumpeters who dealt so featly with Arif Melikov's Brummagem score.) And no less obviously there, the packed and encircling ranks of the audience, well illuminated by the light-spill from the stage. 'What can they see so far round to the side?' you wonder. Excellent views of head-gear and the zip-fastenings at the back of the costumes, I'd hazard, though Yury Grigorovich has been a pains to spread his dances wide and open them out to as much of the public as possible. And what do we actually see? As a Bolshoy devotee for four decades, and one who has watched the company in many theatres, I recognise some of the qualities I love with the troupe. Grandeur of scale, certainly, and dedication to the idea of performance - nothing perfunctory, or time-serving in interpretation. On these terms, the suite from Ivan the Terrible, which opened Thursday's programme, was the best thing so far, and the one most 'like' its original in the theatre. The sweeping crowd of boyars and guards, and the Tsar's full-throttle hysteria, that make the fabric of the piece, were potent, and though Alexander Vetrov and Alla Mikhalchenko could not efface memories of earlier interpreters of Ivan and his beloved Anastasia, the fire of Grigorovich's theatrical vision blazed truly, and in Andrey Uvarov we saw a magnificent Kurbsky - and a magnificent young danseur. But the irresistible sweep of a performance in the theatre, that marvellous sense in which we can be drawn into a production by Bolshoy unity of style and devotion to the artistic cause of a ballet, is inevitably missing. The Nutcracker was a perfunctory batch of divertissements - and under proper conditions Grigorovich's staging is touching and magical - while the Legend of Love suite must surely have proved incomprehensible to an audience on dramatic terms. I have always thought it Grigorovich's weakest work - because ethnically quaint about Persia - and at the Albert Hall it looked as if far too many people were impersonating Wilson, Keppel and Betty in their convulsingly sober sand-dance. It also lasted a thousand and one nights. Maybe more. And as I suggested in earlier comment, the principals' performances are undermined by the lack of a proscenium arch to frame their interpretations, and are dwarfed by the spaces of the hall around them. (Extraordinary to write that about Bolshoy dancers whose artistry in the past has seemed to reach out of the theatre to touch the world.) Yet if the company has not yet shown us talents to rival those of recent seasons - Bessmertnova, Semenyaka, Ananiashvili, Mukhamedov, Posokhov, Fadeyechev - it remains the Bolshoy still, by force of dance presence and by the grand distinction of its manner. But it is also the Bolshoy in the market place, a victim of the need for hard currency, for bigger halls and bigger bucks. And that is bad news. The Bolshoy Ballet continues at the Albert Hall until February 14: programming varies nightly</p>

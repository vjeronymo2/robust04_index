			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Philip Morris net climbs 19.6% PHILIP Morris, the cigarette, food and beer manufacturer, reported a 19.6 per cent increase in second-quarter after-tax profits to Dollars 1.35bn. The double-digit advance was scored on a 2.6 per cent increase in revenues, to Dollars 15.2bn. It takes Philip Morris's net profits for the first half of 1992 to Dollars 2.45bn. In the same period of 1991, it made Dollars 2.05bn - ahead of an accounting change charge. Mr Michael Miles, chairman, said: 'We expect the company's strong net earnings trend to continue for the remainder of the year.' On the tobacco front, Philip Morris saw second-quarter operating profits rise 13.6 per cent to Dollars 1.96bn, on revenues of Dollars 6.57bn, with international tobacco operations chipping in Dollars 499m against Dollars 435m. Cigarette volume was down 2.3 per cent at Dollars 163.2bn. The company blamed this on delayed shipments to Russia 'pending the resolution of financing arrangements'. Although Philip Morris's share of the domestic premium brand market slipped to 36.6 per cent, from 37.2 per cent, its total domestic market share improved from 44.6 to 45 per cent year-on-year.

SURVIVING ACCIDENTS, KILLER EXAMS, VOLCANO  </P> <P> It doesn't take getting hit on the head by a horseshoe as you kneel to pluck a  four-leaf clover or pick up your rabbit's foot to know that a lot of what  happens to us, happens because of luck.  </P> <P> Saturday is St. Patrick's Day -- "luck of the Irish" and all -- so as you're  getting the green out, Hot Topics wonders, "What's the luckiest thing that's  ever happened to you?"  </P> <P> "On our way to Miami, the engine fell off our airborne airplane.

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Mexico economic growth at seven-year low: Government blames restructuring of country's private sector Mexico's economy grew 0.4 per cent last year, the lowest rate for seven years, and far short of the November government forecast of 1.1 per cent, government statistics show. For the first time in the administration of President Carlos Salinas, economic growth has been outstripped by population growth. The manufacturing sector shrank by 1.5 per cent from 1992, with the textile industry declining by 7.4 per cent, printing and publishing by 6.4 per cent, and timber by 10.1 per cent. The service and agricultural sectors grew by 0.9 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively. The government has blamed the low overall growth and recession in manufacturing on the restructuring of Mexico's private sector, as companies closed or reduced operations to compete under free trade. However Mexico's strong exchange rate and high real interest rates and the government budget surplus have made the process of restructuring deeper and more costly than had been forecast. The 0.4 per cent growth for the year would imply a growth of 0.15 per cent for the fourth quarter, suggesting that the economy has recovered from the third quarter, when it contracted by 1.1 per cent. The government also announced that Mexico's trade deficit fell to Dollars 13.6bn (Pounds 9.3bn) in 1993, a 15.1 per cent reduction on the previous year. The low economic growth helped slow growth in imports to 5.2 per cent, to reach Dollars 65.4bn in total. Imports of capital goods fell by 4.7 per cent, an indication of the difficulties faced by the private sector last year. Mexico's exports reached Dollars 51.8bn last year, an increase of 12.2 per cent. Manufacturing exports, which account for about half the total, increased by 17.7 per cent.</p>

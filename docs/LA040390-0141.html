			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> OFFICE FOR SCHOOLS IS A HAZARD IN QUAKE  </P> <P> The Orange Unified School District this week is expected to release a study  showing that the district's administration building is likely to collapse  during a major earthquake, a district official said.  </P> <P> "Under normal, daily activity, the building is probably OK," said John Perry,  assistant superintendent for business services.  </P> <P> "The danger would come in with an earthquake of high-magnitude proportions."  </P> <P> District officials have long suspected that the office building at 370 N.  Glassell St. in Orange might not withstand a large temblor, Perry said, noting  that previous quakes have left cracks in the walls.  </P> <P> Perry noted that the district is aware of structural problems and, in  accordance with the state law, has posted signs throughout the  unreinforced-masonry building that warn workers and visitors of the hazard.  </P> <P> The engineer's study will have the information the school board needs to  determine whether the building is safe from a liability standpoint. The report  is expected to conclude that moving to a new building would be cheaper than  reinforcing the existing one.  </P></p>

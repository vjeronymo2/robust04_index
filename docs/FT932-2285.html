			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Death meets environmental health: EC emission directives are worrying the crematorium industry AS THE LATEST round of environmental legislation comes into force, Britain's crematorium business is facing its biggest shake-up for decades. Almost all of Britain's 236 crematoria must, over the next five years, replace or refit their 700 cremators - as the incinerators are discreetly called - at an estimated cost of Pounds 80m to comply with new regulations on industrial emissions. The move has delighted Britain's tiny cremator making industry, provoked bitter protests from crematorium operators, triggered a rapid rise in cremation charges - and prompted many local authorities to reconsider the management of their crematoria. With a cremation rate of nearly 70 per cent - 90 per cent in London  - Britain has the highest level of cremation in the Western world. Mr Jon Luby, director of the Federation of British Crematorium Authorities, said: 'Crematoria are not something that people usually notice. But it's a very important service, and this is going to mean big changes.' The turmoil in the normally sedate business has been prompted by the 1990 Environmental Protection Act. In accordance with European Community directives on air pollution this requires crematoria to introduce stringent monitoring and cut emissions by raising the temperature in their cremators by 200 degrees to 850 degrees, lengthening each operation by several seconds. The Department of the Environment insists that these measures are needed to reduce the gases - including chloride and carbon monoxide  - it believes are emitted by cremators. 'In technical terms cremators are like any other incinerator, so the industry has to be controlled like any business,' the department said. Since crematoria tended to be in residential areas, the risk from emissions was particularly high, it added. Crematorium operators argue that the legislation is draconian, going far beyond the EC requirements. They say it will be counter-productive in environmental terms - the NIFES environmental consultancy group says operating the cremators at higher temperatures will raise annual running costs by Pounds 4m across the country in addition to the Pounds 80m replacement costs, and use an extra 9m therms of gas. Mr Luby said: 'The whole of the country's cremators don't emit as much pollution as one Boeing aeroplane.' With many local authorities unable to meet the cost of the capital investment, estimated to be about Pounds 450,000 for most crematoria, which on average have three cremators, most operators have responded to the changes by levying an 'environmental surcharge'. Since the introduction of the legislation, charges have risen by a third, bringing the average cost of a cremation to Pounds 134 - still well below the cost of funerals. At the same time, many councils are considering another option - tendering crematorium management out to the private sector. Only 15 per cent of Britain's 236 crematoria are privately owned but the number is rising, as companies such as Great Southern Group, which owns 11 crematoria, seek to expand their business. Mr Eric Spencer, chief executive of Southern Group, said: 'It's a very specialised business. You cannot go into it expecting an immediate return on your capital investment.' The company makes a Pounds 1.3m profit from the business each year. It opens a new crematorium in Aberdeen next month. For the moment the prospects for the business seem fairly healthy - after 50 years of rapid growth the cremation rate seems steady, while number of deaths is predicted to rise by the end of the decade.</p>

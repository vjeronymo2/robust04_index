			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 145 ACRES OF WOODLANDS PURCHASED FOR NEW  PARK  </P> <P> The purchase of 145 acres of pristine woodlands west of Santa Clarita for a new  park -- a move that could hinder plans by the county to open a garbage dump in  the area -- was announced Wednesday by an environmental group and state Sen. Ed  Davis (R-Valencia).  </P> <P> Davis said the new Towsley Canyon Park, which was immediately opened to the  public, is the first step toward creating a proposed 6,000-acre Santa Clarita  Woodlands State Park west of Santa Clarita and north of Granada Hills.  </P> <P> The purchase is considered a victory for the Santa Monica Mountains  Conservancy, which has been competing with the county sanitation districts to  buy land in and around Towsley Canyon.  </P></p>

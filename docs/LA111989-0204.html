			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABOUT REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN PURCHASING A HOME FOR RETIREMENT  </P> <P> QUESTION: My husband and I would like to purchase a retirement home. We are in  our mid-70s, and it would be our first home purchase. We are completely  inexperienced in such matters. What are the best steps to take?  </P> <P> Would we be wise to have an inspection and a title search? When should we  obtain a lawyer? What other items should we look out for? Also, we are  considering paying all cash. Do you think this is wise for people in our age  bracket?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Whether you are buying a retirement home or any other residential real  estate, there are a number of issues -- both legal and financial -- that should  be considered before signing the contract to purchase.  </P> <P> Obviously, the very first question is whether the area and the property you are  considering meet your needs. While you indicate that you are in your mid-70s,  one hopes that you will live a long time, and thus it is important to determine  whether the neighborhood is convenient for your needs.  </P> <P> Are there adequate shopping facilities nearby, so that you do not have to worry  about driving or other transportation merely to get groceries? Are there any  plans for development in the area? You should investigate these matters with  the local community planning officials in the town or county where you are  looking to buy.  </P> <P> Once you decide on a particular house, I recommend that you discuss the  purchase with all of your advisers and with your family. From a financial point  of view, can you afford the house? From a legal point of view, you should  obtain a knowledgeable real estate lawyer who will be representing your  interest -- and only your interests.  </P> <P> I strongly recommend that the contract you sign to purchase the property should  include at least the following:  </P> <P>  -- Contingency on a satisfactory inspection by a building inspector of your  choice.  </P> <P> You want an independent professional to carefully inspect the property, to make  sure that it is structurally sound and to make sure that the mechanical  equipment is not only in operating condition, but has a long useful life  remaining. Obviously, you do not want to consider buying a house where the  furnace may go bad in a year or two or the air conditioning system may be on  its last legs.  </P> <P>  -- Contingency on financing.  </P> <P> You asked whether you should pay all cash for your house. There is no easy  answer to this question. Much depends on your own financial situation. If, for  example, you are considering buying a property worth $150,000, and if you have  several hundred thousand dollars in reserve, then it might make sense for you  to pay all cash.  </P> <P> Keep in mind, however, that if you pay all cash, the only tax benefits you will  obtain are the real estate taxes on the property that have to be paid yearly.  You might be better off -- if you can afford a mortgage loan -- to take out a  moderate loan and make the monthly payments, taking advantage of some of the  available tax benefits for home ownership. I know of too many retired  individuals who are house rich and cash poor. Many people in your age bracket  prefer to have a nest egg in the bank in the event of emergencies.  </P> <P> You should also consider whether your children would be interested in joining  with you on the purchase on a shared-equity basis. Perhaps your children need  some tax benefits, and would be interested in investing in your property.  </P> <P>  -- Title search.  </P> <P> It is important that you have a title company or a settlement attorney do a  complete title report on the property prior to settlement. You are making a  major investment and want to make sure that the title you receive will be free  and clear of all outstanding liens, encumbrances or other defects -- which we  lawyers refer to as "clouds on title."  </P> <P> If there is a real estate broker involved in the transaction, you should be  able to get assistance from that person. Keep in mind, however, that unless you  are paying the broker directly, that broker represents the seller and owes a  fiduciary obligation to the seller in connection with the purchase and sale of  the real estate.  </P> <P> If you decide to obtain a mortgage, you should talk to several local lenders in  the community where your future house is located. There are numerous loans  available today, ranging from six-month adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM) to  fixed 30-year conventional loans. You may be eligible for an FHA loan,  depending on the amount of the loan you are seeking, and you may also have some  unused Veterans Administration benefits available to you if one of you is a  veteran.  </P> <P> These financial questions should be explored before you sign the contract.  </P> <P> You should also keep in mind that it is now a buyers' market. In many parts of  the country, real estate sales are slow, despite the fact that interest rates  are relatively low. This gives you, as a potential buyer, an advantage, and you  should be prepared to enter into some heavy negotiations with the seller so as  to get the best possible deal for yourself.  </P> <P> In the final analysis, one thing should be kept in mind: In the real estate  world, absolutely everything is negotiable.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Trade Minister Eijiro Hata  said Wednesday he has asked monetary authorities to take  positive steps to stem the yen's appreciation against the  dollar, including coordinated intervention with other countries.    International Trade and Industry Minister Hata told a news  conference the economic community was shocked by the yen's sharp  rise, which will cause a serious psychological impact on the  domestic economy.    Citing discussions with representatives of the Japanese  automobile industry earlier in the day, Hata said a rise of 1.00  yen against the dollar will lead to a 10 percent drop in  earnings by automakers.    During the meeting, the industry leaders urged the  government  to make a maximum effort to stem the yen's appreciation.    Hata said Japan's huge current account surplus is seen in  the  United States to be responsible for the higher yen.    He stressed the need for Japan and the U.S. to reach  agreement on a new framework for bilateral trade as quickly as  possible.</p>

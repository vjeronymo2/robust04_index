			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Toronto down ahead of budget Canada Toronto was under pressure from weaker Canadian bonds ahead of today's release of the 1994/95 federal budget. The TSE 300 Composite index ended 29.3 down at 4,349.0 and declines outscored advances by 580 to 216. Due partly to the fact that US markets were closed yester-day, Toronto volume was thin at 43.6m shares. All but one of the 14 stock groups ended lower. The mining sector fell 2.03 per cent and real estate lost 1.65 per cent. Brazil Equities in Sao Paulo closed a net 1.7 per cent easier in heavy trading as investors decided to cash profits in the afternoon session after the conclusion of the options market settlement earlier in the day, which had seen shares initially rise. The Bovespa index was finally 163 down at 9,286. Turnover hit a record high of Cr873.3bn (Dollars 1.5bn) due to the large amount of investors settling stock options positions. Foreigners invested a net Dollars 5.47bn in Brazil's capital markets in 1993, almost five times the amount that flowed into the country in 1992, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Reuter reports from Sao Paulo. This compares with Dollars 1.21bn in 1992 and Dollars 288m in 1991. According to latest estimates, investment in January was Dollars 1bn, some four times that which flowed into the country in the same month last year.</p>

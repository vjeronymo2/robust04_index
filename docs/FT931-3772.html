			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong falls sharply on Patten speech LAST minute buying by foreign investors and arbitrageurs boosted the Nikkei index above the 18,000 level for the first time since September 25. The Nikkei closed up 132.73 at 18,037.52, its sixth consecutive rise and 7.3 per cent higher on the week; it moved between 17,823.52 and 18,043.95, fluctuating in the morning session on price fixing for March contracts of stock index futures and options. Volume rose to 800m shares against 444m. Some 500m shares changed hands during the first hour on futures and options-related trading. Domestic institutions, which close their books for the March year-end, liquidated arbitrage positions, while foreign investors and public funds were the big buyers. Gains led losses by 695 to 316, with 153 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 6.60 to 1,350.94 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.44 to 1,085.40. Traders said that continued selling by investment trusts and corporate investors was countered by foreign buying. The Tokyo stock exchange announced that foreigners were net buyers of Y10.3bn worth of stocks during the first week of March, turning buyers for the first time in four weeks. Investment trusts sold a net Y32.1bn worth of shares, while individual investors sold Y32.8bn. Banks became net sellers for the first time in 26 weeks, selling Y2.9bn. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone continued to lead the rise, advancing Y15,000 to Y810,000. Corporate holders of NTT shares were also strong, with NEC, which holds 8,000 shares and was the most active issue of the day, rising Y18 to Y779. Hitachi, which owns 6,000 shares, rose Y12 to Y757. On the other hand, air transport was the worst performing sector of the day, falling 2.94 per cent. A sharp fall in Japan Airlines, which closed down Y28 to Y563 on rumours of heavy foreign exchange losses, weighed on the sector. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 85.58 to 18,919.80 in volume of 31.5m shares. Roundup BOMBAY's stock market was badly damaged after a bomb exploded near the trading floor, one of more than a dozen that were detonated in the city yesterday. Hong Kong lost more than 3 per cent after Mr Chris Patten, the governor, said that he was to press ahead with democratic reform proposals. HONG KONG fell sharply after Mr Patten's announcement, which came just before the close of trading. The decision surprised investors, many of whom had been expecting a resumption in Sino-British talks. The Hang Seng index, which had earlier seen a high of 6,447, closed 201.44 lower at 6,170.40, a fall of 5.1 per cent on the week. Turnover fell slightly to HKDollars 5.04bn from HKDollars 5.10bn. The selling continued in London as over-the-counter share prices declined strongly, indicating a further fall in the Hang Seng of some 200 points. Analysts forecast that the Hang Seng could fall to 5,850 before the low prices begin to attract foreign investors. Declines were widespread with HSBC Holdings down HKDollars 2.50 at HKDollars 66 and Hang Seng Bank, which reports 1992 earnings on Monday, HKDollars 2 lower at HKDollars 66. Jardine Matheson fell HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 50. AUSTRALIA tried to extend its gains but a bout of pre-election nerves left the All Ordinaries index up just 0.4 at 1,661.5, off its morning high of 1670.9 but 3 per cent better on the week. Coal &amp; Allied rose ADollars 2.05 to ADollars 11.10 on news of CRA's ADollars 11.50 a share takeover offer. Analysts said that CRA should win control. BANGKOK's SET index rose 19.50, or 2.2 per cent to 916.26, up 1.9 per cent on the week, in turnover of Bt6.85bn. There were rumours that Thailand's SEC could be considering reducing the level of punishment for those involved in share manipulation.</p>

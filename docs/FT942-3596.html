			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Arts: Strange bedfellows at the Royal Court - Theatre The Duke of Edinburgh's latest views on poverty add a certain piquancy to the coupling of the two plays running in tandem at the Royal Court for the summer. At first glance the pairing of Jim Cartright's Road and Sue Townsend's The Queen and I, under the thematic yoke of deprivation and wasted lives, looks tenuous. Each work is so stylised, so individual, that the association seems as artificial as lumping together King Lear and Run for Your Wife as a joint exploration of troubled family relationships. The director is Max Stafford-Clark (whose new company, Out of Joint, has been touring the plays as its first venture); his theatrical strengths include intellectual clarity and robust didacticism rather than warmth or humour. Despite avowed aims at a new populist audience, the resultant work seems aimed at the twittering classes, lazily stereotyping the monarchy with the same semi-informed ease with which they distance themselves behind barriers of correct-sounding cliche from poverty and injustice. Pretty much the traditional audience for the Royal Court, in fact, a theatre which Stafford-Clark has officially left but which obviously still exerts a strong hold. The FT was the first paper to recognise the thrilling potential of Road in 1986. A riveting promenade production by Simon Curtis conducted the fearfully hypnotised spectators through a nightmare danse macabre down mean streets of hopeless squalor. The mad, slightly threatening narrator in this Under Milk Wood of urban dereliction was Edward Tudor Pole. Now Toby Salaman buttonholes us with an avuncular twinkle, less a gimlet-eyed ancient mariner than another boring wedding-guest. The conventional proscenium-arch production adds an air of contrivance that makes Cartright's honed obscenities and lyrical laments sound artificial. Some elements of the play have dated: escape is found in drink and attempted sex - little emphasis on drugs. But then the accent was always on adults, aware of the emptiness that faced them, rather than kids still finding out. The production romps towards cumulative impact, not high-pitched intensity. It misses out on subtlety, and therefore a dimension that stops us patronising these losers. Besides compassion, its obverse, disgust, is present, notably in its depiction of sex as either ugly clumsiness or manipulative power-play. The performance is summed up by the scene where bosomy Pam Ferris, hugely blowsy, clambers over an insensibly drunken young soldier who stirs only to vomit, while she pretends that he is seducing her ('So young . . . Why should you choose me?'). Hilarious physical comedy, but a world away from the quiet, faded desperation that made it the most moving moment of the original production. That Stafford-Clark has little time for pathos is illustrated also by his direction of The Queen and I, drawn from Sue Townsend's best-seller. There has reportedly been rewriting on tour; certainly it seems less enjoyable than the Leicester premiere reviewed here in April by Alastair Macaulay. As everyone must know by now, the brilliant fantasy exiles the royal family to a deprived inner-city estate in a newly republican Britain. The book showed affection as well as satire; the stage version hedges its bets by giving a call to action, in the form of an alternative Christmas speech, to the Queen herself; but what was warm-hearted in the book seems mere opportunism on stage. Royalists will find little offensive here, possibly because some of the royal impersonations are so inept. Carole Hayman's Princess Margaret sounds like Margaret Thatcher and looks like Judith Anderson playing Mrs Danvers in Rebecca. Out of context, David Howey's Prince Philip would be unidentifiable. Gillian Hanna is at sea with the Queen Mother. On the other hand, Doon Mackichan suggests the Diana stoop, slyness and general charisma. Toby Salaman uses a hamper of make-up to transform his face into a Prince Charles carnival mask, and suggests the right anguished, teeth-clenched decency. Touching neither the fifth-form iconoclasm of Have I Got News for You nor the juvenile venom of Spitting Image, the writing nevertheless shows a jumble of styles, from comic-strip zaniness to the old-fashioned agitprop theatre that my companion greeted with a sigh of exasperated nostalgia when the Queen and her new neighbours had a final sing-song about necessary change. I suspected the worst when I heard that the company had been getting the feel of a Leicester council estate - about as relevant to comedy as those studies of Jacobean Scotland by American divas who think it will help them to sing Lucia di Lammermoor. But as if to prove he is no dry, po-faced old stick, the director has interpolated unnecessary songs, adding to the impression that a vaguely Brechtian history epic was aimed at. Indeed, the Good Woman of Szechuan is virtually quoted verbatim by the tough estate-leader, Vi: 'It ain't possible to be honest and poor.' There are certainly funny passages: the women's assertiveness class, the Queen and Di participating, is a lovely idea. All credit to Pam Ferris, who looks nothing like her but manages a likable portrait of HM as a woman rather delightedly kicking over the traces and discovering herself. But without the entertainment value of the book, there is no clear message either.</p>

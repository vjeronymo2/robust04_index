			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 21 June (AFP) -- Gunmen have assassinated the  former director of Nigeria's Defence Intelligence Agency, Muftau  Babatunde Elegbede, in an attack on the outskirts of Lagos,  Lagos police chief James Danbaba said.    According to press reports Tuesday [21 June], Danbaba said  retired Vice-Admiral Elegbede was cut down Sunday by more than  70 bullets when the killers armed with automatic rifles forced  his car to stop on the Oworonshoki expressway.    Elegbede, 52, had also served as head of administration in  Defence Headquarters under former junta leader General Ibrahim  Babangida, who stepped down in August last year.    Police said that they had arrested some suspects over the  murder, but the motives were not known.    Elegbede was shot as he stepped out of his car to find out  what was amiss, Danbaba said. He ran a few metres (yards) but  was pursued and sprayed with bullets. The assailants even held  his throat to ensure that he stopped breathing, the reports  quoted the police boss as saying.    Police officers who arrived at the scene engaged the  assassins in a shoot-out and injured one of them, Danbaba said.  But his colleagues were able to carry him into Elegbede's car  and they drove off.    One of the guns recovered from the assassins is suspected to  be a typical smuggler's weapon and is not part of the armoury of  the Armed Forces or police, police said.</p>

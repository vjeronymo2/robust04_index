			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Asean urged to step up trade South-east Asian nations should increase trade among themselves if they want to maintain the pace of economic growth in their region, an official of the European Parliament said yesterday, AP reports from Manila. Mr Ben Visser, first vice-chairman of a visiting 19-member European Parliament delegation, spoke to a news conference at the end of a three-day visit, the first stop on a tour which will also take them to Thailand, Vietnam and South Korea. Mr Visser, from the Netherlands, said the six members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations should spearhead trade in the region. He added that Asean (which is made up of the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei and Malaysia) must work out an arrangement similar to that of the European Union. He said that, despite problems in Europe, 80 per cent of all trade by European nations is within the continent. Regional trade within Asean accounts for only 15 per cent, he said.</p>

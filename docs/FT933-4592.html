			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Peek declines to Pounds 2.1m but wins Pounds 6m Bangkok contract PEEK, the international traffic and field data systems company, has won a contract to install a Pounds 6m computerised system for the volatile drivers of Thailand's Bangkok. Announcing pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 of Pounds 2.07m (Pounds 2.81m) - down as a result of the loss on disposal of a discontinued business - Mr Jim Sanger, finance director, said he was aware Bangkok drivers had threatened violence over the congestion. 'We believe congestion will be eased but we have made no contractual guarantees on the speed of traffic,' he said. 'Over the last four or five years we have established ourselves as the number two in the traffic world and profits have been up over the last couple of years.' He stressed the need to move to larger contracts but 'not to take on too many at a time'. Turnover on continuing activities was virtually flat at Pounds 39.1m with a Pounds 5.8m contribution from the acquisitions of Signal Control Company and Signal Maintenance Inc in March. Operating profits dipped to Pounds 2.43m (Pounds 2.91m) as operating expenses rose on higher investment in the Hong Kong and German markets and in applied technology. The company booked a loss of Pounds 544,000 on the sale of Navstar, a global positioning systems company, as the transport industry failed to respond quickly to the technology. Peek received interest of Pounds 194,000 against payments of Pounds 92,000 last time as the company switched out of certificates of tax deposit following the settlement of a tax liability. The company had borrowings of Pounds 1.89m at the half way stage against cash of Pounds 11.4m in the previous period after the two acquisitions and as working capital in the Netherlands increased. The board declared a maintained dividend of 1.05p out of earnings per share of 1.11p (1.74p).</p>

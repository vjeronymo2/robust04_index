The officials  of Marubeni Corp. said the project brings together the Japanese  firm and two Chinese state-run enterprises, China National  Petroleum and Natural Gas Corp. and China International Trust  and Investment Corp.    Under the present plan, the three partners will engage in  oil  development in a concession to be acquired in the central part  of Papua New Guinea to start commercial production within a few  years, they said.    China became an oil-importing nation last year due to strong  demand for crude oil resulting from high-paced economic growth.    The officials said full-scale production at the oil-rich  Tarim Basin in northwestern China will not start in the current  century.    In the oil development in Papua New Guinea, they said  sharing  of investment estimated at 100 billion yen will be decided later.    Most of the oil produced at the concession will be brought  to  China for domestic consumption but some of it will be sold  overseas to earn foreign currency, they said.</p>

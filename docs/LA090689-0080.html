			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT JUST CAN'T BE FOREVER FOR EVERT AS GARRISON WINS  </P> <P> The Chris Evert era in women's tennis officially ended a 19-year run Tuesday,  far off Broadway in a place appropriately called Queens.  </P> <P> On an unseasonably cool and windy day, Evert played her 113th and final match  at the U.S. Open. And unlike the first one she played in 1971, she lost.  </P> <P> As a 16-year-old, Evert defeated Eda Budding. Her last match was a straight-set  quarterfinal defeat at the hands of fifth-seeded Zina Garrison.  </P> <P> It was not a long goodby. Evert blew a 5-2 lead in the first set and fell, 7-6  (7-1), 6-2, in 1 hour 13 minutes.  </P> <P> On her last match point at the U.S. Open, she stood there at the baseline to  return serve, shifting her feet together as she always does, then sent a ball  into the net.  </P> <P> She shook her head gently and ran to the net to shake hands with Garrison.  </P> <P> "Congratulations," Evert told Garrison. "You played well."  </P> <P> Evert packed her rackets, turned and gave a shy wave to the crowd. As she  walked off the court with Garrison, they put their arms around one another for  an instant and hugged.  </P> <P> Evert looked around one last time, then disappeared into a tunnel beneath the  stands and was gone.  </P> <P> "Now, the sun has truly set," said Ted Tinling, a historian of tennis for more  than 60 years.  </P> <P> If there is a moment that truly represents a passing of an era in women's  tennis, this was it. But Evert's leave-taking was not unexpected.  </P> <P> Winner of 1,304 matches, 157 tournaments, 18 Grand Slam singles titles and six  times the U.S. Open champion, Evert has not won a tournament this year and her  ranking has fallen to an all-time low of No. 4.  </P> <P> At 34, Evert said she is no longer willing to put in the time to play at the  level she wished. The outcome of her match against Garrison only reinforced her  intention to make this year's Open her final major event.  </P> <P> "That's why I'm retiring," Evert said.  </P> <P> Evert turned back the challenge of 15-year-old Monica Seles in a fourth-round  match two days earlier, but Evert was unable to come back with another such  match at the same level.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of players that can cause upsets and then, two days later,  lose to someone ranked 100 in the world," she said.  </P> <P> "That's why players like Steffi (Graf) and myself in the past, Martina  (Navratilova), that's why we have been great, because we have been able to  never have a letdown in a two-week tournament.  </P> <P> "This year, I have had letdowns and that puts me right in with the average  player."  </P> <P> Evert isn't exactly through playing tennis. She is scheduled to play Federation  Cup for the United States in Tokyo and she will probably play in a tournament  in Boca Raton, Fla., next spring.  </P> <P> There is also a series of exhibitions scheduled in various series with  Navratilova, sort of a Chris Across America tour.  </P> <P> But as far as competing seriously is concerned, Evert says she will never do  that again.  </P> <P> Garrison, who was 15 when she got Evert's autograph at a tournament in Houston,  felt slightly uncomfortable with her role in Evert's career.  </P> <P> "That was the hardest match I've ever played in my life," Garrison said. "It  was so emotional. To be the villain, to have to take her out of this tournament  . . ."  </P> <P> Next, Garrison has a chance to take out Navratilova. Navratilova, seeded  second, won her quarterfinal over Manuela Maleeva, 6-0, 6-0, in only 47  minutes.  </P> <P> Navratilova was relieved that she avoided the task of playing Evert one last  time.  </P> <P> "Obviously, emotionally, it'll be easier," Navratilova said. "It would have  been the most emotional match of my life. I could do without it."  </P> <P> After Evert took a commanding early lead, Garrison vowed to run down every ball  on the court. She took a lead in the tiebreaker when Evert double-faulted and  was never challenged the rest of the match.  </P> <P> The key game in the second set occurred with Evert serving at 2-2, 30-30. She  engaged Garrison in a 24-shot rally, the kind of points on which she used to  excel, but this one ended when she took a short ball and dumped a backhand into  the net.  </P> <P> On break point, Garrison finessed a forehand slice cross-court for a winner and  a 3-2 lead.  </P> <P> Evert won only five more points the rest of the way. She was broken to 5-2 when  Garrison hit a backhand passing shot down the line.  </P> <P> Now Garrison was serving for the match.  </P> <P> Evert held a break point, but Garrison hit another forehand slice winner for  deuce then set up match point with a deft cross-court backhand volley winner.  </P> <P> One serve later, it was over.  </P> <P> "I knew no matter what match I played, win or lose, it would be sad for me  because my career really started here back when I was 16 years old," Evert  said.  </P> <P> "Gosh, I think that as I got older, the victories meant more to me because I  was feeling more."  </P> <P> She said she was not glad it was over.  </P> <P> "I was thinking that I would be relieved when the tournament was over for me,  but after you lose a match like today, I'm really not relieved because of what  I did two days ago.  </P> <P> "I thought I was just starting to play the kind of tennis and I did have high  hopes for myself."  </P> <P> She sounded sad, wistful, just like a champion accustomed to perfection and  unable to find it. This was not the way she wanted it to end, but her  expectations had been raised from the Seles match, so the eventual fall was  longer.  </P> <P> Evert maintained her composure right after the match and in the interview room  when she met the press. But on the way out, she reached for the arms of her  husband, Andy Mill, and she cried.  </P> <P> It ended that way and women's tennis may never be the same, as they say.  </P> <P> Look at it this way, though: The sun might have set, but it was a long and  marvelous day.  </P></p>

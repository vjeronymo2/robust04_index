			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt The Bundesbank's 'interest rates horizon' - which Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the bank's president, described in May as 'clear for some time' - is beginning to look a long way away. There is a growing consensus among Frankfurt economists that the next discount rate change is unlikely to come until after the federal elections in October. There are even suspicions that nothing will happen until early in the new year. Although much depends on the inflationary heating effect of the economic recovery and the signals from the 1995 wages negotiations, which should be well under way by then, the move might even be upwards. Figures issued last week showed west German inflation nudging back up to 3 per cent last month. Although Mr Otmar Issing, the central bank's chief economist and Mr Tietmeyer's favoured mouthpiece, was promptly wheeled out to say that it was a temporary blip, the reversal of the downtrend acted as a reminder that prices and inflationary expectations still need careful watching. Much of the impetus behind the German cost-of-living index is still coming from housing costs, and although the bank has said this is a non-inflationary result of supply's failure to meet demand, wage earners are more likely to see it as a drain on thinning incomes and raise their pay demands accordingly.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>German, </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Andreas Mueller, interviewer for INGENIEUR </F> DIGEST]    [Text] Interview: Many Chances in the  Recession    Prof. Dr.-Eng. Hartmut Weule, on the Daimler-Benz AG  [Aktiengesellschaft = Corporation] board of directors  responsible for research and engineering, warns against  underestimating research during crises.    Q. You call for a different research policy in Germany. Why?    A. Although both government and industry pump a lot of money  into research and development, there is no equivalent output in  terms of innovations good enough to be entered into the world  market. There is simply something wrong with the way research  and development in Germany are being managed. For instance,  assistance to medium-scale research is based on insufficiently  strategy-oriented considerations while at the same time  mission-oriented large-scale research facilities are engaged in  too wide a range of tasks.    Q. Has, because of this, German research been knocked down?    A. No, there are downright very promising signs. I am  thinking of the EC (European Community) Project AIT: "Advanced  Information Technology in Design and Manufacturing" as an  example. Spurred by Daimler-Benz, it could revolutionize the  entire European Aero-Space Flight industry. Because it brings  user and provider of information technology together during the  development and production processes. Positive signs are also  coming from the "Round-Table Microelectronics", launched by  Siemens, IBM, Bosch, and Daimler-Benz as well as from the  "Consensus-Group Production Technology." Innovative projects and  research strategies regarding microelectronics and production  technology in the application-oriented industry are being  developed here by thinking 15 years ahead.    Q. But will Germany gain something from this during the very  next few years already?    A. No. Especially in a time of crisis affecting both the  economic boom and the business structure, however, it would be  wrong to aim for better short-term results only. While the  current strained economic condition creates problems, it also  harbors good chances for the German economy.    Q. What chances?    A. One could apportion the research budgets in new ways and  change the modality so as to soften up structures which have  become rigid. Using its ASIC's (Amorphous-Silicon Integrated  Circuits) in the indispensable key technologies such as  microelectronics, Daimler-Benz plans to recover lost ground  vis-a-vis Japan and the U.S.A. by way of international  collaboration. In environmental engineering, moreover, we want  to assume the top position from the very start. Wherever  necessary we will enter into strategic alliances with other  research partners. I am thinking here of energetics and space  flight particularly.</p>

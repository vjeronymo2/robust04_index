			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Mr Amr Moussa by Ramesh Chandran; place and </F> date not given]    [Text] Cairo, December 1--For the past three months, Arab  capitals like Cairo, Damascus, Amman, Beirut, Tunis and Rabat,  as well as the Israeli cities, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, have been  enlivened by absorbing diplomatic activity to harness together a  comprehensive and tangible peace agreement for West Asia. It is  but natural that amidst such a mosaic of complex diplomacy, some  of the more resourceful and felicitous individuals manage to  catch the eye.    In the recent past, amongst those who have managed to  distinguish themselves in this diplomacy--at least in terms of  sheer and strenuous volume of effort--have included Mr Philip  Habib, Mr James Baker and Mr Warren Christopher. But an Arab  diplomat who is lately attracting notable attention is Mr Amr  Moussa, Egypt's multi-lingual foreign minister.    Like an Arab Henry Kissinger, Mr Amr Moussa has been  indulging in recent months in an unflagingly zealous and  formidable schedule. This month alone took him to Washington,  Jerusalem, Damascus and Amman, besides Mogadishu, Abu Dhabi and  Bahrian. Egypt has often produced first-rate international civil  servants as well as accomplished diplomats. Mr Amr Moussa is the  third member sought after by the international media in an  Egyptian troika that includes the U.N. secretary general, Dr  Boutros-Boutros Ghali, an Egyptian capt, and Mr Ismat Abd  Al-Maguid, the secretary general of the Arab League.    Although there may be differences in national debates in the  interpretation of the precise ingredients of Egyptian national  interest as well as the best way of securing them, there is  broad concurrence that the independence, security and prosperity  of the national community of Egyptians should take precedence  over all else.    This relative unanimity about national identity and  interests  makes Egypt exceptional among the Arab states of West Asia. It  has also given Egypt's presidents and foreign ministers  considerable latitude in formulating foreign policy. This helps  explain why the erstwhile President, Mr Anwar al-Sadat was able  to sign the dramatic peace accord with Israel in 1979 as well as  why the present president, Mr Hosni Mubarak, has been able to  abide by the terms of that treaty. These features could also  explain the sure-footed diplomatic moves Egypt made to oppose  the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and to rally Arab members to  participate in an international coalition against Iraq to which  Egypt despatched 30,000 troops.    It is the same savoir faire and confidence that  Egypt often displays in international mediation today. Be it in  Somalia where Mr Amr Moussa has proposed to the Organisation of  African Unity [OAU]--of which Egypt is the chairman--that Africa  ought to develop a diplomatic mechanism for crisis management  in the continent or seeking international troops in Burundi,  which Egypt regards as a fellow Nile country. This week's focus  in Cairo was however on Libya where an adamant Muammar Gadaffi  is squaring up to the Clinton administration over the release of  the two Lockerbie bombing suspects. Egyptian diplomats have been  working up a back-breaking schedule to try to prevent the  sweeping U.N. sanctions against Tripoli.    Having undertaken another leg of his diplomatic shuttle, on  his return, Mr Amr Moussa's schedule included setting-up secret  talks in the Egyptian Sinai enclave of Taba between Palestinian  and Israeli negotiators. Fifty-seven-year-old Mr Amr Moussa is a  product of the faculty of law of Cairo University and has held a  variety of diplomatic assignments including the post of director  of the international organisations department and Egypt's  permanent representative to the United Nations. He had a highly  successful and visible stint in New Delhi from 1983 as Egypt's  ambassador.    Smoking his customary cigar, the foreign minister spoke to  THE TIMES OF INDIA at his new and sumptuously furnished foreign  ministry office in downtown Cairo. Moments after the interview  concluded the minister remarked that he had to make a "dash for  the airport" to receive King Hussein of Jordan. Mr Nagui  El-Ghatrifi, the articulate spokesman of the foreign ministry,  was present during the interview. Selected excerpts:    After the peace accord was signed between the Palestine  Liberation Organisation (PLO) and Israel, there was a momentary  lull. Now there seems to be a fresh impetus to the peace  negotiations with Egypt playing a central role. Are you  optimistic that we might see a new breakthrough?    Yes, indeed, I am optimistic. Things are going in the right  direction. I don't think they (Israel) will retract on the  agenda that has been agreed upon between the PLO and themselves.  Generally negotiations are promising on both the bilateral and  the multilateral tracks. This of course does not mean there will  be no difficulties, obstacles or no risks here or there. But  overall in the region, it seems to be a one-way traffic towards  peace. I hope that developments will prove me right. The  Palestinian-Israeli track has already crossed the  point-of-no-return and the negotiations on Gaza and Jericho are  also progressing in the right direction. And let me say that the  Israeli-Syrian track is also not a lost one.    Is it then reasonably accurate to state that if the  Syrian-Israeli talks on the Golan Heights cause extreme dilemma,  then the Jordanian and Lebanese tracks are less complex?    Yes, I would agree. The Jordanian track has already produced  all the drafts necessary for establishing the framework for an  agreement. The Lebanon negotiations are even more clear as it is  a matter of Israeli withdrawal. Even the former Likud government  had declared that Israel had no territorial ambitions in  Lebanon. I am positive that if we can really work out a good,  working, acceptable way of negotiations then the results can be  achieved.    Watching the bloody events in Gaza, the initial  unenthusiastic response from Hamas and the opposition from  hardline elements to the peace accord signed by Mr Arafat, has  this scenario for peace been too upbeat?    This opposition is exaggerated. The Gaza hardliners have a  point of view and it is their right to accept the peace accords  or to oppose them. However, they have promised not to use force  or enter into an armed conflict with their brethren or to create  havoc with the security situation. This, I find, is quite  satisfactory. Unless of course the arrangements that have been  agreed upon do not work out. That then is another matter.    One finds West Asia commentators looking ahead to the  next decade painting all sorts of hopeful, rosy scenarios,  thriving Israeli-Arab economic partnership, portraying even Gaza  as a flourishing commercial entrepot. Your comment?    All these factors that you are referring to are possible...  It can happen. But much will depend on the developments during  the next two years. So let us wait and see. I prefer to withhold  my expression of optimism on this issue.    Let's turn to bilateral relations. The high point was  during the times of Nehru and Nasser. People still recall both  leaders when referring to Indo-Egyptian ties. Since then, there  has been a downtrend in this partnership...    There has been a king of downtrend. But not a malafide  downtrend. It resulted from force of circumstances... from  different priorities. This area has seen difficult times. It has  been prone to conflicts and wars and Egypt has been involved in  all this and India, which had its own priorities in South Asia,  was not in the frontline in West Asia. The Cold War and its  aftermath has also had its repercussions on the totality of the  situation in the third world, in non-aligned meet forums.    The 1967 war was another turning point which in turn  affected  its ties with India and the 1973 war set the relations on a  different level. Then of course there was Camp David. As of now,  the prospects for better relations are very good. We believe  that India plays a major role in her region in the same way we  do in this area.    India's leading position in the third world is recognised by  Egypt. It is even urged by Egypt. There is no competition  between us, only complementarity. The strong bonds which you  referred to during the days of Nehru and Nasser were but an  expression, or a manifestation of those deep-rooted relations,  although I don't put the good-relations era as having begun at  the times of Nehru and Nasser. I would say they began much  earlier.    I am one of those who has advocated the necessity of having  excellent relations between India and Egypt. Not that we  wouldn't differ on this or that point but the basic premise of  our relations should be more cooperation and interaction.    Some people in Delhi still recall your successful  tenure as ambassador. They say forget about worn-out rhetoric  about non-alignment and concentrate instead on enhancing trade  and commercial relations between our two countries...    Yes, yes indeed. We should focus on economic ties. In fact  we  hope to discuss precisely these issues when we meet in Delhi for  the G-15 summit. And we should set the concrete agenda for more  meetings, more dialogue. As for your reference to my  ambassadorship in Delhi, I am very much upset that you say that  there are only "some" in Delhi who recall my tenure. I would  have thought "many" would remember me. (Laughs)    Regarding regional tensions in South Asia and  specifically on the Indo-Pak dispute over Kashmir, where do you  stand?    We would very much like to bring this conflict to a close.  You will appreciate that I cannot publicly--it would be very  unwise of me if I did--discuss details on this issue. The  Kashmir dispute is a very old conflict. However, Pakistan has  succeeded in putting the problem back on the international  agenda. So many more are talking and discussing Kashmir. Once  this has been achieved, sitting together and attempting to solve  it is the best way. Because Pakistan will live with India and  India will live with Pakistan forever. Remember we are sorting  out some of our ancient and great problems in the Middle East...    Are you suggesting that India and Pakistan should  follow the example set by old enemies, the PLO and Israel, and  talk frankly across the table?    You are talking. But talks should be fruitful. They should  have a point and talks should not be setup for the sake of  talking...    In India as well as in Egypt there is serious concern  about religious extremism and the violence it evokes. Are you  coming to grips with curbing fundamentalism?    Well, as far as India and Egypt, there is some commonality  of  events as far as religious extremism is concerned; it is also a  global phenomena. However, each country has its own  peculiarities as far [as] this is concerned and has to devise  individual ways of tackling them...    But in your attempts to devise ways of tackling them,  you have invited some fiery criticism from human rights groups  concerning Egypt's human rights' record.    No, no. This is a sweeping formula. We cannot simply throw  our countries open to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with  different motives and agendas. And you can never tell what  exactly they are doing or even who exactly is doing this. And  mind you, not all those people who work in NGOs are deep  thinkers; perhaps many are activists. We need to respect the  basic principles of sovereignty of our rights, the basic tenets  of human rights and the principles of fundamental freedoms. But  we simply cannot submit ourselves to double standards.    What double standards?    Well, in Bosnia-Herzegovina when "ethnic cleansing" was  being  practised, we did not see such fervour from the very same  non-governmental organisations. So let us adapt one yardstick  for all. I have argued these points publicly at the Vienna  commission on human rights and said, that we either have one  yardstick for all or let's simply forget about this.    Looking at the role of the United Nations and its  somewhat activist role, I was recently on a reporting mission in  Baghdad. There the impact of U.N. sanctions has squarely hit the  man-on-the-street whilst hardly affecting the regime in power.  Now we hear that sanctions against Libya are to be enhanced. Is  this an effective method of diplomacy?    First of all you should not put yourself in a position where  sanctions have to be applied against you. Second, one needs to  assess the international situation with caution. This of course  does not mean we do not sympathise with the plight of our  brothers in Iraq and Libya. We definitely do. Our work was to  strike a balance between our obligations and international  legitimacy which in a broader context is what the U.N. does too.    The situation as regards Libya is beginning to look  dismal. Can diplomacy persuade their leader to give up the  Lockerbie suspects?    This is what we are striving to achieve. For now, one can  only be hopeful.</p>

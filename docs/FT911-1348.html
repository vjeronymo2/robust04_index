			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Observer: Postscript Among the many place-name changes now being made all over the Soviet Union, one which happened over the past weekend will cause the religious community particular pleasure. Zagorsk, 70km to the north of Moscow, has long been the religious centre of the Russian Orthodox Church. The golden domes of its famous monastery gleam through the grime of the surrounding industrial town, and attract the faithful, as well as thousands of tourists. But now it is to have a new name  -Sergievsky Posad, or Sergei's Settlement. Sergei Radonezhsky was the 14th century founder of the ancient monastery. Sergei's gain is Zagorsky's loss. The former chairman of the Moscow City Communist Party, who was assassinated in the aftermath of the revolution in 1919, does not have the same sort of shelf-life as Russia's patron saint.</p>

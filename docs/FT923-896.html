			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Venezuelan oil group cuts investment PETROLEOS de Venezuela, Venezuela's national oil company, has sharply reduced its capital investment programme, according to company executives. The company is to make direct investments of Dollars 20bn during 1993-98, a cut of around Dollars 6bn compared with previous forecasts made only last year. Weak international oil prices and high taxes on operating profits have forced the company to make the cut. PDVSA, which had gross revenues of Dollars 22.3bn last year, is concentrating most of its capital outlays on core activities - exploration, crude oil production and refining. Other projects will be stretched out or shelved. The company also hopes to attract further outside investment for oil, petrochemicals and coal projects. The 1993-98 investment programme includes Dollars 13bn on maintaining crude oil production capacity, and a further Dollars 1.4bn to take it beyond its present 2.83m barrels per day, and Dollars 2.6bn on upgrading domestic refineries. Since most of Venezuela's oil wells have been producing for many years, heavy investment is required to reverse an annual average decline of 22 per cent in output from old oil fields. PDVSA, which has the highest level of debt in its 16-year history - estimated at more than Dollars 3bn - will still need to borrow on international capital markets in 1993-94 to help finance its investments, company executives said. Officials also warned that unless the company's tax burden were reduced over the next several years, it will not be able to make the investments required - especially in maintaining oil production capacity  -to keep the business afloat. The company pays taxes equivalent to 82 per cent or more of operating profits.</p>

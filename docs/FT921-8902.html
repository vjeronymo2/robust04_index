			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Commuter travel subsidy to remain PLANS TO eliminate the heavy annual subsidy received by British Rail's Network SouthEast division have been abandoned for the foreseeable future, the Department of Transport's annual report showed yesterday. The figures highlight the difficulty the government faces in finding a way to privatise the network's loss-making commuter services, as it has undertaken to do if the Conservatives win the general election. The last corporate plan agreed between the government and British Rail, published in December 1989, set a target of reducing Network SouthEast's subsidy from Pounds 141m in 1989-90 to nothing in the financial year beginning this April. But the combination of recession, additional spending on safety and lower-than-expected improvements in productivity caused the figure to remain at the same level in the following two years. The department's report, published yesterday, forecasts that the subsidy will more than double, rising to Pounds 330m this financial year. Far from being eliminated next year, the subsidy is expected to climb to Pounds 400m. Only then is the subsidy expected to start falling back. It is forecast to be Pounds 300m in 1993-94 and Pounds 100m in 1994-95 - the last year for which forecasts are made. British Rail's other subsidised division, Regional Railways, is also expected to remain a heavy burden on the taxpayer. That division's subsidy had been forecast to fall to Pounds 345m next year at 1989-90 prices. Instead, the annual report estimates that the subsidy will be Pounds 600m at current prices, with the figure falling only slightly to Pounds 500m a year in the following two years.

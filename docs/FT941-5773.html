			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Flotation price of 140p puts Pounds 193m tag on MIN Midland Independent Newspapers, the regional newspaper group which publishes the Birmingham Post, set its flotation price at 140p yesterday, giving a market value slightly below expectations of Pounds 193m. About 57 per cent of the company, or 77.9m shares, is being sold, of which 50.7m are being placed with institutions. A further 27.3m shares are being offered to the public. The net proceeds of Pounds 96m will be used to reduce borrowings of Pounds 139m, leaving gearing at 40 per cent. MIN incurred substantial debt to fund the Pounds 125m management buy-out from Mr Ralph Ingersoll, the US publisher, in 1991. The group is coming to the market on a historic p/e multiple of 19.5, based on pro forma pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.6m. This is a substantial discount to the sector average of 29.9 times and the similar multiples of more comparable regional newspaper groups such as Trinity International and Johnston Press. It is also lower than the expected multiple of 21. The yield is 2.5 per cent on an indicated dividend of 2.8p. Mr Christopher Oakley, chief executive, said he was confident MIN would show good growth as a quoted company on the back of margin improvements and an upturn in advertising revenues. 'Our improvement will not just be related to the economy,' he said. MIN had made several acquisitions last year with lower than desired margins which had yet to contribute a full year's profit. The group was also developing links with cable companies to recycle information gathered through the newspapers for a local television audience. MIN's leaflet operation - which provides direct marketing services to advertisers - was growing rapidly, said Mr Oakley. COMMENT MIN has been attractively priced, particularly in light of its exposure to classified and recruitment advertising. It would also appear to be well managed, having improved margins from 9 to more than 20 per cent during a savage recession. Longer-term, however, there may be questions about the regional newspaper market in general. This has seen a steady decline in its share of advertising in recent years, in favour of other mediums such as radio and cable. MIN's potential further out may depend in part on changes to policy on media ownership - for example, allowing regional newspapers to own local radio stations. Until then, there appears to be considerable upside on the prospective p/e of 17.5 and pro forma forecasts of Pounds 17m pre-tax.</p>

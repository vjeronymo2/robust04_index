			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: EIS maintains growth with Pounds 8.9m EIS Group, the acquisitive specialist engineering group, continued its 23-year run of uninterrupted profit growth with a 14 per cent increase in pre - tax figures to Pounds 8.93m at the interim stage. However, the company warned that margins remained under pressure, although the situation was showing some signs of picking up. 'We've seen a glimmer of improvement in recent weeks,' said Mr Peter Haslehurst, chief executive. 'We're feeling more optimistic than we have done in quite a while.' Turnover to the end of June rose 25 per cent to Pounds 154.27m (Pounds 123.86m), including Pounds 2.78m from acquisitions. Earnings per share rose from 13.1p to 13.3p, while the interim dividend was increased 3 per cent to 3.4p. Mr Haslehurst said that there were strong performances from the technical mouldings and flight spares businesses, although he declined to give a breakdown of operations. Conversely, the aircraft and presision engineering divisions were weak in the face of difficult market conditions. Process equipment was 'patchy but improving.' He added that the first half acquistions had all traded well. EIS bought C&amp;F Miller, an aircraft maintenance equipment group, in April for Pounds 500,000, followed a month later by postal and defence equipment manufacturer ABPH for Pounds 2.5m. ADE-HML Ltd, an aircraft equipment maker, followed in July for Pounds 3.8m, with German coiling machinery group Henrich for Pounds 300,000 the next month. With gearing down to 4 per cent, Mr Haslehurst said that further acquisitions were a possibility. 'But we also have spare capacity available to take up any significant upturn in demand.'</p>

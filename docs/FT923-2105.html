			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: P-E halves dividend after 72% decline P-E INTERNATIONAL, the management and computer consultancy group, yesterday halved its interim dividend to 1p 'in the light of trading conditions,' and reported a 72 per cent decline in first-half pre-tax profits which fell from Pounds 1.83m to Pounds 514,000. Fee income in the six months to June 30 rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 35.5m (Pounds 33.6m), but included a contribution from the Handley-Walker group which was acquired in July last year. Trading profits dropped by 58 per cent to Pounds 842,000 (Pounds 2.01m) while net interest costs increased to Pounds 332,000 (Pounds 177,000). Despite the falls Mr George Cox, who took over as chairman in May, said that given the economic conditions 'our performance is not unsatisfactory'. He said three factors put the performance in perspective. 'Firstly, it shows an improvement on the second half last year. Secondly, this result comes after increased expenditure in the development of the business. Thirdly, we believe our overall performance compares favourably with most of our competitors.' The group restructured its operations and made significant cuts in its cost base towards the end of 1991 taking a Pounds 541,000 exceptional charge which contributed to an overall loss in last year's second half. Mr Cox said that although the group had returned to profitability this year, and improved its gross margins over that second half period, 'we have not yet seen the significant improvement in trading performance which would undoubtedly result from an increase in demand'. He expressed confidence that 'the considerable effort and cost' already expended this year to reshape the group would allow P-E to perform better in a continued depressed economy, and take advantage of any upturn. However, he warned that expenditure on reshaping the business, including investing in new products and services and widening the geographic spread of operations, would increase during the second half. 'We expect to see significant benefits from these investments in 1993, with some of these benefits possibly arising earlier.' Earnings per share dropped to 1.5p (6.7p).</p>

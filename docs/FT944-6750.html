			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (1): Big test for Benazir Bhutto - In her second term in office, Pakistan's prime minister has made a good start by promising a firm response to her country's deep-rooted problems. Now Ms Bhutto has to prove she can deliver Ms Benazir Bhutto, the Pakistani prime minister who is visiting the UK this week, leads a country which is now at a critical point in its history. In the past five years, Pakistan has made a stormy transition from military dictatorship to Parliamentary democracy. Despite six changes of government, it has established a solid consensus in favour of liberalising the economy and opening up to foreign trade and investment. It has also gone some way towards improving relations with the US and other western powers, despite their continuing concern about Pakistan's nuclear programme. However, these achievements still stand on fragile foundations. Pakistani politics is riddled with violence and corruption. The small ruling elite has shown little willingness to share the fruits of prosperity with the great mass of ordinary Pakistanis, some of whom are falling prey to the temptations of crime, political extremism and Islamic fundamentalism. And although Ms Bhutto has a good personal rapport with many westerners, the US administration and most European capitals remain somewhat wary of Islamabad. Nevertheless, Pakistan is at least making progress and at a pace which has quickened noticeably in the year since Ms Bhutto took office for the second time in last autumn's general election. In politics, despite persistent efforts by Mr Nawaz Sharif, the ex-prime minister and Ms Bhutto's bitter enemy, to make trouble , the government has achieved a measure of political stability. After the storms of 1993, which culminated in the overthrow of Mr Nawaz Sharif's government, 1994 has, by Pakistani standards, been fairly calm. Ms Bhutto's government retains a firm grip on the administration and on Parliament. In the economic sphere, Ms Bhutto has successfully pulled Pakistan out of a foreign exchange crisis which loomed large in mid-1993 and has put the country's finances on an even keel, with the help of a squeeze on credit, imports and public spending. Foreign exchange reserves have soared from a paltry USDollars 300m to a record Dollars 3bn. The feud with Mr Nawaz Sharif has fortunately not prevented Ms Bhutto from continuing with her predecessor's economic liberalisation programme, including import tariff cuts, financial deregulation and the most radical privatisation programme in south Asia. International companies say the incentives for foreign investors are among the most attractive in the developing world. 'Pakistan has truly come to believe that foreign investment is a must,' says Mr Nisar Memon, president of the Overseas Investors' Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Karachi. Foreign companies have responded by increasing their actual investments and pledging a big increase in the future, notably in power, where the government has collected proposals for new generating stations worth USDollars 12bn. These would, if realised, double the country's capacity. In the financial markets, the overseas sale of shares in Pakistan Telecommunications Company, the state-controlled utility, raised Dollars 900m, a greater figure than all previous portfolio investment in Pakistan. Yet, despite these gains much more needs to be done if Pakistan is to see broad-based political, economic and social modernisation. The root cause of the country's chronic political instability is the failure of the dominant land-owning elite to share power with the rest of Pakistan's fast-growing population of 128m. More than half the members of the National Assembly are feudal landlords, voted in by their mostly illiterate share-croppers. The country is run by a few hundred families who inter-marry and place their sons in the three pools of power - politics, the bureaucracy and the army. Many of these people, though not all, have come to regard government office as a personal fiefdom, in which nepotism, tax evasion and corruption undermine good administration. As Farooq Leghari, the president, said this month in a Parliamentary policy speech: 'Corruption has permeated all walks of life.' The elite has also failed to distribute resources adequately to the great mass of its fellow countrymen. According to United Nations data, even though per capita income in Pakistan is considerably higher than in neighbouring India (Dollars 1,970 per head in 1991 on a purchasing power parity basis against Dollars 1,150), Pakistan is well behind India in education and health standards. Only 37 per cent of Pakistanis can read, compared with 50 per cent of Indians, and life expectancy at birth is 58.3 years, compared with 59.7. The explanation lies partly in the defence burden imposed on Pakistan by its feud with India over the troubled region of Kashmir. Fully one third of the government budget is spent on the military, starving social development of funds. The scale of military spending also virtually guarantees the generals a powerful influence over the whole of public life. Even though General Waheed, the army chief of staff, is avowedly apolitical, his successors may not be. And while the conflict also puts a strain on India's public finance and on politics in India, Pakistan is a much smaller country and less able to contain its baleful effects. Few voices in Pakistan, however, challenge the consensus that military spending retains a high priority. Washington, for example, failed in an attempt to secure a cap on Pakistan's nuclear programme in return for a shipment of F-16 jets: Islamabad refused to consider such a move unless India did likewise. The immense distractions of Kashmir have been compounded by the effects of the continuing fighting in Afghanistan, where Pakistan remains involved in the rivalry between warring Mujahideen groups. The legacy of the anti-Soviet war has left huge quantities of arms in Pakistan, particularly in the lightly-administered mountainous tribal areas in the north, where, under treaties dating back to independence, the government's writ is limited. Power rests in the hands of tribal elders, some of whom have used it to amass fortunes smuggling guns and narcotics. According to the UN, Pakistan, which knew little even of opium 20 years ago, has become the world's second largest source of heroin after Burma. It has also spawned 3m drug addicts. The country's uneven political and social development and its ready access to guns has created fertile ground for crime and for political and religious extremism. The most pressing problem is in Karachi, the commercial capital, where more than two years of army deployment has failed to end criminal and political violence. Populated largely by refugees from northern India and their descendants, Karachi, furnishes about 60 per cent of government revenue but its people mostly feel excluded from a political system dominated by indigenous Sindhis and Punjabis - see report, page three. In the northern tribal areas, some chiefs and militant mullahs have proved themselves powerful enough to challenge the central government, notably in Malakand district, where armed supporters of a radical Islamic preacher have staged two uprisings this year. To their credit, Ms Bhutto and her ministers recognise the scale of the problem. She talks of the need for 'social revolution' in Pakistan. Mr Leghari's speech, cited above, is a model of objective analysis of matters which many governments would prefer to ignore. As well as dealing with corruption, he makes tough remarks on drugs, law and order, and the 'woefully low' education standards. Moreover, the government is taking action. Anti-corruption and anti-narcotics laws have been tightened. Karachi has been promised better policing and long-term investment in public services. Military spending is being kept under close control while social spending is being increased through a Social Action Programme, backed by international aid donors, which envisages spending Dollars 7bn over 1993-98 mainly on education and health. With luck and good weather, the economy should recover this year after two sluggish years and give Ms Bhutto some room to manoeuvre in financing these ambitious plans. She says: We don't believe in talking. We believe in doing.' But she has yet to show that she has the determination to force the rural elite to become more accommodating to the needs of ordinary Pakistanis. One example of the landowners' reluctance to countenance change has been the delay over the introduction of an agricultural income tax, imposed on the feudal elite. This was passed last year by the National Assembly and has since been ratified by provincial assemblies in Sindh, North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan but Punjab, home of the richest farmers, has refused to comply. If the landowners do not pay tax, who will pay for the education of their tenants? Ms Bhutto knows as well as anyone that a powerful and disciplined army can suppress social conflict but cannot remove its causes. She has made a good start in her second term in office by identifying Pakistan's deep-rooted problems and promising a response. She has now to prove she can deliver.</p>

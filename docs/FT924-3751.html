			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / An EC cuckoo in the Swiss clock: Fears of national vulnerability expressed as Switzerland goes to the polls tomorrow in a referendum on Europe FOR THE traveller newly arrived from any of the grimmer cities of the real world, Switzerland offers a delightful prospect - escape into the unreal world of the picture postcard. Other places may need the skilled deceptions of the photographer to remake them. Switzerland requires no such artifice; wherever you look, it is a picture postcard. There is something of the toy town, of the table-top maquette about the entire country. There are dolls' houses with gingerbread facades, miniature cog-wheel trains that trundle up alpine slopes as smooth as croquet lawns, petrol stations that look more like flower shows, medieval clock towers where outsize wind-up machinery ticks and whirrs and rings by the hour. Everything is clean, well-kept and neat. What happens to the sweet wrappers and empty cigarette packets that blow through the rest of the world's streets? It is a mystery. In Switzerland, they seem simply not to exist. Wander about for a few days and you might begin to think that Switzerland exists serenely detached from the rest of the world, a Shangri-La unaffected by disturbances emanating from beyond the Alps. But this is the greatest artifice of all. Howling over the summits and passes every day now are the winds of European change - political experiment, economic adjustment, social dislocation and international realignment. Like the celluloid veneer of a postcard photo, Switzerland's reassuring visual allure is thin. It papers over a growing Swiss anxiety and national debate about new ideals of continental integration, and about how far Switzerland should go in accepting or rejecting them. Nor is the debate a theoretical one concerned with some vague future - instability, recession and change in the outside world have already brought Switzerland, long Europe's most self-satisfied nation, troubles undreamed of since the second world war. In the last 18 months, real growth in Switzerland has been measured in negative terms. Domestic consumption has also shrunk. Mortgage and lending rates, traditionally low, have risen dramatically. House prices have dropped by up to 40 per cent. Switzerland used to have the lowest inflation rate of the 25 Organisation for Economic Cooperation Development countries; it currently has the sixth highest. Unemployment was non-existent two years ago; today, along with a hard drug problem, it is a major social concern. For the Swiss, the unimaginable has happened - what used to be merely other countries' problems are now becoming Switzerland's problems. Some see this only as the coming of the inevitable. 'Like it or not,' says Beat Arnet, assistant vice-president of the Union Bank of Switzerland, 'we are already integrated with Europe'. He points out that Switzerland, without resources of its own, is wholly dependent on value-added exports for its survival; almost two-thirds of Swiss exports go to the EC, more than three-quarters of imports come from the EC. Trading with the continent that surrounds you is hard to avoid. But Arnet also notes a fundamental contradiction in the Swiss character. 'It is very difficult to make the Swiss understand that our country is not an island. We think of ourselves as special. We have our own institutions, habits, and way of looking at the world. We want the advantages of trade with the rest of Europe, but really we would rather have nothing to do with it at all.' Switzerland's future direction now presents itself as concrete choice. In a referendum tomorrow, the Swiss will vote on a proposal for the creation of a European Economic Area, an act that would liberalise trade between the seven member-states of EFTA - the European Free Trade Association, of which Switzerland is a member - and the EC. Most Swiss, though, see the arrangement as more than mere market rationalisation - they believe it a first step towards full EC membership and all it implies. Should the Swiss play the economically rational card, concede to the political norms demanded by a unified Europe, and take advantage of the undoubted benefits of doing business in a community of 380m consumers? Or should they ignore sensible economics and - at the cost of exclusion from a continental economy - maintain a long-held tradition of political isolation, neutrality and grass-roots democracy found nowhere else? It is an issue on which the Swiss are, untypically, both passionate and deeply divided. There are many arguments suggesting that only a freer exchange of goods, services, and labour can restore Switzerland's health. These arguments are pragmatic and expressed in economic terms. They are propounded by big business, industry, the banks, government, and minority communities like the Swiss-French who, living on the outward-looking peripheries of the country, stand to benefit from stronger ties with the outside world. Their underlying thesis is clear enough: in a fast-changing world unchanging formulas of Swiss success, so long cherished, are becoming obsolete. 'Switzerland is an artificial creation, vulnerable from the outside and held together inside only by a near-sacred principle of consensus,' says Antoine Maurice, foreign editor of the pro-European Journal de Geneve. 'External changes have put heavy strains on our economy, and threatened Swiss consensus and security. For the first time in 40 years, the Swiss are questioning the instruments that brought them success.' Such questions are being asked in every sphere of Swiss life. When Switzerland emerged from the last world war with its economy unscathed, its tradition of value-added, high-tech export gave Swiss industry enormous competitive advantage over other war-torn economies. In today's post-industrial world, of course, competitive high-technology production is found around the globe. Foreign gains have become Swiss losses. Similarly, initial post-war prosperity and stability made Switzerland the international banking and investment centre of choice, and it remained so for decades. But many developments - the growth of other financial centres equally stable and profitable, revolutions such as London's 'Big Bang', offshore banking and easy access to world-wide markets and services - have all reduced Switzerland's unique appeal. In international relations, Switzerland's primary role as a strictly neutral mediator between cold war adversaries has collapsed. If the US and the Soviet Union were once a mother and father that nourished Switzerland in a global role, they have left it an orphan. It now struggles with other international conference centres offering cheaper facilities. Domestically, too, Swiss institutions are failing to meet modern needs. In the past, a strong sense of civic responsibility made the Swiss process of government by consensus responsive and workable. Local, cantonal and national decision-making though consensus, through committee and through a highly evolved system of referenda made every Swiss - or at least every Swiss male - a true democrat. Today, partly because of growing cynicism over a number of government scandals, only 30 to 40 per cent of Swiss regularly bother to vote. Nor does the system respond efficiently to the speed of change Europe is seeing today - tiny minorities entitled to call a referendum can block the political process; politicians in Switzerland are still part-time and cannot devote their full energies to office; and the exhaustive popular consultative process that underlies legislation is too slow and drawn out to be effective. Both economically and politically, Switzerland's clockwork is ever more out of kilter with the world around it. Synchronisation would return, say more outward-looking Swiss, if Switzerland threw in its lot with the rest of Europe. But arguments based on economic rationality make few inroads in Inner Switzerland, the conservative and isolationist Swiss-German heart of the country. In its farmyards, small businesses and rural communities Brussels, unwelcome as it is foreign, is seen as a distant, imperial enemy whose bureaucratic decrees would destroy local decision-making and the Swiss way of life. The Swiss here see not only their jealously guarded institutions under threat, but their livelihood as well: they are afraid that EC controls on agricultural subsidies would eliminate age-old but now uneconomic and heavily protected small-scale farming. The ideological differences separating traditional Switzerland from the Switzerland of the pro-European periphery are large and growing. There are now fears for the future unity of the Swiss Confederation. 'If the results of the December 6 referendum are split along French and German ethnic lines, we will have tension and possibly a separatist movement to contend with', predicts Roger de Weck, editor of the Tages Anzeiger, Switzerland's largest German-language newspaper. 'We are not a liberal country, but a radical country. We have imposed order and compromise because we have had a bloody history. Tensions which are now under control could explode.' It is in such references to history as Roger de Weck's that the most profound responses to European integration lie. Officially, political debate over future relations with Brussels is couched in the language of logic and reason. But lying behind these arguments are illogical, instinctive attachments to race, culture, nation and to the inbred traditions of history. It is the battle between market logic and these powerful atavistic forces that give such unpredictable direction to European unification efforts. The struggle in Switzerland between head and heart, between economic opportunity and separate political identity is particularly poignant because until now no such choice has been necessary - in the past these have not been contradictory ideals. On the contrary, they underlay the Swiss view of the world. Self-reliance and suspicion of outsiders is the hallmark of mountain people everywhere; an unforgiving environment leaves no room for chance or risk-taking. In the case of Switzerland, a tiny state without natural frontiers, the hostile designs of powerful foreign neighbours - the Habsburg empire, royalist France, Napoleonic France, and Nazi Germany were but a few  -have added to native conservatism a deep-seated sense of national vulnerability. The internal ethnic and religious disputes, often bloody, that have emerged time and again between Swiss of German, French and Italian culture over its 700-year history have only added to Switzerland's sense of its own fragility. Swiss folk heroes like William Tell are not bold, aggressive conquerors; they struggle for a Switzerland that is peaceful, self-reliant, and above all, free of foreign entanglements. It was this mental make-up of vulnerability that gave birth to many of the country's unique political views and institutions - its reluctance to resolve problems through direct confrontation; its mistrust of central authority, extremism and heavy-handed leadership; its intentionally weak federal government; its local decision-making and popular voting system. At the same time, however, Switzerland has been forced to go to the outside world to make its living. Landlocked and with no natural resources of its own, fearful for its fragile, institutions, Switzerland adopted a policy of strict neutrality, killing two birds with one stone: political isolation gave it the right to trade with any nation, but no nation the right to intrude in Swiss affairs. For much of its history Switzerland profitably marketed to all and sundry the only commodity it possessed - high quality professional mercenaries. Neutrality giving it the peace it needed to enjoy the fruits of war, Switzerland participated impartially in almost every European conflict for several centuries. Precision machinery, pharmaceuticals and luxury goods replaced mercenaries in the 19th century, but the strategy remained the same. Given its historical duality, is it any wonder that the Swiss are having difficulty in finding their place in the new Europe? In the past, reconciling inward-looking politics and an outward-looking economy presented no problem. Today it does, and the future of Switzerland depends on the resolution of a profound ambivalence.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (5): Flotation seen to lack lustre - Smaller firms prefer to dispose of a buy-out through trade sales FOR a few short weeks after the Conservative election victory in April the buoyancy of the London stock market prompted a surge of flotations of buy-out companies. In July MFI Furniture Group, Kenwood Appliances, Anglian Group and Taunton Cider were listed with a combined market capitalisation of more than Pounds 1.1bn. The continuing recession and political uncertainty have since made a public listing unattractive for all but a handful of companies. Such swings in the political and economic cycle are to be expected but of greater concern to managements and the organisations which finance buy-outs is a more fundamental decline in the opportunities for flotation. While the early 1980s saw the launch of the Unlisted Securities Market (USM) followed in 1987 by the creation of the Third Market, recent years have led to a narrowing of the options for flotation. The failure of the Third Market to attract sufficient high quality stocks and attempts to make the main market more accessible have brought about the demise of the Third Market and a decline in the attractiveness of the USM. Big Bang and the subsequent restructuring of the UK stock market have led to a concentration on the larger quoted stocks and a neglect of the smaller company. Even the main market has been unable to provide sufficient liquidity for the smaller quoted company. A number of large securities houses have withdrawn from making markets in many of the smaller stocks. 'The USM is a shadow of what it was at its peak,' says Mr Michael Smith, managing director (Europe) of Citicorp Venture Capital. 'We probably wouldn't take a company to the USM now but would encourage it to wait until it was of a size to go to the main market.' Even there the absence of market makers at the bottom end is worrying. Some buy-out financiers say that they never used the USM anyway because it was only a half-way house to a full flotation. Others point out that some companies which were never suited to a listing were floated in the heady days of the late 1980s. But even if excesses were committed during the boom, the effective removal of flotation as an option for the smaller company represents a loss to the buy-out sector. It may also have implications for the way deals are structured in future. 'People will have to be more conscious of the need for a running yield rather than just an exit realisation to get a reasonable return,' says Mr Gordon MacLean, responsible for larger buy-outs at 3i. This could lead to a greater emphasis on, for example, preference shares in deal structures. In the short term, at least, managers of buy-out companies may have mixed feelings about the narrowing of the flotation option. They are only too aware of the problems which many small companies have encountered after obtaining a listing. Companies have frequently been unable to make rights issues and have found the pressures of listed status too burdensome. They have to spend a lot of their time keeping shareholders informed while the stock market is unforgiving of any temporary set back in performance. But while a flotation is the most high profile means of obtaining an 'exit', a sale to a corporate buyer has proved to be the most common next step in the development of most buy-outs. Ten per cent of buy-outs completed between 1981 and 1991 were subsequently sold on to a trade buyer while just 4.4 per cent were floated, according to Nottingham University's Centre for Management Buy-Out Research. A trade sale is often the only option open to the company which is too small to go for a flotation. This usually allows the financial backer to realise all of his investment while managers, if they wish, can normally withdraw after a handover period. A corporate buyer may also be prepared to pay a higher price than could be realised by flotation if it sees synergies resulting from combining the two businesses. Swedish Match, which was sold to Procordia, a Swedish food pharmaceuticals group, earlier this year, considered a flotation, says Mr Smith of Citicorp, which had backed the earlier Swedish Match buy-out. But the company's activities had a wide geographical spread, making it difficult to value its overseas assets and to decide on which market to float. A sale meant investors could get their money back, gave the management the opportunity for added responsibility within the larger group and allowed Swedish Match to benefit from Procordia's distribution network. Del Monte Foods International got as far as announcing plans for a flotation in February 1992 amid suggestions it might attract a valuation of Pounds 450m. In October, however, it opted for a sale to a joint venture between two South African companies, Royal Foods and Anglo American Corporation, for Pounds 360m, citing stock market uncertainty. Sometimes a company is too small to consider a public flotation. A market capitalisation of at least Pounds 60m is needed to consider a float while Pounds 100m often makes a more realistic minimum, says Mr David Hutchings, deputy managing director of Montagu Private Equity. For all the thought that is given to 'exits' only a small proportion of buy-outs over the past decade have reached this stage of development. Only just over 23 per cent of buy-outs completed between 1981 and 1991 have achieved any form of exit whether flotation, sale, receivership or refinancing, according to the Centre for Management Buy-Out Research. This may be partly explained by the fact that it was not until the late 1980s that buy-outs began to be done in large numbers - 315 in 1986 rising to a peak of 485 in 1990. But the result is that the financial backers of buy-outs will have to devote much of their energy to exits over the next few years if they are to achieve their expected returns. One option which has yet to be explored in any detail is the refinancing deal which allowing the buy-out management to retain its independence. A refinancing which leaves the existing management in charge would depend on the business producing sufficient profits to fund the deal. Buy-outs have in the past been criticised for encouraging short-term thinking on the part of managements and financiers. A refinancing formula which ensured continuity of management and ownership might go some way to counter this as well as meeting the wishes of managers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LISTED AND UNLISTED MBOs OVER POUNDS 10M  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   Number                       Value (Pds m)              Total      Listed        %      Total     Listed        %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1981-84         25           1        4        860        310       36 1985            23           2        9        870         70        8 1986            27           2        7        940         30        3 1987            33           4       12      2,750        480       17 1988            55           6       11      4,510        940       21 1989            71          12       17      5,860      3,780       65 1990            58           4        7      2,010        170        8 1991            44           1        2      1,880         20        1 1992 (to date)  43           1        2      1,450         10        1                379          33        9     21,130      5,810       27  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: KPMG Corporate Finance  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Electrical workers' union votes to join TUC MEMBERS of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union have voted overwhelmingly to belong to the TUC. The move comes five years after the EETPU electricians' union, now a section of the AEEU, was expelled from the TUC for defying its rules. Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU, described the vote as 'the biggest vote of confidence the trade union movement has ever had'. The postal ballot was called because of the merger last May of the AEU engineering union, which was affiliated to the TUC, and the EETPU to form Britain's second largest union. Although the new union's engineering section is affiliated to the TUC, the union as a whole is not. In a postal ballot, 37 per cent of the 839,250 members voted with 283,956 (91.7 cent) approving TUC affiliation and 25,619 voting against (8.3 per cent). The turnout was higher than the 30 per cent or less usually achieved through postal ballots in trade unions. The EETPU was seen as a rightwing maverick union in constant conflict with other unions which disliked its aggressive but successful policies that pioneered single union agreements and no strike deals. The AEEU is expected to join the TUC in September, but the final terms still have to be negotiated and must be approved by three quarters of the AEEU's executive council. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers union, welcomed the AEEU ballot result yesterday because it would 'help to consolidate the unity of the labour movement'. He said he firmly believed that 'any difficulties' between the unions which remained could 'now be sorted out within the commonly accepted structures of the TUC'.

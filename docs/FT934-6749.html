			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bubble's collapse hits Japan's builders - Construction The 'tenants wanted' signs plastered on buildings around Tokyo and Osaka tell as much about the difficulties of Japan's construction companies as their interim profit statements, which detailed rapidly slowing orders and generally falling profits. In the late 1980s, the so-called 'bubble era', the contractors were aggressive developers of office buildings and resorts in Japan and abroad. They prospered from a surge in investment by ambitious Japanese manufacturers, which expanded plant capacity in the expectation of demand that has yet to materialise. The bubble's collapse has left the contractors unable to fill their own buildings and resorts, and facing a continuing decline in orders from private customers. To add to the woes, construction companies are at the centre of the latest political scandal and some excluded from public works bidding, the only area of potential growth this year. The interim statements reveal some of the bruises, but have yet to show the effects of the sharp fall in orders this year. In the first half, the Federation of Construction Companies said orders were 22.3 per cent lower than a year ago, marking three years of contraction since the peak reached in the first half of 1990. Kajima, the latest company to be implicated in the political scandal, reported a 12.2 per cent fall in sales in the six months to September, and a 16.7 per cent slide in pre-tax profit. Shimizu reported a 3.7 per cent increase in sales, but a 3.8 per cent drop in pre-tax profit and a 32 per cent fall in net profit. The damage was more severe at Kumagai Gumi, which saw a 25.9 per cent fall in sales, a 74.5 per cent drop in pre-tax profit, and a 92.4 per cent plunge in net profit, which was a thin Y323m. Obayashi was the exception, reporting an 18.7 per cent rise in sales, and a 133.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profit and a similar leap in net profit, which it attributed to a cost-cutting drive. However, the contractor said orders for the period were down 32.4 per cent on a year earlier. The fall in orders was repeated at other leading contractors. Taisei said that its orders received slipped 38.6 per cent, Kajima 24.9 per cent, Shimizu 32.1 per cent, and Kumagai Gumi 13.4 per cent. Private construction tends to account for about two-thirds of orders, but contractors had hoped that three stimulatory packages over the past year would lead to an increasing flow of public works orders. The bribery scandals have hurt the industry through the bidding suspensions imposed on some companies, but the damage has been larger than expected because government authorities have delayed awarding contracts, fearing the embarrassment that would be caused if the chosen company was implicated in the scandal. The trend was reflected in a 19 per cent fall in public works orders during the first half, and the industry is hoping that delayed contracts will be awarded early next year. But companies whose executives are alleged to have given illegal donations to politicians could still be overlooked even if the formal suspension on bidding is lifted. Construction ministry officials are reviewing the 'designated bidder' selection process for public works projects. The scheme has been blamed for encouraging corruption among authorities responsible for designating the bidding companies and for encouraging collusion among the companies, which often decide the bid prices among themselves. Private construction orders are unlikely to recover for at least a year. Manufacturers, which account for about 20 per cent of private orders, are continuing to cut capital spending, and new factories are likely to be established in China or elsewhere in east Asia. Residential demand has been rising in recent months, as reflected in a relatively small 1.3 per cent decrease in sales at Daiwa House, which had an 11 per cent fall in pre-tax profits. Orders during the period were Y476bn, compared with Y472bn in the same period last year. Larger contractors' profits are more closely linked to commercial building demand, which has been undermined by the continuing flow of completions that were commissioned during the bubble era. According to the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, established by Japanese banks to clear their property-related bad loans, commercial prices are expected to continue falling for at least another year. For the full year to March, Kajima is expecting pre-tax profits to fall by 29 per cent, Taisei by 34 per cent, Shimizu by 24 per cent, and Kumagai Gumi 69 per cent. Obayashi is forecasting a 22 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Y60bn (Dollars 561m).  -----------------------------------------------------------------                      INTERIM RESULTS 1993-94 (Ybn)  -----------------------------------------------------------------                   Sales      Change        Pre-tax      Change                                   %         Profit         %  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Shimizu           955.6        +3.7          49.0        -3.8 Kajima            796.2       -12.2          31.8       -16.7 Taisei            789.5       -11.0          31.8       -30.8 Obayashi          785.9       +18.7          37.5      +133.5 Kumagai           333.4       -25.9           3.1       -74.5 Daiwa House       458.8        -1.3          39.1       -11.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Observer: Herd heard Are Japanese researchers putting the cart before the horse - or even the cow? British cows, at any rate, have an inbuilt body-clock which tells them when it is time to gather for milking or feeding. But it seems that Japanese farmers - suffering from both a shortage of herdsmen and a blind faith in technology - are resorting to playing music to announce bovine tea-time. Last year, scientists at an experimental farm relayed music across the fields by loudspeaker and then put out feed for the animals. However, because loudspeakers have only a limited range, the researchers decided instead to play the sounds over bleepers in the cows' ears. So far, apparently, the tests are promising, but more research is needed to discover the cows' preferred taste in music. The current favourite is a piano version of Spring Stream, a Japanese folk song. But perhaps Moo River may be more to their liking?</p>

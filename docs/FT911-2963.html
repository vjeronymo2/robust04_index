			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Exxon may face criminal trial over Valdez oil spill EXXON faces the prospect of a costly, lengthy and highly- publicised criminal trial unless it agrees to raise substantially the Dollars 1.1bn settlement it reached with the US and Alaska governments over the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The oil company's liability for damages from the March 1989 disaster has been reopened by a US judge's decision to reject as inadequate the Dollars 100m criminal fine which was included in the settlement. The remaining Dollars 1bn is a settlement of civil damages. Exxon said yesterday that 'while we are carefully considering the implications of the judge's decision, we are continuing our preparation for trial.' The company has 30 days to decide whether to withdraw its guilty pleas to four violations of environmental law, and thereby face a criminal trial. Judge Russel Holland indicated that he would treat the case as a priority. The federal justice department warned that the rejection of the criminal fine also threatens the Dollars 1bn civil settlement. Ms Hope Babcock, general counsel for the National Audubon Society, a Washington-based conservation group, predicted that Exxon would return to the bargaining table on the criminal settlement, but that the justice department and the Alaska state government might also seek higher civil damages.</p>

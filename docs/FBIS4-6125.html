			<p>BFN     [Text] The United States has informally asked Japan to  suspend the yen-based loans to Iran Japan resumed last year.  The U.S. Government has taken the position that "it is  undesirable to provide economic aid to Iran that has been  supporting terrorism and has been uncooperative in the Middle  East peace process." In response, the Japanese Government is  refuting the U.S. request, asserting: "The yen-based loans are  to be used for projects unrelated to Iran's military buildup and  there is no problem with Japan's resumption of the yen-based  loans to that country." But the Japanese Government has yet to  make the U.S. Government fully understand.    According to a concerned official, the U.S. request was made  in late March by American officials with the U.S. Department of  State and the National Security Council (NSC) to the Foreign  Ministry.    The Japanese Government decided last May to resume the  yen-based loans to Iran for the first time in 17 years after  concluding that "Iran has a great influence in the Middle East  and that Japan's economic aid to the country will bring  political and economic stability to the region." The loans are  expected to amount to 150 billion yen and are to be used for the  construction of a dam on the Karun River in southeastern Iran.    The yen-based loans are to be provided in three installments  because of the large amount. Japan was committed last year to  approximately 38 billion yen in the first installment. A  Foreign Ministry source says: "At the time, the Clinton  administration did not have its Middle East policy team in place  and the administration did not raise any objection to Japan's  commitment." The Clinton administration has made clear its  critical attitude toward Iran as it has shaped its policy toward  the Middle East. The U.S. Government is said to have asked the  Japanese Government to defer providing the second and third  installments of the loans on which Japan is to decide this year.    The Japanese Government stresses: "It is not desirable to  halt the yen-based loans to Iran halfway." The U.S. Government  is said to be unhappy with the Japanese Government, claiming:  "Japan is the only nation among the G-7 industrialized nations  that is trying to use the Official Development Assistance (ODA)  to provide massive economic aid to Iran." Anthony Lake,  assistant to the president for national security affairs, has  just written an article entitled "The Containment of Iran" in  FOREIGN AFFAIRS, an influential foreign affairs journal in the  United States. There is a possibility that the "Iran issue"  will become a focal point at the talks of industrialized nations  (the Naples summit) to be held this July.</p>

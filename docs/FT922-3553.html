			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Delors hits back at critics with warning of stagnation MR Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, yesterday hit back at critics of the planned increase in the European Community budget. He warned that the EC would relapse into 'stagnation or crisis' if richer states continued to resist an increase in contributions to the budget. The 35 per cent boost in EC revenue proposed in the so-called Delors II package came under attack from seven out of 12 members - led by Germany and Britain - at Tuesday's meeting of finance ministers in Luxembourg. Yesterday, Mr Delors told the European parliament in Strasbourg that the EC would have to scale back its plans for 1993-97 drastically if member states remained intransigent. Holding contributions at the equivalent of 1.2 per cent of gross national product until 1997 would provide Ecu11bn (Pounds 7.7bn) of additional annual funding by 1997, against Ecu21bn under plans for a 1.37 per cent contribution. Mr Delors said: 'With that Ecu11bn we could finance the reform of the common agricultural policy, the cohesion funds (for poorer EC members), to the tune of up to Ecu10bn over five years, and external policy. But there would be no increase in structural funds, and no increase for internal policies (principally research and schemes to make EC companies more competitive). Can we really envisage that?' Finance ministers cannot block the package, but their comments are likely to influence foreign ministers, who will discuss it on Monday, and EC leaders in Lisbon at the end of the month. 'A realistic assessment of the attitude of the 12 at the moment makes me think the budget will not be adopted in its entirety at the next European Council (in Lisbon),' admitted Mr Delors yesterday. But he said he hoped for a formal decision at the Edinburgh summit in December. Mr Delors added that the Commission had prepared its evaluation of Britain's rebate on budget contributions - worth Ecu3.3bn last year - and was waiting for the right occasion to publish it.</p>

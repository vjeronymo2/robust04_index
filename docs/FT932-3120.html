			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Nigeria vote rigging claim THE party trailing in Nigeria's presidential election, the National Republican Convention (NRC), has alleged rigging and called for fresh voting, Reuter reports from Lagos. Meanwhile, Mr Arthur Nzeribe, a millionaire behind the Association for a Better Nigeria which wants military rule extended, said it had won a court order barring the electoral commission (NEC) from announcing the result of Saturday's poll. On Thursday, the group had won a temporary injunction to delay the poll, but this was over-ruled by the NEC. The contest was between two millionaire Moslem businessmen, Mr Moshood Abiola of the Social Democratic party, whose predictions of clear victory have been borne out by results so far, and Mr Bashir Tofa of the NRC.</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL SOCCER ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ARCADIA BEATS HART ON PENALTY KICK  </P> <P> Hart High's push-came-to-shove Foothill League soccer match against Arcadia on  Friday belonged in the Forum, where boxing and the National Hockey League are  often featured.  </P> <P> "It was very much like a hockey game and not a soccer game," Arcadia Coach  Floyd Williams said of his Apaches' 2-1 victory over Hart at Hart.  </P> <P> Kevin Williams, the coach's freshman son, scored on a penalty kick with seven  minutes left to give Arcadia (14-5-2 overall, 9-4-1 in league play) the  deciding goal.  </P> <P> The Apaches were awarded the penalty kick after officials charged Ruban Ramirez  with elbowing an Arcadia player in the back of the head.  </P> <P> The checking, however, was wild on both sides.  </P> <P> Arcadia's Neil Voskeritchian, who scored on a breakaway to give the Apaches a  1-0 halftime lead, was given a yellow card in the second half for colliding  with Hart goalkeeper Octavio Benavides.  </P> <P> Two minutes later, Indian midfielder John DePaco was penalized for throwing an  elbow at Brad Miller along the Hart sideline after the ball rolled out of  bounds.  </P> <P> Four yellow cards -- including one given to Hart Coach Robert Benavidez for  arguing with officials before the Apaches' game-winning penalty kick -- were  issued in the match.  </P> <P> "Brutal? It's not the word for it," said Benavidez, whose Indians (13-2-4,  7-2-4) dropped to fourth in the league standings, one point behind Arcadia.  </P> <P> Oliver Germond scored Hart's only goal seven minutes into the second half. The  Indians outshot Arcadia, 10-3. MIKE GLAZE  </P></p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / This Week: FT Guide to Boss of the Year Britain is holding its breath this week: not so much for tonight's confidence vote at Westminster, or tomorrow's Budget, but for the result on Wednesday of the Boss of the Year award. What is the origin of 'boss'? Dictionaries say it is derived from the Dutch word baas, meaning master or uncle, and is probably related to the old High German basa (aunt). The word can have slighly perjorative connotations - when used, for example, in relation to politicians who control a party machine - though the once-sinister BOSS (South African Bureau of State Security) is an acronym and strictly no relation. In Australia, boss-cocky is an informal term for especially overbearing bosses. Companies called Boss have had mixed fortunes. The German menswear business Hugo Boss - which has a Boss men's fragrance - has been making a good contribution to the profits of its Italian parent, Marzotto. The British fork-lift truck manufacturer Lancer Boss, however, went into receivership earlier this year and is now owned by the German company Jungheinrich. Is there a typical boss? A typical UK director is a 52-year-old male, though the age range is late teens to early 90s. Women are outnumbered 35:1 in British boardrooms. Until he stepped down earlier this year as non-executive deputy chairman of the south coast motor group Caffyns, the oldest incumbent of a publicly quoted company was thought to be 92-year-old Lord Shawcross. How many other bosses can you boss? Professor Sir Roland Smith, former chairman of British Aerospace, used to be the record holder with 11 non-executive directorships (he now has a mere six). At the last count, George Duncan led the field with eight. Who is the toughest boss? Lord Sheppard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, holds this distinction in Britain, according to one poll, though he was once reputedly so mild on a visit to an American subsidiary that his hosts thought they had the wrong man. Certainly he sounds tame by comparison with T J Rodgers, ceo of California-based Cypress Semiconductors and America's toughest boss in 1993, according to Fortune. Rodgers routinely reduces employees to tears, and has developed what is known inside the company as 'killer software' - that tracks down and penalises employees by stopping their cheques. He told one: 'I am willing to see your children's tuition payments go away and for you to lose your house and go on welfare ..' Who is the meanest boss? Earlier this year the FT made a valiant attempt to unearth this unworthy individual, but the 'competition' was quickly abandoned in the absence of suitable nominations. It is no doubt prejudicial to say so, but perhaps the media ogre Robert Maxwell should have had the honour conferred posthumously (to be held in perpetuity). Who is the highest paid boss? Michael Eisner of Disney, with Dollars 203m, topped a Business Week survey last April measuring all remuneration (including stock options). Lou Gerstner's Dollars 7.7m of salary, bonus and other payments heads a Wyatt/Fortune list published in July. Peter Wood, chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland's insurance subsidiary Direct Line, wins the UK's biggest prize - a Pounds 21m 'contract variation' this year plus a Pounds 350,000 salary. According to Labour Research, an independent consultancy, 71 UK directors received more than Pounds 100m between them in share dividends last year (among them, payouts to Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber of Really Useful Holdings of Pounds 13.3m and to David Sainsbury of grocer J Sainsbury of Pounds 11m). Which car do bosses typically like to drive? A poll conducted by Reward and the Institute of Directors puts the Jaguar way ahead, even though its popularity fell from 84 per cent to 79 per cent last year. Mercedes was second. Why is there a Boss of the Year award? Largely, one suspects, to generate publicity on local radio and in local newspapers for the international distribution company sponsoring the event. This year's finalists include 35-year-old Henry Stewart, boss of the London-based IT training company Happy Computers, who personally inspired a 4pm ice-cream break for clients and staff, allows staff to choose their own titles and job descriptions, and arranged for a bouncy castle to be hired for a recent agm. The current Boss of the Year is Reg Key of Chubb Fire.</p>

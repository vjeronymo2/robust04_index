			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 21 (CNA) -- The economy is expected to  flash a green light in May for the sixth month in a row,  according to a preliminary index used by the Council for  Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) to measure Taiwan's  business activity. The CEPD estimated that the index would  stand at 26 for May -- about the same level as April.    The CEPD, Taiwan's highest economic planning agency, uses a  five-color rating system to measure economic prospects. A red  light means the economy is overheated, yellow-red signals brisk  economic growth, green indicates steady expansion, yellow-blue  shows economic slowdown, and blue means recession.    A CEPD official said despite lackluster production  capability  and exports for the month, the economy would get a green light  on the strength of the booming stock market.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOCIAL SWIRLERS LEAP AT ATTENDING OAKS CLASSIC  </P> <P> Joan Irvine Smith was host of her fifth annual Oaks Classic on Sunday -- a hot  afternoon of fast horses leaping tall fences in an oak-shaded show ring at  Smith's San Juan Capistrano riding center.  </P> <P> The two-day event is one of the most prestigious show-jumping competitions on  the West Coast, and with prize money totaling $75,000 and VIP accommodations,  it brings out the local social swirlers.  </P> <P> Among those striding the ringside Astroturf in the shade of the VIP tent (hung  with framed oil paintings in generic Impressionist style), were Lois and Buzz  Aldrin, Jolene and Tom Fuentes, Dr. Robert H. Schuller and his son and  daughter-in-law, Robert and Donna Schuller, Ardith and Howard Marguleas, June  and Victor Andrews, and Donna and John Crean. Asked about her interest in  horses, Donna Crean of Newport Beach said that while she wasn't an  equestrienne, her daughter once took a shine to the sport.  </P> <P> "Actually, we came here to eat," Crean said between bites.  </P> <P> The lavishly laden buffets -- each topped with huge floral decorations and  cooled by giant fans -- were enough of a reason to make the drive. To feed the  masses -- more than 1,000 people attended the event, including about 400 guests  in the VIP tent Sunday -- Cathee Hickok of Rococo catering hauled in 6,000  jumbo shrimp, 5,000 oysters, 3,000 clams, 400 pounds of crab claws, 400 pounds  of lobster and 200 pounds of ceviche.  </P> <P> Smith spent most of the afternoon at a table in the shade with friends Monte  Fisher, Jan and Bill Baker and Catherine Shattuck. Smith's mother, Athalie  Clarke, sat nearby chatting with ear specialist Dr. Howard House. PAMELA MARIN  </P></p>

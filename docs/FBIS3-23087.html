			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former al-Shawqiyun leader 'Adil </F> 'Abd-al-Baqi, alias Abu-'Abd-al-Rahman, by Ahmad Musa; place and  date not given]    [Text] [Musa] I sat opposite a well-built, clean-shaven man  in a "pink" outfit. I asked him to speak honestly, which he  promised to do. I inquired about his background.    ['Abd-al-Baqi] My name is 'Adil Muhammad 'Abd-al-Baqi. I was  born on 9 April 1961 in al-Fayyum, one of eight children, to an  ordinary family. My father is a government employee, my mother  does not work. We are a religious family that observes the  rites and prays regularly. I did very well in school and every  year I received various honors from the governor and other  officials.    [Musa] How did your links with the extremists in your town  begin?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] In late 1977, I frequently went to the club  and the nearby mosque, whose imam was Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman.  The very first time I entered the mosque I was given a buoyant  reception by 'Abd-al-Rahman's followers, who treated me like one  of their own. One of them was 'Imad Khalifah, a student at the  al-Haram Physical Education Institute. I grew attached to the  mosque and its imam.    Once when Khalifah was back in town from Cairo he invited me  to go to Cairo with him and meet some of his colleagues who he  said "are a real embodiment of true religion."    I went with him to Fatimah al-Zahra' Mosque in al-Sahil in  Shubra [in Cairo] where I was welcomed with enthusiasm similar  to that displayed in al-Fayyum. Among those who welcomed me  were Muhammad al-Aswani, Khamis Muslim, 'Isam al-Qamari--the  three who staged the big escape from Turah prison in 1988 and  were later killed in clashes with police--and Salah  'Abd-al-Basir. My extremist schooling began with them. I  started by reading the "Four Terms" book by Abu-al-A'la  al-Mawdudi, which taught me four new concepts about government,  godliness, worship, and religion.    A second book was "New Rules of Propagation" by Ibn-Rajab  al-Hambali. This one included ideas about religious licenses,  sanctions for killing and theft, and rulings about apostasy.    A third book was "Milestones" by Sayyid Qutb, who concludes  that all secular governments are atheistic and must be  overthrown.    At that time my ideas on change took shape. What completely  made up my mind was the 28th volume of "The Doctrine of Jihad"  by Ibn Taymiyah. The 600-page volume was summarized by Muhammad  'Abd-al-Salam in a 54-page book entitled "The Missing Rite."  The group's Shura Council concluded that fighting the regime  should be our sole occupation. I left school because we ruled  that teaching is a sin and those who engage in that profession  are atheists who know nothing about religion. Back home I told  my family that they were all atheists and left the house, never  to see them again. This was in 1980.    [Musa] What was your specific mission when you set up the  organization?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] I conveyed the information and ideas I had to  other groups, particularly because I am a tactful and convincing  speaker. It occurred to me to call for burning down movie  theaters and shops. Our first sabotage operation was against  the 'Abd-al-Hamid movie theater in al-Fayyum. We burned it down  when it was showing the film "Islam al-Masih" ["Christ's  Conversion to Islam"]. We burned it again after it was  renovated and destroyed many other shops.    With the growing number of operations, the security  apparatus  started to summon me and the group working with me, 18 members  at first. At that time the al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' incidents  occurred and were followed by the late President Anwar  al-Sadat's decision to place 1,553 persons under custody. My  name was 81st on the list and I was the youngest one, 20 years  old. I went to jail with 'Imad Khalifah. Al-Sadat was  assassinated in 40 days. We rejoiced that the head of the  regime had fallen. Eighteen persons of Yusuf al-Badri's group  were jailed. Among them were Shawqi al-Shaykh, a student at  Hulwan Technological Institute; Rafi' Mustafa Sayyid, who is now  wounded in Pishawar; and 'Abdallah al-Samawi. I spent 14 months  in the same room with Shawqi and al-Samawi. We spent our time  reading and isolated ourselves from the rest of the inmates, who  had no specific orientation at the time. The three of us even  used to perform our prayers alone.    I agreed with Shawqi to establish a group under our  leadership. He was released four months before me but was  rearrested for harboring a fugitive from Cairo. When I was  released from jail, I formed the first group of this  organization. It included Kamal Tawfiq, "the present leader";  al-Sayyid Khalid Mahmud, sentenced to 10 years in the case of  the al-Zaytun jeweler shop robbery and the assassination of  Lieutenant Colonel 'Ala' al-Barrawi of the State Security  Detectives; Ahmad al-Khawli, a suspect in the case against 'Umar  'Abd-al-Rahman; and Muhammad 'Abd-al-Mun'im. The number of  members reached 25.    Al-Khawli asked me to leave al-Fayyum for al-'Arish, which  was a new area. He succeeded in convincing a large number, who  were arrested as soon as they arrived in al-'Arish. I rented a  flat. I had &pound;4,000 that I had taken from my mother to trade  chickens. I had spent the money on my colleagues after two  months.    [Musa] Where did you obtain the funds for your group  members?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] Regrettably, the idea of sanctioning  [al-istihlal] was first introduced by 'Abdallah al-Samawi, alias  Tahah. Our robberies were first confined to bicycles and  motorcycles despite the small amount of money. But they helped  provide food and clothing.    When Shawqi left prison, I visited him in his Sinaru  al-Qibliyah village. He was in very bad psychological  condition. We agreed not to go to the mosques and perform the  Friday prayers with only our group. We relied on the  "Al-Tawhid" group book by Shaykh Muhammad Bin-'Abd-al-Wahhab.  We centered our activities in the villages of Kahk al-Qibliyah,  Kahk al-Bahriyah, and al-Rashidiyah.    We extended our thefts to various governorates, including  Cairo, Bani Suwayf, and al-Fayyum. The robbery of motorcycles  spread during this period, and al-Shawqiyun was responsible for  all the thefts that occurred between 1983 and 1984. We also  carried out highway robberies and seized passengers' money.    'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman was acquitted in the al-Jihad case in  early 1984. He returned to al-Fayyum as a spiritual leader and  became a larger-than-life figure. Some 500 members joined our  group. It was proposed that we work under the leadership of  'Umar or just use his name. The group was divided and was  vehemently attacked by 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman. 'Abd-al-Rahman has  a vicious tongue, is good speaker, and a polygamist. We closed  down the Markaz Ibshaway and banned 'Umar and al-Samawi from  entering. The area was free for our group. I started to visit  villages and hamlets from Naja' Hammadi in the south to Shaykh  Zuwayd in the north and Matruh in the west. This caused problems  with the security services because I recruited thousands of  youths. Then the burning of cars and clubs occurred. Later, the  "Hesitation and Confirmation" group was seized and I, as its  leader, was imprisoned for six months. After I was released, I  asked Shawqi al-Shaykh to rejoin our group as agreed in  Abu-Za'bal.    [Musa] Who were your recruits?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] Those who actually carried out the orders  given to them. My role was to overcome whatever reservations  they may have had.    [Musa] What were the reasons underlying the organization's  specialization, as compared to other radical organizations, in  robbing jewelry shops?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] With the increase in the number of members  and  the costs involved, we thought of robbing jewelry shops,  including that of the "three brothers" in al-Zaytun, "Mishmish"  in al-Matariyah, "al-Batul" in al-Khusus, and "Hakim" in 'Ayn  Shams. Those were some of the fiercest operations carried out by  groups from al-Shaqiyun and included 'Ali 'Abd-al-Wahhab,  Ramadan Mustafa, Hilal Shafi', Khalid 'Abd-al-Hamid Imam, 'Ali  Fayid Mayhub, Muhammad Ahmad Farghali, and Kamal 'Abdallah.  Some of these have been sentenced to death and executed and  others were sentenced to various periods of imprisonment. They  collected huge amounts of gold jewelry in these incidents, which  were accurately planned by specific groups.    [Musa] It is obvious that when the members of your group  fell  no further robberies were committed. Are there elements around  that can perform these special tasks?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] It is certain that al-Shawqiyun was solely  responsible for these tasks; they had no partners from other  organizations. The leaders' fall does not mean the termination  of these operations. But the security agencies are tightening  their control on jewelry shops in all cities and governorates.  This makes the success of these operations uncertain.  Moreover, there are no leaders among the remnants of  al-Shawqiyun. They are currently in the making.    [Musa] What about the other organizations: The Vanguards of  Conquest, al-Jihad, Those Delivered From Fire, and Repudiation  and Renunciation, and their leading cadres?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] I did not join the Islamic Group because I  detest 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman personally. The operations they  carry out, particularly in Upper Egypt, are part of their public  actions. They often claim responsibility for the crimes they  commit. The examples are numerous. I believe that the group  has weakened considerably after the security agencies'  successive blows to their leading cadres, who are actually  responsible for running the criminal operations. I recall that  Tharwat Hajjaj was one of the most reliable cadres in his  organization because he was a good thinker. He was rivaled only  by Safwat 'Abd-al-Ghani and Mamduh Yusuf, both accused of  assassinating late People's Assembly Speaker Rif'at al-Mahjub.    [Musa] What about other elements?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] Muhammad al-Najjar, the third defendant in  the  al-Mahjub case, is a Maxton Fort [a liquid amphetamine] addict.  Traces of injections are all over his body. He joined the group  to be beside 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman.    Muhammad Shawqi al-Islambuli is living off the reputation of  his brother Khalid, who killed the late president.    'Izzat al-Salamuni, implicated in the al-Mahjub case, has no  vision of religion or organizational action.    'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman: The press and the security turned him  into a star. He is talkative and sharp-tongued. After raiding  the Asyut Security Directorate's building and killing 23  officers and soldiers on 8 October 1981, 'Abd-al-Rahman ordered  members of the organization to fast in the prison for 60 days to  atone for their failure to consult with him over the operation.  (This is mentioned for the first time.)    Tal'at Yasin Hammam: One of the most important fugitives.  He is actually responsible for carrying out criminal  operations. He conveys messages to certain elements to  accomplish certain objectives.    Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim, alias Abu-Talal al-Qasimi: Good for  talking and sending leaflets from abroad, but he is unable to  lead the group.    The Vanguards of Conquest: This organization is more  dangerous and more active. The advanced equipment seized from  its members indicates this. The organization adopts an  intricate system in its operations and its members receive  thorough training in the apartments they rent; they know how to  use coded messages, and most of those who now join the group had  travelled to Afghanistan with "al-Jihad, the Islamic Group, or  Notification and Propagation." The organization focuses on  selecting new members who have not been monitored by the  security services and have no identity cards. These members,  therefore, manage to enter ports and airports normally. The  organization's members remain under observation and  psychological training until they themselves ask for  assignments. They often carry out crimes that draw widescale  reaction, like the attempts on the lives of Prime Minister Dr.  'Atif Sidqi and Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. Through such  crimes they seek to show that the regime is impotent, which is  more dangerous than guns.    Repudiation and Renunciation: The most dangerous criminal  mentality on the scene was that of Shukri Mustafa. The  organization has not disappeared; it is only dormant. After the  Shaykh al-Dhahabi incident and the murder of Shukri Mustafa,  Muhammad al-Amin 'Abd-al-Fattah assumed its leadership. He  travels between several countries. A split took place and Dr.  Wahid Abu-Salman was put in charge of the organization.    Those Delivered From Fire: Their leader is Amin 'Abdallah,  not Yusri 'Abd-al-Mun'im or Majdi al-Safti. Amin's mission is  to give lessons to the organization's members, who include 'Adil  Musa 'Atiyah and 'Abdallah Abu-al-'Ula. As regards Muhammad  Qasim 'Abd-al-Qawi, who was "killed at the Santaris battle," he  only knew a collection of short Koranic verses.    Al-Jihad: Muhammad al-Aswani and his brother Tariq, Khamis  Musallam, Muhammad Sa'd, Hasan al-Hillawi, and 'Abbud al-Zumur  are its leaders. Under the slogan "the end justifies the  means," members of the organization use their wives to carry  weapons and ammunition. Al-Jihad carries out secret  organizational actions; this was the principle of the unified  organization before the 1981 events.    Al-Shawqiyun: A group of thieves and robbers; they are no  different from the other groups although their armed operations  are violent and vicious. They do not mind killing scores of  citizens to ensure the success of their operations. The  organization has reached a level where every group assigns  itself some task, such as assassination or armed robbery. The  crimes are not organized because the organization has so many  members with different thoughts.    [Musa] What is your explanation of the competition among  terrorist groups to perform the largest number of operations?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] What the so-called Islamic Group is  doing--striking here and there--has no noticeable effect. Their  intention is to create a state of confusion and panic. As for  the Islamic Jihad, their operations are intentional and have a  definite objective. The Vanguards of Conquest's problem is  choosing a target and finding the way and means to attack it.  Despite the different sizes of the operations, their objectives  are the same: to embarrass and pressure the government.    [Musa] You were responsible for one of the terrorist groups  and know the size of its expenditures. Where does the funding  for these groups come from?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] The al-Shawqiyun and Repudiation and  Renunciation groups did not get any funding from abroad. They  relied on robbery, theft, and contributions. The others  definitely have foreign contacts and receive funding from  numerous countries. I was present one day when a famous lawyer  handed over 250,000 Egyptian pounds that he had obtained from  alms taxes. The objective was to spend this money on the needs  of the organization. There was more than the amount we saw.  There are people abroad whose responsibility is to gather funds  and send them over. In one of the seminars he held in al-Salam  Mosque in New York, 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman gathered $200,000 in  one day. Part of these funds were transferred by various means  to his aides in Egypt.    [Musa] This leads us to wonder about the leaders of the  terrorist groups who have fled abroad and the extent of their  influence on their bases in Egypt.    ['Abd-al-Baqi] Over 70 percent of the incidents in Egypt  take  place upon instructions from abroad. As proof, we note what has  been reported about instructions issued by al-Zawahiri, Tal'at  Qasim, and Makkawi to assassinate the prime minister and the  ministers of interior and information.    [Musa] Why has al-Fayyum been transformed from a hotbed to a  large ambush?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] Religious activities in al-Fayyum decreased  and the security grip was tightened on the governorate and on  criminal hotbeds, thus weakening the presence of these currents  and toppling their leaders. However, fears still exist. There  are three fugitives in an Asian country who have contacts with  some of their aides. This requires much attention and awareness.    [Musa] Is there a similarity between the type of armed  operations taking place in Egypt and Algeria?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] There are similarities between the terrorist  operations in both countries. No one can deny this similarity  because groups from both countries receive their training in  Afghanistan and fight side by side inside the same camps.    [Musa] Where do the members of these gangs get their  weapons?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] You do not need any evidence to know this.  Most houses in Upper Egypt have weapons. As long as there is  money one can buy weapons anywhere. It is difficult to stop  groups from obtaining automatic weapons and machine guns.  However, the numbers that they have are not as large as some  people imagine. This is evident in the operations that are  being carried out and the weapons that are being used.    [Musa] Describe for us the secrets of the organizations,  such  as marriages and divorces?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] Many things that go against Islamic teachings  are practiced inside these groups. There are many women who get  married while still married to their first husbands. We once  heard that one of the members of the organization met a married  woman and had a relationship with her after he ordered her to  leave her infidel husband and marry him. They also had a  daughter together. However, the organization condemned him as an  infidel and forced her to divorce him and get married to another  member without any contractual agreement. After some time she  divorced him again. This is how marriages take place among the  members of these organizations. We heard reports about a rich  man in Port Said who would pay &pound;1,000 to each member who  joins the group and provide them with an apartment. This amir  married his sister off to a member of the organization without  having the couple sign a single sheet of paper. How can you  describe such a marriage? Does Islamic shari'ah sanction these  satanic abominations that are committed by those who claim to  have come to deliver the people from destruction?    [Musa] What about your own marriage?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] I got married to the sister of 'Abdallah  al-Samawi. When I asked for her hand in marriage, I offered him  only &pound;500. We were married within the week in a small bare  room. In two years we had two children, 'Abd-al-Rahman and  Hasna'. My wife traveled with me on my trips around the  governorates. When my differences with the organization  started, she left me and joined my colleagues. This was the  beginning of our troubles.    I asked Shawqi to discuss the issue of sanctioning robbery.  He told me that the issue was out of his hands, especially  because there were over 5,000 people working for the  organization and reaping the yield. He would not be able to  inform them all. Suddenly, one day, Shawqi al-Shaykh, Sayyid  Khalid, and Kamal 'Abd-al-Ilah came to see me. They were  carrying automatic weapons. They asked me to leave al-Fayyum  and never come back. After some time, clashes took place with  the police and Shawqi was killed.    [Musa] How did the assassination of Lieutenant Colonel Ahmad  'Ala' al-Barrawi, an officer in the state security in al-Fayyum,  take place?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] I was not in al-Fayyum at that time. The  crime upset me a great deal although I hated the officer and  everyone who was related to the regime. However, he helped me a  great deal with things unrelated to his work; this made me like  him. His assassination was a major turning point in my  relationship with the members of the organization and their  crimes.    [Musa] Why have you left your two children in this terrible  swamp and not looked after them?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] Deep in my heart, I will resort to any power,  including the devil himself, to rescue my children from this  swamp as soon as my financial and psychological situation is  sorted out. I have suffered much brainwashing for 17 long years.  These 17 years have had a great effect on me; I had to stop my  studies and am now unemployed with no identity. My whole future  has been wasted as a result of destructive concepts. I left  these groups and now haven't a single penny in my pocket,  despite the fact that I used to spend around &pound;10,000 to  15,000 a week on these groups. Nevertheless, I am still  convinced that these groups are thieves, robbers, and criminals.    ['Abd-al-Baqi] Recently the security agencies dealt major  blows to these groups. What is your view of this confrontation  and the role of the remaining organs?    [Musa] The current confrontation indicates that the security  agencies have modernized their methods. The terrorists  currently are reacting to police attacks--the opposite of the  situation in previous years. The police should continue to take  the initiative to deny these groups the opportunity to commit  crimes that confuse the concerned parties. I regret that the  other ministries have not played the necessary role in the  confrontation. Sermons inside mosques do not persuade. There  must be urgent alternatives and solutions. The government is  currently exerting efforts to partially solve the unemployment  problem. The police agencies are banning these groups to  isolate them from society. These measures will limit terrorist  activities. I call on the media organs to refrain from  publishing dialogues with terrorist leaders. The interview  published in a certain newspaper with terrorist Tal'at Fu'ad  Qasim is considered a code that raises the morale of the  terrorists inside Egypt.    ['Abd-al-Baqi] Do jails serve as sites to spawn terrorism  and  pass orders?    [Musa] True, jails in the past few years served as spawning  sites for terrorism. Any convict who was jailed on charges of  robbery would later leave prison an effective member of these  groups. Most current leaders of these groups met in jail and  organized their plans and groups inside jails. The jail  authorities now separate prisoners and limit mingling. Orders  are passed from prisoners to visiting women. Orders might be  passed through certain signals or words that represent a code  and passed to another party outside the prison to be carried out.    ['Abd-al-Baqi] Lists of figures who are targets for  assassination are usually discovered in terrorist dens. How do  you prepare these lists and who is in charge of choosing the  targets?    [Musa] In principle, every organization has its own rules  about the targets it selects. Customarily, the groups seek to  kill officials and police officers connected with the regime  although terrorists generally dislike reporters because they  believe the media are responsible for guiding and consolidating  the regime.    ['Abd-al-Baqi] But certain officers are constantly targeted?    [Musa] Yes, especially those who deal with prisoners in  political cases.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 25 TASS -- The Liberal-Democratic Party  faction today returned to the hall of the State Duma (lower  chamber of the Russian parliament) from which it demonstratively  walked out last Friday. However, its members refused to  register or to take part in the voting.    Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy told the Duma that no  measures against the "Podrobnosty" (Details) programme of the  Russian TV, on which the faction insisted, were taken so far.  "Therefore, the faction refuses to take part in the Duma's work  until it shows who wields the power in the country,"  Zhirinovskiy said.    Addressing Ivan Rybkin, who chaired the session,  Zhirinovskiy  stated: "Either you will show that there is a parliament in  Russia or you will see that a part of it is already gone, that  you have already lost it".    Rybkin stressed, in turn, that the parliament would like to  base its relations with the mass media on the existing laws.  Recalling about the resolution of the Duma council, addressed  to the leader of the Russian TV company Oleg Poptsov, he said  that the State Duma had not received any official answer to the  resolution. Rybkin said that the Duma legal department had  contacted the court for informational disputes under the Russian  president and its chairman Anatoliy Vengerov, who explained that  the collision, caused by journalist Nikolay Svanidze's  pronouncements, was within the competence of the court. Rybkin  moved to settle it by legal means. He urged the  Liberal-Democratic faction to take part in the work of the  chamber even though the conflict with the mass media was not  settled yet.</p>

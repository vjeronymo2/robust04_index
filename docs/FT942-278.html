			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Drugs company chief quits over share scandal Nippon Shoji, a Japanese drug wholesaler and distributor whose employees are being investigated for alleged insider trading, said yesterday its president will step down to take responsibility for the scandal. Company employees face charges that they used confidential information about the deaths of patients using its shingles drug. The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, the securities watchdog, is conducting an investigation. Some 175 workers and family members are believed to have sold Nippon Shoji shares before the health and welfare ministry publicly disclosed last October the fatal side effects of Sorivudine, the company's treatment, launched in September last year. Mr Takakazu Hattori will resign to become the company's consultant, while Mr Masami Shimizu, vice president, will take his place. The move follows the company's dismissal of four former executives on Monday over allegations of illicit stock trading.</p>

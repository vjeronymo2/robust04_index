The main reason for this, in the view of the Social  Democrats, is the considerable deterioration in the people's  standard of living, the Russian-speaking citizens' increasing  loss of confidence that they will be given social protection,  and their worry for their children's future.    Given this, the SDP has called upon the presidents of Russia  and Kyrgyzstan to ensure that industrial enterprises of the two  countries that have mutual economic ties are granted most  favored status, in order to avoid bankruptcy and mass unrest  among the people; to draw up and adopt a law on immigration  based upon international norms and rights; and to guarantee that  Russian-speaking citizens in Kyrgyzstan may receive education in  the Russian language; and finally to conclude an  inter-governmental agreement on recognizing dual citizenship in  Russia and Kyrgyzstan.</p>

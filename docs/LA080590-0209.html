			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEAU GENIUS MOUNTS LATE SURGE TO WIN LACKLUSTER CHALLENGE CUP  </P> <P> Beau Genius and Triteamtri ran virtually as a pair for most of the 1 1/4 miles  before favored Beau Genius won the Arlington Challenge Cup by one length  Saturday.  </P> <P> The glamour of the race was lost because of career-ending injuries to Sunday  Silence, the 1989 Horse of the Year, and his Triple Crown rival, Easy Goer.  </P> <P> The idea behind the inaugural Challenge Cup was to renew the rivalry between  Sunday Silence and Easy Goer, but both suffered injuries while preparing for  the race.  </P> <P> With Sunday Silence and Easy Goer out, Criminal Type, who beat both of them  this year, was held out in favor of the Whitney, which he won Saturday at  Saratoga.  </P> <P> Beau Genius was timed in 2:02 1/5 and paid $4.80, $3.80 and $2.80. Triteamtri  paid $14.20 and $5.40 and Western Playboy returned $2.80.  </P> <P> Also at Arlington, Southland-based Real Cash beat five other 3-year-olds in the  American Derby. Real Cash, ridden by Pat Valenzuela, covered the 1 1/4 miles on  a good track in 2:02 in beating Home At Last by one length.  </P> <P> Real Cash, who took the lead from pace-setting Adjudicating entering the  homestretch, returned $11.40, $5.60 and $3.20. Home At Last paid $4 and $2.60  and Adjudicating returned $2.40.  </P></p>

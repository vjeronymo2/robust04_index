			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] A senior Chinese official yesterday expressed  optimism about the chances of reaching agreement on the  financing of the new airport and its rail link.    Deputy Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office Chen Ziying was replying to reporters who had  suggested the Government's funding request from legislators for  $820 million for the Chek Lap Kok airport railway might damage  the talks.    "Things are moving on. Why are you so pessimistic?" he said.    Pro-China legislator Tam Yiu-chung said he believed the  Airport Committee meeting on Friday had made some progress.    He did not think the funding request would hamper future  talks.    "The airport projects have started. It is no longer a matter  of whether to build it or not.    "The most important thing is the size of borrowings should  not go beyond the $5 billion ceiling as laid down in the  Memorandum of Understanding on the airport projects," he said.</p>

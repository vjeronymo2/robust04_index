			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The U.S. State Department conveyed through Robert  Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on the  Cyprus issue, that the U.S. Government would not favor Russia's  active involvement in the Cyprus issue.    According to information from diplomatic circles in  Washington, the United States supports Russia's coordination  role through the United Nations. This development came to light  following Lamb's recent visit to Moscow.    The State Department coordinator and Assistant Secretary of  State Steven Oxman will visit Athens and Ankara next week in an  effort to secure assurances that the two governments will fully  support the efforts of the UN envoys for progress in the  proximity talks.    Their visit to Ankara is particularly important because it  will aim at strengthening Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller  and her party in light of the election on 27 March.    It is well known that the U.S. Government is concerned about  the possibility of the Turkish prime minister's influence  weakening, which would seriously affect Cyprus and Greek-Turkish  relations.

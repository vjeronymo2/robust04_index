			<p>BFN     [Text] Georgia's Constitutional Commission worked out the  draft of political and territorial system for the country, a  member of the Commission told Interfax. The draft provides for  dividing Georgia into 12 territories, Abkhazia and Ajaria among  them, though with a special political status. This provision  does not relate to South Ossetia.    In the meantime, as Interfax learned from reliable sources,  the Georgian leadership is planning to hold talks with the  present South Ossetian administration concerning the political  status of that territory. On instructions from Eduard  Shevardnadze a special group was formed to conduct these talks.  The talks are to take place in mid May.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: BELL;  </P> <P> POLICE CHIEF TO LEAVE FOR SIMILAR JOB IN PLACENTIA  </P> <P> Police Chief Manuel Ortega is leaving Bell to become police chief in Placentia.  </P> <P> Ortega, a policeman for 21 years in Orange County until he went to Bell in  1988, will replace former Chief Harold Fischer, who retired in June.  </P> <P> Ortega will start his new job Oct. 15.  </P> <P> Sgt. Bill Talbott, who has been with the Bell Police Department for 17 years,  said Ortega brought stability to the department as the city struggled with  financial problems. "He kind of kept us on an even keel," Talbott said.  </P> <P> Ortega helped start such programs in Bell as Operation Off the Wall, a graffiti  cleanup program that attracted 950 volunteers in March, and another program  that uses police reserves to patrol city parks on weekends.  </P> <P> City Manager John Bramble credited Ortega with expanding the city's drug  enforcement investigation team. He also improved the department's image by  encouraging officers to become active in professional organizations and by  establishing more standard training programs, Bramble said. "My goal was that  Manny let the outside world know that we had a professional police department  and that it was full of top, qualified people," Bramble said. "From that  perspective, he accomplished that goal."  </P></p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Aluminium hits fresh highs - Market Report ALUMINIUM prices finished close to 19-month highs at the London Metal Exchange. Dealers said the market took advantage of a constructive technical picture and recent strength in copper to break through resistance at Dollars 1,330 a tonne for three months delivery. COPPER initially extended this week's upward move and the three months price traded up to an 8 1/2 -month high of Dollars 1,981 a tonne before running into heavy overhead sales. By the close it was showing a loss of Dollars 5 on the day at Dollars 1,962. London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures closed with strong gains after opening at the highest levels since the dollar contract started three years ago. The May position opened Dollars 19 higher at Dollars 1,330 and quickly put on another Dollars 10 as the market sucked in a further surge of investment fund and trade buying. Some traders said positive chart patterns now heralded further gains, initially targeting Dollars 1,400 a tonne and some even talking of Dollars 1,500. COCOA had a quiet day, ending mostly lower despite a firm start. Compiled from Reuter</p>

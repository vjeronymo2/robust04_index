			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Following the publication of the statement by the  Majles public relations office which was about the radio  broadcast of the response by the Voice and Vision organization,  protesting the report by the Majles Inquiry and Investigation  Group, the Voice and Vision organization's public relations  office sent a reply, which appears below:    The Voice and Vision organization of the Islamic Republic of  Iran thanks the Majles public relations office for opening the  discussion on the rights and prerogatives of government bodies  and organizations. This made some important points known to the  respected law and policy makers in the three powers, as well as  to the ever-present-on-the-scene and martyr-nurturing people of  Islamic Iran.    1. While the Voice and Vision organization believes in  Article 76 of the Constitution, which has given the  responsibility for research and investigation to the respected  Majles, it believes that this article guarantees the  continuation of the government and the perpetuation of Islamic  values. However, the aforementioned organization feels obligated  to answer the affronts to honor, which were in a report from the  Majles Inquiry and Investigation Group in the form of very ugly  and inappropriate accusations against the organization's  hard-working and hezbollah management and its concerned, active,  and committed workers.    2. Article 171 of the Constitution gives people who have  been  subjected to accusations the right to defend themselves and it  makes it obligatory to restore their spiritual and material  honor and dignity.    In this regard it is necessary to look at Article 39 of the  Constitution.    Article 39: "Affronts to the honor and dignity of someone  who  has been arrested, detained, imprisoned, or exiled by legal  order in any form are forbidden and subject to punishment."    The aforementioned law forbids affronts to the honor of  criminals and exiles and considers this subject to punishment.  It is clear that affronting the collective and individual honor  of those running a government body in any form or pretext is a  violation of the Constitution and the criteria of religious law.    3. The Voice and Vision organization, according to Article 6  of the Law on General Policies and Principles of the Voice and  Vision organization's Programming enacted on Thursday 17 Tir  1361 [8 July 1982] by the respected Majles, is required to  prevent and avoid affronting the honor of individuals. We quote  the text of Article 6:    Article 6: "Respect the human dignity of individuals and  refrain from affronting their honor, in accordance with Islamic  regulations."    Shouldn't the Voice and Vision organization do its lawful  duty in respecting the human dignity of individuals? Moreover,  to preserve Islamic, social and security values, the  organization is required to act in accordance with Article 19 of  the policies law. Article 19 clearly specifies the items whose  publication the organization must prevent, and while mentioning  their study, we will quote the two relevant paragraphs:    Paragraph B, Article 19: "Accusing the nation's official  bodies and organizations and groups, societies and parties whose  activities are lawful according to the Political Parties Law."    The aforementioned law includes the Voice and Vision  organization, which is one of the government's most sensitive  organizations and has the confidence and trust of the leader and  the people. Therefore, the Voice and Vision organization is  legally required to prevent the broadcast of accusations and  incorrect material from the Inquiry and Investigation Commission  during the direct broadcast over the Voice and Vision of the  Islamic Republic.    Likewise, in view of Paragraph H, Article 19, due to the  fact  that the names of the leaders of a counterrevolutionary  minigroup were given in the commission's report and caused the  false idea to be created for some people that the aforementioned  opponents of the government might acquire power, the  organization is required by law to stop the direct broadcast and  to broadcast the report at an appropriate time for public  information after deleting the accusations, affronts to honor,  and propaganda for minigroups.    Unfortunately, however, since the inquiry and investigation  report was broadcast directly, the possibility was taken away  from us for monitoring it, observing the law and carrying out  our responsibilities.    4. Now that the report from the Inquiry and Investigation  Group has been broadcast verbatim with all the inappropriate  accusations and affronts to the honor of individuals, outside  the lawful responsibility of the Voice and Vision organization,  it appears that one must turn to the Constitution and read all  of Article 69, which is the result of long discussions by  theologians and legal specialists, was approved by the Assembly  of Experts and was given final approval by His Holiness the  Imam, and apply it. Here it is necessary to study the provisions  of the Constitution to clarify the responsibilities of the Voice  and Vision organization, and we must study the limits and  boundaries in broadcasting the proceedings of the respected  Majles.    In Article 69 of the Constitution, we read: "Majles  proceedings must be public and a complete report of them must be  published via official radio and newspapers for public  information...."    First: In Article 69 of the Constitution mention is made  only  of the proceedings of the respected Majles deputies and there is  no mention of the pre-agenda speeches and the special reports  such as the inquiry and investigation report. These kinds of  events are beyond the absolute and lawful meaning of the term  "proceedings," and the radio is not legally required to  broadcast these items.    Second: There is no kind of direct or indirect mention of  the  live and direct broadcast of sessions or even the proceedings of  the respected Majles.    Third: The law clearly states that a "report" of the  proceedings must be broadcast by radio for public information,  not the proceedings themselves. If the law had intended the  broadcast of the actual proceedings and sessions it would not  have used the term "report" and it would have written instead,  for example: The "verbatim proceedings" must be broadcast  without alteration for public information.    The term "report" applies in its meaning and lawful intent  to  the presence of a third person between the originator of the  message and the intended receiver of the message.    Fourth: The spirit and intent of the Constitution will be  better understood when we read Article 69 along with Articles 40  and 22 as well as with paragraphs B, D, and H of Article 19 of  the Law on the General Policies and Principles of the Voice and  Vision organization's Programming approved by the Majles, and  when we study all the laws as a whole. In this way it is  understood that the Constitution makes no kind of reference or  even allusion to the direct broadcast of the sessions of the  respected Majles, and that its emphasis and explanations are  about reporting on them.    Therefore, while we thank again the Majles public relations  office for opening the discussion on limitations and boundaries,  the Voice and Vision organization intends to submit a request  for a conceptual study of Article 69 to the competent  authorities so that the Constitution can be implemented in this  regard and anything resembling heresy will be eliminated.  Because of its belief and complete faith in the Constitution and  its experience in these 12 years witnessing events, problems and  critical dangers in direct broadcasts, and in view of the  message from His Holiness the Imam (may his grave be  sanctified), as the second [as published] term of the Majles  begins, the management of the Voice and Vision organization  intends to pursue seriously the important matter of a conceptual  study of Article 69 in order to observe Islamic ethics, avoid  insults and also to follow recent guidance in this regard from  the exalted leader. Again, it expresses its thanks to the  respected Majles public relations office.    5. In its statement the Majles public relations office has  accused the Voice and Vision organization of heresy. This new  point must also be studied carefully.    First: Based on Article 69 of the Constitution and the legal  explanations, which have been presented concerning it, it is  this Inquiry and Investigation Group, which has committed heresy  and has made the illegal matter of directly broadcasting its  report lawful and assumed it to be within the domain of its  prerogatives, thereby making an illicit innovation.    Second: Reporting on research and investigation is itself  another heresy that could be dangerous for the nation's future  and could disrupt national unity and harmony.    In the Constitution the matter of research and investigation  is considered lawful, and affronting honor, making accusations  and publishing lies is prohibited and subject to penalties.  Therefore, employing illegal material such as accusations,  slander, and insults in the name of lawful research and  investigation is itself a new heresy that the aforementioned  group has committed, and not the Voice and Vision organization.    Third: Under the law of the Islamic Republic of Iran and  other regulations approved by the respected Majles, any person  has the right to defend himself against accusations in the same  media. How is it that the Voice and Vision organization must  broadcast the answers submitted by all the offices to the  criticism and protests broadcast by the people, but it does not  have the right to answer the incorrect statements and unworthy  accusations concerning its own performance and its workers? If  it answers, is this heresy and making personal use of public  facilities? Based on this, it appears that the accusations in  the inquiry and investigation report, in view of Articles 39 and  40 of the Constitution, are heresy. The answer from the Voice  and Vision organization on the one hand is the lawful right of  every person and legal entity as an answer to insults and  accusations against itself, and on the other hand the  organization has acted on its lawful duty to fight heresy and  the groundwork for heresy.    6. The Law on General Policies and Principles of the Voice  and Vision organization's programming requires the organization  to fight heresy. Article 26 of the policy law reads as follows:    Article 26: Informing public opinion concerning ideological  heresy and deviation as mentioned in the Tradition "if deviation  arises..." [unattributed Arabic quote]    After the reading of the inquiry and investigation report,  the Voice and Vision organization was faced with two important  heresies.    The first heresy was the heresy of making accusations and  insults in the sacred name of the lawful duty of inquiry and  investigation. The second heresy, which is the largest and most  painful heresy possible, is the Inquiry and Investigation Group  open and direct opposition to the written views, emphatic  statements and guidance from His Holiness the Imam (may his  grave be sanctified), and this is intolerable for the managers  of the organization. Silence was seen to be the equivalent of  treason.    The respected members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group  were aware of all the Imam's theological guidance and views, and  today after the instances of their opposition to His Holiness  the Imam's views are made clear, they cannot exonerate  themselves on the pretext that they were not aware of them. At  the first meeting between the respected members of the group and  the chief of the organization, the chief of the Voice and Vision  organization explained His Holiness the Imam's theological views  and opinions to them. Moreover, at that same meeting the chief  of the organization explained: "According to Article 107 of the  Constitution, in addition to the fact that His Holiness the Imam  is the owner of the revolution and the founder of the Islamic  Republic of Iran, he is recognized and accepted as source of  emulation and leader by a decisive majority of the population.  Therefore in all matters of religious law such as the veil,  music, makeup, and the matter at hand, the Voice and Vision  organization has acted in accordance with his theological views.  If the Inquiry and Investigation Group wants to study the  performance of the organization, it must study and evaluate  based on His Holiness the Imam's criteria and standards and not  those of some other authority. Likewise, even if there is a  member of the Inquiry and Investigation Group who has written a  treatise or a fatwa, he cannot use his own view and fatwa."    In order to be sure that the group would be able to evaluate  based on the views and fatwas of the Imam, the organization sent  the theological views and guidance from his excellency in a  letter to the chief of the Inquiry and Investigation Group.  Therefore if the members of the group declare today that they  were not aware of His Holiness the Imam's theological views,  criteria, and standards, it is not acceptable or forgivable.    7. Unfortunately under these conditions the Voice and Vision  organization cannot defend His Holiness the Imam's (may his  grave be sanctified) theological views and criteria any more  than this, because it is possible that the Voice and Vision  organization will be accused of defending its own performance  and then the aforementioned views and criteria may be  questioned. However, it does not appear that the deputies and  officials who follow the Imam will remain silent in the fact of  such rudeness. Therefore the Voice and Vision organization is  lawfully and religiously required to inform the public about the  aforementioned heresy, which is definitely considered a  deviation from theological fundamentals, and it was not the  first nor will it be the last instance.    8. In addition to the aforementioned legal proofs, the  broadcast of the answer from the Voice and Vision organization  to the inquiry and investigation report was based on a measure  enacted 8/3/1363 [25 October 1984] by the Voice and Vision  organization Supervisory Council, and this measure, because of  the presence of representatives of the three branches of law,  has the validity of law. It is appropriate to ask the Majles  public relations office, is applying the law heresy? Or is the  law for the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Commission  different than the law for the Voice and Vision organization? It  would also have been appropriate if the statement from the  Majles public relations office had been written with more study,  care, and examination of the record, because the Voice and  Vision organization has implemented the measure enacted on  8/3/1363 by the Supervisory Council during the second, third,  and fourth terms of the Majles.    Moreover, supposing a law is not implemented for 20 years.  Does it cease to be a law in the eyes of the respected Majles  public relations office, and is it illegal to implement it?    In this connection we note that according to Paragraph B,  Article 8 of the Voice and Vision organization administration  law, which is devoted to the duties of the executive director,  the executive director is required to observe the measures  enacted by the Supervisory Council.    9. Since the undocumented and unproven accusations from the  Inquiry and Investigation Commission were directed at  individuals and lawful entities in the organization and in  several cases at all the organization's workers, many complaints  have been sent to the offices of the organization's managers and  its legal unit, and the organization's management cannot prevent  them from being sent to the legal authorities.    In conclusion, we ask the respected judiciary, which has  properly announced that it will investigate the complaints from  the respected deputies, will it also investigate the complaints  from the workers and managers of the Voice and Vision  organization who were insulted, accused, and had their honor  affronted, or not? Will it investigate the violation of the  prerogatives of Article 39 of the Constitution, which caused all  this heresy and these unworthy accusations, insults and slander  without proof or documentation, or not?</p>

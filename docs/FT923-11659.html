			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Accountancy Column: Testing time for professional relationships SPARE A thought on Monday for two of the super-stars of the UK accountancy profession, Mr Michael Jordan of Cork Gully, and Mr Richard Stone, corporate finance head at Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Monday is the day that Mr Stone and Mr Jordan appear before the professional-conduct panel of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. They will respond to claims that they breached the institute's ethical guidelines when they agreed to become the administrators of Polly Peck International, the fruit, leisure, and electronics group in October 1990 because during the previous three years there had been a continuing professional relationship between Coopers and Mr Asil Nadir, the group's chairman and chief executive. The disciplinary committee's by-laws mean that the hearing will take place behind closed doors, which has already drawn a good deal of unfavourable comment in some quarters. Coopers is confident, on the advice of leading counsel, that they have not broken the guidelines. The number of large accountancy firms is dwindling and administrations continue to proliferate. Almost every firm has a relationship with most big companies. For instance, Touche Ross, the accountancy firm of the third Polly Peck administrator, Mr Christopher Morris, audited Sansui, the Japanese audio and consumer electronics subsidiary that Polly Peck acquired in the year before its collapse. To be fair this is a much more remote link than Coopers' role as advisers to Mr Nadir, which went back over a decade. So there must be many accountants who are hoping that the hearing will make it clearer just how the ethical guidelines are to be interpreted. Beyond that, there is probably not a great deal that can be said at this stage about the hearing itself. But it is perhaps a suitable moment to cast an eye over the 21-month history of the Polly Peck administration over which Mr Jordan and Mr Stone have presided, along with Mr Morris. At the time of the group's collapse in October 1990, Polly Peck was by far the UK's largest and most daunting administration. Since then several of its dramatis personae among the administrators have resurfaced first in the BCCI liquidation and then in the Maxwell administration, but the scale of the challenge for Mr Jordan and Mr Stone remains undeniable. Polly Peck in October 1990 seemed to be a case of a debt-ridden central operation in London with debt-free subsidiaries across the world that were either cash rich or which, like Sansui, needed some cash to turn them around but seemed to have reasonably good medium term prospects. A few months earlier the group had been worth Pounds 2bn on the market, and only a week or two before it went into administration its bankers were being told that if there were to be a liquidation, there should be around Pounds 300m left over for the creditors. Not surprisingly under these circumstances, and entirely creditably, Mr Jordan and Mr Stone decided that the best course would be to try and straighten out the group's affairs with a view to refloating it eventually on the stock exchange. They sold off a few of the group's fringe assets from Joseph Le Shark, the small textile company, to the sumptious antiques collection at 42 Berkeley Square, the Polly Peck group headquarters, and persuaded the bankers (some of whom seem to have taken a relatively rosy view of the group's affairs even after it had collapsed) to inject a little more money - and off they went on a world tour. Even Henry Kissinger might have blanched at the journeys that lay ahead of the Polly Peck administrators as they shuttled across the globe struggling to tie up a multitude of corporate loose ends - from Curacao to Taiwan and Hong Kong, and from the US to Nicosia and Istanbul. Just in case any reader should feel a twinge of envy at all this jet-setting, it is only fair to report that these whistle-stop journeys for a few hours in foreign capitals cannot have been much fun. On the other hand they were inevitably very expensive. By most standards the global shuttling was also not very productive, either for the businesses concerned or for the creditors. One grumble sometimes heard from the creditors is that the administrators did not take a very commercial approach to the hydra's head of decisions confronting them or do what corporate financiers might have done. Sansui plunged into heavy losses last year, mainly because of write-offs of good will, and was sold off to a Hong Kong entrepreneur for a dollar. Hopes of floating PPI Del Monte on the New York stock exchange were dangled before the creditors' committee last autumn, only to be withdrawn this spring when the price of bananas collapsed on the world market, thus depriving the administration of a deal that might have netted upwards of Pounds 400m for the creditors. The other businesses in the group, which reported turnover over Pounds 1.16bn in 1989, have turned out to amount to relatively little in terms of saleable assets. Vestel, the Turkish consumer electronics operation, has survived but there has been a dramatic fall in its profits and market share and it has been shedding subsidiaries to raise cash. There seems to be no chance of Vestel remitting substantial amounts to the rest of the group or of selling it off and raising money for the administration. Buyers seem to have been found for PPI's shipping line and perhaps also for the Antalya Sheraton Hotel. But there seems to be little chance of raising much from the fruit businesses. An endless series of trips by the administrators to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus has not unlocked either the records of the Polly Peck companies on the island or any cash balances in accounts there, or even secured control of the group's hotels there for the administration. The most recent disappointment came when an attempt by the administration to take over Jasmine Court Hotel ended with a scrimmage and a fresh case for the Turkish Cypriot courts. At the peak of the administration, Coopers had around 30 people working full time on Polly Peck and there are still between 10 and 15 employed. The services of a top administrator cost around Pounds 200 an hour, those of a junior accountant between Pounds 100 and Pounds 150. Not surprisingly, since October 1990 the costs of the administration (Pounds 13.1m) have dwarfed Polly Peck's salary bill (Pounds 5.02m). Lawyers' fees have made up a further Pounds 7.5m. They presumably include the Pounds 50,000 paid to Mr Mentes Aziz, the Nadir family lawyer, for his advisory services. Mr Aziz subsequently ended up on the receiving end of a Mareva injunction from the administrators who are now trying to reclaim Pounds 5.9m from him. All in all, in 18 months Polly Peck had total income of Pounds 51.5m, a good chunk of it garnered from fire-sales of antiques, motor vehicles, and a yacht, and expenditure of Pounds 48.9m. Its far-flung cash rich subsidiaries ended up taking Pounds 11.44m for repayment of inter-company debt and not remitting profits to the parent company in London. A mere Pounds 2.5m was left over for creditors at the end of April this year and there is now talk of a payment of 3p in the pound or 11p on the most optimistic forecast. One suspects that whatever is said behind those closed doors at the institute on Monday could be decorous and restrained compared to what is in store at the next meeting of Polly Peck's creditors.</p>

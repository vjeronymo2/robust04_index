In order to get even a little more nuclear  power-related information (data) out to larger numbers of  people, the Atomic Power Technology Agency, at the behest of the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) in September  1990 commenced operation of the Atomic Power Information Service  Network (nicknamed Atom Net) to provide information to people  via personal computer-based communications systems. During the  roughly three years since that time, an average of 40 users have  accessed this system daily, significantly exceeding our  pre-operation user estimates.    In the hopes of getting even more people to use ``Atom Net''  services, I would like to take this opportunity to explain how  to use this service and to give an overview of the kinds of data  stored in the system.  <H5>  1. How To Use Atom Net </H5>   Anybody with a personal computer (or dedicated word  processor) equipped with communications software and a modem can  utilize Atom Net services. The communication software parameters  are the same as those for ordinary PC communications packages.  The line settings are as follows:    Baud rates: 1200/2400 bps    Kanji code: Shift JIS Kanji    No. of data bits: 8 bits    No. of stop bits: 1 bit    Parity: None    Flow control: Xon/Xoff    Communication protocol: No protocol (However, XMODEM is used  for graphics.)    To access the system, specify auto-dial on your  communications software and dial Atom Net's modem number  (03-5470-5511). Once you have connected with the system, the  user ID input screen will be displayed. I have given the Tokyo  modem number here, but people in outlying regions wishing to use  Atom Net services may dial whichever of the 140 access points  nationwide is closest to their locations. Access point modem  numbers are listed in the Atom Net ``User's Guide,'' or can be  obtained by calling the ``Atomic Power Telephone Question Box''  discussed below.    Atom Net information provision services are available  24-hours-a-day, which means you can avail yourself of these  services whenever you like.    When the user ID input screen appears, you will be prompted  to ``Please enter 000.'' At this point, enter ``000'' and press  RETURN. This will display the prompt ``Please enter return  key,'' at which time you should press RETURN once again to  display the MAIN MENU. This makes it possible for anyone to use  Atom Net services without having to worry about user IDs or  registered passwords. And the service is free (you will still be  required to pay the telephone charges incurred during use,  however).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-06A>      Figure 1. User ID Input Screen </FIG>     For those people with questions concerning the contents of  the Atom Net database system, you can call the Atomic Power  Technology Agency's ``Atomic Power Telephone Question Box'' at  Tel: 0120-119433 and get answers to all your questions and  inquiries.    The data available via Atom Net consists of bibliographic  data as well as graphics such as graphs and the like, the latter  of which can be utilized provided your communications software  is equipped with XMODEM protocol capabilities and you have the  graphics software ``Hanako,'' or any software capable of reading  ``Hanako Ver 1.0'' data.  <H5>  2. Atom Net Special Features </H5>   We were afraid that if we made the nuclear power information  stored in Atom Net available in text form alone, it would just  be like other databases and would not hold any particular appeal  for users. We therefore decided to equip Atom Net with some  special features.    The first of these features is the fact that it provides  both  textual and image data, the latter consisting of graphs and  drawings. There is a lot of nuclear power-related information  that is difficult to grasp by reading textual data alone, much  of which is easier to understand if it is accompanied by visual  data such as graphs and drawings. Based on this fact, we  constructed the Atom Net so that users with graphics software  can call up image data whenever they need it.    The second special feature built into Atom Net is its ``News  Flash'' capabilities concerning trouble that occurs at nuclear  power plants. Whenever trouble breaks out at a nuclear power  plant, the press release put together by MITI is input into the  system as soon as MITI releases that news to the media, and can  be accessed that same day. Therefore, Atom Net trouble reports  are available at the same time as, and in some cases, sooner  than they reach the newsstands.  <H5>  3. Contents </H5>   The data contained in Atom Net is compiled under seven main  menus, for a total of 960 data elements (as of the last day of  June, 1993). When Atom Net first commenced operation, it started  out with just 237 data elements, but today, after being in  operation for three years, that figure has quadrupled.    In general, data is maintained and updated every Friday  afternoon, but announcements of trouble reports from nuclear  power plants are input the day they are published.       Table 1.

However, since commencing  operations, there have been days when Atom Net has been accessed  by over 300 users, and it is not unusual to see the really  dedicated users accessing the system in the middle of the night.  The large numbers of people using Atom Net are indicative of the  degree of interest in energy-related issues on the part of  ordinary citizens, and the ongoing boom in personal computer  usage.    We will strive to update and provide increasingly more  complete data, and to make it even easier to use Atom Net in  future.

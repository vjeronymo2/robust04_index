Sharma: "Biodiversity Convention Comes </F> Into Force"]    [Text] London, December 30--The international convention on  biological diversity came into force yesterday amid fears that  the GATT agreement would make it difficult to address some of  the issues raised by the convention. It is a pious hope that  provisions of intellectual property rights on genetic resources  will not run counter to the wider objectives of the convention.    The occasion was used by `Friends of the Earth' and the  Labour Party to attack the British government for its failure to  fulfil its own obligations to preserve endangered species and  habitats.    `Friends of the Earth' said the British government was  allowing imports of tropical timber that would never be  replaced. A Labour spokesman said while the government lectured  the Third World nations about preserving rain-forests, it was  not protecting natural habitats in Britain. Hedgerows were being  destroyed and these needed legal protection.    `Friends of the Earth' said the GATT agreement would make  things worse in the area of biodiversity. Aid workers,  development economists and environmentalists here have been very  critical of the GATT agreement's impact on genetic resources and  on small farmers, the latter constituting 80 percent of the  total in developing countries.    In these countries, farmers play an important role in  conserving local plant genetic resources and restrictions on  free access to these will reduce global biological diversity.  Farmers are informal plant breeders and patents on plants are  likely to restrict access to a common pool of plant genetic  resources, essential to plant breeding.    Western experts, barring those employed by biotechnology and  seed companies, take a cautious view of the consequences of the  extension of intellectual property protection to plant genetic  resources for farmers as producers and conservers of  biodiversity. They have been pointing out the irony of  developing countries being confronted with a system which  maintains open access over their genetic resources while  establishing private property rights for improved products based  on those resources.    They wonder whether developing countries could use the  patent  system to protect their "unimproved" genetic resources and use  them as a tool in biodiversity conservation.    In the furious debate over GATT in India, perhaps no one  suggested that the government could at least do what the state  of Queensland in Australia has done. It has passed its own  legislation giving it intellectual property rights over genetic  information embodied in the animals and plants found in the  state. India and other developing countries could use the  argument that if genes, gene constructs and genetic  characteristics can be patented in industrialised countries,  developing countries could also patent their own genetic  resources.    Of course, there are potential problems, claiming patent  rights over genes or genetic characteristics which occur in the  wild or in farmers' varieties would give rise to the problem of  ownership and if that was vested in the sovereign state,  competing claims might be made by other states.    The wild plant varieties as well as `landraces' and other  farmers' varieties also will not meet the criteria that  varieties must be distinct, uniform and stable for protection  under plant breeders' rights. But then the system could be  adapted. And despite such problems, it is not a developing  country but the state of Queensland that has taken as  initiative.[Sentence as printed]    A study by the Overseas Development Institute points out  that  pressures towards the wider granting of intellectual property  rights over genetic material originate within industrialised  countries and the benefits will accrue primarily to companies  located there. The erosion of biodiversity in developing  countries will continue as commercial agriculture expands into  these areas. The intellectual property rights will hinder the  protection of agricultural biodiversity, if they jeopardise  co-operation between the formal and informal sectors.    Any restrictions on access to and exchange of genetic plant  material by farmers and public sector plant breeders will have a  negative impact in areas where a high proportion of planting  material is not purchased. However, a lot would depend on the  extent to which ways to protect farmers' informal exchange  mechanism and re-use of saved seed can be implemented.    Agriculture in developing countries could suffer if free  access to plant genetic resources ends, not least because the  types of plant produced by the private commercial sector are  unlikely to meet the diverse needs of peasant farmers.    Diversity is deemed important for food security at global  and  local levels and agriculture in practically all countries is  heavily dependent on a supply of plant genetic resources from  other parts of the world. The agricultural systems of the  industrialised world are particularly dependent on plant genetic  resources from tropical and subtropical regions of developing  countries having most of the centres of diversity from which  these resources originated.</p>

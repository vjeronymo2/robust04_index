In a statement released here the Iranian Embassy also  condemned any act of terrorism. The statement was a response to  allegations recently raised by French papers that Iran had been  involved in Bakhtiar's assassination. It underlined the need  for the French judicial system to maintain its independence and  keep aloof from any hue and cry while investigating the case.    The AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE in a news dispatch on Monday  accused  Iran of providing logistical assistance in the assassination of  Bakhtiar. The Iranian Embassy advised that no prejudgement  should be made on the issue.</p>

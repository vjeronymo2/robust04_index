			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPER RELENTS, PICKS BLACK TO HEAD MALL  </P> <P> In response to mounting criticism by local civil rights groups, developer  Alexander Haagen has named Leo Ray, a black man, to manage the newly  refurbished Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, the nation's first enclosed mall  serving a predominantly black area.  </P> <P> Civil rights leaders criticized Haagen for abruptly firing the mall's previous  manager, Louis George, also black, and replacing him with a management team  that included Janice Hahn Baucum, daughter of County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, a  longtime friend of the developer. Baucum is white.  </P> <P> To end the controversy, Haagen broke up the management team, which included  Baucum and Ray. He promoted Ray, a 37-year-old architect who has worked with  the developer since 1986, to the position of general manager of the  $100-million mall. Haagen transferred Baucum to a management marketing position  at the developer's corporate headquarters in Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Showcase Mall  </P> <P> Haagen said he decided to promote Ray and transfer Baucum to silence criticism  by civil rights leaders who accused the developer of not keeping his promise to  make the mall a showcase for black opportunity.  </P> <P> "I want to get back to the business of running a first-class regional shopping  center," he said. "I want it to prosper and to succeed for the retailers and  the community."  </P> <P> John Mack, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the Urban League, praised  the developer's decision to promote Ray. "I don't know what caused Mr. Haagen's  turnaround, but it is a big step in the right direction," Mack said.  </P></p>

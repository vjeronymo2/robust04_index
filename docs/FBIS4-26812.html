			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin said here today that the Russian-EU partnership  agreement is of "historic importance" and represents the first  step of Russia's economic comeback to Europe.    Speaking after signing the pact at the European Union  summit,  Yeltsin said the agreement marks the end of ideological and  economic conflicts that prevailed during the Cold War era.    "We all felt the symptoms of an economic Cold War, but this  threat is being abolished with this agreement," said Yeltsin.  "Today, Russia becomes a significant partner of the Europeans,  and we will do everything possible to support European  integration."    He added that Moscow would back efforts aimed at enlarging  the 12-nation bloc, which will extend formal membership to four  countries later today.</p>

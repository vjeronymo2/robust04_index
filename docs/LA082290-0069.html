			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EGYPT SAID TO SEEK ISRAELI OUTLET FOR REFUGEES  </P> <P> Despite Egypt's denials, Israeli Foreign Ministry sources said Tuesday that  Egypt has inquired about the possibility of moving Egyptian refugees from Iraq  through the Israeli port of Eilat.  </P> <P> About 20,000 Egyptians fleeing Iraq and occupied Kuwait are waiting in the  Jordanian port of Aqaba for transportation home.  </P> <P> The Egyptian ambassador in Jerusalem, Mohammed Bassiouny, reportedly asked  Foreign Minister David Levy on Monday about allowing them to pass through  nearby Eilat en route to Taba in Egypt.  </P> <P> Levy agreed in principle, the Foreign Ministry sources said, and Bassiouny was  to consult with his government on details.  </P> <P> The sources said Levy told Bassiouny: "It is natural that Israel lend its  assistance to those from a friendly state who flee to their homeland fearing  tyranny."  </P> <P> Egyptian officials issued a denial Tuesday in Cairo after the exchange was  leaked to the press here, resulting in what was described as embarrassment at  the premature disclosure.  </P> <P> In the past, Egyptian migrant workers in Iraq and Kuwait have traveled through  Jordan to Aqaba and then by ferry to Egypt, either to the Sinai port of Nuweiba  or to Suez City.  </P> <P> If they are permitted to pass through Eilat, which is only a mile or two from  Aqaba, it would ease considerably the jam of refugees at Aqaba.  </P> <P> About 800,000 Egyptians have been working in Iraq, their usual numbers  increased by the recent Iraq-Iran War. Most young Iraqis were conscripted into  military service, causing a shortage of workers. Like other foreigners in Iraq  and Kuwait, many Egyptians have fled for home since Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait  on Aug. 2.  </P> <P> Mayor Rafi Hoffman of Eilat said Tuesday that, if asked, his staff would assist  in the transfer of Egyptian refugees.  </P> <P> "I can tell you that if we get notice, we will do everything possible to help,"  Hoffman said. "We have been looking for many years to open a bridge with  Aqaba."  </P> <P> Jordan has no official border crossing into Israel in the Eilat-Aqaba area. The  only such crossings are at bridges over the Jordan River to the north.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Israeli Supreme Court decided to reject a petition demanding the  immediate distribution of gas masks to civilians.  </P> <P> Danny Ernst, a lawyer and legal adviser to the Israel Consumer Council, had  asked the court to force distribution of gas masks on grounds that there may  not be enough time in the event of an attack.  </P> <P> The court ruled that the matter is not a judicial one and should be decided by  the government.  </P> <P> The argument over gas masks, which has developed since the invasion of Kuwait,  has become a political issue within the conservative government of Prime  Minister Yitzhak Shamir.  </P> <P> Some officials contend that a premature move could cause panic and serve to  provoke Iraq, but Foreign Minister Levy has taken the position that the masks  should be distributed now. Defense Minister Moshe Arens says they will be  delivered at the appropriate time.  </P></p>

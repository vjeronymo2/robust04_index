			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Glaxo in investment shake-up after losing Pounds 100m Investments in complex financial instruments have cost Glaxo, the UK pharmaceuticals group, about Pounds 100m in recent months, the company indicated yesterday. Glaxo also said it had switched control of its Pounds 2.2bn investment portfolio from its own 10-member, Bermuda-based investment management group to outside experts. 'We are going to concentrate on pharmaceuticals from now on, rather than investment banking,' it said. Glaxo's losses stemmed from the investment of its huge cash pile, rather than from trading in financial markets, which has been the cause of well publicised losses at other companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble. The losses are believed to have arisen mostly from the company's holdings of structured bonds, which amounted to 10 per cent of its investment portfolio, and collateralised mortgage obligations, which have been reported at Dollars 600m (Pounds 384m). Structured bonds are instruments whose returns are tied to some other factor, such as the relationship between two interest rates, while CMOs are securities created from mortgage-backed bonds which carry greater risk (and potentially greater rewards) than standard instruments. Although not strictly derivatives, these securities can share many of the characteristics of such instruments, as they bring a leveraged exposure to a change in interest rates or other market-moving event. A number of big investors in the CMO market in the US have reported substantial losses in recent months, among them Kidder Peabody, the investment banking arm of General Electric; Askin Capital Management, an investment firm which specialised in such instruments, and Bank of Montreal. The head of Glaxo's investment management activities, Mr John Hignett, a former managing director of Lazards and head of the City's Takeover Panel, retired at the end of March at the age of 60. His departure was not related to concerns about the quality of the investments, Glaxo said. But after his departure, Mr John Coombe, the company's finance director, launched a review of the company's investments which revealed the losses. The company refused to confirm directly that it had lost Pounds 100m. However, it said: 'That is what the market thinks. If the board thought the market was wrong, it would make a statement.' The losses were broadly in line with the decline in bond markets in recent months, or about 5 per cent, he added. The scale of the losses could grow as Glaxo moves to sell its securities. It is believed to have begun the sales last week and confirmed that it had sold Dollars 55m of securities on Monday. Worries hit Glaxo, Page 44</p>

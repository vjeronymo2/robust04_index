			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Republicans urge suspension of Nicaraguan aid NICARAGUA'S hopes of receiving more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 50.2m) of promised aid from Washington have been dealt a blow after a report by the Republican staff on the US Senate foreign relations committee called for an indefinite suspension of all US help. The report on Monday charged that the government of President Violeta Chamorro is controlled by the left-wing Sandinistas, maintains the largest army in Central America, has fraudulently channelled money and aid to its friends, and has failed to return land to US citizens that had been illegally confiscated. Mr Antonio Lacayo, the president's son-in-law and minister of the presidency, described the report as 'false and full of slanders'. But the US State Department yesterday called the report 'far-reaching and disturbing' and is sending a delegation to Nicaragua to take up the issues raised. Ms Deborah De Moss, who wrote the report, said it was almost certain Nicaragua would not receive the money this year, and that its findings had received support from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress. The Dollars 116m of aid has been on hold since the end of May after Mr Jesse Helms, the right-wing US senator, protested at the continued influence of the Sandinistas in Mrs Chamorro's government and the failure of the government to return land to the US citizens. The aid is critical to Nicaragua's economic stabilisation programme. Were it to be suspended indefinitely the government would have to slash spending to keep to IMF targets - an almost impossible task given the budget cuts it has already made. If it missed IMF targets, further multilateral aid might be put on hold. The US administration has agreed Nicaragua will be given Dollars 50m to meet IMF financial commitments if the government removes Sandinista commanders from the police force and draws up a strict timetable to reform the army and return land to US citizens. The remaining Dollars 66m, Ms De Moss said, should only be issued when all land was returned to the 465 US claimants.</p>

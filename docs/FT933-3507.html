			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Biblical cities the focus for Palestinian autonomy - Gaza and Jericho will form the nuclei of a future new Arab entity NEITHER Gaza nor Jericho, which are to be the nuclei of Palestinian autonomy, rivals Jerusalem in Arab aspirations or in strategic and political standing. But their combination in a new Arab entity, flanking Israel under its internationally recognised borders, is the key factor enabling Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, to say he has grasped at least the outline of a Palestinian state. The two Biblical cities are on opposite fringes of the tight little country disputed by Jew and Arab. Jericho is on the Jordan river dividing the Hashemite Kingdom from pre-1948 Palestine, and Gaza sits on the coast road linking Egypt with Israel's main population centres. It is not just a matter of geography. In the armistice agreements which concluded the war of 1948-9, Jericho and Gaza found themselves controlled by two rival Arab kingdoms. They became casualties not only of Israel's victory  -swamped by thousands of restless refug - gees - but also the political vacuum caused by the their political leaders' fatal extremism. The Arab states, spurred on by these leaders, had invaded Palestine to thwart its partition under the United Nations resolution of November 29, 1947. The Jewish state emerged with borders substantially wider than those drafted by the UN; the rump of Arab Palestine, having spurned co-existence with a Jewish state, was split between Jordan and Egypt (there was also a tiny strip controlled by Syria). In taking over Jericho and Gaza, Transjordan and Egypt at first acted as though they recognised the Palestinian Arabs as a separate national entity with rights to independence. On October 10, 1948, an All-Palestine government - in Gaza - was formed with the blessing of Egypt and the Cairo-based Arab League. It adopted the trappings of national sovereignty. Its president was former Jerusalem Mufti Haj Amin al-Hussaini, Arab Palestine's foremost nationalist leader, who had led a pre-war revolt against the British and spent much of the second world war in Berlin. It also had its own prime minister, a cabinet and a national assembly. Most Arab countries recognised it. But King Abdullah, whose Arab Legion held the west Bank, including the Old City of Jerusalem, said he would recognise no government in Palestine, including Israel's, as long as the land had not been restored to its inhabitants. From Jericho he launched his counter bid as protector of Arab Palestine. On December 1, 1948, the ancient city hosted a congress of Arab notables from the territories under Abdullah's control. The Jericho assembly declared Emir Abdullah King of Palestine, and hailed the union of the two banks of the Jordan as the kernel of a wider Arab unity. Over the next two years, the process begun at Jericho was consolidated as first the US, and then Britain, announced de jure recognition of a new Jordanian kingdom embracing Transjordan and the Palestinian West Bank. Gaza's pretensions were quickly forgotten. Its All-Palestine government faded away; some of its leaders left the city almost immediately and its assembly collapsed after only one meeting. Gaza and its coastal strip became a fiefdom of the Egyptian army. It was never incorporated into Egypt and its refugee population was in a state of continuous explosion. Gaza and Jericho came under the same political administration only when they were among the territories captured in six days in 1967 by the Israeli army, under its chief of staff, Lt Gen Yitzhak Rabin, now prime minister. It was to take another quarter of a century for Palestinians and the Israelis finally to recognise each other's national credentials. Jericho and Gaza, once the symbol of Arab Palestine's dismemberment, are now the twin centres from where it might become the catalyst in transforming the Middle East from continual warfare to peaceful coexistence. But only if the fanatics, Arab and Israeli, are kept in check.</p>

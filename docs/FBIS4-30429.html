			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 27 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  ambassador for nuclear affairs will fly to Washington this week  for bilateral and trilateral talks, including Japan, on the  North Korean nuclear situation, a Foreign Ministry spokesman  said Monday.    Ambassador Kim Sam-hun's visit precedes a third round of  North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue slated to open in Geneva  after a one-year hiatus following the second round.    Kim is to meet with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert  Gallucci, chief American delegate to the dialogue with North  Korea, for bilateral consultations.    The meeting will be followed by a trilateral consultation  including Yutaka Kawashima, director-general for Asian affairs  at the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the spokesman said.    The three-way meeting is expected to address issues related  to freezing North Korea's nuclear development program,  recounting its past activities, and financial aid in switching  the North's outdated nuclear system to safer light-water  reactors.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Haynes' shares rise 37p on record Pounds 4m UNDERPINNED by improving performances in the US, Haynes Publishing Group, the car and motor cycle maintenance manual company, reported record pre-tax profits for the year to May 31. The shares rose 37p to 455p. Mr John Haynes, chairman, said the rise was the result of improved management of the business rather than an increase in sales. On turnover 7 per cent ahead at Pounds 22.8m, against Pounds 21.2m, pre-tax profits advanced 67 per cent from Pounds 2.37m to Pounds 3.95m. Earnings per share rose from 14.53p to 26.5p. Directors are proposing a final dividend of 4.5p for a total of 8p (6p). An enhanced scrip dividend of 6.5p is being offered. Mr Max Pearce, chief executive, said the move was to conserve cash and also to pre-empt possible future ACT problems because of the level of profits from the US. In the US pre-tax profits were a record Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 1.8m) on sales of Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 8.74m). The company said that the Haynes manual in the US had established a leading market position. During the year sufficient cash was generated in the group to repay net borrowings of Pounds 1.3m and end the period with Pounds 1.6m on deposit after investing Pounds 1.5m in capital assets. The net interest charge fell to Pounds 69,000 (Pounds 382,000). Market development in France was proceeding to plan but was unlikely to contribute significantly for the the next two or three years. Mr Pearce said that there were plans for expanding in other parts of the continent, particularly eastern Europe. In the UK pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 1.3m, up Pounds 1m, most of which was the result of lower exceptionals and interest charges. Losses in general publishing were halved. Mr Pearce said that the UK was the only area for caution. Despite its dominant market position, more work was needed before profits returned to an acceptable level.</p>

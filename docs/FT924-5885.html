			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: ERM tensions growing THE EUROPEAN exchange rate mechanism again appeared on the verge of a crisis yesterday after the weekend devaluations of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo failed to staunch speculation against currencies at the core of the system, writes James Blitz. The intention of Sunday's 6 per cent devaluation of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo was to remove strains that had arisen because of the linkage of these currencies to the D-Mark at an over-valued rate. But yesterday, the devaluations threatened to create a 'domino effect' inside the ERM, triggering uncertainty over the Danish krone, a currency perceived to be at the core of the system. Unlike the September crisis, this new bout of ERM turmoil did not have its roots in D-Mark strength alone. The perception that Germany is entering recession caused the dollar and the yen to appreciate. The US currency rose nearly a pfennig against the D-Mark, closing at DM1.6020, while the yen was at Y77.48 to the D-Mark from a previous Y77.91 Inside the ERM, however, the strains formed a familiar pattern. A rise in overnight rates to 50 per cent helped the Danish authorities to staunch the selling of the Danish currency and bonds. By the close of European trading, the currency was trading at DKK3.8818, close to its ERM floor of DKK3.9016. But analysts wondered whether interest rates could remain at such high levels. The Irish punt closed at IPounds 2.6297 against the D-Mark, and dropped below its ERM floor against the strongest currency in the system, the Belgian franc. The Irish currency remained weak, despite overnight rates rising to 30 per cent and the persistence of capital controls. The Spanish peseta weakened despite two devaluations and a rise yesterday in interest rates. It closed at Pta 72.26 against the D-Mark, just above its new central parity of Pta72.79. The escudo remained strong, while sterling was mostly unaffected, closing up one pfennig at DM2.4325. Several analysts said yesterday that the rise in Danish rates to such high levels was absurd, considering that Denmark has a 2 per cent inflation rate and a current account surplus. However, speculators are pushing for an early Danish devaluation because of the export competitiveness that has been lost following devaluations in other currencies. The life or death of the EMS ultimately depends on the French franc. Yesterday, the French currency weakened sharply to a close of FFr3.394 from previous FFr3.386. Mr Christopher Potts, an economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris, said that the franc may be hindered by the growing premium that speculators put on growth as a reason for purchasing currencies.</p>

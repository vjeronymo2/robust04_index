			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANA MAN CONVICTED ON 27 LOAN FRAUD COUNTS  </P> <P> A federal court jury in Los Angeles has convicted Orange County businessman  John F. Hayden of defrauding Bank of America and 21 other financial  institutions by issuing millions of dollars in worthless loan guarantees.  </P> <P> The jury on Wednesday convicted the Santa Ana resident of 27 fraud counts but  acquitted him of one count of interstate transportation of stolen property. On  Friday, the jury was unable to return a verdict on a single count of  conspiracy. U.S. District Judge Harry L. Hupp declared a mistrial on the  conspiracy charge and dismissed it, according to an FBI spokesman.  </P> <P> In an 11-week trial, prosecutors alleged that Hayden used Glacier General  Assurance Co. of Montana -- of which he was president -- to induce lenders to  make millions of dollars in real estate loans that were never repaid.  </P> <P> Glacier, which had an office in Tustin, did that by guaranteeing repayment of  the loans. When the loans later turned out to be fraudulent, Glacier was unable  to make good on its guarantees and was declared insolvent.  </P> <P> The persons who received the loans never used them to market a proposed  condominium project in Oregon or to build homes in Chatsworth, as was intended  by the lenders. Instead, they diverted millions of dollars into their own  accounts, prosecutors alleged.  </P> <P> Among Hayden's victims, prosecutors said, was giant Bank of America, which sued  Hayden and others in what it alleged was a scheme to swindle $95 million.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said loans from 22 lending institutions were involved in the fraud.  Hayden was first indicted with six other men in 1986. All but one have been  convicted.  </P> <P> The FBI spokesman said Friday that Hayden's defense attorney has made a motion  for a new trial on the the 27 counts of fraud.  </P></p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Observer: Self-destruction Treasury officials were quaking in their pinstripes last night after Teresa Gorman, Tory MP for Billericay and one of the most extravagant self-publicists in the Commons, finally added her voice to the chorus of advice to the government on how best to solve Britain's economic problems. Mrs Gorman's solution? Fire a Treasury civil servant each time a business goes bankrupt. 'The sackings should start at the top,' she advises, 'At permanent secretary level.' If she started with Terry Burns at 5 o'clock, the guard at the front door would get his marching orders by about 6 and the place would be deserted well before the Tory party conference, on the basis of 1,000 bankruptcies a week. No doubt the idea will go down well with her supporters in Essex but it hardly suggests that she is ministerial material.</p>

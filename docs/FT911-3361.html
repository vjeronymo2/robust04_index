			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Arts: Ten new productions for Covent Garden A new principal conductor and ten new productions for 1991-92 were announced yesterday by the newly ebullient Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Edward Downes is taking over on September 1 as principal conductor from Jeffrey Tate. He will also function as associate music director, making life easier for Bernard Haitink. These days 'new' productions tend to have started life in some foreign opera house, but five of next season's repertoire will actually have been created in the House. They are Verdi's Simon Boccanegra, conducted for the first time by Georg Solti and directed by Elijah Moshinsky; a very early Mozart, Mitrodate, re di Ponti, which opens on the actual centenary of his death in December, and a very established Mozart, Don Giovanni; a new production of Wagner's Die Fliegende Hollander to replace the one recently booed off the stage; and the first British professional staging of Rossini's comic opera Il viaggio a Reims. The five 'bought in' productions are Prokofiev's The Fiery Angel, never previously staged at Covent Garden; Das Rheingold, to complete the new Ring cycle; Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots; Bellini's I Puritani (the WNO production); and Britten's last opera, Death in Venice. The general director of Covent Garden, Jeremy Isaacs, also placated his critics by announcing that he was asking many of the members of the chorus aged over 50 to take early retirement. The Minister for the Arts, Timothy Renton, has asked the Arts Council to come up with savings of Pounds 1m on its devolution programme by May 17. He is unhappy with the few savings that have accrued so far from the policy of creating Regional Arts Boards with enhanced responsibilities. So far out of a total Arts Council and RAB payroll of around 500 only 35 jobs are to be lost through the rationalisation. The Minister wants a 10 per cent cut in the payroll bill. Mr Renton has approved the first Arts Council list of 28 devolved arts organisations but it is remarkable for the general unimportance of the companies involved. It includes Aldeburgh, going to Eastern Arts, and Northern Sinfonia, to Northern Arts. There is no mention of the big four London orchestras, the ICA, the Royal Court, or Manchester Exchange, all once earmarked for devolution. It could well be that Tim Renton is not so keen as the Arts Council on devolution. The new Boards are being recruited but they start life, on October 1, not knowing whether they will handle the really major arts companies.</p>

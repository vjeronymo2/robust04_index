			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICAN MEMORIES, AMERICAN SCHEMES;  </P> <P> LIMITS TO FRIENDSHIP THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO BY ROBERT A. PASTOR AND JORGE  G. CASTANEDA (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $24.95; 415 PP.);  </P> <P> THE CHALLENGE OF INTERDEPENDENCE REPORT OF THE BILATERAL COMMISSION ON THE  FUTURE OF UNITED STATES-MEXICO RELATIONS (UNIVERSITY PRESS OF AMERICA: $19.95,  CLOTH; $8.95, PAPER; 238 PP.)  </P> <P> No country affects the United States as much as Mexico. No other country is  more pervasively influenced by the United States, in turn. Few bilateral  relationships in the world are more complex, or more difficult to manage.  </P> <P> Millions of persons engage in an intricate web of transactions between Mexico  and the United States, most of them legal, but many not. U.S. corporations and  banks have invested billions of dollars in Mexico; Mexicans have stashed  billions in U.S. bank accounts and real estate; and Mexican workers in the  United States send $2 billion a year to relatives at home. While thousands of  Mexicans produce cars for the U.S. market, hundreds more take part in a massive  trade in stolen vehicles. U.S. citizens cross into Mexico to obtain inexpensive  medical care and legal medicines, but the trade in illegal narcotics is many  times larger and more lucrative.  </P> <P> The two governments deal with each other constantly on a host of issues --  clashing or cooperating on matters ranging from the price of gas to the size of  tomatoes, trading rules to oil spills, ground water to sewage disposal.  Domestic policy choices in each country -- on budgets, taxes, welfare, labor,  education and immigration -- significantly affect its neighbor.  </P> <P> The intermestic (combining international and domestic) quality of U.S.-Mexico  relations is nowhere more evident than in Southern California: the primary  destination of Mexican immigrants and tourists, the main source of investments  in Mexico's assembly (maquiladora) industries, the key beneficiary of Mexican  flight capital, the largest market for illegal drugs from Mexico.  Spanish-speaking students, most of them of Mexican origin, are a majority in  the public schools of Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> A "silent integration" is taking place on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico  frontier. The economics, politics, and culture -- even the cuisine -- of the  border region is becoming homogeneous, and different from the rest of the two  countries. But while this interpenetration proceeds apace, conflicts between  the two governments have also been multiplying. Bilateral tensions in the 1980s  have been sharper than at any time since the 1920s. Frictions have intensified  over immigration, drugs, debt, trade, investment and foreign policy  differences, especially in Central America.  </P> <P> In "Limits to Friendship" two accomplished scholar-practitioners of U.S.-Mexico  relations analyze why the relationship is so often frustrating and conflictive.  Forty-one-year-old Robert A. Pastor, a Harvard-trained political scientist, was  the Latin America specialist on the National Security Council during the Carter  years; Jorge G. Castaneda, 35, the son of a former Mexican foreign minister, a  graduate of Princeton and the University of Paris, is already Mexico's  best-known commentator on international affairs.  </P> <P> Precociously well-established, the two self-confident, astute, and  exceptionally articulate interlocutors are well-matched in this book. Writing  alternate and reciprocal chapters, they vividly illustrate that Mexico and the  United States are divided not only by vast asymmetries of power but also by a  shared history each nation understands and remembers very differently.  </P> <P> Each author personifies predominant national characteristics that are at the  heart of the relationship. Pastor, an energetic problem-solver, argues that  history need not be a barrier to U.S.-Mexico relations. He sees mutual  advantage in closer economic relations and tells Mexicans that they have little  to fear from foreign investment because, after all, foreign investment in the  United States now accounts for a larger share of the U.S. economy than U.S.  investment does in Mexico's.  </P> <P> Castaneda asserts that "Pastor's chapters underestimate the strength and  currency of Mexican nationalism particularly in its anti-American bent."  Castaneda twice expresses his concern about threats to Mexico's "national  soul," a concept and phrase far from Pastor's discourse.  </P> <P> Castaneda reveals a deeply felt distrust of the United States. He derides the  U.S. tendency to push Mexico to do "for its own good" what the United States  sees as in its best interest. He regards the maquiladora industries not as an  outward-looking sector of the American economy, but as "an extension of the  American economy on Mexican soil." He fears that privatization of the Mexican  economy, forced by greater integration with the world economy, "may well turn  out to be an Americanization."  </P> <P> Castaneda's telling criticisms of Pastor's chapters effectively show why it is  difficult to reconcile the Mexican and U.S. perspectives. But Castaneda is much  less effective -- and thus perhaps most illuminating -- at conveying a coherent  policy prescription of his own. Emotionally, he resists greater economic ties  between Mexico and the United States, but analytically he appears to see them  as inevitable. He notes that "ties between the two nations, while manageable,  are not really improvable," -- but he joins Pastor in a final chapter of  recommendations aimed precisely at improving these relations. Castaneda dances  elegantly up to and around, but never quite addresses, the central question he  himself poses: "Should Mexico resist integration? Or should it manage, govern,  and administer that integration, with full awareness of its inevitability?"  </P> <P> Perhaps because Castaneda is unable to resolve his own ambivalence -- or  because he reflects a fundamental national division of opinion -- the joint  policy conclusions Pastor and Castaneda offer are not particularly original or  exciting. By far the most arresting of their proposals is confined to two  paragraphs and is not well-developed; almost as a throwaway line, they assert  that "the moment is ripe to consider a package deal that would involve many  concessions and demands by both nations in trade, energy, intelligence and  security, debt, capital flight and immigration." But this bold and tantalizing  suggestion is not further developed, and is undercut by much of Castaneda's  argument.  </P> <P> Whereas Pastor and Castaneda sought primarily to illumine the differences  between Mexico and the United States, the Bilateral Commission on the Future of  United States-Mexican relations worked hard to overcome the differences.  </P> <P> The commission's report, "The Challenge of Interdependence," is an impressive  product, given the familiar limits of consensual reports, as compounded by the  particular difficulties of the U.S.-Mexico relationship. On most issues --  economics, migration, drugs, and education -- the commission was able to agree  on a shared analysis, no small accomplishment.  </P> <P> As is common in commission reports, many of the recommendations are calls for  yet more study -- and some of the prose is ponderously prudent and balanced to  a fault. But the report is surprisingly forthright in recommending that  Mexico's debt-service obligations be limited to levels consistent with the  country's growth; in proposing a two-step approach toward expanded free trade;  in urging Mexico to adopt a more open and consistent policy to attract foreign  investment; and in favoring a bilateral accord on migration that would both  increase the legal Mexican migration to the United States and provide a  long-term temporary workers program.  </P> <P> "The Challenge of Interdependence," the first such effort by U.S. and Mexican  nongovernmental leaders to seek joint responses to shared problems, suggests by  its very existence that a corner is being turned in relations between the two  countries. U.S. Because U.S.-Mexico relations are in such great flux, neither  "Limits to Friendship" nor "The Challenge of Interdependence" is likely to be  the last word on this topic. The two books, however, represent a major advance  over anything written before. No one interested in our most challenging  international tie should be without either volume.  </P></p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Books: The rise of Yeltsin the egalitarian BORIS] Boris] they hailed him in Washington last month. But what sort of a man is he? His image outside Russia is that of a leader at once brave and resolute, tactless and impulsive, the man of the hour in the failed Moscow coup, a touch naive about politics, maybe, but on the personal side a damned good fellow who shares his country- men's fondness for vodka. Boris Yeltsin, a political biography by two former Soviet journalists, Vladimir Solovyov and Elena Klepikova (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, Pounds 18.99) alters this impression in one crucial respect. Yeltsin is portrayed as genuinely egalitarian. As First Secretary in Moscow he assaulted the system of party privileges, shops, cars, dachas. 'I cannot take imported miracle drugs knowing that my next-door-neighbour has no aspirin for her child.' Gorbachev's personal style is depicted as the exact opposite of Yeltsin's. In this contrast, it is suggested, lay the roots of their hostility. As Boris' popularity rose, so Mikhail's fell. Yeltsin's speech to the Party Plenum, resigning from the Politburo, was the turning point, the small stone that released the avalanche. It was, an emotional, hesitant speech, not a prepared attack: but it was seen as treason by the comfortable, conformist, above all undemocratic, leadership. 'I'll never let you back into politics,' warned Gorbachev. How he came back is the story of this flattering account, part thriller, part political analysis. And there is a lot more to come, no doubt, as (or if) Yeltsin goes on. A useful cross- check on these events is provided by the well-known Russian journalist Vladimir Pozner in Eyewitness (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 12.99). His account, mixing his personal reaction to events, which as a journalist endangered his own position, with an informed perspective on the wider meaning of Kremlin politics, has the virtue of first-hand reporting. At the mass rally in Dzerzhinsky Square after the coup, Pozner was called by the crowd to speak. He found the right words, though they seem now too optimistic. 'I want to thank the junta for what it did for us . . . for uniting us, for finally bringing us together . . . for helping us recover our pride . . . for giving us back our army.' The fact that the soldiers had refused to obey the junta and storm the Russian Parliament, saved Yeltsin and saved the day, and turned a momentous page in history. Could Gorbachev have done better than he did, Pozner wonders? Probably. Could someone else have done a better job? Maybe. Did he miss golden opportunities and thereby botch things - yes, he did. The coup was the fulcrum which precipitated his downfall, but the killings in Vilnius when the Soviet troops moved into Lithuania was the start. Everyone who lived through those events has their own story to tell, not least first-rate British reporters. In Out Of Red Darkness (John Murray, Pounds 16.95) Trevor Fishlock of the Telegraph and in Goodbye to the USSR Steve Crawshaw of the Independent (Bloomsbury, Pounds 18.99) each provide alert, lucid and well-paced assessments of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Another way of getting the flavour, of sensing the poetic truth of why the system failed, may be found in fiction, in the form of Alexander Zinoviev's mordantly funny satire Perestroika in Partygrad (Peter Owen, Pounds 10.95) A model town, where nothing has ever happened (though there is plenty to hide), Partygrad is scheduled to become a 'lighthouse of perestroika', to attract admiring visitors from the West. This scenario allows the narrator to draw an anatomy of the party, its functionaries and hacks and hangers-on, the whole spectrum of society in its muddle, wistfulness, indulgence, inefficiency and solace in fine words and hard liquor. It is an affectionate, in a paradoxical way patriotic, account which shows exactly why Communism could never never work. More worrying, it implies that perestroika has not got a chance, either. But the voice of the people, cold and raw as vodka itself, comes through most strongly in their own words, in two books simply recording their feelings. A wide range of Soviet voices is given in Russia Speaks, an oral history from the revolution to the present, by the American writer Richard Lourie (HarperCollins, Pounds 16.99). The author travelled from Moscow to Central Asia, from Lithuania to Georgia, and interviewed all manner of people, from soldiers, and Gulag survivors to clowns and priests, all longing to talk. More sombre are the voices heard in Zinky Boys by Svetlana Alexievich (Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds 9.99). This was the name given to the young Soviet soldiers who came back from the war in Afghanistan in zinc coffins. Something like 15,000 lives were lost, with more than double that number seriously wounded. Yet their families were denied even the right to express their grief properly. Many of these reminiscences are heart-rending. 'Both my legs were amputated above the knee. If only they'd been taken off below the knee - that would've been fine] I'd be a happy man]' Yet if the same circumstances arose, this conscript says he would go back. A useful guide to the rapidly changing world of the Commonwealth of Independent States is provided by Russia Revised by Andrew Wilson and Nina Bachkatov (Andre Deutsch, Pounds 9.99). It is compiled with wit as well as hard facts. Thus under 'Cosmonaut': 'Favourite hero of Soviet small boys, until Yuri Gagarin was ousted by Crocodile Dundee.'</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Equity Plans (26): The tax-free route to a stake in your employer - Single-company PEPs / Shares bought through a SAYE scheme can now be transferred directly into a Pep THIS YEAR's newcomer in the Pep market is the single-company Pep. Investors are already entitled to use Peps for holding shares in only one company if they wish. Such vehicles have a limit of Pounds 6,000. But these plans cannot provide diversification, and so make little investment sense. They were likely to be of most use to executives and employees who had built up shares in their own companies through option schemes, allowing workers a tax-free way to hold the proceeds. Single-company Peps - otherwise, SCPs or Copeps - were introduced in the last budget to recognise this. Since the beginning of this month, investors have been allowed to invest an additional Pounds 3,000 in a single-company, on top of Pounds 6,000 in a mainstream Pep. Transfers of shares bought via an approved SAYE scheme can be made directly to a Pep, saving the expense and bother of selling them, and then buying them back into a Pep, as is currently necessary. A number of companies - including such blue-chip names as BP, ICI, Glaxo and BAT Industries - sponsor their own Peps. Other companies are planning to launch them. Much of the running in this market has been made by Bradford &amp; Bingley, and CC&amp;P Trustees, which is now a division of Bacon &amp; Woodrow. The FT-SE 100 companies and their intentions are listed below These Peps will be particularly attractive to company employees. In some ways, they can be set apart from the main bulk of portfolio management and financial planning. However, institutional fund managers are also cashing in. In practice, you can buy a tax-free Pounds 3,000 stake in virtually any quoted company, even if you do not work for them. Many managers are offering a free choice of any quoted company, or in some cases a choice of any FTSE stock. If the company you wish to invest in does not have its own Pep, then this is the route to take. Choosing a Pep manager in these circumstances is simple. Go for the cheapest. The only other factor is to check the company's financial strength. The collapse of Diameter Stockbrokers last year led to lengthy hassle for its Pep-holders, as ownership was often difficult to establish. The bigger institutional fund managers might, therefore, make sense. These Peps still have the significant advantage over other plans that most do not suffer from the heavy dealing costs involved in active management. It does not cost much to buy a block of shares and then hold on to it. If you choose a large, secure company, with every prospect of continued high dividends, then a Pounds 3,000 Pep should be a sound investment, provided you hold it for the long term. Some managers, such as Reyker Securities and John Siddall &amp; Son, will offer discounts by combining the Pounds 3,000 single-company Pep with a Pounds 6,000 standard Pep. It is open to question whether the big fund managers offer the best value for money. For example, NatWest Bank charges an initial fee of Pounds 30, with a half-yearly management charge of 0.25 per cent plus VAT. There is no start-up fee for existing NatWest planholders. It offers a range of 60 companies for investment. This is a good deal. But if you invest in ICI, one of the companies offered by NatWest, through its own sponsored Pep, managed by Bradford &amp; Bingley, it should work out cheaper. There is no initial charge, and management charges are Pounds 5 plus VAT per half year, which works out, unless the price of the shares drops considerably, as being rather cheaper than NatWest's management charge. However, there is a fee of Pounds 5 plus VAT when the Pep is closed. If you want to invest in ICI in any case - and it is part of many portfolios  -then ICI's sponsored Pep seems to be a very sensible way to do it. But in general, although these plans provide some interesting opportunities for general investors, they are of most use to those who already have a large portfolio, and want to protect some of it from tax. Unless you are in that bracket, unit and investment trust Peps, with possibly some blue-chip equities on top, should take priority over a single-company Pep.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Sex bias claim limit may be 'too low' EMPLOYERS could face increases in the size of compensation claims from victims of sex discrimination because of a European Court of Justice case, the Equal Opportunities Commission said yesterday. Industrial tribunals in Britain are not allowed to award more than Pounds 10,000 in sex discrimination cases. The European Court was advised by the EC advocate-general yesterday that an upper limit on compensation must allow for 'adequate' compensation and cover: for example, any loss of income suffered by the victims. The EOC said that, on first reading of the opinion, it was 'highly delighted'. It said: 'It looks as if the upper limit may in certain circumstances offer inadequate compensation under EC law.' The opinion also meant it was likely that individuals would be able to claim interest on damages from the date the discrimination took place, rather than from the time of the tribunal's ruling - as at present. The advocate-general's view is likely to be adopted by the European Court and, after further clarification, returned to the House of Lords. The issues of industrial tribunal ceilings and interest payable arose from a long-running case which was brought against Southampton Health Authority by a former employee, Ms Helen Marshall. The first cases which could be affected by a final European Court ruling involve as many as 5,000 women dismissed by the armed services after becoming pregnant. In a test case involving two former military nurses, the government agreed in the High Court in December 1991 that two women had been unlawfully sacked, and agreed to pay compensation. The Armed Forces Pregnancy Dismissal Group, which represents the women, said yesterday that some individual claims might now exceed Pounds 100,000.</p>

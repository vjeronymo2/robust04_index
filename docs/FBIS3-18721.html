The supporters of the two government parties have  about as much in common as two partners in a marriage that  failed.    Most FDP voters think more highly of the Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD] than the CDU/CSU, more highly of  Scharping than Kohl, and they want another coalition -- one with  the SPD rather than the CDU/CSU.    This is the result of a survey carried out by the Bielefeld  Emnid-Institute for DER SPIEGEL. Between 25 January and 16  February, a total of 2,500 people were interviewed and another  1,000 between 21 and 23 February, a sample that is  representative for the 60 million federal citizens who are  entitled to vote.    The objective of the survey was to clarify before the series  of elections, due to open next Sunday [13 March] in Lower  Saxony, what the Germans thought of the parties and what the  parties's chances were eight months before the 16 October  Bundestag election.    The CDU/CSU voters are in a depressive mood. Only 55 percent  believe that Kohl and the coalition will win the fall election.  In April 1990, eight months before the last Bundestag election,  it was 94 percent.    At the moment, things look rather gloomy for the CDU/CSU. It  is supported only by 35 percent of the electorate, less than in  any Bundestag election since 1953. The other figures: SPD, 39  percent; FDP and Alliance 90/Greens, 8 percent each; the Party  of Democratic Socialism [PDS], 4 percent; Republikaner and  Instead Party, 3 percent each.    There are fluctuations, but in the weekly Emnid surveys, the  SPD has constantly been stronger than the CDU/CSU and the FDP  and Greens have always been above 5 percent, while the  Republikaner and the PDS almost always, and the Instead Party  always remained below 5 percent.    The figures for the various parties issued by the institutes  are more or less identical, something Kohl refuses to believe  ("The differences between the institutes have meanwhile become  bizarre"). Only those provided by Forsa (Dortmund) are  significantly different, attributing to the SPD an unrealistic  43-46 percent.    The big parties have become smaller. No longer 91.2 percent  as in their best days (Bundestag election 1976), but only 74  percent would opt for one of them at the moment. While in the  past it was often less than 1 percent, it is now 10 percent that  intend to vote for other but the established parties, which  meanwhile also include the Greens.    Yet, the parties can be sure of their voters less than ever.  The share of "convinced supporters" has fallen from 35 to 16  percent. No longer 73 but only 45 percent know exactly what  party they will support in the Bundestag election. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Placer Dome posts Dollars 236m shortfall PLACER Dome, one of North America's two biggest gold producers, has posted a final 1991 loss of Dollars 236.2m, or Dollars 1 a share. This follows previously-announced writedowns totalling Dollars 294.7m on its investments in the Mt Milligan hopper-gold property in British Columbia and in smaller gold properties across Canada. The Mt Milligan special charge alone was Dollars 195.7m. In 1990, Placer, which has changed to US dollar accounting because of its global operations, reported profits of Dollars 164.6m, or 70 cents a share. Sales in 1991 were Dollars 968m, up 4 per cent from 1990. The fourth-quarter final loss, including writedowns, was Dollars 283.1m, against a loss of Dollars 7.6m a year earlier on sales of Dollars 277m, compared with Dollars 247m. The 1991 profits from continuing operations before writedowns was Dollars 58.5m, against Dollars 103.5m last time, due mainly to lower prices. Average realised price for gold in 1991 was Dollars 399 per ounce, taking into account forward contracts. Gold output was 1.68m ounces, including 276,200 oz from the first full year of Porgera in Papua New Guinea and 32,000 oz from La Coipa in Chile, which started on October 1. Average cash production cost was Dollars 223 per oz, against Dollars 232 per oz, because of low-cost Porgera and La Coipa.</p>

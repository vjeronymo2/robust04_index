Inland was the first of the big, integrated US steel manufacturers to report its second-quarter figures. Its results were line with with expectations of generally narrowed losses as the US economy slowly improves. Net income of Dollars 1.8m for the second quarter translated into a loss of 20 cents a share after payment of preferred dividends.

Sales rose from Dollars 864.8m to Dollars 909.4m. Mr Frank Luerssen, chairman, said the results reflected the slowly growing domestic economy. 'While shipments have increased modestly, prices remain at unacceptable levels.' The company's integrated steel manufacturing business reported an operating profit of Dollars 13.3m after taking the Dollars 22.5m pre-tax gain on the joint venture sale. That compared with an operating loss of Dollars 25.5m in the second quarter of last year. Steel sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars 508.5m, with shipments totalling 1.1m tons, up 3 per cent.

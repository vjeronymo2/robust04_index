			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Arts: Magnificent Titian, and other titans - Patricia Morison is enchanted by a masterful exhibition of Venice's Golden Age WHAT DID Titian feel in the autumn of 1510 on hearing that Giorgione had died of plague? Perhaps he mourned for 'Big George' who, as Vasari wrote, 'taught everything he knew with love' and revolutionised painting in Venice, even though he was still in his early 30s when he died. Yet Titian must have reflected that there now was no rival to stand in the way of his acceptance as supreme painter of Venice. And so began truly The Century of Titian, the title of the magnificent exhibition which can be seen in Paris and nowhere else. It would be rash to prophesy that decades must elapse before there is another comparable exhibition of Venice's Golden Age. Nonetheless, it is certain that this exhibition had remarkable leverage in securing loans, thanks to the prestige of its organiser, Michel Laclotte. For this last exhibition before his retirement, the director of the Louvre has been calling in the favours, winkling out important paintings which have not been lent for over a generation, and in some cases have barely been seen this century. Room after room of the Grand Palais is hung with masterpieces from Venice's golden age, among them some of the best-loved paintings of the Italian Renaissance, such as Titian's 'Flora' from the Uffizi and his 'Venus at her Toilette' from Washington. Titian dominates, but this is not to say that it is his show alone. The Royal Academy's Splendour of Venice in 1983-4 produced not one Giorgione, but some fine paintings from his circle. In contrast, Paris offers an entire room hung with 17 Giorgiones, among them the mysterious 'Sunset Landscape' from London and the exquisite Laura, bare-breasted in a fur-lined coat - a courtesan, a Virtue, or even, as some would have it, a marriage portrait. As for the bitterly lamenting old woman, 'La Vecchia,' it seems odd that anyone could think this is Giorgione's portrait of his mother. However, the enormous catalogue (FFr390, Pounds 47.15) reveals that this is the opinion of the Italian scholar, A. Ballarin, on whose views of Giorgione and Titian the exhibition is more or less closely based. But then, Giorgione is an endlessly mysterious artist. Hanging such a room amounts to throwing down the gauntlet a dozen times - assuming that certain paintings such as the San Diego 'Portrait of a Man,' with its immensely delicate sfumato effect, are certainly by him. But whoever one plumps for, there is no gainsaying the extraordinarily powerful effect of a wall of five portraits of beautiful, narcissistic, moody young men, among them the famous Gattemalata from the Uffizi and the hand-on-heart youth from the National Gallery in Budapest. The rooms which follow trace the influence of Giorgione, above all on Sebastiano del Piombo and on young Titian. The hornets of controversy buzz loudest of all at the point where the famous 'Concert Champetre' from the Louvre is said to be by Titian, and the 'Susannah and Daniel' from Glasgow. The unique pleasure of any such exhibition is to see wonderful paintings hanging together, commenting on each other. The 'Concert' and the 'Susanna' look less like Titian, to my eye, for being shown alongside the newly cleaned sacra conversazione from Mamiano di Traversatolo. Here is the artist of the Frari Assumption, totally confident in his harmonious grouping of monumental figures, and gifted above all with the surpassing use of colour. Separate sections on middle and late Titian include such rarities as a portrait of Laura Dianti, Alfonso d'Este's mistress, and 'St Margaret,' stepping out of the dragon's jaws while behind her is the view of a burning city as brilliantly impressionistic as anything from late Titian's brush. Interspersed are copious selections of other artists of the Veneto who fell under (or in Lotto's case, rejected), the spell of Giorgione and Titian. The Louvre has lent much, including the 'Man with a Glove'. Its 'Venus of the Pardo' can be seen with the two triumphantly erotic mythologies from the Prado, 'Danae' and 'Venus with Cupid and and Organist'. In all there are 150 paintings, and two rooms of 120 exceptionally fine prints and drawings. Le Siecle de Titien is attracting some 4,000 visitors daily so you should expect a queue. However, the show is spaciously hung which means that the crowd soon thins out. Wastage is helped by the fact that there are disgracefully few seats. This may be a mundane point, but it is nonetheless a serious one. Increasingly, doubts are expressed about the wisdom of exposing works of art to the risks of travel. In the last analysis, then, the justification for blockbuster exhibitions has to be the joy they give the public. So why, one might ask, are curators the world over so indifferent to their visitors' comfort? Le Siecle de Titian is, I am afraid, a classic example. The labels are so small that opera glasses are a good idea. And if possible, plan to visit more than once - not that there is a season ticket option, which also seems ungenerous. At the least, husband your strength, for the final room of the exhibition deserves not to be skimped. Hung against a nasty royal blue background, are the unsettling works of four great painters in their old age. Of Veronese there is the tender, quiet-toned 'St Pantaleon curing a Child' and 'Christ in the Garden of Olives'. Counter-Reformation spirituality speaks with a more troubling voice in the nocturnal scenes by Tintoretto and Bassano. Among the masterpieces of Titian's final two decades are 'Venus and Adonis' from the Metropolitan, the newly restored 'Venus Bandaging the Eyes of Cupid,' the Detroit 'Ecce Homo,' and 'St Jerome' from the Escorial. Above all, there is 'The Flaying of Marsyas,' the painting which in a decade of travel around the world has awakened a deep response in art lovers, few of whom would ever see it at home in Kromeric in the Czech Republic. Surely, then, it should have been possible to provide a perch? Prestigious block-buster shows look set to continue despite the opposition of hard-line conservationists. Indeed, their arguments look mean-spirited in the face of an exhibition like this, which offers such a deep and rich encounter with one of the most exciting periods in western art. And yet, at the same time, it also underlines the need for curators to take a less Olympian attitude to their eager but footsore public. Exhibition ends 14 June; open daily (except Tuesdays), 10-8, Thursdays 10-10. Sponsored by ICI France.</p>

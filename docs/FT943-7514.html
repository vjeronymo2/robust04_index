			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Dairy industry locks horns with new market: A look at the opposition to plans for milk purchasing The dairy industry's trade body and biggest companies yesterday launched a co-ordinated attack on the arrangements for milk purchasing that take effect when the Pounds 3.3bn milk market is liberalised in just over two months. Following a board meeting on Friday, the Dairy Trade Federation announced it was going to the High Court to seek judicial review of the government's 'mishandling' of the deregulation process. At the same time Northern Foods, Unigate and MD Foods, three of the biggest dairy companies, warned that retail prices could rise sharply and the dairy processing industry could lose jobs to continental Europe. They are furious that Milk Marque, the voluntary farmers' co-operative that will succeed the statutory Milk Marketing Board on November 1, has been able to raise the prices at which it sells to them because it controls 65 per cent of supplies in England and Wales. Farmers are free under the new arrangements to sell their milk either to Milk Marque - which will act as a broker - or direct to the dairy companies. Most have opted for the former, although up to 15 per cent are still undecided. At the heart of the dispute is the bidding process introduced by Milk Marque to fix the prices and quantities of milk it sells to the dairy companies. Yesterday was the deadline for companies to sign contracts with Milk Marque, which many said they were doing 'under duress'. At each of the three rounds of bidding, Milk Marque has raised prices. But the dairy companies wanted 30 per cent more milk than Milk Marque has to offer, so it is also scaling back allocations. Mr Andrew Dare, Milk Marque chief executive, said it was asking for an average of 25.5p per litre, compared with the present price of 24p - an increase of just over 6 per cent. But the dairy companies say this does not take account of recent changes in the value of the green pound - the artificial exchange rate at which Ecu-based support prices are converted into sterling - which means a further rise in prices of 3.5 per cent. Furthermore, the average price covers seven categories of milk, carrying increases ranging between 2.7 per cent and 24 per cent, they say. Unigate, which accounts for about 13 per cent of milk supplies, said its operating profits could be down by as much as Pounds 10m in the year to March 31 because of the cost increases. Mr Ross Buckland, chairman, said British dairy companies were trapped by Common Agricultural Policy quotas, which mean Britain can produce only 85 per cent of its milk requirements. Unigate faces price increases of about 12 per cent in the milk it uses for yoghurt, and up to 24 per cent in milk for cheese production, he said. Yet input costs in other European Union member states such as France, where supply exceeds demand, were falling. Imports of dairy produce would be sucked into Britain from France, 'where you don't have a government-created, 65 per cent monopoly which is able to set its own selling conditions and its own prices in a quota-capped regime,' he said. He predicted thousands of job losses in the industry and said Unigate's 8,000-strong workforce faced 'significant' cuts. Some companies are already in trouble. Last week the Galloway Cheese Company, which is majority-owned by the Scottish Milk Marketing Board through its commercial arm, went into receivership, putting 130 jobs at risk. The board said banks had been reluctant to continue support for the company without new guarantees or funds because of 'the uncertainties of the marketplace following deregulation'. Mr Chris Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, the biggest dairy company, said farmers could suffer, too. 'They may have a honeymoon, but prices would collapse as factories close, the value-added business goes elsewhere and imports come in.' But the National Farmers' Union said the old system gave dairy companies an advantage over producers. Ms Julie Smith, the union's milk adviser, said: 'They've been cushioned from competition and they've fossilised a bit. I don't think it's going to be as drastic as they say, but this is a necessary jolt.'</p>

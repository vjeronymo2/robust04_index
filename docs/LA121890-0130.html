			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL;  </P> <P> PANEL SAYS MAYOR VIOLATED STATE LAW  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel Mayor Patricia C. Bates violated state law but did no "public  harm" when she chaired City Council meetings about a ridgeline-protection  ordinance, according to a letter from the California Fair Political Practices  Commission.  </P> <P> The letter was mailed to Laguna Niguel resident Eddie Rose, who lodged the  complaint against Bates in October. Rose is a leader in the attempted recall of  Bates and three other council members.  </P> <P> In the letter, dated Dec. 4, the commission said that although Bates abstained  from the vote, she should not have chaired portions of meetings in September  and October during which the ridgeline-protection initiative was discussed.  However, it also says her participation was "nominal, involving only the  orderly progression of the meeting" and did not warrant enforcement action.  </P> <P> The ordinance would have prohibited development within 300 feet of ridges,  preventing property owners from building on their lots in areas such as Bear  Brand Ranch and Monarch Point. Bates owns a Monarch Point lot.  </P> <P> Although residents gathered sufficient signatures for the measure, the council  refused to pass it as law or put it to a citywide vote. City officials said it  would open the way for lawsuits harming the city.  </P> <P> According to the commission's letter, a public official is prohibited from  participating in a "governmental decision in which he knows or has reason to  know he has a financial interest." Chairing a council meeting "constitutes  participation and is prohibited if the official has a conflict of interest," it  says.  </P> <P> When notified of the initial complaint, Bates said she had consulted with the  city attorney before participating in the meetings. Since early November, the  mayor has delegated the leadership of a meeting to another council member when  she has had a possible conflict of interest.  </P> <P> A commission spokeswoman said Monday that Bates had received a warning letter  advising her of the violation. Bates could not be reached for comment Monday.  </P> <P> Rose said on Monday that he was "somewhat satisfied" with the response from the  commission. LESLIE EARNEST  </P></p>

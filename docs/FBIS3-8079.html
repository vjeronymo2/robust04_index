			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 4 March carries in its  regular 8-minute newscast the following reports on the fighting  in the republic.    Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Sermic reports that "the  fighting on the Maglaj front has been escalating minute by  minute since the early morning hours. The chetniks are  relentlessly carrying on with their attacks on the free  territory and its defenders. At the moment, all types of  artillery and antiaircraft weapon shells are pounding the  positions of the 201st Chivalrous Brigade and other  [Bosnia-Herzegovina Army] units and are an introduction to  infantry attacks on the (?Hedrovace)-Siprage-(?Tresjiste) line  and the region of Nekolj. Civilian targets in the town and  surrounding villages are also not spared. Dozens of howitzer  and mortar shells have already hit and destroyed residential and  business buildings. This is the tenth day that the population  has been in shelters."    Hamid Deronjic reports from Brcko and says that "the  shelling  of the free Brcko territory defense lines continued overnight.  Vranovaca, Djukici, and Kladje were targeted by 80-mm and 82-mm  enemy mortars. From the direction of Brod, the chetniks opened  fierce Praga and machine gun fire at the defenders' positions on  the central sector of the front. Overnight, all the free Brcko  territory defense positions came under intensified fire from  enemy infantry weapons. The air corridor over the temporarily  occupied Brcko continues to be used in the continuing aggression  on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Between 1800 [1700 GMT] and 1900 last  night, three overflights of enemy transport helicopters were  registered on the Brcko-Kicevo route; at 2045, another chetnik  helicopter was sighted flying the same route."    Reporting from the Bosna Operative Group Press Center in  Zavidovici, correspondent Viktor Boban says that "it seems that  the Washington agreement is taking hold in the Bosna Operative  Group operational zone, because the confrontation lines with the  Croatian Defense Council [HVO] have been mostly calm, which is  not the case with the lines facing the Serbian aggressor. The  defenders at Mahoje were the target of small arms and  antiaircraft machine guns, and some time after 1200, 10 82-mm  mortar shells fell in the wider area of Hajdarevici. The night  was calm, with only sporadic small arms fire. The exception was  the area of Hajdarevici, where several 82-mm mortar shells  landed before midnight. Minor chetnik regrouping and movements  of heavy armored combat vehicles from Mt. Ozren have been  sighted. It is quiet this morning on all the stable defense  lines in the Bosna Operative Group operational zone."    Enes Rastusic reports from the 4th Corps Information Center  on the situation on the Mostar front. He says that the "past 24  hours in the 4th Corps operational zone were marked by sporadic  small arms and antiaircraft provocations along all defense  lines. The cease-fire was particularly violated in the southern  parts of the Mostar Commune, the free Prozor territories, and in  Konjic. Our defenders are consistently observing the cease-fire  and did not respond to enemy provocations. Personnel of the 4th  Corps thwarted an attempt to infiltrate a [word indistinct]  reconnaissance and subversion group in the region of  (?Bijelimic). The demarcation lines remain unchanged and under  the control of Bosnia-Herzegovina Army units."</p>

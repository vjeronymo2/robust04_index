			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Letter: Success of UK machine tool makers Sir, We noted with interest the article on Holroyd machine tool company which has just won the Queen's Award for Technological Achievement, ('Cutting and Grinding', April 21). You say Holroyd is 'One of the few surviving machine tool companies left in Britain, which once was a world leader in this sector.' This does a disservice to the many leading companies in our industry. There are about 175 UK makers of machine tools and ancillary equipment, some of which remain world leaders. Figures from the Machine Tool Technologies Association show the UK is the world's eighth largest producer, and seventh largest exporter of machine tools. The UK exports more machine tools per head employed than any nation except the Swiss; several of our members have won the Queen's Award for exports. The industry has become smaller as its domestic customer base has shrunk. Conversely this has accounted for the strength of the German and Japanese industries. It will be interesting to see how they cope with the downturn in demand that has been regarded as commonplace in the UK. Simon Brown, director general, The Machine Tool Technologies Association, 62 Bayswater Road, London W2 3PS</p>

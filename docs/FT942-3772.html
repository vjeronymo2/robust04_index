			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Beckett jubilant at string of victories Senior Labour politicians claimed last night that their European election gains had exceeded the party's wildest expectations and amounted to a crushing defeat for the Conservatives. However, Tory party managers, while acknowledging that they had endured heavy losses, were relieved that their party had not suffered the electoral 'meltdown' that was feared. Instead, Labour and Tory politicians were quick to claim that the Liberal Democrats had been the main losers on the night, amid signs that Mr Paddy Ashdown's party would not gain many of its target seats. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting Labour leader, described her party's gains as 'absolutely wonderful'. Throughout the campaign, Labour had feared that the party would find it hard to improve on its performance in the last European elections. But, as a string of Labour victories was announced, Mrs Beckett said that the Conservatives had been 'overtaken by a political earthquake'. She said of the Tory leadership: 'In 1989 they thought they were down to their irreducible minimum, down to their core vote. Now we are eating into that core vote.' Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the Tories had endured their worst result for 100 years. 'Labour has broken through in areas like Essex and Norfolk which we haven't won since 1945 and 1966. The Conservative government is living on borrowed time. The betrayals have now caught up with them.' Mrs Pauline Green, the leader of the Labour group in the European parliament, said that Tory divisions over Europe had been the main reason for the party's defeat. 'This election has been about the Europe people want to see,' she said. 'The Tories are clearly riven top-to-bottom over Europe while the Labour party is united in its approach.' The mood at Conservative Central Office was gloomy, but tinged with relief that the number of Tory seats would end up in double figures. Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, regretted that his party had lost so many seats, but said that it had performed much better than most forecasters thought. He went on to claim that yesterday's defeat could even be the low point in the party's recent run of ill fortune. 'It marks what could be the start of recovery as far as the Conservative party is concerned,' he said. According to Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, the party could still make a comeback at the next election 'provided we listen to the message of the voters in this election'. However, some of the sitting Tory MEPs who lost their seats last night could not refrain from criticising the government for helping to bring about their defeats. After losing his London North West seat, Lord Bethell, the longest-serving English MEP to stand in the election, said that the Tory party 'should pull its socks up'. He said: 'There was a feeling amongst the people that they wanted to punish the government, give it a kick, and I'm one of the victims.' Mrs Teresa Gorman was one of a number of anti-European Tory MPs to claim that the low turnout underlined that people wanted Britain to reduce its commitments in Europe. 'Seventy per cent of the British people have turned their backs on Europe, and that is the most important thing in this election,' she said. The Liberal Democrats were initially jubilant at winning their first seat. But Mrs Beckett claimed that the Liberal Democrats' performance showed they were not a viable alternative to Labour as an opposition party. 'People are seeing right across Britain that if they want to get rid of this government they have to go for a real alternative and that is Labour.'</p>

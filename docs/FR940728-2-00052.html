			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In most cases, either (or both) of the following two types of environmental audits should be considered [in enforcement settlements]:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Compliance Audit: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  An independent assessment of the current status of a party's compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. This approach always entails a requirement that effective measures be taken to remedy uncovered compliance problems, and is most effective when coupled with a requirement that the root causes of noncompliance also be remedied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Management Audit: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  An independent evaluation of a party's environmental compliance policies, practices, and controls. Such evaluation may encompass the need for: (1) A formal corporate environmental compliance policy, and procedures for implementation of that policy; (2) educational and training programs for employees; (3) equipment purchase, operation and maintenance programs; (4) environmental compliance officer programs (or other organizational structures relevant to compliance); (5) budgeting and planning systems for environmental compliance; (6) monitoring, record keeping and reporting systems; (7) in-plant and community emergency plans; (8) internal communications and control systems; and (9) hazard identification and risk assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whether to seek a compliance audit, a management audit, or both will depend upon the unique circumstances of each case. A compliance audit usually will be appropriate where the violations uncovered by Agency inspections raise the likelihood that environmental noncompliance exists elsewhere within a party's operations. A management audit should be sought where it appears that a major contributing factor to noncompliance is inadequate (or nonexistent) managerial attention to environmental policies, procedures or staffing. Both types of audits should be sought where both current noncompliance and shortcomings in a party's environmental management practices need to be addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Environmental Auditing and Criminal Enforcement Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following EPA's 1986 Policy, three significant developments mark the evolution and implementation of criminal enforcement policy governing the use of self-audits and the voluntary disclosure of environmental violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, on July 1, 1991, the Department of Justice issued a guidance entitled: ``Factors In Decisions On Criminal Prosecutions For Environmental Violations In The Context Of Significant Voluntary Compliance Or Disclosure Efforts By The Violator.'' The guidance sets the general DOJ policy on auditing: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> It is the policy of the Department of Justice to encourage self-auditing, self-policing, and voluntary disclosure of environmental violations by the regulated community by indicating that these activities are viewed as mitigating factors in the Department's exercise of criminal enforcement discretion. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The guidance and the examples contained therein provide a framework for the determination of whether a particular case presents the type of circumstances in which lenience would be appropriate. The factors to be considered in exercising the Department's prosecutorial discretion, in cases where the law and evidence are otherwise sufficient for prosecution, include: voluntary disclosure; cooperation; preventive measures and compliance programs; pervasiveness of noncompliance; internal disciplinary action; and subsequent compliance efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, on November 11, 1993, the Final Draft Environmental Sentencing Guidelines provided for the mitigation of sentences where a court finds that the following factors for environmental compliance are satisfied: line management attention to compliance; integration of environmental policies, standards, and procedures; auditing, monitoring, reporting and tracking systems; regulatory expertise, training and evaluation; incentives for compliance; disciplinary procedures; continuing evaluation and improvement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, on January 12, 1994, EPA's Director of Criminal Enforcement issued a guidance entitled: ``The Exercise of Investigative Discretion,'' that sets forth specific factors that distinguish cases meriting criminal investigation. With respect to corporations conducting environmental audits, the guidance states: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Corporate culpability may be indicated when a company performs an environmental compliance or management audit, and then knowingly fails to promptly remedy the non-compliance and correct any harm done. On the other hand, EPA policy strongly encourages self-monitoring, self-disclosure, and self-correction. When self-auditing has been conducted (followed up by prompt remediation of the non-compliance and any resulting harm) and full, complete disclosure has occurred, the company's constructive activities should be considered as mitigating factors in EPA's exercise of investigative discretion. Therefore, a violation that is voluntarily revealed and fully and promptly remediated as part of a corporation's systematic and comprehensive self-evaluation program generally will not be a candidate for the expenditure of scarce criminal resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Audit Privilege Legislation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four States (Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, and Oregon) have recently enacted legislation which, with some variations, creates a ``self-evaluative'' privilege for audit reports. EPA has consistently opposed this approach, principally because of the risk of weakening State enforcement programs, the imposition of unnecessary transaction costs and delays in enforcement actions, and the potential increase in the number of situations requiring the expenditure of scarce Agency resources, including the ``overfiling'' of State enforcement actions. EPA urges States that are considering a privilege-oriented approach to actively participate in the comprehensive process described in the June 20, 1994  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice (59 FR 31914) before pursuing any legislative action. The Agency also encourages States that have passed such legislation to present documentary justification for this approach either at the public meeting on July 27&hyph;28, 1994, or in written comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Environmental Auditing at Federal Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1986 Policy also encourages all Federal agencies subject to environmental laws and regulations to institute environmental auditing, to help ensure the adequacy of internal systems to achieve, maintain and monitor compliance. Such Federal facility environmental audit programs should be structured to promptly identify environmental problems and expeditiously develop schedules for remedial action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where appropriate, EPA will enter into agreements with other agencies to clarify the respective roles, responsibilities and commitments of each agency in conducting and responding to Federal facility environmental audits. Also, to the extent feasible, EPA will provide technical assistance to help Federal agencies design and initiate audit programs. Currently, the EPA Federal Facility Enforcement Office (FFEO) is co-chairing an inter-Agency work group to revise auditing guidelines and protocols for Federal agencies. In addition, FFEO is developing the Federal Government Environmental Challenge Program required by Executive Order 12856, which calls for the establishment of a Code of Environmental Principles and a Model Installation Program for Federal facilities. This program is likely to include environmental auditing components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1986 Policy states that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to inspections of self-audited facilities and requests for audit reports, EPA generally will respond to environmental audits by Federal facilities in the same manner as it does for other regulated entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Federal agencies should, however, be aware that the Freedom of Information Act will govern any disclosure of audit reports or audit-generated information requested from Federal agencies by the public. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When Federal agencies discover significant violations through an audit, EPA encourages them to voluntarily submit the related findings and corrective action plans to the appropriate EPA Regional office and State agencies, even when not specifically required to do so. EPA will review the audit findings and action plans, and negotiate either a consent agreement or a Federal Facilities Compliance Agreement, pursuant to its enforcement authorities under the various environmental statutes. In any event, Federal agencies are expected to report to EPA pollution abatement and prevention projects involving costs necessary to correct compliance problems discovered through the audit, in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;106. Upon request, and in appropriate circumstances, EPA may assist affected Federal agencies through coordination of any public release of voluntarily submitted audit findings with approved action plans once agreement has been reached and/or appropriate enforcement actions have been taken. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

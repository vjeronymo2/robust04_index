			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / International Company News: Cominco sells mine stake COMINCO, the Vancouver-based metals and fertiliser producer, has sold its 46 per cent stake in Australia's Aberfoyle mining and exploration group for CDollars 135m (USDollars 113.4m), writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. The buyers are various Australian and international institutions which have been pressing Cominco for almost a year to part with at least a portion of its stake in Aberfoyle. The approaches were initially turned down, but were given consideration as Aberfoyle's share price rose from less than ADollars 4 to its present level of more than ADollars 5 a share. The Canadian company expects to use the proceeds to help finance projects in Chile, Mexico and, possibly, Turkey. Cominco is committed to providing USDollars 110m in equity for the Quebrada Blanca copper mine in northern Chile.</p>

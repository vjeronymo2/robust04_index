			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Jan 11 (CTK) -- Chairman of the ethnic  Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) Bela Bugar  strongly protested today against the allegation that he had held  secret talks with Chairman of the Slovak National Party (SNS)  Ludovit Cernak with the aim of ousting Slovak Premier Vladimir  Meciar.    "It is tragic that at a time when the unity and sovereignty  of the Slovak Republic is threatened, Cernak is secretly  negotiating with Bugar and Arpad Duka-Zolyomi from Egyutteles,"  says a statement by leaders of SNS West Slovak regional branches  published in the left-leaning PRAVDA today. PRAVDA writes that  Cernak has called the statement "an utterly shameless and  immoral lie."    Bugar called the report "a dirty political move" with an  apparent effort to eliminate Cernak. He stressed that the  latest talks between the MKDH and the SNS had been conducted  when the SNS had been in opposition.    Bugar chronologically listed all the initiatives connected  with the Komarno call, published on December 6, 1993. He said  the reaction by Slovak top officials, warning against  "destruction of Slovakia's integrity," was "out of proportion,"  while their approach to solving the ethnic problems had not been  positive and contradicted the previous promises.    He accused the Democratic Left Party (SDL) representatives  of  insincerity as they had received "a year and a month ago" the  draft minority bill, compiled by Hungarian parties, but they had  not commented on its wording yet.    In connection with dissatisfaction of the Hungarian minority  with the government proposal of the new  administrative-territorial set-up of Slovakia, Bugar noted that  deputies to local bodies in purely Slovak districts were also  dissatisfied and it is them (local governments) who should have  the largest powers with respect to the drafting of the law. He  stressed that the MKDH stuck to the principle taking "also" the  ethnic aspect into account, but not "only" the ethnic aspect.</p>

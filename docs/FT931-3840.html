			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: N American side lifts ABN Amro NET profits at ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank, rose by nearly 10 per cent in 1992 with buoyant results from North America helping to compensate for a relatively sluggish performance at home and in Europe. The bank said net profit climbed by 9.6 per cent to Fl 1.68bn (Dollars 908m), while profit per share rose by a more moderate 5.6 per cent to Fl 5.51. The dividend is being held at Fl 2.90. 'Given the fact that 1992 was not an easy year in several countries, the result is satisfactory,' said Mr Robert Hazelhoff, ABN Amro's chairman. Total revenue at the bank was up 8.5 per cent at Fl 12.28bn, while total costs saw the same percentage increase to Fl 8.32bn, producing an 8.5 per cent gain in gross profits to Fl 3.97bn. ABN Amro attributed the high rate of growth in costs to the acquisitions last year of Talman Home Federal Savings of Illinois, the London-based European operations of stockbrokers Hoare Govett, and CM Capital Markets of Spain. The first-time consolidation of Talman helped double ABN Amro's gross profits in North America to Fl 811m. Without Talman, results would have risen by nearly 68 per cent. Mr Hazelhoff said the emerging recovery in the US had led to a rise in demand for credit from small and medium-sized businesses. Lending in the US rose by 38.9 per cent, compared with just 3.7 per cent in Europe and 7.2 per cent in the Netherlands. At home, gross results fell by 3.4 per cent to Fl 2.5bn from Fl 2.59bn in 1991. The previous year's figures had been flattered by nearly Fl 200m in book profits from the divestment of two intermediary companies.</p>

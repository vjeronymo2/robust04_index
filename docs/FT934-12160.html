			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Singapore trial enters second week THE SINGAPORE trial of three prominent local economists and two financial journalists accused of breaking the republic's Official Secrets Act by prematurely disclosing an official economic growth estimate enters its second week today. The prosecution, led by Mr Chan Sek Keong, the Attorney General, has brought forward witnesses to back its claim that the defendants colluded in leaking an official 1992 second-quarter estimate on economic growth. The 4.6 per cent growth figure appeared in a report in the Singapore Business Times, the republic's leading financial newspaper, at the end of June last year. The figure was subsequently confirmed by the government. The accused are Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, director of the economics department at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore's de facto central bank, Mr Manu Bhaskaran and Mr Raymond Foo, both economists at the regional brokerage Crosby Securities, Mr Patrick Daniel, editor of the Business Times, and Mr Kenneth James, a journalist on the newspaper. All have pleaded not guilty to the charges. Most of the case so far has concerned what did or did not happen at a meeting in Mr Shanmugaratnam's office at the MAS in June 1992. The prosecution alleges that Mr Shanmugaratnam communicated the estimate to Mr Bhaskaran at the meeting. The prosecution also alleges that Mr Bhaskaran subsequently communicated the figure to the other defendants. Mr Shanmugaratnam, in a statement made to internal security department officers which was read to the court, denied deliberately leaking the figure to Mr Bhaskaran and colluding with him. Mr Bhaskaran, in a similar statement, said he had caught sight of the figure among papers Mr Shanmugaratnam had at the meeting and had subsequently concluded that it referred to second-quarter growth. Mr Daniel, in a statement read to the court, said he had published the estimate figure even though he knew it would violate the Official Secrets Act. Mr Daniel said he concluded that by not publishing the figure a false picture might be conveyed of the state of Singapore's economy. If found guilty each of the defendants faces a maximum of two years in jail or a SDollars 2,000 (Pounds 860) fine, or both. The trial is expected to go on for another two weeks.</p>

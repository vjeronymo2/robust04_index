			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY EMPLOYERS' WISH LIST ON WORKERS IS GOAL OF JOBS SURVEY;  </P> <P> EMPLOYMENT: ABOUT 750 BUSINESSES WILL RECEIVE QUESTIONNAIRES ON ENTRY-LEVEL,  SKILLED AND SEMISKILLED WORKERS IN THE FIRST SUCH STUDY.  </P> <P> They know that counter helpers at fast-food restaurants are in short supply and  will continue to be so, but they're no longer all that sure about electronics  assemblers.  </P> <P> So to find out -- and to gauge industry's wants and needs for entry-level,  skilled and semiskilled employees in Orange County for the next three years --  state and local employment officials are about to launch a countywide job  survey.  </P> <P> Initially, some 750 employers will receive the four-page questionnaires to be  mailed out within the next few weeks by the Private Industry Council of Orange  County, a job-training agency funded by both the state and federal governments.  </P> <P> If needed to achieve a 50% response rate for each of the survey's 25 employment  categories, up to 1,500 questionnaires might ultimately be sent out, according  to Eleanor Jordan, Orange County labor market analyst with the state Employment  Development Department. The EDD is co-sponsoring the survey with the Private  Industry Council.  </P> <P> The study, the first in what will be an annual survey program, seeks  information about jobs that Jordan and West described as mainly hourly  positions for which high school, trade school or two-year college diplomas are  the maximum educational requirement.  </P> <P> "We are concentrating in this first one on what are basically entry-level jobs  but which pay a living wage," Jordan explained.  </P> <P> "In later surveys," she added, "we might include more professional-level  occupations, or even some highly specialized job categories. In San Mateo  County, for example, they're doing their third survey and are seeking  information this year on jobs pertinent to the airline industry. That's because  they are close to San Francisco International Airport," and county job  officials suspect that there is a demand for airline industry-related  employment and employment training programs.  </P> <P> "Suspect" is the operative word in the survey program. Officials are using the  study in part to validate suspicions about which industry segments are on the  upswing and which are in decline.  </P> <P> In job-placement and employment-training circles in Orange County, for  instance, there "is a lot of disagreement about the electronics-assembly  industry and whether it is declining," said Margo West, the Private Industry  Council's survey coordinator.  </P> <P> "So that's one job category we want to make sure we ask about," she said.  </P> <P> Conversely, there has been so much publicity about the lack of skilled  secretaries and unskilled fast-food restaurant workers in the county that there  is not much need to ask employers about those types of jobs, Jordan said.  </P> <P> Included in the 25 types of jobs for which employers' hiring plans are being  solicited are bus drivers, auto mechanics, restaurant cooks, shipping clerks,  hotel desk clerks, medical and dental assistants, licensed vocational nurses,  computer operators, typists, sales representatives, carpenters and plumbers.  </P> <P> The survey asks employers how many of a particular type of employee they have  and how many they need; how they recruit and what they pay; how difficult it is  to find experienced applicants; what skills they would like applicants to have,  and what skills recently hired employees have lacked.  </P> <P> The survey also asks -- after assuring the employer that all answers are  confidential -- how many employees stay on the job for three years or more,  what kind of fringe benefits are offered, and whether employment in the  specific occupation is expected to grow or shrink over the next three years.  </P> <P> Once the questionnaires are returned, the data will be compiled and published  as the Orange County Labor Market Survey. The target date for publication "is  sometime in the fall . . . about the same time we start preparing the  questionnaires for the second survey," Jordan said.  </P> <P> The survey will provide schools, employers and training programs with  information about which jobs are in demand and which are not; about starting  wages; the chances for promotion and the types of fringe benefits available  within certain occupations, and about what skills are needed and which are  lacking.  </P> <P> The labor market survey is part of a $3.3-million statewide program, launched  in 1986 in San Mateo County, that ultimately will develop annual labor pool and  wage information for the 26 counties that account for 70% of the labor force in  the state, Jordan said.  </P> <P> So far, only seven counties have been surveyed and only two, Los Angeles and  San Diego, are in Southern California. Orange County currently is scheduled to  be the only other Southland county in the program.  </P> <P> LABOR MARKET INFORMATION PROGRAM  </P> <P> The state Employment Development Department plans to survey Orange County  businesses on their labor needs in certain job categories. The survey will seek  information on training and experience, employer requirements, job outlook,  wages and where the jobs are most needed. Among job categories to be included  in the survey are:  </P> <P> Automobile mechanics  </P> <P> Bus drivers  </P> <P> Cabinet makers  </P> <P> Computer operators  </P> <P> Cooks  </P> <P> Dental assistants  </P> <P> Hotel desk clerks  </P> <P> Licensed vocational nurses  </P> <P> Medical records technicians  </P> <P> Nurses, registered  </P> <P> Plumbers  </P> <P> Sales representatives  </P> <P> Shipping clerks  </P> <P> Source: State Employment Development Department  </P> <P> </P></p>

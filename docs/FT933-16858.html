			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse elects Jordan chief WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the troubled US conglomerate, yesterday named Mr Michael Jordan, a former head of international operations at drink and foods group PepsiCo, as its new chairman and chief executive. Westinghouse has been searching for a chief executive since January when Mr Paul Lego stepped down under pressure from the board and shareholders, dissatisfied at his progress in turning the company around. Yesterday's announcement followed boardroom divisions as to whether in-bred Westinghouse should appoint to the post Mr Howard Clark, a 36-year company veteran and acting chief executive, or seek a leader from outside. Mr Jordan indicated yesterday that he planned substantial changes, saying he saw 'the new Westinghouse as smaller, but strategically sound, less affected by business cycles and more competitive'. Westinghouse, with interests ranging from nuclear power plant to radio stations, has suffered particularly from severe losses on poor property investment by its financial services unit in the 1980s. He said it had made significant progress this year to resolve the financial services problems and added that he would be examining all the group's core businesses. Mr Jordan is joining Westinghouse from the New York private investment firm of Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, where he has been a partner since last year. Before that, he had worked since 1974 for PepsiCo, rising to be head of its international foods and beverages division. Between 1964 and 1974 he worked for McKinsey &amp; Co, the management consultants. His background in finance and consumer products contrasts with that of most Westinghouse chairmen, who have been closely involved in engineering, but Mr Jordan holds degrees in chemical engineering from Yale and Princeton universities and was certified as a nuclear engineer early in his career. Mr Clark will remain president of Westinghouse while the company's interim chairman, Mr Richard Morrow, will stay on the board.</p>

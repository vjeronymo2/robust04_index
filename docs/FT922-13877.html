			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (9): A time of reappraisal - Profile, Wharton AT THE end of a corridor in the Wharton School in Philadelphia hangs a photograph of Donald Trump, the financier who made his fortune in the 1980s and fell on harder times in the 1990s. Mr Trump is one of the alumni whose achievements are still celebrated. Those of another, the disgraced Michael Milken, are no longer so publicly applauded. Wharton's power was undisputed in the 1980s, and remains enormous. It is one of the three big US business schools that exert a tight grip on the world market in management education - the others being Stanford and Harvard. Among the three, Wharton's fortunes seem most bound to the past decade's explosion of interest in free market business and finance. The school was founded in 1881 by the Philadelphia financier Joseph Wharton. It is part of the University of Pennsylvania - established by Benjamin Franklin - yet its independent reputation and its financial strength set it apart among the university's graduate schools. It is often regarded with a mixture of awe and resentment by outsiders. This is a time of reappraisal and self-analysis for Wharton. Its reputation is as the best US finance school, and many of those who gained MBAs found easy rewards in the 1980s bull market. At the same time, the number and size of US business schools grew to the point where there is now over-capacity of up to 10 per cent on some estimates. So Wharton is attempting to redefine itself more in sympathy with the 1990s zeitgeist, while holding on to its traditional strengths. It is a tricky balancing act, symbolised most strongly by a new curriculum being tested out for the first time this year on 130 of the intake of 830 students paying Dollars 17,750 each a year to study for a two-year MBA. These are also nervous times for many of the MBA students. Jobs are not as easy to come by as they might have anticipated this year, and they came with high expectations of what they would get for their money. As at other business schools, there is a vociferous debate over the quality of the teaching, and whether the MBA education is still worthwhile. The man charged with steering this vast enterprise - with a faculty of 180 and a capital endowment of Dollars 98m Wharton is as much a large business as a university graduate school - along an uncharted course is Mr Thomas Gerrity, the dean. He has a vision of what Wharton should become, although he acknowledges that it is easier said than done. Mr Gerrity's view is that business schools should concentrate on giving leadership skills not only to MBA students, but to undergraduates and executives attending part-time courses. He thinks managers now have to be able to integrate approaches from operations or marketing or finance to solve a range of complex problems from early on in their careers. 'Managers now require great cognitive and analytical abilities, and enough of the craft of leadership to follow their ideas through and deliver actions,' he says. In practice, that presents a tall teaching order for an academic institution which has divided teaching into separate functional areas, and not bothered about blending ideas. Wharton's main response has been to establish its new curriculum, which tries to raise standards by adding a four-week preparatory course to the start of the first year, and offers a series of six-week module courses during the two semesters. The over-riding principle is a stronger emphasis on interdisciplinary study of business strategy. Those involved in the pilot curriculum say it had an uncertain start because it involved a different approach from a faculty which was used to the old ways. But some students now see benefits: Ms Andrea White, a first-year student, talks enthusiastically of professors from different disciplines debating business case studies in classes. Wharton is careful to distinguish its approach from that of Harvard Business School, known for using case studies and examples from business practice rather than emphasising econometric rigour. Mr Anthony Santomero, the deputy dean, says drily that Wharton uses case studies where it thinks them useful rather than as 'a religious endeavour'. But in the final analysis, Wharton may not be able to shape its destiny alone. The demand for its services will depend on the overall market for management education. Executive education is clearly booming - that side of Wharton's business brought in Dollars 16m revenue last year - but the MBA market is a more uncertain matter. Mr Gerrity professes little concern about Wharton, but says the future for US business schools depends on attracting a continuing stream of overseas recruits. Twenty-nine per cent of the MBA intake last year were foreign. For the moment, US schools hold as strong a market share in world business education as Detroit used to in the world car market. The dean does not believe this is likely to change rapidly, despite an inevitable growth in competition from Europe and south-east Asia. 'There will be more competition, but we are not going to see radical change overnight. This is not the software industry,' he says.

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: ICI considers Pakistan plant ICI is considering spending more than Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) on building a chemicals plant in Pakistan. The plant would increase ICI's manufacturing capacity in teraphthalic acid (PTA), used in the manufacture of polyester fibre, by one third and be the first such plant in Pakistan. The project has yet to receive the approval of ICI's board, a process which is likely to take several months. The investment would come from ICI Pakistan, the 61.5 per cent-owned subsidiary, which already produces polyester fibre, soda ash and other substances. The plant would have a capacity of 300,000 tonnes a year, compared with the 250,000 tonnes PTA plant ICI built two years ago in Taiwan. ICI said yesterday that the Pakistan market for PTA was growing at 15 per cent a year, currently satisfied entirely by imports. The PTA market is growing quickly around the world, with Amoco, the US petrochemicals company, the market leader. ICI said global PTA capacity was 9.4m tonnes a year, compared with 2.3m tonnes a year in 1980. The growth was the equivalent of two or three 'world scale plants' such as that proposed in Pakistan being built each year, said ICI.</p>

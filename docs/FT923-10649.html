			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Competitors battle 41' temperatures Sun-battered Olympic athletes appealed for more bottled water to combat dehydration as the heatwave continued. Most competitors have yet to see a cloud over the Catalan city since their arrival. Spectators at the claycourt tennis stadium said the courtside thermometer showed 41 degrees in early afternoon. A French bottled water company said it had shipped 100 extra cases of water to the US basketball team and 75 to the US volleyballers. Humidity adds to the problem: rooms in the athletes' village do not have air conditioning. Croat tennis player Goran Ivanisevic said it was like living in a sauna in his room and many athletes complain they cannot get to sleep until it cools down in the early hours of the morning. Pollution is increasing. From the hillside diving pool it is now hard to pick out the famous Sagrada Familia cathedral only 2.5km away because of smog. Temperatures are expected to fall gradually in the next few days.</p>

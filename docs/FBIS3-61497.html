M. </F> Nazarov, Global Climate and Ecology Institute, Russian Committee  for Hydrometeorology and Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC  556.535.8:551.583(47)]    [Abstract] A study was made of possible changes in river  pollution in zones of mixed and broadleaf forests, wooded steppe  and steppe in the European territory of Russia, the Baltic  states, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova for three global warming  scenarios. Water quality was evaluated using an index taking  into account the pollution of river waters, river runoff and the  type of water use. The most unfavorable situation with the  quality of river waters in the middle latitudes of the European  CIS and in the Baltic countries is anticipated with a global  warming of about 1.2C. A further warming, accompanied by an  increase in water runoff, should result in a considerable  improvement in water quality over almost the entire territory.  With a warming by 1.2C over an area of about 1 200 000  km[.sup]2[/] (46% of the total considered area) in which  at  the present time the norms are not impaired there will be a  worsening of the quality of river waters to 1.5-2.0 of the  maximum admissible concentration or more, which will cause  definite difficulties in the case of use of these resources for  drinking purposes. Further research must be centered on  predicting the influence exerted on water pollution by probable  changes in the intraannual distribution of runoff.

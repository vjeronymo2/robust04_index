			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kyrgyz </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday the people of Kyrgyzstan participated in  the nationwide referendum. Those who voted for President Akayev  voted for the new economic reform, for the future calm in the  republic, and for our prosperity. Medetbay Sherimkulov,  chairman of the Supreme Council, voted to express confidence in  Askar Akayev. Following is an interview Mr. Sherimkulov gave to  our correspondent:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr.  Sherimkulov, this January is a very memorable time for our  state. What would you like to say about the referendum?    [Sherimkulov] This is the first referendum since Kyrgyzstan  became an independent state. It is important because if the  nation expresses confidece in Askar Akayev his term of office  will last until 1996. It is not only showing confidence in  Akayev, but also giving the leadership an opportunity for  another two years to continue to implement the reform. If the  reform is implemented, we can move forward. It means we will  not reverse course or deviate from it. Frankly, we have spent  many years aspiring to build socialism and communism, and in the  final analysis what we have now is neither socialism nor  capitalism. But our aim is to bring good to the country. This  is a very important period for reforms. Frankly, we have many  problems in the economy. We have to bring our laws in line with  the process of reform. I want to repeat: Those who vote for  Akayev will give him additional time to implement these reforms.  Well, I know it is forbidden to campaign on referendum day  [laughs] but this is just my personal opinion. Frankly, our new  life and all aspirations are connected with the name of Askar  Akayev. Thank you. [end recording]</p>

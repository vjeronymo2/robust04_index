[passage omitted]    Gao Dezhan said: Upon the arrival of the Spring Festival,  representatives of the model workers of the municipality  gathered together to suggest ways and means for Tianjin's  development. This is a meaningful thing. Today's forum is a  meeting at which municipal leading persons and model workers  held heart-to-heart talks. The model workers made many good  opinions and suggestions. We will conscientiously accept their  opinions and suggestions. The municipality's working class,  particularly its model workers, has made great contributions.  On behalf of the municipal party committee and government, I  express my heartfelt thanks to the model workers and the working  class in the municipality. Gao Dezhan said: The year 1994 is a  key year to promote Tianjin's reform, opening up, and  modernization. Therefore, all work of the municipality should  be submitted to and serve the overall situation of grasping  favorable opportunities to deepen reform, expand the scale of  opening up, promote development, and maintain stability. We  should speed up the setup of the socialist market economic  system; maintain a sustained, fast, and sound development of the  national economy; safeguard political stability; comprehensively  promote social progress; and make key headway in various  undertakings.    Gao Dezhan stressed: To realize the 1994 work targets, we  should grasp the following few tasks. First, the party and  government leaders should think for the masses, do everything  for the masses, and rely on the masses to do their work. It is  necessary to deepen reform, develop production, improve  management, increase economic results, and ceaselessly increase  the income of the staff and workers. Enterprises with good  economic achievements should create more real benefits for the  staff and workers. The enterprises that have taken a turn for  the better from the strained circumstances should solve more  difficulties for their staff and workers. Second, we should  enliven enterprises, particularly state-owned large and  medium-sized enterprises. Only when enterprises are well  enlivened will Tianjin be able to become prosperous. Only when  enterprises are well developed will Tianjin be able to make  developments. So, we must not only do concrete deeds for the  masses but also positively do concrete deeds for enterprises.  All departments and fronts should make contributions to  enlivening enterprises. Third, we should foster the idea of  relying on reform to promote development. Enterprises should  exert great efforts to deepen reform. Fourth, we should persist  in the principle of taking a two- hand approach and being sure  that both hands are tough and accurately handle the relationship  between reform, development, and stability. We should  strengthen spiritual civilization, the ideological and political  work, and the improvement of social order so as to create good  conditions for reform, opening up, and economic development. In  the new year, we should wholeheartedly rely on the working  class, pool the joint efforts of all people of the municipality,  and unite with the people to capture a bigger success in reform,  opening up, and modernization.

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: UAPT holders urged to accept lower offer UAPT-Infolink yesterday wrote to shareholders urging them to accept the lower of two concurrent takeover offers, to avoid the risk of a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, writes Simon Davies. UAPT has become the target of the attentions of two US credit information groups, and has taken the unusual step of recommending shareholders to take 550p from Trans Union, instead of 600p from Equifax. The rationale for the advice is that although a 500p offer from Equifax was originally recommended, the bid is conditional upon their being no referral to the MMC, due to Equifax's position as a UK competitor of UAPT. The board argues that shareholders who accept the higher offer could risk the removal of Trans Union's offer and then the lapsing of Equifax's, due to a referral. UAPT has been backed in its decision by Sir Gordon Borrie, a non-executive director of UAPT who is also a former Director General of the Office of Fair Trading, which makes the decision on referrals. The OFT is unlikely to make a verdict for several weeks, and the Trans Union bid will lapse on August 31.</p>

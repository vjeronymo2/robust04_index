			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / MMM reopens for business The Moscow offices of the MMM investment fund reopened yesterday to queues of prospective investors despite the collapse in its share price last month and government warnings that its new 'tickets' were not valid stocks. The tickets are not officially registered as shares and thus the government, which warned potential investors that they would be buying nothing more than 'pretty postcards', has few legal means to prevent their sale. The MMM offices had been closed since August 4, when tax police arrested Mr Mavrodi on charges of tax evasion. Mr Mavrodi reversed the decision to close the branches last week in an order issued from his prison cell. The 10,000 Russians who have signed up to buy the tickets are making a questionable investment. The tickets are being sold for Rbs 1,515 each on the strength of the MMM fund's promise to at some unspecified date redeem the tickets for MMM shares at a rate of 100 tickets per share. Ticket buyers are thus gambling that MMM shares will eventually rise to a value of Rbs151,500 each. On the informal black market which has developed on the pavements outside MMM branches in Moscow, shares are selling for up to Rbs9,000 and MMM tickets are unofficially changing hands at Rbs3,000 each.</p>

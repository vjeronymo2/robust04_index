			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Cross Harbour Tunnel plans HKDollars 830m rights THE Cross Harbour Tunnel Company (CHT) plans to raise HKDollars 830m (USDollars 107m) from a one-for-two rights issue at HKDollars 13 a share to fund construction of Hong Kong's new Western Harbour tunnel, which received approval from China in June. It is the first private financing for a core project in Hong Kong's HKDollars 165bn airport development programme. CHT has a 37 per cent interest in the Western Tunnel, with Chinese partners Citic and China Merchants. The rights offer is being made at a 35 per cent discount to last night's closing price of HKDollars 20.10 per share. The Wharf Group, which owns 27 per cent of CHT, has agreed to take up its share of entitlements in the issue. The new tunnel is estimated to cost HKDollars 7.5bn and must be completed by August 1997 since it will link with the expressway leading to Chek Lap Kok airport. The airport is due to open in mid-1997. CHT will inject HKDollars 922m in equity into the project and additional loan finance is being finalised. The company constructed the first tunnel to link Hong Kong island with the Kowloon peninsula. It was launched on a 30-year operating franchise and reverts to the government in August 1999. It also owns 70 per cent of the highly profitable Hong Kong School of Motoring, but the company's main income in the future will come from the new tunnel. The franchise for the Western crossing has been described by some politicians as overly favourable to the operators, who are guaranteed toll increases giving a minimum return on equity of 15 per cent.</p>

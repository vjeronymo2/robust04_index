			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (5): Not so cosy as it was - The banking sector The advent of Europe's single market, together with domestic reforms to adjust to it, have forced Belgium's traditionally cosy banking system to take a cold look at itself. But the changes set in train are 'creeping and discreet', as Mr Georges Martin, head of the research department at the Association Belge des Banques (ABB), puts it. The trend is not so much to seek the protection and weight of mergers and alliances as to look ruthlessly at items such as costs, asset and liability management, new sources of income, pricing, and improved risk management and provisioning. Such alliances as are beginning to emerge - or be mooted - in response to competition between the biggest players. They normally take the form of setting up Bancassurance or Allfinanz groups, selling banking and insurance products. Almost no one in the sector foresees large-scale mergers. The larger players are too like each other, attempting to provide a universal banking service strongly rooted in the Belgian (or at most the supra-regional) market, encompassing the Benelux countries and bits of France and Germany. The entry of more aggressive outsiders such as Credit Lyonnais, offering higher interest rates, has shaken some of the complacency. But there is little sign of any significant restructuring of the sector as a result. Competition in the Belgian banking sector is not new, but it is growing. There are now 90 banks - only 23 of them with a majority Belgian interest - as well as a clutch of powerful private savings banks and public credit institutions providing the most dense branch network in Europe. Top of the league in consolidated balance sheet terms are the Big Three private commercial banks: Generale de Banque, Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), and Kredietbank. These are closely trailed by Credit Communal, jointly owned by all Belgium's provinces and municipalities, and ASLK-CGER, the state-owned savings bank which has been recently half privatised. Until the end of the 1980s, banks in Belgium could rely on earning high bond yields from a government already well-launched into a serious public indebtedness problem (see article on bonds), while paying out relatively low interest on a very high stock of private savings, big chunks of which were regulated. Belgium's savings profile was and remains an important part of the rationale behind maintaining a branch network which would raise boardroom eyebrows elsewhere. At the end of 1991, net household savings in Belgium as a portion of disposable income was 17 per cent. This is a ratio even higher even than 14.6 per cent in Japan; 12.6 per cent in Germany; 9.8 per cent (for gross household savings) in the UK; 4.9 per cent in the US. Between a quarter and a third of these deposits, depending on the type of credit institution, were remunerated at a low fixed net interest rate. These accounts, originally designed to fund low-cost public housing, were attractive to savers because in exchange they were exempted from a stiff withholding tax. The number of branches climbed to nearly 9,000, raising the number of accounts per 100 inhabitants from 26.5 in 1965 to 97.9 in 1991. Belgium, not a sparsely populated country, now provides a branch for every 742 inhabitants against, say, one for every 1,839 people in the Netherlands or one for every 1,385 people in the UK. Belgian bankers, in the main, resist suggestions that this is over-branching, much less overstaffing. Each branch employs between a third and a quarter of the staff numbers common in Europe, and banks have invested heavily in automation. Since 1980, total staff costs have nearly doubled - but ABB figures show that net profit in the sector as a whole has more than quadrupled. Increased branching has gone hand in hand with increased competition. One leading economist in the sector underlines the point that judgment of risk is more accurate at this grass-roots level, and that, for the Big Three as much as the savings banks, a strong domestic base is essential. Mr Eric Pollefliet, head of Kredietbank's information department, says: 'We want to be a universal bank in the Belgian market, and to do that you have to present in every village.' Nevertheless, deregulation at European and domestic level is forcing changes. The government's 1990 decision to slash withholding tax from 25 to 10 per cent has sucked savings back into Belgium from tax havens such as neighbouring Luxembourg, but it has also sharply reduced the pool of cheap regulated deposits. As a portion of all deposits, the latter have fallen from 24.8 per cent in 1980 to 13.2 per cent in 1992 for the banks, and from 46 per cent to 28.8 per cent over the same period for private savings banks. At the same time as this big shift from low to high-yielding deposits, the government is aggressively repricing large chunks of its debt, moving it into longer-term bonds, and eating into bank margins. Most banks are now expecting to get about a tenth of their earnings from financing the government, against nearly a third barely five years ago. Interest margins overall have declined sharply, from an average 3.2 per cent in 1970 to 1.4 per cent in 1992. This goes well beyond similar slides across the European Union, where the average remains 2.1 per cent. As a result, there is new emphasis on cutting costs, on profitability, and on boosting capital ratios to ease access to cheaper working funds. Costs across the sector have dropped from 76 per cent of net earnings in 1980 to 66 per cent last year. Despite the recession, all three big banks reported double digit increases in consolidated net profits for the first half of this year. Most banks have opted to consolidate a strong domestic customer base (where margins are higher, partly because of generalised repricing of credit and new charges on customers), and to generate more non-retail income in areas opened up by deregulation (although margins are keener). Most institutions are developing a sizeable fee earning base in equity dealing (some 20 brokers are now linked to banks); in foreign exchange transactions; in swaps and futures; in new products like Sicavs (a kind of unit trust); and most visibly in insurance. CGER, for example, surprised the market by consolidating its bancassurance strategy through a link-up with Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group. It has bought half the savings group's equity. The move contrasts with unconsummated attempts by bigger players to establish supra-regional financial services groups: Generale de Banque's proposed link up with Amro of the Netherlands foundered in 1989, while BBL abandoned advanced discussions last year to ally with Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance company. BBL has since opted to pursue insurance links with Royale Belge of Belgium, and Winterthur of Switzerland. Kredietbank has its own insurance division. In the rest of the sector, the Government's privatisation programme could produce new partnerships, on the CGER-Fortis model. Mr Martin of ABB argues: 'What we've seen with CGER could happen with others, drawing in not only the Belgian private sector, but foreign (credit and insurance) institutions too.'  --------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD RANKINGS OF BELGIAN CREDIT INSTITUTIONS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                               Consolidated                              balance sheet   Capital &amp;   Net pre-tax Institution                          local    reserves       profits  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Generale de Banque                      73         100            84 BBL Bank Brussels Lambert               90         146           189 Kredietbank                             97         129           115 Gemeetekrediet-Credit Communal          98         220           213 ASLK-CGER Bank                         108         192           322 CERA Savings Bank                      213         190           374 BACOB Savings Bank                     245         301           554 National Industrial Credit Co          269         594           793 Anhyp Savings Bank                     451         437           597 Ippa Bank                              479         786           747  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The Banker, July 1992: the Top 1,000, worldwide  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON OF HOUSEHOLD SAVINGS RATIOS 1 IN %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                1980    1985    1989    1990    1991  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium        16.2    11.5    14.4    15.1    17.0 Italy2         21.6    18.0    14.4    16.1    15.6 Japan          17.9    15.6    14.2    14.1    14.6 Austria        10.4     8.3    12.5    13.3    12.8 Germany        13.0    11.4    12.5    12.4    12.6 France2        17.6    14.0    11.6    12.2    12.6 Switzerland     3.3     5.7    11.2    12.0    12.5 UK2            13.3    10.6     7.1     8.3      .8 US              8.1     6.6     4.7     4.5     4.9 Sweden          4.8     1.7    -3.8    -1.2     1.9 Netherlands     0.7     2.0     4.2     6.5     0.6  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Belgian Bankers Association.

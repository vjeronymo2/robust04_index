			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister </F> Oleksandr Makarenko by Yuliya Mostovaya; place and date not  given: "Reforms, Reforms, and Once Again Reforms"]    [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko initialed  an agreement "On Partnership and Cooperation With the European  Union [EU]" in Brussels today. Ukraine thereby became the first  CIS state to initial this document with the EU.    What we have managed to do so far, said Deputy Foreign  Minister Oleksandr Danilovich Makarenko after returning from  Brussels, even according to their estimates, represents a  revolutionary breakthrough. The point is that formally this is  an agreement "On Partnership and Cooperation With the EU," while  in essence this is an agreement on associate membership in the  EU. Similar agreements have been signed with Poland, Hungary,  the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. The difference between our  agreement and their's is that their negotiations on setting up a  free-trade zone with the EU will be finished in eight years,  while similar negotiations with Ukraine will begin on 31  December 1998.    Nevertheless, according to Oleksandr Danilovich, all  quantitative and qualitative restrictions on trade between  Ukraine and the EU have been lifted. Though there are some  exceptions on a group of goods including textiles, metals, and  nuclear material. These restrictions will be valid until 31  December 1998, and they will later be rescinded. It is up to us  how far we should be able to move forward in signing separate  accords. Negotiations on agreements for textiles and metals are  approaching their conclusion, and we believe that we will  conclude them in the immediate future.    [Mostovaya] However, Oleksandr Danilovich, the export of  metals is of a priority for Ukraine....    [Makarenko] You are right. However, Europe has never been a  priority market for selling our metal. There are other markets  in the world, and they are rather vast. I refer of course to  the states of Southeast Asia, where we could export 3-4 million  tonnes of steel a year. [end Makarenko]    Next, Oleksandr Danilovich said that the document was  initialed after four rounds of talks, the first of which was  held in March of last year and the last one -- in March of this  year. Russia has already held eight rounds of talks, but the  text of the agreement is not yet ready. At the same time, we  have managed to enlarge the scope of our mandate. Moreover, the  preamble states that the EU supports the sovereignty and  territorial integrity of Ukraine because this will promote  stability in both Central and East Europe, and on the continent  in general. This represents very valuable and timely political  support from the states of West Europe. By the way, the clause  on political consultations between the EU and Ukraine has been  considerably expanded. All disagreements over mutual  cooperation in transportation and sea navigation have been  surmounted.    It is impossible to overestimate the importance of  initialing  this document, said O. Makarenko. We managed to refute the  viewpoint of those who were skeptical about cooperation with the  EU, as well as Europe's interest in cooperating with us. We  have many such people, including those at the top. The fact  that this agreement was initialed in its present form gives us  the answer to the question: Where should Ukraine move? Toward  our past in the East, or our future in the West? We are facing  a choice: Either to speed up reforms and take advantage of the  West's proposal, which opened its doors to us, or forget about  this agreement, put it aside, face the East and move eastward.  In my opinion, there are strategical and tactical issues that  cannot be confused. From a strategical point of view, Ukraine  is by all means a European state. Therefore, according to the  Rome Declaration, it has every reason to unite with free and  democratic Europe. We understand that this is a lengthy and  difficult path, but we have to do it. When Franco died in  Spain, nobody thought that Spain would ever become an EU  member.... From the viewpoint of tactics and the survival of  our state, we should restore economic relations with Russia.  However, our goal should be staunch.    [Mostovaya] Do you think that Ukraine -- stemming from  tactical considerations -- should sign the CIS economic pact?    [Makarenko] I participated in every round of negotiations on  this issue. The Foreign Ministry and I are convinced that  Ukraine should become an associate CIS member, because full  membership would delay our EU membership.    [Mostovaya] Well, in general, can Russia let Ukraine out of  its sphere of influence?    [Makarenko] Everything depends on how strong willed we are,  on how a new government will be committed to our sovereignty and  independence. We should think about this already today, on the  eve of Supreme Council elections, because a voter should decide  with what he is concerned: Either go forward toward Europe or  backward toward the empire.</p>

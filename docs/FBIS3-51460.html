On behalf of the commander in chief, the  Central Committee, the government, and on his own behalf, Raul  Castro thanked the people for what they have done, and continue  to do, in the defense of the fatherland. Manuel Menendez  Castellanos, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in  Cienfuegos, summarized today's events. He said that the central  territory surpassed its tunnel digging plan by 105 percent.  During the event, the five most outstanding municipal general  staffs in the area received awards. These municipalities are:  Jovellanos, Matanzas Province; Camajuani, Villa Clara Province;  Cumanayagua, Cienfuegos Province; Yaguajay, Sancti Spiritus  Province; and Majagua, Ciego de Avila Province.    During his visit to Cienfuegos, Army Gen. Raul Castro said  that the result of the work done represents tons of sweat of  millions of combatants, militiamen, and members of the  production and defense brigades. In statements to Radio Reloj,  Raul said that despite the situation confronted by the country,  the men and women who make up the Army are aware that the sole  goal of their effort is to prepare for war and to avoid war.  Raul Castro described today's event, which was held in an area  near the Jaime Gonzalez Airport, as one filled with emotion,  patriotic, profound, and revolutionary. Following the event,  Raul attended a meeting at the Camilo Cienfuegos Military  School, where the participants discussed the results of the  Central Army's 1993 defense training and the guidelines for 1994.    [Havana Radio Rebelde in Spanish at 1800 GMT on 14 January  carries a similar report, but adds that Division General Joaquin  Sola, chief of the Central Army, also attended the event.]</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OTHERS CONSIDER RUNNING;  </P> <P> LARKIN SAYS HE'S IN RACE FOR CATHIE WRIGHT'S SEAT  </P> <P> Bob Larkin, a longtime Republican activist and former Simi Valley Chamber of  Commerce president, announced Friday that he has decided to oppose beleaguered  Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) in the 1990 primary.  </P> <P> "I've decided that I think there's enough support to start a good, hard  campaign," said Larkin, who owns a State Farm Life Insurance Co. agency. "I'm  in it for the long haul."  </P> <P> Larkin, 52, first vice chairman of the Ventura County Republican Central  Committee, filed papers earlier this month to run, but he said he had not made  a final decision. He said Friday that he has recruited volunteers, raised  $1,000 in small contributions and plans to lease a campaign office in Simi  Valley next week.  </P> <P> Spurred by controversy surrounding Wright, at least two other well-connected  Republicans are said to be weighing possible candidacies in her sprawling 37th  Assembly District, which includes parts of Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa  Barbara counties.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seeking Support  </P> <P> Robert Wilcox, a former aide to Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette  (R-Northridge), is openly courting support. Hunt Braly, administrative  assistant to state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), is also exploring a potential  primary bid, according to Larkin and another Republican activist.  </P> <P> Wright angered Republican Assembly colleagues in December when she abstained  from a vote to oust Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). Most of her  colleagues voted for Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier), one of five  insurgent Democrats who had challenged Brown's leadership. Wright said she had  promised constituents that she would not vote for any Democrat for speaker.  </P> <P> In addition, Ventura County District Attorney Michael D. Bradbury's office is  completing its investigation into reports that Wright improperly sought to use  her clout with judges, the Simi Valley Police Department and the state  Department of Motor Vehicles to keep her frequently ticketed daughter,  Victoria, from losing her driver's license or incurring other penalties.  </P> <P> Bradbury is expected to issue his report in early May.  </P> <P> Victoria Wright, who has received 27 traffic tickets since 1981, lost her  license March 9. She is serving a 30-day jail term in the Ventura County work  furlough program for violating conditions of her probation for a traffic  offense.  </P> <P> Cathie Wright, who has refused comment pending the release of Bradbury's  report, could not be reached Friday.  </P></p>

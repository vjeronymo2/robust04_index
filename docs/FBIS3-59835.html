			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] A survey conducted by the  Ministry of Labor in 1993 showed that the number of Thai workers  in Saudi Arabia has declined from 200-300,000 to only 50,000.  There are fewer than 3,000 Thai workers in other Middle East  countries. But there are still more than 20,000 Thai workers in  Libya, which means that among Arab countries, Libya has the  second largest number of Thai workers.    Of the more than 20,000 Thais working in Libya, statistics  on  those sent between 1990 and the present show that almost 13,000  are employed by the Dong A Consortium, a Korean contractor. This  is the single largest source of employment for Thais in Libya.  The second largest employs only 1,750 Thais. To date, 34 groups  of Thai workers have been sent to work for the Dong A Company,  with each group consisting of approximately 400-500 workers.    Thus, the Dong A Consortium is a giant for Thai workers in  Libya. This company has won the bid to build a man-made river  for the Libyan government. This is Libya's largest investment  project, which calls for laying pipeline to transport water from  large underground reservoirs in the desert for use by  communities located along the coast. About 40 percent of the  Dong A employees are from Taiwan, and 60 percent are from  Thailand.    Because Thailand and Libya do not have diplomatic relations,  in the past workers who wanted to go work in Libya had to obtain  a visa from the Libyan embassy in Malaysia and then fly to  Tripoli, the capital of Libya. When countries halted air service  to Libya because of the conflict between Libya and the United  States, travel became even more difficult. Now, people must  first travel to a neighboring country and then enter the  country. For example, one route is to travel from Bangkok to  Egypt and then take a bus from Egypt to Libya, which takes 30  hours. Dong A, which has sent many Thai workers to Libya, uses  this route. This is because the construction project is located  in eastern Libya near Egypt.    A second route is from Bangkok to Malta. From there, people  can take a boat to Tunisia, which borders the northwestern  region of Libya and which is near Tripoli. Even though these  long routes pose an obstacle, the profits waiting there are very  attractive.    The first project in the eastern region of Libya was  completed last year. And 3 years ago, Libya launched a second  8-year project in the western part of the country. Libya has  invested more than $8 billion in these two projects. Thai  workers will build the "eighth wonder of the world" as this is  called by Colonel Muammar Qadhdhafi.    The fact that more than 20,000 Thais are now working in  Libya  shows the effort that they are making to earn a living and enjoy  a secure life. Their skills and qualities are greatly  appreciated by the companies that employ them. An official of  the Dong A Company said that it can be said that these projects  are the work of Thais alone. Those who employ Thai workers are  very satisfied with them as compared with workers from other  countries. A driver is paid about $335. If he works 3 hours a  day overtime, he can earn about 12,883 baht a month. The  companies provide free room and board near the work site.    "Workers can save a minimum of 100,000 baht a year. The  employment agencies charge each worker a fee of 40,000 baht."    In view of the fact that Dong A is a large employer of  foreign workers and that it employees mostly Thais, there are  several employment agencies that seek to place workers. These  include the PPP Construction Employment Company, the BPB  International Company, and the Khuta Company. An employment  agency news source said that the managing director of the BPB  International Company is a South Korean and so there is a close  relationship. Also, the Thai shareholder is a close relative of  Mr. Kittisak Hatthasongkhro, a Thai Nation Party MP [member of  parliament] from Udon Thani Province.    The minimum wage paid is $240-250 a month, and there are  benefits. This is very attractive to Thais hoping to strike it  rich in the desert--something they have little hope of doing at  home.    Now that this conflict has arisen, those engaged in sending  Thai workers to Libya, who stand to be affected the most by  this, have expressed great concern. Madam Kim, the managing  director of the BPB International Company, said that  preparations have been made to send another 100 workers. But  they can't be sent because the Thai government has prohibited  this. Actually, the Thai workers there are helping to build up  Libya. In particular, the man-made river project must proceed.  If Libya does expel Thai workers, those working for the Dong A  will probably be the last to leave. The problem is, the "Thai  government likes to interfere, which just causes problems."    A news source from the Khuta Employment Company Ltd said  that  Libya is now starting to employ workers from Vietnam and the  Philippines instead. It is the government that has created the  problem, but it is the workers who must suffer the consequences.  Quick action must be taken to solve this problem. "Actually,  Libya wants Thai workers, because they are even more skilled  that the Koreans and it is their company. This is clear from the  fact that the salaries paid to Thai workers are second only to  what the Koreans get. Also, they are given annual bonuses and  raises." The salaries of these workers are higher than those in  Thailand who have a master's degree. Also, they get room and  board. Most are drivers, blacksmiths, plasterers, and laborers.    Thailand is on the horns of a dilemma. Whichever way it  turns, it could get hurt. The government has done things in a  very "noisy" way. This has been the case even though Letter  NR0504/1419 signed by General Charan Kunlawanit, the secretary  general of the National Security Council, summarized the  problems and said that Thailand should take action against those  private companies said to be involved with the chemical weapons  plant in Libya. But the letter stressed that things should be  done very carefully, because this is a very delicate issue.    Police officials, however, have done things in a very  "noisy"  manner, apparently wanting the United States to see what they  have done, even though they could have done things quietly.    Prior to this, officials had been negotiating with Libyan  officials in an attempt to remove about 200 Thai workers from  the Libyan plant said to be a chemical weapons plant. Thai  officials cited the agreement signed by Thailand that prohibits  chemical weapons. A regulation that will prohibit Thai workers  from working at weapons plants is now being drafted. Libya has  been monitoring all of this, because these things are in line  with the pressure now being exerted by the United States,  Libya's enemy. [passage omitted]    From another angle, the companies that send workers abroad  are pressuring the government to solve this problem. The fact  that officials are licking the ass of the United States may stem  from pressures having to do with trade problems between Thailand  and the United States. The United States frequently likes to use  the GSP issue as a bargaining chip. What this means is that the  government gives greater weight to exporters than to those who  send workers abroad or to Thai workers who are trying to making  a living abroad. There is a good chance that the second largest  labor market in the Arab bloc will soon shut down completely.  <H3>  The Man-Made River Project, Water Conduit or Underground  Weapons Plant? </H3>   The collision between Libya and the United States over the  terrorists responsible for the bombing of the Pan American Jet  has affected Thailand. The Thai engineer who owns a construction  contracting company in Chiang Mai was arrested on charges of  sending workers abroad illegally. But there are are rumors that  he designed an underground tunnel in Libya for use as an  underground chemical weapons plant. This has apparently made  Qadhdhafi so angry that he has ordered the expulsion of the more  than 20,000 Thai workers from Libya.    The matter of the underground tunnel is very confusing. Some  people say that this is an air raid shelter. Others say that it  can be modified for use as an underground weapons production  plant. And some say that it is a water conduit that is part of  the man-made river project.    "The man-made river project, or plant to produce huge water  pipes for the project (Berka plant), is 1.4 million square  meters in size. The plant produces pipes with a diameter of 4  meters and a length of 7.5 meters.    Concerning Libya's "Great Man Made River Project, documents  compiled by Dong A official Udon Chanthawan, and a document  entitled "The River of Life" prepared by Libyan officials state  that the purpose of this project is to defeat the dry natural  conditions of the Sahara desert. The goal is to transform this  desert into a green agricultural zone. [passage omitted]    Thus, this huge project to pipe water from the middle of the  desert to communities in the north is in form similar to a  man-made river. Altogether, there are five projects:    1. The Al-Sarin-Sidra and Qaslr Benghazi lines.    2. The western Jamahiriyah-Tripoli line.    3. The line connecting Kufra with the headwaters of a river.    4. Ajdabiya-Tubruq.    5. The Sidra line, which follows the coast to Tripoli.  [passage omitted]    Building these five projects will require a huge sum of  money. The first project alone cost $3.27 billion, or more than  80 billion baht, to build. Almost 2,000 km of pipe with a  diameter of 4 meters had to be laid through the desert. It took  9 years to complete this project. A total of 1 million cubic  meters of water flows through this pipeline each day.    The second project, which is being built by the Dong A  Consortium, will cost $4.6324 billion. About 2 million cubic  meters of water a day will flow through this pipeline. This  project will consist of 283 km of iron pipe and 1,240 km of  concrete pipe and will take 8 years to build.    The man-made river project has not yet been completed. But  much experience and knowledge about underground work has been  gained from building an underground tunnel in different  topographical conditions. A tunnel with a diameter of 4 meters  is large enough for a vehicle to drive through. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Bargaining shift triggers increase in personnel managers THE NUMBER of personnel managers has more than doubled in the past 10 years because of the shift from national to plant-level bargaining, and about half of the total are women. Membership of the Institute of Personnel Management, the main professional body for personnel managers, has grown from 20,000 to more than 47,000 over the past decade. During the past six years the organisation's membership has grown steadily at 10 per cent a year. Not all personnel managers are members of the institute, but Mr Leslie Walford, an institute official, said that between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of them were thought to belong to the organisation. Mr Walford said that one important cause of the growth in membership was the devolution of a wide range of industrial relations issues, including pay, from national and company level to plant level. In the past, pay negotiations in large companies may have been handled by two or three people at head office. But separate negotiations are now often conducted at each plant with a corresponding increase in the number of managers required. Mr Walford said another reason for the expansion of the personnel function was increasing specialisation in subjects such as pensions. The most commercially aggressive organisations employ the most personnel managers, with the ratio of personnel managers to employees three times higher in the private sector than the public sector, according to a study by Chater Associates Management Consultants, an Oxford-based consultancy. The CAMC study, of more than 150 organisations shows that there are 280 employees per personnel manager in the public sector and only 109 in the private sector. Within the public sector, health authorities have a higher-than-average ratio of one personnel manager to every 237 staff. In the private sector retailers are below average with 164 employees per personnel manager. Japanese-owned enterprises are way above average with a personnel manager for every 62 employees. 'An organisation top heavy with personnel specialists is not necessarily an inefficient one,' the study says. Chater Associates Management Consultants, 1 Ickleton Road, Wantage, Oxon. OX12 9JA.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eduardo Carrillo in Juanchacho, Valle Department] </F>   [Excerpts] Colombian military engineers, rather than U.S.  Army engineers, are building the airport in Juanchaco with a  clear vision of progress, wholly convinced of the national and  international projection of the challenges the Pacific region  faces for the year 2000.    Admiral Jose Ignacio Rozo Carvajal, commander of the Pacific  Naval Force, has said, given the Navy's insistence and the  decision by local authorities, Inter-Administrative Agreement  No. 350 was signed on 17 August 1993 between the Valle del Cauca  Department Governorate and the Defense Ministry.    He explained that on 29 and 30 October 1993 the ARC  [Republic  of Colombia Navy] landing craft "Bahia Solano," which belongs to  the Pacific Naval Force, carried materiel, equipment, and a  scouting detachment for the construction of a camp, which would  precede the construction of an airport.    The Army Engineering Corps appointed the Codazzi Battalion  to  build the airport.    Military engineers believe the work to repair and extend the  runway will be completed by late April, while the Valle del  Cauca Governorate is in charge of building the control tower,  passenger terminal, and access roads.    The only access road to the airport consisted of a dirt road  that the U.S. soldiers have patiently turned into a highway so  they could proceed with the construction of a school and health  center. [passage omitted]    Admiral Rozo Carvajal has explained the presence of the U.S.  Forces has made it necessary to double security measures not  only in Bahia Malaga but also in Juanchaco, Ladrilleros, and  neighboring areas to prevent any problems.    "Security measures were increased to provide protection to  the Colombian military engineers in charge of building the  airport and the North Americans who are building a school and  health center," he has said. [passage omitted]    Admiral Rozo Carvajal has said he "would be the first to  notify superiors if anything exceeds the framework foreseen with  the U.S. military engineers. I must notify them, and that is  how it should be."    He has reasserted the Bahia Malaga Naval Base has  regulations, an internal system, and the U.S. forces involved in  "Fuertes Caminos 94" were instructed on what they could do.    "We control the speed of vehicles, the way they are parked,  the notices and reports when the "Runnymede," a craft used to  transport personnel and machinery, will be mobilized, when  helicopter support is given, and other measures," added Jose  Ignacio Rozo Carvajal, commander of the Pacific Naval Force.</p>

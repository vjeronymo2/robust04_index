			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Tiphook finance director resigns MR RODGER Braidwood has resigned as finance director of Tiphook, the container leasing and transport rental group which last month revealed pre-tax losses of Pounds 21.8m for the year to April. He is to receive compensation totalling less than one year's salary, which was more than Pounds 500,000 according to the 1992 annual report, although he had a three-year contract. Tiphook shares fell 2p to 242p. The company blamed last year's loss on a Pounds 77.3m charge following changes in accounting policies. The charge covered, among other things, foreign exchange hedging losses, losses on interest rate swaps and costs related to redemption of preference shares. Tiphook said yesterday that Mr Braidwood's departure was 'amicable'. He is abroad on holiday. His replacement is Mr Andrew Chandler, 36, the financial controller who joined the group in 1990. Tiphook conceded that Mr Chandler was not well known to shareholders, but said its banks knew him well. Tiphook also confirmed that Mr Rupert Hambro, a non-executive director, would become a non-executive deputy chairman, and that he would chair the audit and remuneration committees. A review of salaries and incentive payments to directors was in hand, and directors' salaries would be cut this year. More non-executive directors from outside the UK would be recruited 'in due course'. The group said it was committed to 'stronger financial controls' and that it had 'adequate funding for its current needs'. There has been speculation that its burden of Pounds 1bn debt could lead to an equity issue. One lender to the group said the announcement of board changes was 'an appropriate step'. He said that it could be hard to achieve the right balance between entrepreneurial flair and strong business management in a company like Tiphook. Lex, Page 18; Observer, Page 17</p>

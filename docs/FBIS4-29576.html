			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NHK News 9" program] </F>   [Text] The Japanese Government's reaction to North-South  Korean summit talks follows:    [Video shows Foreign Minister Kakizawa speaking into a  microphone at an unidentified location] [begin Kakizawa  recording] Japan hopes that both North and South Korea will work  for a peaceful settlement to the North Korean nuclear issue. An  opportunity has been created wherein the two Koreas will hold  summit talks, and this development is in accord with Japan's  hopes. In that sense, I welcome the North-South summit talks.    I believe it is important for North Korea to clear up  suspicions about its development of nuclear weapons by allowing  the IAEA to conduct inspections of its nuclear facilities. I  hope that the two Koreas will discuss the North Korean nuclear  issue at the North- South summit talks. [end recording]    Foreign Minister Kakizawa also stated Japan would do what it  can do to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue through  dialogue.</p>

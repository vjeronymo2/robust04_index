			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Study points to high cost of new cars in EC EUROPEAN car buyers are paying as much as 30 per cent more for new cars than consumers in the US and in Japan, according to a study by Ludvigsen Associates, the UK-based automotive analysts. Ludvigsen Associates, which carried out the controversial basic research for the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into pan-European car pricing, claims that 'the European car buyer is spending more than he should for personal transportation', both in absolute terms and in relation to household income. The report is the first co-ordinated attempt to compare car prices between Europe and the other main world markets, the US and Japan. According to the study, the largest differences are with car prices in Japan. It claims that European car prices (net of tax) are 33 to 43 per cent higher than equivalent prices in Japan, while European prices are 15 to 45 per cent higher than in the US. On average it takes 27 weeks of gross family income for a European to buy a car compared with 21 weeks in America and 15 weeks in Japan. The UK is at the European average, while the Germans, French and Belgians need four weeks less. The Ludvigsen report is likely to re-ignite the vexed debate over car makers' pan-European pricing policies and the wide disparities between car prices across the European Community, following earlier studies this year published by both the MMC and the European Commission's competition directorate. The Ludvigsen report claims that inefficiencies in the European motor industry are one of the factors behind much higher prices in Europe than Japan or the US. 'Judged by hours required to assemble a car, the Europeans attain less than half the productivity of the Japanese and little more than two-thirds that of the American domestic producers.' According to an analysis of both efficiency and labour rates, America's per-car production costs are Ecu135 (Pounds 105) higher than Japan's while Europe's are Ecu220 higher. The Ludvigsen report, which is likely to be fiercely contested by car makers in Europe, concludes that European car plants employ close to 150,000 more assembly workers than they would if average Japanese standards were maintained. It claims that this is equivalent to a surplus staffing level in Europe of at least 17 per cent. While European consumers pay over the odds for new cars compared with Japanese and American car buyers, Ludvigsen claims that new research confirms that large price differences remain within Europe. In Denmark, transaction prices, excluding taxes but taking into account typical dealer discounts, are 65 per cent of those in the UK. In Belgium they are 80 per cent of the British level, in Germany 89 per cent, in France 93 per cent and in Spain 94 per cent. The report claims to have unearthed 'startling' findings about disparities in wholesale car prices, the prices at which cars are sold by the car makers to their dealers. It urges Europe's car price watchdogs to investigate wholesale car prices as well as retail prices and claims that 'private buyers in continental markets, paying list prices, pay less for their cars than do British dealers buying their cars from the factory.'</p>

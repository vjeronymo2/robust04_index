			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Easing of curbs on migrants is urged Immigration restrictions are depriving UK businesses of much-needed professional and managerial skills, says a report published today by the left-of-centre Institute for Public Policy Research. The institute says that changes in immigration policy could bring economic benefits in the form of skilled labour and an inflow of investors and entrepreneurs from overseas. Any such change would also help in attracting international companies by making it easier for them to transfer staff to the UK. The report points out that other western countries actively promote immigration to fill skill shortages and boost their economies. Britain's policy on migrants was adopted in the 1960s to deal with large-scale immigration to fill low-skill jobs. It neglects the needs of the labour market for selective, skilled immigration, and erects unnecessary barriers to entrepreneurs who would invest in the UK and create jobs. The institute says the work-permit system operates primarily as a form of entry control, rather than a system for identifying the UK's economic needs for migrants. It should be revised to adapt to current migration and economic conditions. The UK approach is contrasted with those of the US, Canada and Australia, where immigration is seen as a means of attracting people who can contribute to economic growth. The report says substantial numbers of migrants are unlikely to be needed to fill UK labour shortages. Relaxation of immigration policy is necessary, however, in a world where certain types of human capital have become much more mobile. Strangers &amp; Citizens.

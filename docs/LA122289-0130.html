			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> ROOSEVELT: The Roosevelt Family name is inextricably linked with Panama. . . .  Work on the Canal was begun during Teddy Roosevelt's administration. . . .  James Roosevelt, a Newport Beach resident and a Democrat, is TR's grand-nephew  and FDR's eldest son. . . . Of the Panama incursion, Roosevelt, who turns 82 on  Saturday, says: "The important thing now is to think of the whole hemisphere,  rather than (just) Panama. I wouldn't say I'm satisfied; I would say I'm  anxious to see a more detailed and long-range program worked out." Dana Parsons  and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

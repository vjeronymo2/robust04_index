			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Higgs &amp; Hill back in black After two years of losses, Higgs &amp; Hill, the construction, property and housebuilding group, moved modestly back into the black in 1993 with a Pounds 1.23m pre-tax profit. This compared with a Pounds 22.04m loss in 1992, restated in accordance with FRS 3, and a Pounds 16.7m loss in 1991. After an abnormally high tax charge of Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 701,000 credit) reflecting the low proportion of UK profits available to offset ACT, earnings per share rose only to 0.3p compared with losses of 48.4p. The company, however, is proposing a maintained final dividend of 1.5p making an unchanged total of 2.5p. The biggest reason for the profits recovery was the absence of large land and property write-downs, as well as provisions against redundancy costs and losses on disposals which cost Pounds 22.02m in 1992. Mr John Theakston, chief executive, said 1993 represented a turning point in the UK housing and commercial property markets, which had been in recession since the late 1980s. Commercial property, following the sale of a 12 acre site in Southend, Essex to Waitrose for a superstore and a 75,000 sq ft office development at St Quentin-en-Yvelines in France, moved from a Pounds 14.29m loss to a Pounds 4m profit last year. Mr Theakston said that UK institutional investors in property had begun to return to the domestic market enabling values to recover and improving development opportunities. The UK housing market had also improved. The number of homes sold had risen from 262 to 332, making profits of Pounds 2.25m (Pounds 1.67m losses). Contracting however, remained difficult. Margins remained deeply depressed with too many companies chasing a shortage of work. An 11 per cent fall in group turnover to Pounds 262.2m (Pounds 296m) was mainly because of a fall in construction orders as the group became more selective about the quality of work it took on. Construction losses were reduced from Pounds 2.92m to Pounds 2.08m on lower turnover of Pounds 212m (Pounds 251m). COMMENT Profits, excluding the effect of write-downs and exceptional provisions, rose 37 per cent to Pounds 1.25m. The company has the good feel of a business that knows where it is going notwithstanding an extremely difficult UK market. Joint ventures with Berkeley Group and H&amp;H's moves to increase its international order book are the right measures for a medium-sized contractor seeking to counter a steep downturn in its domestic market. Gearing may rise to 10 per cent this year to buy housing land, but hardly straining the balance sheet. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m this year and Pounds 6m in 1995 would put the stock on a prospective p/e of 14 two years out: probably high enough but buy on weakness, this is a good contractor.</p>

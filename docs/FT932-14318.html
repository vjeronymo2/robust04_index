			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / World Trade News: US and EC start new trade talks - Sanctions may follow if Kantor and Brittan fail to reach agreement US INDUSTRY representatives were anxiously watching for signs yesterday that Mr Mickey Kantor and Sir Leon Brittan, the top trade officials of the US and EC - who began a two-day meeting in Washington - would make progress in efforts to eliminate tariffs on a wide range of products. There has been little news out of preliminary meetings held over the weekend between Mr Warren Lavorel, the US Gatt co-ordinator, and Mr Hugo Paemen, the chief EC trade negotiator. Much could depend on the outcome of the dispute over the EC Utilities Directive, which, the US argues, makes it difficult for US companies to win telecommunications and electrical equipment contracts. A settlement could produce momentum in the multilateral procurement talks in Geneva and in the Uruguay Round of talks as a whole. Failure to reach agreement, followed by US sanctions against EC companies, might dampen the mood, although US officials say they will try to segregate the issue from the rest of the round. On the market access package, agreement was reported to be near on pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and construction equipment. However, the question of including scientific and agricultural equipment must still be aired. The talks on forest products have been in some trouble. The EC has complained about export restrictions of logs from the US, Malaysia and Indonesia, making elimination of the restrictions a condition to reduce or eliminate tariffs. This was 'a red herring' as far as the US is concerned, said Mr Stephen Lovett, of the National Forest Products Association. US logs were of 'little economic significance' to the EC, although Indonesian exports were more of a problem. Chemical tariffs are also at issue, with the EC disagreeing about some exceptions the US wants to take. The Community also could demand more from American 'donor industries' - those such as textiles, ceramics and glassware which will be forced to give up tariff protection. Mr Lovett and Mr William Lane, government affairs representative for Caterpillar, stressed the necessity of producing 'a major market access package' containing a 'very strong zero tariff component', to make the Uruguay Round of talks saleable to Congress. 'Overnight the business attitude would change from ambivalence to enthusiasm,' Mr Lane said. Caterpillar and other big US equipment makers face tariffs of 4-10 per cent in most developed countries and over 15 per cent in developing countries. 'It's difficult to offset the extra burden of import tariffs,' the company said in its proposal to reduce tariffs to zero on construction equipment, diesel engines, lift trucks, and industrial gas turbine engines.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / International Company News: EIB bites the bullet with first Greek drachma bond - A look at investors' appetite for the high coupon likely to be offered by the first international drachma bond Years of planning are about to bear fruit as the European Investment Bank prepares to issue the first international Greek drachma bond. 'We have been trying to tap the Greek drachma market for many years, but for one reason or another we had to keep postponing our plans,' said Mr Ulrich Damm, who heads the supranational agency's capital markets department. Now those obstacles have been overcome, largely because the EIB was able to find two back-to-back borrowers in Greece who wanted to draw down loans in Greek drachma, he said. 'We will definitely come to the market,' Mr Damm said. The EIB today will hold a presentation for investors and banks in Athens, and the issue is expected on Thursday. The EIB plans to issue Dr10bn of 5-year bullet bonds. According to sources in the Eurobond market, the bonds are likely to pay a coupon of 17 3/4 per cent. They will be listed in Athens and Luxembourg and cleared through Euroclear and Cedel. Midland Bank Athens (part of the HSBC Group) and the Greek state-owned Hellenic Industrial Development Bank (ETBA) have arranged the deal. Many compare the fledgling drachma bond market with the southern European markets of the late 1980's. 'Back then, those currencies offered double-digit coupons, but now Italy and Spain pay about 7 1/2 per cent and Portuguese bonds offer about 8 1/2 per cent, so paper yielding 17 per cent to 18 per cent will attract investors' attention,' said HSBC's Mr Mark Bucknall. Until now, foreigners haven't had easy access to the Greek bond market. Moreover, they have been put off by the unavailability of fixed-coupon bonds with maturities of more than one year. The Greek government issues bonds with maturities of up to seven years, but bonds with maturities above one year pay floating interest rates. Their coupons are pegged to the rate on 12-month Treasury bills, which is regularly set by the Greek central bank. With one-year Treasury bills currently yielding 19.75 per cent, a five-year bond pays 200 basis points above that - 21.75 per cent. The Greek government bond market is relatively illiquid, although increased over-the-counter inter-bank trading has begun improving the liquidity of some government bonds, especially at the shorter end of the maturity spectrum. Greece does most of its borrowing domestically, although it has been an active issuer in the Japanese samurai market in recent years. It is said to be talking with the US Securities Exchange Commission about plans for a Yankee bond issue. The country regularly issues bonds linked to Ecu, US dollar, sterling and D-Mark which pay the interest rate a borrower with an equivalent rating would pay in each of these currencies. Many hope that the EIB's bond will open the market for other borrowers as well as whetting investors' appetites for drachma bonds. 'The EIB bond is a relatively small issue, but I expect other issuers to follow,' said a senior Athens banker. 'The big question is whether the Greek government will start issuing longer-dated fixed-coupon bonds.' Indeed, Greece's large budget deficit is likely to ensure that supply won't dry up. Falling inflation and interest rates are likely to yield to solid capital gains on drachma bonds. Inflation is likely to have dropped to about 11 per cent in January, from 12.1 per cent in December, and is expected to fall to 10 per cent this year. Meanwhile, the Greek central bank recently cut its 12-month Treasury bill rate by  1/2 point to 19.75 and its 3-month Treasury bill rate by one point to 17 per cent. Of course, investors should bear in mind the currency risk associated with drachma holdings. While Greece is a member of the European Monetary System, the drachma is not in the ERM and has slipped steadily against most European currencies over the years. According to the OECD, the drachma depreciated by about 8 1/2 per cent per year over the past two years. However, according to HSBC's Mr Bucknall, 'many investors are prepared to take a currency risk if it's compensated by a big yield pick-up over the market they're based in'. Thus, for a D-mark based investor receiving a 5 1/4 per cent yield on five-year notes, the interest-rate differential is so large that 'the currency has to devalue substantially before he starts losing money,' says Mr Bucknall. Elsewhere in the Eurobond market, the EIB is rumoured to be considering a Pta60bn (Dollars 428m) issue this week, which would make it the largest deal in the matador market to date.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Just in from the editor's desk: According to a  REUTER report a short while ago, three resistance fighters were  killed and three others were injured when Israeli forces this  afternoon bombarded the vicinity of Tallat 'Ali al-Tahir, which  is occupied by Israeli forces. REUTER also reported that  Israeli helicopters flew several sorties over Kafr Tibnit and  released dozens of thermal balloons.    The Israeli forces heated up the security situation in the  south this afternoon. At 1550, Israeli forces began bombarding  al-Nabatiyah al-Fawqa, the outskirts of the Lebanese army's  deserted barracks in al-Nabatiyah, the outskirts of Kafr Tibnit,  Arnun, the 'Ali al-Tahir wood, and al-Dabshah. The shelling was  followed by intensive machine-gun fire from Israeli positions.  Hostile tank movement was spotted in al-Dabshah. After 1630,  the shelling reached the outskirts of the Ghandur Palace and  Tallat al-Mazra'ah in the al-Nabatiyah al-Fawqa area. The  shelling was accompanied by 12.7-mm machine-gun fire from the  Israeli positions in the 'Ali al- Tahir hills and al-Dabshah.</p>

Tudjman said that Croatia's policy was consistent and that  its constitution demands a referendum amongst the people to  finally accept the confederation plan of the accord which was  signed by Croatia, Bosnia's Croats and Muslims in Washington on  March 1.    Tudjman told a news conference in Zagreb that he and Bosnian  Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic had reached agreements, both  open and secret, on the confederation plan. Izetbegovic had  repeatedly voiced his support for the Croatian-Muslim alliance,  he said.</p>

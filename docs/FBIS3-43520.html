From the primary sector to  the tertiary sector through the secondary sector, they have  always sought to develop their country's economy, thanks to  peace and concord installed for more than a quarter of a century  in Togo. This is why, taking advantage of the calm situation  since this morning, in the aftermath of the painful events in  Lome in recent days, the people of Lome have not hesitated to  gradually resume their normal activities. Some vehicles and  motorcycles, as well as pedestrians, have started going about  the city.    These people, however, have to obey the injunctions of the  security forces who, for their part, are still trying to  dislodge the last terrorists still in hiding after their deadly  act. The official balance sheet for this attack yesterday stood  at 58 dead, after the discovery of 16 more bodies. It will be  recalled that yesterday, the National Gendarmery presented the  arrested terrorists to the national and international press.  The statements they made pointed to the fact that they all  received military training in neighboring Ghana, and that their  mission was to arrest or to kill the head of state, General  Gnassingbe Eyadema, and then later to cause panic within the  peaceful population of Lome and its environs.    It will also be recalled that the head of the government,  Joseph Kokou Koffigoh, yesterday in a press statement deplored  the attack on the Togolese people. The prime minister also  spoke of Togo's desire to live in peace, in particular with its  neighbors. He stated that himself, President Eyadema, and the  government will do everything possible to preserve this peace,  which is so dear to the whole of Togo.</p>

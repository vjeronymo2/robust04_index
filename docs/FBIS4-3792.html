			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 24 (XINHUA) -- China said here  today that despite the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the  World Trade Talks and the signing of the final act, "The results  are far from satisfactory."    "Many of the developing countries' requirements have not  been  met and the world must continue to address the remaining  issues," said Chen Yuan, deputy governor of China's central  bank, the People's Bank of China.    Speaking at the 50th meeting of the group of 24 ministers,  part of the spring meeting of the World Bank and the IMF, Chen  said much work remained to be done to implement the concluded  trade agreements.    Chen stressed that while trade protectionism in the  developed  countries has increased rather than decreased, the developing  countries have adopted measures to liberalize trade and open up  domestic markets.    "The developed countries should further open their markets  and eliminate various forms of subsidies as well as non-trade  barriers," Chen said.    "We earnestly oppose the use of so-called social barriers on  part of developed countries as an excuse to restrict the exports  of developing countries," he stressed.</p>

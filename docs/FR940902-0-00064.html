			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The grievance procedures established pursuant to section 144 of the Act, and set forth at &sect;&sect;627.501 and 627.502 of the interim final rule, are intended to ensure due process and to provide for the timely and orderly processing of JTPA complaints at the State and local levels. The regulations also provide for a State-level review of local grievances, as set forth at &sect;627.503. There is also provision for Federal-level review of State and local-level complaints without decision at &sect;&sect;627.601(a) and 627.605. It would be premature and improper to interject the Department into a State or local grievance process before it is completed. It would also create problems in the event that the Department was subsequently requested to review a complaint in which it had participated. The Department believes that the regulations set forth in the interim final rule are appropriate and consistent with the legislative provisions. Therefore, no change is made to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter recommended that the time period for requesting a State-level review of a local complaint, provided under &sect;627.503(c) of the interim final rule, be increased from 10 and 15 days to 30 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the statutory provisions at section 144, and the regulatory provisions at part 627, subparts E, F, G and H, the grievance procedures established at the various levels are intended to provide the speedy processing of filed complaints. The Department believes that the timeframes established in the regulations are consistent with the statutory scheme. No change is made to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter recommended including examples of independent reviewers at &sect;627.503(b) pertaining to State level review of complaints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department does not believe that it is appropriate to include a laundry list of examples of possible independent reviewers in the regulations, but agrees that some clarification in this area is warranted. Section 627.503(b) is amended in the final rule to indicate that independent review should be conducted by a reviewer who is not connected with the JTPA program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter recommended amending the employer-level grievance provisions at &sect;627.504 to indicate that if an employer is required to use grievance procedures under a covered collective bargaining agreement, then those should be the operative procedures for the handling of JTPA complaints at that level. In addition, it was recommended that if no collective bargaining agreement exists, participants should be made fully aware of their rights to file a grievance either by using the employer's grievance procedures or the SDA's JTPA grievance procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees that where the employer is required to follow a certain grievance procedure under the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, those procedures should be followed for complaints pertaining to the terms and conditions of employment of JTPA participants, therefore, &sect;627.504(b) is revised accordingly. The regulations provide that recipients, SDA's and SSG's shall ensure that employers have grievance procedures available to their JTPA participants. Some commenters suggested that participants be permitted to choose a grievance procedure under which to process a complaint. The regulations indicate that employers of JTPA participants may elect to operate their own grievance procedures or use the recipient's, SDA's or SSG's grievance procedures established pursuant to section 144 of the Act. The employer must inform participants of the procedures they are to follow when they begin employment. The choice of which grievance procedure to follow does not extend to the individual participants. Since the relationship exists between the employer and the JTPA entity in the first instance, it is important that all of the procedures and provisions applicable to a given employer, including grievance procedures, are clearly established in the agreement. The Department believes that the existing regulatory provision is consistent with the provisions of the Act, avoids potential confusion that could result from the recommended change, and provides for the consistent treatment and processing of JTPA complaints at the employer level. No change is made to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

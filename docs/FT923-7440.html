			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Chile's debt wins back investment grade status CHILE yesterday became the first Latin American country to win back investment grade status after the region's debt crisis of the past decade. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, said it had assigned an implied BBB rating to long-term debt issued by the Republic of Chile, putting it two notches above the threshold for investment grade. Implied ratings are given when there is no outstanding debt issued by the country, and provide a ceiling for the ratings of private sector issuers from the country concerned. Of other Latin American countries, Venezuela is rated two notches below investment status by S&amp;P at BB and only one rung below by Moody's Investors Service, the other leading US agency, at Ba1. Mexico, unrated by S&amp;P, is regarded as a Ba2 credit by Moody's. Chile's rehabilitation in the eyes of the international financial markets is due largely to the impact of economic reforms carried out during the 1980s, under the military dictatorship of General Pinochet. The duration of the country's economic reforms was one of the significant factors which accounted for Chile's higher standing than other countries in the region, S&amp;P said. S&amp;P's assessment also reflects the country's successful transition to democratic rule in 1990. Although its gross external debt of some Dollars 18bn is still around 60 per cent of gross domestic product, S&amp;P said debt service had fallen to a manageable 21 per cent of exports in 1991 from 56 per cent in 1985. Banco de Chile, which said a month ago that it was planning to raise Dollars 75m, is the only Chilean issuer so far to have announced plans to return to the international bond markets. However, the issue has yet to emerge.</p>

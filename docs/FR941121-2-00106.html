A 2-mile length of US 219 from the Rich Creek junction with US 460 to the state line is in Giles County, Virginia. The remaining section of US 219 is in Monroe County and Greenbrier County, West Virginia. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Bobby W.

Most of the 52-mile highway improvement will occur in West Virginia, with a 2-mile section at the southern end extending into Virginia. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The intent of the project is to improve access in the project area where US 219 serves as the primary north-south route through major population concentrations, business centers, and recreation areas in the eastern portion of West Virginia. Also, the roadway comprises the southernmost segment of the 540-mile long ``Seneca Trail International Highway,'' as US 219 is presently known. This highway proceeds from the Canadian border at Buffalo to Virginia, linking with interstate highways to all mid-Atlantic and southeastern states. Following implementation of the US/Canada and North American Free Trade (NAFTA) Agreements, increasing trade and tourist traffic is expected, which could promote economic expansion in adjacent depressed areas of Appalachia. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Present roadway deficiencies in the proposed project area include sections with poor geometric design, lack of sight distance, poor level of service, restrictive speed limits, and a lack of passing opportunities. These functional, operational, and physical deficiencies compel this action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Project alternatives will involve the No-Action Alternative and a combination of Build Alternatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EIS will assess the alternatives and their environmental effects through detailed studies of socioeconomic, natural, visual, and cultural resources; air quality; noise impacts; secondary and cumulative effects; energy utilization; hazardous wastes; utilities; and permitting. Joint development prospects, congestion management, the relationship between local short-term uses of man's environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, and any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action will be determined. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Plan of Study describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be forwarded to appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies. Agencies will be invited to attend a scoping meeting where aspects of the proposed action will be discussed. When completed, the draft EIS will be provided for public and agency review and comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning the proposed action should be directed to the FHWA or West Virginia Department of Transportation at the addresses provided. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number 20.205, Highway Research Planning and Construction.

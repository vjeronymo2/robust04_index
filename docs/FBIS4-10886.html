			<p>BFN     [Text] Former President General Andres Rodriguez, retired,  stated on 16 April that he had spoken with Fidel Castro four  times when, together with other Latin American countries, they  asked him to put his country on the road to democracy, something  the Cuban leader refused to do. "Moreover, we can now happily  observe that there is the beginning of an opening on the  Caribbean island," Rodriguez said after a meeting with Cuban  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina at his home in the Asuncion  neighborhood of Las Carmelitas.    "The systems that are in force in friendly countries must be  respected, but at least we must indicate the interest that  exists in wanting them to follow the same (democratic) path and  the same course to improve relations between one country and  another," [Juan Carlos] Wasmosy's predecessor said.    He stated that it has not been possible until now to reach a  stage of transition in Cuba like the stage occurring in our  country, but he expressed his hope that this democratic opening  will open up new horizons and thus involve the political sector.    When asked if the Wasmosy government's position of not  maintaining diplomatic relations with Cuba is the best one,  Rodriguez said: "Diplomatic relations cannot be discussed  before Cuba has a democratic system or opening. The foreign  minister (Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner) is trying out the  possibility of maintaining trade relations. But at this time I  cannot give an opinion; only the government and president can  give an opinion."    Rodriguez stated that he would vote in favor of the U.S.  blockade of Cuba if the possibility arose in an international  forum, such as the occasion on 3 November 1993 when our country  voted against Cuba. Paraguay was the only Latin American country  to do so with the exception of Argentina, which abstained.</p>

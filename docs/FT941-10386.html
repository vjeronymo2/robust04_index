			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Mideast talks progress slowly Israel and Palestinians yesterday made good but slow progress towards drafting a long-delayed agreement on security issues to implement Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho, Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, were due to meet President Hosni Mubarak, who is mediating between the two sides. Neither side offered any clue whether they would be able to initial a draft agreement last night or today, when Mr Peres and Mr Arafat are due to leave Cairo. Mr Peres said: 'We have to negotiate quietly. . . We shall try to conclude as soon as we can. I cannot give you a date.' Mr Nabil Shaath, senior PLO negotiator, said the two sides had resolved 'six or seven minor issues' in morning talks. 'We are going a little slowly but we are going. . .' Israeli officials confirmed the two sides were seeking to 'clarify' a draft agreement reached between Mr Peres and Mr Arafat in Switzerland 10 days ago. The talks mainly focused on details of a Palestinian presence at border crossings; Israeli security arrangements at the borders and the operational role of the Israeli army in protecting Jewish settlers remaining in Gaza once Israeli forces have complete a troop redeployment. Mr Yossi Sarid, environment minister, confirmed the Cairo talks were aimed at initialling the security clauses of a protocol as a prelude to Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza-Jericho and the transfer of power to Palestinian hands. Mr Sarid said that once the security clause were initialled, the two sides would have to hold at least two weeks of further talks in Paris and Egypt on economics and the role of the Palestinian police force before Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, and Mr Arafat could formally sign the protocol. 'We do hope to conclude the security agreement today and if not today tomorrow or after tomorrow,' Mr Sarid said. But he cautioned: 'Always the beginning of talks is very positive and the atmosphere constructive but some times it is difficult to translate that atmosphere into results.'</p>

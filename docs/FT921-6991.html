			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Nafta talks run into stalemate CRUCIAL talks on the proposed North American free trade agreement (Nafta) in Dallas last week have done little to resolve uncertainty clouding the treaty, as negotiators refused to say where, if any, significant breakthroughs were made, Damian Fraser reports from Mexico City. Presidents Carlos Salinas de Gortari and George Bush will meet in San Antonio this week, where they will discuss progress over the talks and perhaps give their negotiators authority to make key concessions. The Mexican government, according to various Mexican press reports, is still being pressured to make further concessions in agriculture, energy, treatment of foreign investment, and the financial sector. The three countries involved, the US, Mexico and Canada, seem also to be divided over textiles, cars, a disputes mechanism and anti-dumping rules. The US trade representative's office said negotiators would report to their trade ministers before scheduling another meeting.</p>

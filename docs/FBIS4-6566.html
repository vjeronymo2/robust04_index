			<p>BFN     [Text] There was a report of heavy shelling inside  Cambodia opposite Sa Kaeo Province on 21 April. According to  the report, a group of about 200 Khmer Rouge forces of the 519th  Division at 0500 on 21 April opened fire on a former Khmer Serei  command post, which is now under control of the Cambodian  Government, at Boeng Ta Kuan in Thmar Puok District, Banteay  Meanchey Province, about 20 km from Ta Phraya District, Sa Kaeo  Province. As a result, people's houses and markets were  damaged; government soldiers were running away from the attack.  The shelling continued until afternoon. About 600 Cambodian  people, mainly children and the elderly, crossed the border into  Thailand's Ban Khlong Phaeng, Tambon Thapsadet, Taphraya  District. Thai soldiers and policemen disarmed them and gave  them help on humanitarian grounds. General Atchawin  Sawetserani, Burapha Task Force deputy commander, ordered that a  temporary shelter be given to those people until the fighting  inside Cambodia calms down. They will be pushed back once the  shelling stops.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TV SHOW ACCIDENTALLY LEADS TO MAN'S ARREST  </P> <P> A Los Angeles man sought on charges of abducting his 13-year-old daughter was  arrested a month after a TV program featured a similar case, the FBI said.  </P> <P> Guillermo E. Bonilla was arrested at his home in Point Roberts, Wash., Friday  for investigation of two counts of using a false Social Security number, an FBI  statement said.  </P> <P> Bonilla lived five years in Point Roberts as Robert William Kelly.  </P> <P> An "Unsolved Mysteries" episode shown Nov. 21 covered a 1983 Montana kidnaping.  School officials in Tsawwassen, Canada, north of Point Roberts, thought they  recognized the victim as Bonilla's daughter.  </P> <P> Bonilla's daughter was not the one involved in the Montana case but had been  reported missing in the Los Angeles area in 1983, the statement said.  </P> <P> She was found in Bonilla's house last week and placed with Child Protective  Services pending a reunion with her mother in California.  </P> <P> Bonilla was scheduled for arraignment Wednesday on federal Social Security  charges in Seattle. He faces extradition on child detention charges.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BAN ON CONTRACEPTIVES QUESTIONED;  </P> <P> NORWAY'S PREMIER TAKES ON THE POPE  </P> <P> Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland took on the Pope today over the  Roman Catholic Church's ban on contraception, questioning its wisdom in view of  the spread of AIDS.  </P> <P> Brundtland, known for her plain speaking, told Pope John Paul II of her concern  during a half-hour meeting at the start of his first tour of Scandinavia, which  is about 1% Catholic.  </P> <P> "I asked him a question which I think he will consider," she told Norwegian  state radio after the talks.  </P> <P> She said it concerned "the problems linked to the spread of AIDS . . . where  religious attitudes to the use of contraceptives make it difficult to prevent  the spread of the disease in countries where there are many Catholics."  </P> <P> Asked how the Pope had responded, she replied: "I think he thought it was an  interesting and difficult moral question. He said he would gladly study it more  closely."  </P> <P> Condoms have been widely recommended as helping to prevent infection by the  AIDS virus, which kills by stripping the body of its natural defenses. The Pope  has often spoken out against contraception and abortion.  </P> <P> After the talks with Brundtland, the pontiff celebrated open-air Mass before a  crowd of 10,000 in the grounds of Oslo's Akershus fortress. Organizers had  expected double that number but rain apparently kept many away.  </P></p>

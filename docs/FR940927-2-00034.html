Approximately $1.50 million is expected to be available in FY 1995 to fund this project. It is expected that the award will begin on or about December 1, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 2 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this cooperative agreement will be to conduct a pilot survey which will assess the past and present health status of Iowa residents who are Persian Gulf War veterans compared with other Iowa residents who are Persian Gulf War-era veterans, in terms of self-reported health outcomes. This assessment will serve as a model for potential future similar assessments undertaken by other Federal agencies, States, local governments, or universities. CDC will serve as the principal point of contact with the Department of Defense and other Federal agencies to secure names and locating information for the study participants; provide expert review, comment and approval on all study protocols, data collection instruments, analysis plans, media releases, draft and final reports, and publications generated by the recipient and its contractors and ensures appropriate involvement of related Federal agencies and veteran services organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life.

Inspector Jurkevicius heads the Defense Ministry's dangerous  cargo transportation division and is authorized to issue or to  deny permissions for Russian military transit.    On Tuesday, he instructed Lithuanian railroad officials to  stop a Russian train with around 30 armored personnel carriers,  which were escorted by four armed Russian soldiers.    The train was allowed to enter Lithuanian territory from the  Kaliningrad region late Tuesday when 17 flatcars with military  equipment were disconnected.    The leadership of the Russian troops stationed in  Kaliningrad  apologized for an incident last weekend when a Russian echelon  crossed the Lithuanian border without any permission of  Lithuanian authorities.    On Tuesday, Russian Army officials requested a transit  permission for a new echelon but Jurkevicius denied their  request.    Jurkevicius said his decision was prompted by the media's  strong reaction to the incident last weekend.    Until now, Russian military transit from Kaliningrad was  reportedly carried out in accordance with the rules of transit  from Germany. Apparently, the inspector is no longer willing to  apply the same rules to transit from Kaliningrad and to transit  from Germany.</p>

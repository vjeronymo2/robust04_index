			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / HK notes to mature after handover Hong Kong's Monetary Authority, the colony's central bank, is to test investor sentiment towards the transfer of sovereignty to China when on Monday it offers HKDollars 500m (Pounds 41.5m) of three-year notes that mature on July 28, 1997. The authority said yesterday that Beijing's approval had been obtained to conduct a borrowing programme, even if repayment was beyond July 1, 1997, the day sovereignty passes to China. Through Mr Joseph Yam, its chief executive, the authority has established close working relations with the People's Bank of China, Beijing's central bank. The authority said it expected the notes would be well received. They carry a coupon rate of interest of 6.95 per cent. 'We believe the market has discounted the 1997 factor,' an official said. The issue of three-year paper is part of the authority's attempt to establish the basis for a debt market in Hong Kong. It now issues securities with maturities ranging from three months to three years and is considering the issue of a five-year note. The notes and bills are sought after by banks. The authority operates a discount window at which banks can cash notes and bills for overnight funding. Bills have been issued since 1991. The value of outstanding notes and bills at the end of June was HKDollars 44bn. These securities are backed by Hong Kong's exchange fund, a government reserve established to maintain the value of the Hong Kong dollar, which the authority manages.</p>

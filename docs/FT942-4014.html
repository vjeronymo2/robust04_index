			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Books: A biographer's elusive quest IN SEARCH OF CHURCHILL by Martin Gilbert HarperCollins Pounds 20, 338 pages After all the heavy stuff on Churchill, here is some light relief. Martin Gilbert has come out with the Agatha Christie side of the historian's art. Gilbert was a young Oxford history graduate when in 1962 he was reluctantly roped in as a researcher on what was to become Churchill's official biography. Since then he has devoted most of his working life to the subject. What may well be the longest biography ever written (eight volumes) was completed in 1988. A large, single volume life of Churchill by Gilbert appeared in 1991. And still the work on the accompanying Churchill documents goes on: there may be another five volumes of these to come, making a total of 15. Don't be deterred by the statistics. In Search of Churchill is largely fun. It tells the tale of how Gilbert became involved in the first place, then how he set about his continuing task. There are three key figures: Winston Churchill; his son, Randolph, and (modestly) Gilbert himself who took charge of the project when Randolph died in 1968. The book is phenomenally, sentimentally pro practically everything to do with the Churchill family, but not much the worse for that. In some ways the hero is Randolph, the wild journalist/politician who never seemed quite to pull anything off. He succeeded, however, in putting together a team to write his father's life. He also installed a journalistic discipline: go on looking for sources and, when you have found them, check them and look for more. When Gilbert first arrived at East Bergholt as a potential recruit, he was met by what he took to be an ordinary driver. The man turned out to be Michael Wolff, who was already the director of research and subsequently political adviser to Edward Heath. Wolff, like Randolph, died early. After an argument with Lord Hartwell of the Daily Telegraph, who thought his paper had proprietary rights to appoint the new Churchill biographer, it was left to Gilbert to complete the job. Gilbert abandoned a commission to write the official life of Sir Stafford Cripps and, apart from a brief fling with Harold Wilson, has been with Churchill ever since. He set to work like a detective. Apart from the official records, there was always the question of who said/wrote what to whom, and in what tone of voice, let alone what was unrecorded. Gilbert spoke to everyone he could find: secretaries, civil servants, old military men, anyone who had come across Churchill. When Churchill left Downing Street as prime minister for the last time, the press simply reported that he did so with 'an unknown woman'. Gilbert identified her as Elizabeth Gilliatt, a Churchill secretary since 1945, a useful source on how Churchill worked. Sometimes Gilbert advertised for material in the newspapers. At others, sources came to him out of the blue. One such was Judy Montagu, daughter of Venetia Stanley, who turned up in Oxford with a laundry basket full of letters written to her mother by prime minister Asquith. The letters explained a great deal about why Asquith did not push Churchill for much of a role in the 1916 coalition with Lloyd George: his mind was on other matters, for the new government was formed on the day that Asquith heard that Venetia was getting married. Not all the high level sources were immediately helpful. Sir John Colville, for years Churchill's private secretary, was initially reticent. Gilbert thinks that may have been because Colville had previously worked for Neville Chamberlain. Then it turned out that Colville was ready to publish his own diaries - almost unprecedented at the time. Harold Wilson came as a late source. He had praised Churchill greatly on his death and Gilbert asked him why. It was partly because Churchill had so very kind to him when Wilson resigned from the Attlee government in 1951. Gilbert then helped with Wilson's book on 1964-70. He found Wilson questioning him about Churchill's later years in Downing Street. 'I do not want to decline in office,' Wilson said. There are also anecdotes and historical insights: Churchill in old age watching the film of Wuthering Heights and finally commenting, 'What terrible weather they have in Yorkshire'. The origins of Churchill's Battle of Britain tribute seems to have been a speech on the launching of the Queen Mary in 1935: 'Never in the history of transatlantic travel has so much been done for those who travel tourist.' Best of all is Gilbert's warning as a historian: 'Never fully trust any recollection. Beware of memory, even one's own]' Although perhaps unduly protective of the Churchill reputation, the book nevertheless is immensely enjoyable.</p>

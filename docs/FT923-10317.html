			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Observer: Bus queue Sniffing out the individual winners and losers in the great ICI break-up is difficult. Ronnie Hempel, the group's chief operating officer, is already over 60 and by the time he takes the helm of what's left of ICI, he will be less than a year away from the normal retirement age of 62. ICI chairman Sir Denys Henderson gets to be chairman of both bits of his empire, but since he collects his bus pass in October, he is also not going to be around for ever. David Barnes is an obvious winner in the short term. He will be chief executive of ICI Bio, the most exciting part, and since he is only 56 he has a few years to get the feel of the helm of an independent company. However, apart from him, it is far from clear who is going to emerge in glory. The problem with ICI is that most of its senior management is getting on a bit. David Friend, chief executive of the pharmaceutical side, and his counterpart at speciality chemicals Rodney Brown are both 57, which is also the average age of the main board executive directors. One man to watch, however, is 45-year-old Rob Margetts, who has restructured ICI's Tioxide business. He joins the ICI board next month and has already picked up his first outside non-executive directorship on Andrew Teare's board at English China Clays.</p>

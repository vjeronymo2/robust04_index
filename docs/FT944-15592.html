			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Texas cuts 900 jobs in management shake-up Texas Homecare, the UK's second biggest do-it-yourself stores chain, which is owned by Ladbroke group, is cutting 900 jobs in its 240 stores as part of a management restructuring. The redundancies provide further evidence of the depressed state of the DIY market - one of the fastest-growing sectors of retailing in the 1980s - which Ladbroke said yesterday remained 'highly competitive'. Sales growth is slow, with little sign of stimulus from a recovery in the housing market. Many analysts believe that with more than 1,000 DIY superstores in operation there is too much capacity in the market. About half the planned job losses come from reducing the average number of managers and assistant managers in stores from seven to five, with some administrative functions being taken over by computer systems. Remaining assistant managers are being retrained and will spend more of their time on the shopfloor to improve service. The other losses result from closure of Texas Pantries snack bars in 170 stores. Ladbroke said research by Mr John Coleman, the Texas chief executive recruited from fashion chain Dorothy Perkins last year, showed that the snack bars did not fit the chain's image and were being under-used. The group said there was little scope for redeployment of staff, although generous redundancy terms were being offered. Restructuring costs of about Pounds 2m will be charged to this year's profit and loss account, but Ladbroke said resulting cost savings would be 'considerable'. The recent half-year results of the top three chains reflect the squeeze. Texas reported a fall in profits from Pounds 16.6m to Pounds 2m. B&amp;Q, the market-leader owned by Kingfisher, saw interim profits increase slightly from Pounds 41.6m to Pounds 44.5m, but the number three, Do It All, a joint venture between Boots and WH Smith which is selling 100 of its 240 stores, could only reduce its loss from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 10.5m. Mr Coleman is attempting to improve Texas's performance by cutting the number of suppliers from 400 to 200, and renegotiating terms. He is also refitting 50 stores and introducing more 'heavy' items such as bricks, cement and timber - often in space vacated by the snack bars - to cater properly for the 'high-spending DIY enthusiast'. Ladbroke, which has no other retail interests apart from Texas, says it has no plans to sell the chain, but analysts believe it might be prepared to if its performance could be improved sufficiently to attract buyers.</p>

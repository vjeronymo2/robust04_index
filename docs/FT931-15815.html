			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Cautious optimism signalled on economy FURTHER evidence that the worst of the recession may be over is contained in new figures on company registrations and in a survey of business confidence from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business-information group. The figures on registrations of new companies provided grounds for 'cautious optimism' in the view of Jordans, the monitoring group which compiled them. Jordans said the number of companies formed last year fell for the third year running but the rate of decline was lower than in either 1990 or 1991. In particular, the decline in company formations slowed in the second half of 1992, underlining expectations that the recession may be ending. Company registrations in the UK excluding Northern Ireland reached 107,375 last year, down 2.5 per cent on 1991. Jordans said the decline in company formations compared with a year-on-year reduction of 9.1 per cent in 1991 and 7.1 per cent in 1990. Formation of companies provides a rough guide to overall economic activity. However, the link is inexact since the figures do not distinguish between functioning businesses and those formed for legal reasons or as subsidiaries. In the latter six months of last year, 51,371 companies were formed - 1.8 per cent below the 52,293 in the corresponding period in 1991. That compared with the year-on-year change in the first six months of 3.3 per cent, when registrations dropped to 56,004 from 57,815. Between 1991 and 1992, the decline in formation of new companies in England and Wales was 2.1 per cent compared with 8.4 per cent in Scotland. The Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey suggests that businesses are more optimistic that sales and profits will improve this year compared with last year. The survey suggests that confidence has increased significantly since the first quarter of last year, with light industry and the service sector expected to lead a revival in sales over the next three months. Dun &amp; Bradstreet's confidence index has returned to levels last recorded in early 1990 before the recession took hold. The survey shows that nearly 40 per cent of businesses expect profits to rise in the first quarter against 22 per cent expecting a fall. However, in spite of improved expectations about company performance, executives are more cautious than a year ago when optimism about higher sales was unfulfilled. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, which surveyed 1,950 managing directors in the first three weeks of December, said optimism was highest in London, the south-east and the north.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        NEW COMPANY FORMATIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               Eng &amp;       %        Scot         %      Total      %               Wales    change     change     change            change  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1983         91,472     10.2      4,718       12.4    96,190    10.3 1984         92,954      1.6      4,983        5.6    97,937     1.8 1985         99,229      6.7      5,426        8.9   104,655     6.9 1986        111,369     12.2      6,009       10.7   117,378    12.2 1987        122,266      9.8      5,872       -2.3   128,138     9.2 1988        122,288        -      6,894       17.4   129,182     0.8 1989        123,684      1.1      6,794       -1.4   130,478     1.0 1990        114,208     -7.7      6,986        2.8   121,194    -7.1 1991        103,449     -9.4      6,659       -4.7   110,108    -9.1 1992        101,275     -2.1      6,100       -8.4   107,375    -2.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Jordans  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

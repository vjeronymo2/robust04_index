			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> HEARING PLEA ON INSURANCE  </P> <P> With 16 days to go before the Aug. 23 deadline for challenging insurance  company requests to be exempted from Proposition 103 rate rollbacks, Insurance  Commissioner Roxani Gillespie was asked by consumer groups to call for  additional rollback hearings. Although the language of the proposition is  ambiguous, Gillespie's office and the consumer groups say companies for which  hearings are not called by the deadline probably will be legally deemed to have  won their exemptions. So far, Gillespie has called for hearings on only seven  companies and has tentatively ordered $305 million in rollbacks. Harvey  Rosenfeld, chairman of the Voter Revolt group, asked Gillespie to call hearings  for all 445 companies that have applied for exemptions. Gillespie's office said  more hearings will be called, but it did not say how many.  </P></p>

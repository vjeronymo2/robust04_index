			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Food: Weighed in the scales - Giles MacDonogh casts a line to catch some fishy British prejudices WITH Lent upon us, the whole question of fish is raised again. Most people, it would seem, use the religious fast for reasons of vanity; hoping that 40 days of abstinence will shed pounds, or break an ugly habit such as smoking. (The only Roman Catholic I know who is serious about observing Lent is aware that she is not required to fast on Sundays or the one or two religious feast days scattered through the period.) Since the first week of this year I have ordained a self-imposed regimen in an effort to break the monotony of a single man's diet of chops and steaks: I now eat only fish at home. Thus far, in 25 days of fish diet, I have consumed no fewer than 24 sorts of sea life. My search for variety has been vindicated, but there are one or two limitations. Certain fish are impractical for the working man. Squid takes too long to prepare; halibut, sea-bass or lobsters seem too self-indulgently expensive for a man by himself; certain fish, such as turbot, come in too big a chunk. At times one is reduced to the supermarket  -fish trawled on the high seas, deep frozen and tasteless. This is far from ideal, but plaice and cod, of the pis-allers, are decent standbys. (I should add, though, that it has been a long time since I was tempted by a farmed trout.) To a far greater degree than meat-eating, fish-eating seems to be governed by a strong element of snobbery and fashion. Anxious to learn more about this, I went to see Nicky Herman. As owner of the noted fish restaurants Scotts, Overtons, Sheekeys and Drones, Nicky Herman is literally the biggest fish in London. Nicky called John Bertram, his executive chef, to join us. Together, they buy all the fish for the group of restaurants. I asked both men why the British were so pathetic about eating fish, compared to their Continental cousins. 'English people don't like fish bones. They always ask you: 'Has it got bones in it?' Or they ask for their fish to be taken off the bone.' In Scotts - a somewhat plutocratic establishment - Nicky doubted if 10 per cent of customers were prepared to eat a fish with small bones. 'Easy bones' form part of the attraction of halibut, sea-bass and turbot - trendy fish, with snob appeal. Americans, apparently, are not prepared to eat fish with the heads left on after cooking; the idea of being watched by the creature they are consuming is too intimidating. This reminded me that I had cooked a John Dory only a few days before, and that I had been much amused by the doleful way in which the fish had seemed to watch me as I wolfed the flesh from its back. When I had finished my meal, only the lugubrious eye remained in place. There is considerable snobbery directed against the cheaper range of fish - those monsters of the deep which French housewives seem to be able to transform into delicious meals at a moment's notice. Coley was regarded as fish for the cat - and whiting not much better. Hake, which went through a period of trendiness in Paris a decade ago, was also viewed with apparent contempt. The only fish which had gone, as it were, up-market, seemed to be cod. Only a generation ago cod was perceived as a 'below stairs' fish. The British are still extraordinarily conservative about fish. Scotts had tried out very many French classic fish dishes without success: the sea-food platter did not sell; no one had ordered haddock; the omelette Arnold Bennett had been about as easy to sell as a plate of fresh herrings - that is to say, impossible. Nicky and John took me next door to the kitchens, where a selection of that morning's purchases had been laid out. Here were little red gurnards and big red sea-bream ('the Rolls Royce of fishes', according to Nicky). Here lay the hideous monkfish - looking at it, you can see why the Germans call it 'the devil's fish'. Here were sea-bream, hake and whiting; lemon and Dover soles; a Greek sea bass; a multi-coloured parrot fish; one of the season's first wild salmon and a pike. It was interesting to try some of these, simply cooked, unassisted by sauce or seasoning: the dry, straw-textured parrot fish tasted against a delicate, milky sea-bass; a subtle flavoured red sea bream tasted in contrast with the bony pike. Served a la meuniere, a pike's muddy river fish taste was less easy to detect. The interview ended upstairs in Scotts. After some of the largest native oysters I have ever seen - Imperials, from Colchester - I tried some of the new dishes on the 'modern side' of this traditional English fish restaurant: red mullet fillets served with a mix of olive oil, olives, tomatoes, garlic and basil; and a pretty dish of scallops with a finely chopped ratatouille. It seemed as if a distinctly Mediterranean breeze had blown, ruffling the ranks of old colonels who had drifted in to pay homage to their Dover soles at the onset of Lent.

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Parisian exchange studying wheat futures Matif, the French futures and options market, is moving closer to developing a new market for financial derivatives in wheat, its president said yesterday. The decision to launch the new market would depend on liberalisation of the existing regulations controlling the price of wheat and is unlikely to take place for a number of months. Mr Gerard Pfauwadel, Matif president, said: 'Wheat prices are not determined by the market but by technocrats in Brussels. They are still partially subsidised. We are waiting for volatility of prices. We need a market game'. Tomorrow the Matif launches a market in futures for rapeseed, in response to deregulation of the price for oilseeds in 1992. It already operates markets for white sugar and potatoes. Market officials said yesterday they would also consider the possibility of developing futures products in related oilseed products, such as sunflower oil, and in rapeseed options or other derivatives if the rapeseed futures market proved successful. Experts at Matif have been studying the possibility of developing wheat products, but are reliant on the planned liberalisation of the determination of the commodity's prices through reforms to the European Union's common agricultural policy and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Pfauwadel said he believed that one of the few potential growth areas for developing new products at the Matif was in commodities, and particularly agricultural products - reflecting the farming roots of French society.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 5 April, the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC]  announced that beginning this year, it will financially sponsor  the Jose Marti Pioneers organization. Pedro Ross, Politburo  member and secretary general of the CTC, made the announcement  on 4 April in Camaguey following a ceremony marking the  completion of the Jiguey Cayo-Romano Cayo Cruz causeway. Ross  added that the decision was made on the basis of union dues  contributed by the workers and which is their gift to the  youngest organization in Cuba on its 33d anniversary, adding  that 8 million pesos are already earmarked for that goal this  year, thanks to expenditure reductions by the CTC. Ross pointed  out that over the past three years, CTC expenditures have been  less than 30 million pesos, and that in 1993 they were 28  million as the result of reductions in personnel rosters and  other expenditures.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: Moss Bros trimmed 42% at Pounds 2.4m MOSS BROS Group, the menswear retailer and hirer, saw pre-tax profit for the 12 months to January 26 fall by 42 per cent to Pounds 2.39m after a sharp reversal in interest income and property profits. The comparative figure of Pounds 4.09m for the year to January 27 1990 had been helped by an exceptional profit of Pounds 810,000 on the sale of a central Londonproperty. A Pounds 5m tax payment on a 1988 property sale - of a Covent Garden site which netted Pounds 21m - halved interest received during the year to Pounds 768,000 (Pounds 1.49m). Mr Rowland Gee, managing director, said those two factors accounted for about Pounds 1.5m of the Pounds 1.7m fall in pre-tax profit. Operating profit declined by 11 per cent to Pounds 1.68m (Pounds 1.89m). Turnover advanced by 7 per cent to Pounds 54.76m (Pounds 51.11m). The company opened a net five stores, bringing the total to 98 covering 150,000 (140,000) sq ft. Mr Gee said a further 10,000 sq ft of planned expansion was shelved until conditions improved. He claimed the company's share of the men's suit market had risen from 5 to 5.5 per cent as 1,500 menswear shops had closed during the year. Most of the expansion had come from the Suit Co shops, in the mainstream division, where sales rose by just over 19 per cent to Pounds 22.2m (Pounds 18.6m). The more up-market Savoy Taylors Guild chain - the classic division  - grew to about Pounds 17m (Pounds 16.1m). Mr Gee said it had been affected by what Austin Reed described last week as the white-collar recession in the south-east of England. Cecil Gee, the fashion division and the only one of the three chains not to include a suit hire service, inched ahead to Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 13.5m). Costs had, however, been hit by rent reviews where Mr Gee said the Next expansion of the late 1980s had pushed up the 'rental evidence'. Another adverse factor was the uniform business rate, where increases had often been 30 per cent. Payroll costs had been controlled, partly because they were sales and profit related. 'Staff will accept a reduction in numbers more readily if they are paid on commission,'he said. Net cash held on January 26 amounted to Pounds 9m (Pounds 14m). Capital spending had fallen to Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 5m) and would be down again this year. Earnings per share fell to 9.43p, compared with 16.35p including property profit and 13.11p without it. The final dividend is held at 3.5p to give an unchanged total of 5p. The Moss and Gee families hold 49 per cent of the equity.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Contractors warned on bids CONTRACTORS bidding for work in the public sector have been advised by their trade association to ask for an extensive list of information about the existing work-force. The Cleaning and Support Services Association said the information was needed so contractors could assess their potential liabilities if the contract was covered by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations 1981. Where Tupe regulations apply, a contractor must take over the existing workforce at existing pay and conditions. Mr John Hall, CSSA director-general, said that while the regulations did not always apply, there was a risk that they would 'in almost every case', depending on 'fine legal interpretations and on how the contractor decides to perform the work'. As a matter of good commercial practice, bidders needed full details of the potential liabilities they were taking on, he said. The information needed includes a list of all staff employed on the work, their terms and conditions, reckonable service, accrued pension rights and current health.</p>

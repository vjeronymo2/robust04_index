			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Five countries query legality of Thorp permit The government has received inquiries from the European Commission and other European governments about the legality of licensing the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria, it emerged yesterday. Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, told the Commons in a written answer that, since the start of the second public consultation on Thorp in August, the government had received letters from the Irish Republic and Denmark about the application of the European directive on environmental impact assessments to Thorp. He added that Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands had also written to the UK about Thorp and the environmental impact assessments required under international marine pollution recommendations. Ministers are expected to announce within days whether they will give the go-ahead to the Pounds 2.8bn plant. They have already said that they are 'minded' to grant a licence. British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, has said that the alternative of launching a public inquiry could delay start of operation by months and would undermine its profitability. Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, said yesterday: 'It would be nonsense for the government to give the plant the nod only for the European Court to rule it illegal later.' Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group which has mounted court challenges to the government's handling of the Thorp decision, said yesterday it believed that full environmental impact assessments should be carried out before a decision was made.

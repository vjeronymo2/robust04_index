			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> HOUSE PANEL WILL STUDY LAND SWAPS  </P> <P> Two proposed and disputed land swaps within the Santa Monica Mountains National  Recreation Area will be the focus of a May 1 congressional subcommittee hearing  in Washington.  </P> <P> The House Committee on Government Operations' subcommittee on the environment,  energy and natural resources will review potential exchanges involving  federally owned land in Cheeseboro Canyon and Elsmere Canyon, a senior  committee staffer said.  </P> <P> The purpose of the hearing, which is expected to be the first in a series, will  be to assess whether proper procedures exist within the departments of the  Interior and Agriculture to properly consider proposed intrastate land swaps  nationwide.  </P> <P> "We're trying to look at the standards that are used to make intrastate  exchanges," said the aide, who spoke on condition that he not be named.  </P> <P> He noted that the General Accounting Office, Congress' research arm, "has  consistently pointed out that there is a deficiency in the kind of written  procedure and practice" on previous land-swap deals. However, he added, the  selection of the proposed Los Angeles-area land swaps does not mean that the  subcommittee has found problems with them.  </P></p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Collor impeachment process begins: Brazilian lawyers and journalists accuse president of 'losing moral authority' BRAZIL'S first impeachment process was set in motion yesterday with a formal petition to the president of Congress against President Fernando Collor, who has been linked to a multi-million-dollar corruption scandal. The request was presented by the heads of the Brazilian Bar Association and Journalists' Association in an emotional ceremony in the Green Room of Congress. The room was packed with congressmen, union leaders and journalists. The 20-page document accused Mr Collor of 'losing all moral authority to govern the country' and of 'sullying the image of the state'. The impeachment request is the first formal step to ending Mr Collor's mandate and comes only half way through his five-year term. The president's determination not to resign means the country now faces weeks of political uncertainty and economic paralysis. The charges against Mr Collor, elaborated in the request, include 'lying to the nation' and receiving - along with his wife, ex-wife and mother - 'huge quantities of money and goods of illicit origin', through a scheme of 'phantom account holders and 'trafficking of influence' by Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, his friend and former campaign treasurer. The petition follows publication of a damning congressional report concluding a three-month probe into Mr Farias' activities. This report was initiated after accusations against the president by Mr Collor's younger brother. It has provoked widespread calls for the president's resignation or impeachment. Few believe Mr Collor can survive the impeachment process and he is growing increasingly isolated in the battle to save his political career. His ministers have made clear in an official note that they are only staying on for the sake of the country. Last night members of the Liberal Front, Mr Collor's remaining supporters, were meeting to discuss withdrawing their backing. A commission will now be set up by Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, the president of Congress, which will meet for 10 days to decide whether to accept the impeachment request. If accepted, it goes to the lower house where Mr Collor has 20 days to present a defence before a vote is taken. A two-thirds majority is needed for approval, at which stage Mr Collor would be suspended for 180 days while he is judged by the Senate. Mr Pinheiro expects the congressional vote to occur this month. Mr Collor may also face a legal process. Yesterday the congressional report on corruption, together with more than 40,000 cheques which were used as evidence, were taken to the office of the attorney-general, who will decide whether to take legal action.</p>

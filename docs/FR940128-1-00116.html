			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> To minimize the variation in salt content of the fish, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency is recommending in section 5.f. of Example 6 of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix that only fish of the same species and of similar size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and similar weight be brined in the same tank (Refs. 171 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 199). Because reuse of brine solutions is a possible route of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microbial contamination of raw fish, the agency is providing in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 5.g. of Example 6 of this appendix that brines not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reused unless they have been processed in some way to return them  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a microbiological quality equivalent to the original, unused  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brine made with potable water and food-grade salt. The agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also providing in section 5.h. of Example 6 of this appendix that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a processor may rinse the brined fish with fresh water to remove  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any unwanted excess salt on the exterior of the fish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Drying.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Fish that are to be processed as smoked or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smoke-flavored fish are dried after brining to remove excess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water and prevent dripping during smoking. The drying process,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> usually of several hours in duration, provides another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity for microbial growth. Therefore, to minimize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity for microbial growth by reducing those conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would provide a favorable environment for such growth, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency is providing in section 5.i. of Example 6 of this appendix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the presmoking drying step should be conducted in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigerated room (Ref. 46).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Smoking. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Smoke deposition, like water-phase salt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content, is very difficult to control. Constituents of smoke  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> called ``inhibitory compounds'' (such as phenolic compounds) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported to have a bactericidal effect (Ref. 177). Factors that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect the quantity of inhibitory compounds deposited on the fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface and the degree of penetration by those compounds into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fish are the humidity in the smoking chamber, the temperature of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smoking, and the air flow in the smoking chamber (Ref. 178).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Decreased levels of inhibitory compounds reduce the preservative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of the smoke and make dependence on these compounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadvisable (Ref. 178). In general, smoked products are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shelf stable and must be either refrigerated at a temperature of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (4.4  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) or lower or frozen immediately after processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Refs. 43, 45, and 178).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To promote uniform deposition of smoke, heat exposure, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dehydration, and to ensure that on completion of these processes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fish do not contain any raw or wet sections that would create  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an environment favorable for microbial growth and spoilage, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency is providing in section 5.j. of Example 6 of this appendix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that fish should be arranged in the smokehouse chamber or oven so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that they are not overcrowded or touching each other, and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only fish of like size and weight should be included in a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> batch of fish for smoking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Liquid smoke, a solution of wood smoke that, when diluted,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be used to impart a smoke flavor to fish products, is often  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used as an alternative to generated smoke. Liquid smoke has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported to have similar antibacterial properties to, and some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advantages over, generated smoke (Ref. 26). It is easier to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply uniformly, and the inhibitory compounds penetrate further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the fish flesh (Ref. 26). Liquid smoke, generated smoke, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a combination of liquid smoke and generated smoke needs to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied to all surfaces of fish to be smoked. Liquid smoke may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be applied to the product before, at the commencement of, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the process, while generated smoke needs to be applied to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fish during the first half of the process and longer if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary (Refs. 178 and 179). If a combination of liquid smoke  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and generated smoke is used, the method for use of liquid smoke  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be followed, and the generated smoke may be applied at any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stage of the process (Ref. 26). The agency is providing for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of liquid smoke alone or in combination with generated smoke  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in section 3.c.2. of Example 6 of this appendix to impart smoke  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flavor and antibacterial properties to the products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Use of sodium nitrite. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Use of sodium nitrite in smoked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and smoke-flavored fish products is limited to the species listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;172.175 (21 CFR 172.175) and to chubs in &sect;172.177 (21 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 172.177). Section 172.175 permits the use of sodium nitrite as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preservative and color fixative in cured, smoked sablefish,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salmon, and shad. However, it requires that the level of sodium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nitrite in the final product not exceed 200 ppm. Use of sodium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nitrite substantially reduces the level of salt necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inhibit outgrowth of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> C. botulinum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> type A and type E spores,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although the levels vary because of the difference in heat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance between the two types of spores (Ref. 179). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity of sodium nitrite necessary to achieve inhibition is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by both the level of contamination and the resistance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the spores (Refs. 179 and 180). Refrigeration of the finished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product at temperatures of 40  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (4.4  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) or below is necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to retain the inhibitory characteristic gained through use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sodium nitrite (Ref. 179). Therefore, in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of &sect;&sect;172.175 and 172.177, the agency is proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide for the use of sodium nitrite in the processing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging of smoked and smoke-flavored fish in section 5.a. and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 5.b. of Example 6 of this appendix.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

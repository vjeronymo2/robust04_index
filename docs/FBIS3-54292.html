That  was the first reaction to the document announced by the National  Dialogue Committee for the settlement of the crisis between  Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali  Salim al-Bid. Brig. Gen. Baras also requested a percentage of  the oil royalties for Hadramaut. Observers fear that that  demand might hinder the agreement as the Follow-up Committee  holds its first meeting today to name the venue and set a date  for the signing of the agreement by the Yemeni president, vice  president, and House of Representatives Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah  Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar.    In his capacity as chairman of the national conference in  the  governorate of Hadramaut, Brig. Gen. Baras told AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT that the document was not as broad as we had expected.  He urged reconsideration on the question of the percentage that  the governorate or district should get of the oil and mineral  wealth it produces and of its fishing resources, no matter how  small.    Speaking on behalf of the Hadramaut Governorate, the biggest  governorate and richest in oil, fish, and agricultural products,  Brig. Gen. Baras said that giving a reasonable portion of the  revenues of the wealth produced by each governorate to that  governorate was a point included in the recommendations and  demands of the Hadramaut national conference held in  mid-December.    Baras is a veteran politician who recently resigned from the  General Committee (Central Committee) of the General People's  Congress led by Yemen's president because of the party's  policies resulting in the country's crisis. He said: The  districts should be granted more powers including promulgation  of laws to safeguards many rights of the inhabitants. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION OF REP. FRANK VOTED BY PANEL  </P> <P> The House Ethics Committee voted Tuesday to conduct a preliminary investigation  of Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who has acknowledged employing a male  prostitute as a personal aide after initially hiring him for sex.  </P> <P> Although Frank had formally sought the investigation, the committee chairman,  Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), told reporters that the decision "was not  based on his request" but on the panel's own initiative.  </P> <P> Frank welcomed the action, saying the matter "is now before the proper forum"  and promising to "cooperate fully with the committee as it proceeds with its  deliberations."  </P> <P> Dixon said the investigation was prompted by "the assertions surrounding Barney  Frank's employment of Mr. Steve Gobie."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Admitted Hiring  </P> <P> Frank, a leading congressional liberal and acknowledged homosexual, has  admitted hiring Gobie, initially for sex and then from July, 1985, through  August, 1987, as a housekeeper-driver paid from the lawmaker's own funds.  </P> <P> The committee resolution said the panel was "aware of assertions relating to  the conduct of Rep. Barney Frank in connection with his employment of a  personal assistant." The panel "has determined that the matters merit further  inquiry," the resolution added.  </P> <P> The committee vote began the first round of the House's internal disciplinary  process, and will determine whether a more complete investigation is necessary.  The panel, officially the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, can issue  subpoenas and take testimony during the preliminary stage.  </P> <P> Gobie has said in interviews that he used Frank's Capitol Hill apartment to run  a prostitution ring with the lawmaker's knowledge.  </P></p>

Popov pointed out that the crisis in the country has  exacerbated. According to preliminary data, the gross domestic  produce in 1993 was just over 104 trillion [figure as received]  karbovantsi, down 15 percent from 1992.    On the subject of privatization, Popov noted that the  process  of privatization accelerated at the end of last year. Of the  total number of the facilities privatized, 1,070 were  state-owned and 1,554 in communal ownership.    As for the official karbovanets exchange rate, Popov  informed  the audience it was planned that the karbovanets exchange rate  would be raised to 16,000 karbovantsi to a dollar this year by  increasing production, maintaining coal prices throughout the  year, and lowering the norm of money income by 20 to 25 percent.    It was envisaged that prices this year would rise by 4.45  percent.    It was also envisaged that 28 million tonnes of oil, almost  84 billion cubic meters of gas, and 16.8 million tonnes of coal  would be imported and 437 million dollars worth of nuclear fuel  purchased this year. [passage omitted]    Finance Minister Hryhoriy Pyatachenko reported on the draft  state budget for 1994.    The budget submitted makes no provision for deficit, with  both its revenue and expenditure at 352.1 trillion karbovantsi.    In the budget, it is planned that 112 trillion karbovantsi,  or 37.6 percent, will be allocated to social security and the  socio-cultural sphere, 37.4 trillion to education, almost 100  trillion to financing the national economy, and almost 16.9  trillion to defense needs. Provision is made for an additional  1 trillion to be allocated to eliminating and reducing strategic  offensive arms. It is planned that 15.8 trillion will be  allocated to the needs of Chernobyl.    Three trillion karbovantsi were allocated to the needs of  executive power and 384.4 billion to the maintenance of the  Supreme Council.

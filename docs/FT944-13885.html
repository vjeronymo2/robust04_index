			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Japan index recovers to 7-year high Japan's official index of current business conditions hit a seven-year high in August, suggesting the recovery may be becoming more broadly based. The government Economic Planning Agency's coincident indicator, a basket of 11 economic and business measures, rose above the 50 per cent dividing line between growth and decline in August for the first time in three months. It hit 90 per cent, the highest since July 1987. This eases pressure on the Bank of Japan to cut interest rates, when the yen is strengthening again, and reduces strain on the government in the middle of a difficult parliamentary session. The EPA's leading indicator, a measure of the three-to-six-month outlook, was even stronger, at 100 per cent, the eighth month at which it has stood above economic equilibrium. Within this, 10 of the leading index's 13 components were pointing upwards. This suggests the current upturn has more depth than the economic revival of spring 1993, which turned out to be a false start, Mr Dick Beason, senior economist at James Capel Pacific, said. Four components of the leading index shifted from decline to growth between July and August: graduates' job prospects, the amount of floorspace used by companies, money supply, and manufacturing industry profitability. Most of the other components continued a regular improvement. Evidence that patches of weakness still exist in important parts of the Japanese economy emerged yesterday with poor results from the vehicle and department stores sectors. Vehicle production fell 7.2 per cent to 5.1m units in the six months to September, from the same period last year - the third-sharpest six-monthly fall in 20 years, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said. Department stores, a victim of discount retailing, recorded a 2.1 per cent sales decline in the year to September, the 31st monthly decline running. But it was an improvement on the 3.6 per cent decline shown in August. Stores' business continues to crawl, the Japan Department Stores Association said. The cabinet yesterday adopted a plan to spend Y6,010bn (Pounds 38bn) to prepare rice farmers for the gradual opening of their market. The package, prepared by the three parties of the ruling coalition, clears the way for parliament to ratify the trade liberalisation bills needed to comply with the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

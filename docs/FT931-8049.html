			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Mark of evil on Adam's Apple: Dominic Lawson investigates the apparent rise in violence by Britain's young THE Black Museum is the name given to a long dank room in the basement of New Scotland Yard. In it are collected exhibits of some of the ghastliest crimes and punishments. The Black Museum is not open to the general public, but instead provides an afternoon's diversion for groups of people who have professional contact with the police, such as solicitors, and, it must be admitted, journalists. Just below the ceiling, by the door, is a row of death masks of the heads and necks of rather non-descript looking men. If the police are hunters, these are some of their trophies. The policeman showing visitors round is inclined to ask the question: 'Can you see any common factor in the appearance of these men?' The answer, given with relish, is: 'They all have crushed Adam's Apples.' The trophies are the death masks taken of criminals who had just been hanged. The original reason for the taking of death masks of criminals in the 19th century was, in fact, to find some common factor of physiognomy, in particular of the skull. At that time the fashionable idea in criminal pathology was that not only was there such a thing as a criminal mind; there was also a criminal face. Not surprisingly the criminal face was supposed to be somewhat ape-like, with a low brow, and small, narrow set eyes. The idea was that policemen would come into the Black Museum, study the skulls, and look for similar characteristics among suspects. Nowadays we laugh at such methods of detection. But the inspector plods of the 19th century did not have DNA testing to aid them in their hunt for the guilty men. And perhaps there is a case for returning to the idea of, if not the criminal face, at least that of the criminal cerebellum. The country has been shocked by an apparent wave of crime among the young. The police have arrested two boys of 10 in connection with the kidnapping and murder last weekend of a two-year-old Liverpool toddler, James Bulger. On Tuesday the newspapers reported the case of a 13 year old boy who is alleged to have stolen more than 200 cars. He is being held in a Pounds 500-a-day 'secure unit', more than 300 miles from his home. The boy was taken from court in handcuffs. On the same day the case was also reported of a 15 year old schoolboy, Stuart Smith, who broke into the home of a 23 year old mother, and, at knifepoint, raped and assaulted her over a period of two hours. The schoolboy threatened to kill the woman's one year old child, if she did not submit. At one point the child woke up, and the boy sexually assaulted the mother as she attempted to comfort the infant. Fortunately, the judge who recently freed another 15 year old rapist with the recommendation that he pay Pounds 500 to give the victim 'a good holiday' was not presiding over this case. Stuart Smith was ordered to be detained for life. These, and other cases have started a process of national self-examination, to find out why we are breeding a new class of sadistic killers. Probably we are not. It is not so much that crime is increasing among the young, as that the reports of it have become far less heavily censored than in the past. Forty years ago the newspapers would talk only of 'serious offences' in the reporting of crimes of an unnatural sexual nature. Nowadays even The Daily Telegraph uses the word 'buggery' when covering such matters. And assaults on little children, with or without the social workers' invented category of 'Satanic Ritual' are also traditional English pursuits, like fox-hunting and pigeon-fancying. As Brian Masters, a specialist in the field of criminal analysis, wrote in my own magazine last week: 'A statute in the reign of Henry II fixed the age of consent at ten, which presupposes that sexual contact with young girls, even perhaps with girls under ten, was then common, if it had to be prohibited by law.' I suspect that single parent families, now widely - and with some reason - touted as the source of youthful criminal excess, were not so widespread in the days of Henry II. Nor was the sentencing of youthful offenders particularly lax in medieval England. As the novelist Sally Emerson wrote this week in The Times: 'Even among the very young there are children who are simply bad. Certain children show a savagery, even as babies, which is frightening. Their parents, interestingly, are unable to see the evil others witness.' Primitive stuff. Perhaps it is time for the police to dust off those death masks in the Black Museum, and bring them up into the light, for the public good. Dominic Lawson is Editor of The Spectator.</p>

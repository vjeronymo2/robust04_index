			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Observer: Stay tooned? Has Ted Turner, the founder of Cable News Network, the world's first 24-hour news network, joined the establishment at last? The question is raised by CNN's failure to relay a major scoop - its interview with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, on Larry King Live - direct to its European audience. The interview ran a day later and CNN used an actor to mouth Adams' comments. So much for the idea that CNN has redefined news from 'something that has happened to something that is happening'. Hard to believe that CNN, which put its reputation on the line by reporting from Baghdad at the height of the Gulf war, was kow-towing to the silly laws which prohibit the BBC and ITV from broadcasting Adams' comments. CNN International said yesterday that there was nothing unusual about its behaviour. It has been based in London since 1985 and is licensed by the Independent Television Commission, so it has always abided by Britain's censorship rules. Perhaps. But there must be a sneaking suspicion that a news network which can be watched by up to 1bn people doesn't want to jeopardise its chances of increasing the European penetration of lucrative ventures, such as its cartoon network, by upsetting officialdom.</p>

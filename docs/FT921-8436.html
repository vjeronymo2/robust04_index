			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Deng pledges to continue economic reform CHINA'S paramount leader Deng Xiaoping says his country's commitment to economic reform must last for a century, a Beijing-funded Hong Kong newspaper reported yesterday, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Deng also promised the southern province of Guangdong that it could become Asia's fifth economic 'dragon' within 20 years, the newspaper Wen Wei Po said. Deng has recently toured the province's special economic zones, Zhuhai and Shenzhen. He noted the success of the booming province but said it must work harder and faster to catch up with the four dragons - the dynamic economies of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea. In a clear signal that the push for economic reform does not include any hint of political change, Wen Wei Po said Deng supported 'grasping two things at once', economic opening and control of spiritual values. Deng and his supporters believe economic reform is possible without the Communist Party surrendering power. The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union has apparently convinced Beijing that to survive, the Chinese Communist Party must push ahead with economic reforms while suppressing political dissent.</p>

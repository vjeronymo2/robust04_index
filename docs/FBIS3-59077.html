			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] In an article in the 31 December Lisbon  independent noted political commentator Antonio Pinto Leite  focuses on the five personalities who, in his opinion, are  likely to exert a significant influence on Portuguese politics  in 1994.    -- While still beset by his conflict with President Mario  Soares, Prime Minister Cavaco Silva succeeded in limiting the  victory of the Socialist Party (PS) in the municipal elections;  however, he is concerned about a possible future alliance  between the PS and the Communist Party (PCP), Pinto Leite  believes. The prime minister is also tight-lipped about a  possible presidential run. Although a Social Democratic Party  (PSD) congress is planned for 1994, it may be postponed for the  first quarter of 1995, adding to the uncertainty. If it takes  place on schedule, the PSD will know whether its leadership will  change, and the country will find out whether the era of  "absolute majority" may have ended.    -- President Mario Soares will continue to be influential in  1994, Pinto Leite contends, "preoccupied with how best to  complicate the government's life and how to convince PS leader  Antonio Guterres to conclude an alliance with the communists."  In addition, he will "subtly feed the social conflict" to deny  Cavaco Silva the success of a "social contract" that would be  beneficial to the prime minister in the 1995 elections. An  unknown at this time is whether an "enervated" and impatient  Soares will provoke "unexpected situations," Pinto Leite  concludes.    -- Despite his gains in the municipal elections, PS leader  Antonio Guterres did not achieve his dream of becoming the "key  to the system." It would have allowed him to "sensibly" ask the  president not to dissolve the Parliament and let the PSD become  increasingly attrited. Guterres seems determined to eschew an  alliance with the PCP for the 1995 legislative elections and  expects that the Center Social Democratic Party (CDS) will steal  enough votes from the PSD on the right to put an end to the  latter's absolute majority.    -- In Pinto Leite's opinion, new Minister of Finance Eduardo  Catroga will play a key role in 1994, as his realism and  cautiousness, coupled with his use of "simple and direct"  concepts, may lead to the hoped-for economic recovery.    -- CDS leader Manuel Monteiro, who will probably run in the  Euroelections to test his power, has so radicalized his  discourse that he is now accused of extreme rightist views,  Pinto Leite affirms. While this is untrue, it indicates that  Monteiro has abandoned the moderation of his first months in  office. He may perhaps be the recipient of more hopes from the  left than from the right, Pinto Leite continues, because the PS  will be unable to end the PSD's absolute preponderance without  his help. If 1994 is favorable to Monteiro, Cavaco Silva ought  to worry, he concludes.</p>

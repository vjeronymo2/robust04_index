			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Hepworth Hepworth is a classic recovery stock whose shares have seemingly sprinted too far ahead of recovery. Its share price has risen 48 per cent since October's low; the market seems uncertain where it should head next. Ratings across the building materials sector look heavy on this year's numbers. Longer term, though, they may prove meagre. Just as shareholders were caught out by the steepness of the downturn, they may well be surprised by the recovery. The market value of the entire building materials sector is equivalent to that of British Gas. It requires an extremely dim view of the UK economy to believe the sector's shares will not outperform on a three-year basis. There are special factors at play at Hepworth. Its big presence in deteriorating continental European markets is the most significant. These activities, which account for 48 per cent of trading profits, are a lasting strength. They could, however, prove a short term embarrassment. Patient shareholders should nevertheless be rewarded. Hepworth's shares currently stand on a multiple of just nine times peak historic earnings. No one pretends its markets will recover their former buoyancy for many years, if ever, but Hepworth's severe cost-cutting should ensure far higher profitability on incremental sales increases.</p>

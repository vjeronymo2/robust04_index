			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MOTHERS BEARING CAMERAS TAKE ON SPEED DEMONS  </P> <P> The 800 block of San Clemente's Calle Vallarta used to be a quiet, dead-end  street where parents could let their children play with little fear of passing  traffic.  </P> <P> But 2 years ago, the hillside street was opened to connect with a new housing  tract, and Calle Vallarta became a blazing raceway, with frenetic commuters  speeding up to 50 m.p.h. through the 25-m.p.h. residential zone, residents  said.  </P> <P> The neighborhood's baby population exploded at the same time, increasing from  about eight to two dozen. Suddenly, residents said, there was a much greater  danger to toddlers.  </P> <P> Enter the "vigilante mothers."  </P> <P> First, the group of seven called police and begged for more enforcement of the  neighborhood's speed limit.  </P> <P> When the understaffed Police Department failed to assign more patrols, the  mothers took it upon themselves to try to slow traffic.  </P> <P> Beginning about a year ago, they stood on both sides of the street and shouted  at speeding motorists to slow down.  </P> <P> When this tactic was greeted with an occasional obscenity, one mother began  videotaping offending drivers, threatening to turn the tape over to the police  for prosecution.  </P> <P> Finally, 2 months ago, the mothers resorted to even more desperate measures.  They scrawled their own speed limit signs -- with such not-so-subtle messages  as "Slow Down" or "You Are Being Videotaped" -- and staked them out in their  front yards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> City Began Crackdown  </P> <P> That got the city's attention. Several weeks ago, workers painted double yellow  stripes down the middle of the street to deter motorists from using both lanes  while rounding corners on the hill. They also posted an official speed limit  sign. Police began conducting radar checks on the street, with Police Chief  Albert C. Ehlow himself sitting in on one occasion.  </P> <P> With the county's explosive growth, other communities have had similar  problems, with the frequency of accidents involving pedestrians increasing.  </P> <P> According to California Highway Patrol statistics, fatal county accidents in  which pedestrians were killed by automobiles increased to 64 in 1988, from 51  in 1987. Automobile-related pedestrian injuries increased from 996 to 1055 in  the same period, according to the CHP.  </P> <P> At UC Irvine, Dr. Phyllis Agran has been researching traffic-related injuries  to children since 1980. Because some drivers zip through residential areas  regardless of posted speed limits, Agran said it is important for parents to  take special precautions with their children, especially toddlers, who are at a  greater risk of being injured as traffic increases in once-quiet areas.  </P> <P> "Anytime you mix children with vehicles and increase the number of vehicles,  you're going to increase the risk of injury to children," she said.  </P> <P> "The best way of preventing injuries is separating the children from the  vehicles. Parents have to retrain their children that they cannot go in the  street."  </P> <P> Agran also suggested riding bicycles only on sidewalks and wearing helmets;  taking children to play in parks, and dressing school-age children in  reflective clothing if they have to be out in the dark.  </P> <P> On Calle Vallarta, thanks to the activism of residents, motorists are slowing  down.  </P> <P> On April 5, Linda Smith, 44, mother of a 3-year-old boy and  </P> <P> leader of the Calle Vallarta mothers' group, appeared before the City Council  seeking continued city support for her neighborhood's speeding problem.  </P> <P> The council was receptive, with Mayor Brian J. Rice asking Smith to report back  about whether the city's speed control measures have helped to slow traffic.  </P> <P> "I've got to commend them," Rice said of the mothers. "They definitely got our  attention -- and I'm glad."  </P> <P> Marcia Markley, one of the mothers, said the vigilante tactics probably  prevented a serious accident.  </P> <P> "If we hadn't gotten as far as we had, there's no doubt in my mind that there  would have been a tragic accident," said Markley, 38, mother of 8-month-old and  3-year-old sons. "The main thing is not to make people aware after the fact,  when a child is fighting for life in a hospital."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hard to Keep Out of Street  </P> <P> But Markley said that while she and the other mothers impress upon their  children the importance of not going into the street, that does not always keep  them from doing so.  </P> <P> "You're dealing with a child under 3 years old," Markley said. "If they just  happen to forget, that could be it. I mean, you're talking paralyzed for life  or killed, because of the way they (vehicles) fly through here -- so fast I  sometimes can't even get the license plates."  </P> <P> Calle Vallarta's speeding predicament is typical of many neighborhoods in the  rapidly growing south county, where dead-end streets are opened to provide  access to new tracts.  </P> <P> In San Clemente, where residential growth has been exploding in the rugged  hills in the east of town, Chief Ehlow said he has received speeding complaints  from many neighborhoods.  </P> <P> None, he added, have become involved to the extent of the residents on Calle  Vallarta.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Few Days of Tickets  </P> <P> The customary police response to speeding complaints, he said, is to dispatch  officers to a neighborhood for a few days to write tickets.  </P> <P> But Ehlow said the department, already understaffed by seven positions, does  not have the manpower to spend much time on a street such as Calle Vallarta,  with the city's 40 police officers kept busy tending to the problems in areas  more heavily trafficked by the city's 37,000 residents.  </P> <P> "We go out and we work it as we can," Ehlow said, adding that officers will  return periodically to Calle Vallarta.  </P> <P> Calle Vallarta used to be so quiet, residents said, that children safely flew  kites in the middle of the street. When the street was opened up, Smith said,  motorists on their way to the new Seaside Estates tract atop the hill would  "gun it" to build momentum for the final steep grade. Since the 800 block of  Calle Vallarta lies on flat terrain between two steep grades, Smith said it  became a favorite spot to accelerate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Accident Dramatized Danger  </P> <P> Although there have been no serious traffic injuries reported on the street  since the upper Calle Vallarta housing tract was built nearly 10 years ago,  Smith said a non-injury accident 2 months ago dramatized the potential danger.  </P> <P> An elderly man, test-driving a new luxury-model automobile, reportedly had a  blowout and lost control, crashing into a park area where children play. The  vehicle sustained only minor damage, but Smith and other residents -- who  believe the man was speeding -- said the accident could have been worse.  </P> <P> In recent days, residents and police agree, traffic has slowed dramatically.  Ehlow said officers he has posted have cited violators only sporadically in  recent days.  </P> <P> "I sat there myself for almost an hour," Ehlow said. "I counted 16 cars going  down the hill and five up the hill, and none were speeding."  </P> <P> Several residents of the Seaside Estates tract above Calle Vallarta said the  activism of their neighbors downhill had deterred them from speeding.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Slamming on the Brakes  </P> <P> "I find myself slamming on my brakes if I do 30," said Lori Twilegar, 26, a  Seaside Estates resident.  </P> <P> The Calle Vallarta mothers are still not entirely satisfied. Although traffic  has slowed, Smith said she is worried that it will speed back up as soon as the  city diverts its attention from the neighborhood.  </P> <P> And with summer coming and teen-agers out of school, Smith said the city needs  to keep on top of the problem, perhaps by installing speed bumps,  children-at-play signs and maybe another speed limit sign or two.  </P> <P> "My fear is," she said, "that we will see this speeding continue."  </P></p>

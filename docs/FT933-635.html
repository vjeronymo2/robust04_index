			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Automation helps margins as Metalrax edges up to Pounds 3.4m METALRAX, the engineering components, housewares and storage equipment group, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.32m to Pounds 3.41m in the six months to June 30. Mr Eric Moore, managing director, said this was a pleasing result 'in the current economic climate and in the engineering sector', and, he added, 'despite 'costdown' (price reduction) in automotive and housewares'. Group turnover edged ahead to Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 30m). Mr Moore said that margins had been 'retained mostly through automation' - in the past four years capital expenditure had exceeded Pounds 20m and that level of outlay was not likely to decrease, he said. Net cash balances rose from Pounds 6m at the end of 1992 to Pounds 6.5m at June 30. Mr Moore said that the pre-tax profits figure would have been Pounds 50,000 better had it not been for the decline in interest rates. Mr John Wardle, chairman, said there had been 'an increase in the number of suitable businesses appearing' and that acquisition announcements were a 'possibility before Christmas'. Mr Moore said that heads of agreement had been signed with two such possibilities - one in housewares and the other in precision components, but both bringing complementary ranges to the group's products. They would be cash and equity deals, he said, and would not use up all the cash pile. He added that discussions were continuing with two other companies, but at a less advanced stage. In terms of turnover and profits, precision components accounted for 50 per cent, housewares 30 per cent, and storage and materials handling equipment 20 per cent. Earnings per share edged up to 2.8p (2.7p) and the interim dividend is lifted 10 per cent to 1p (0.91p adjusted for May's scrip issue).</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: CU France set to raise motor premiums The French arm of Commercial Union, one of the UK's biggest composite insurers, is set to raise motor premiums by up to 10 per cent next spring as part of an effort to increase profitability, writes Andrew Jack. Commercial Union France, known as Victoire before it was acquired by the UK insurer over the summer, also plans to merge its operations in France in an effort to cut costs. Commercial Union yesterday reported worldwide pre-tax profits of Pounds 305m (Dollars 488m) for the first nine months of the year, nearly double the amount for the same period last year. CU France reported total premium income up 16 per cent to FFr19.7bn (Dollars 3.7bn) for the first three quarters. Life income rose 20 per cent to FFr13.1bn and non-life 5 per cent to FFr6.5bn. Mr Bernard Pottier, director general of Commercial Union Assurances, one of the main subsidiaries, said he expected motor premiums to rise by between 8 and 10 per cent next April.</p>

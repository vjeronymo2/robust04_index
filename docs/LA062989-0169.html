			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> PEOPLE: LUCKY STORES' EX-CHIEF WILL JOIN SEQUOIA  </P> <P> John M. Lillie, who stepped down April 30 as chairman and chief executive of  Lucky Stores, will join a Northern California investment firm as of Saturday.  </P> <P> Lillie, 52, a Stanford MBA with experience in forest products, printing and  bulk chemicals, will become a general partner of Sequoia Associates, with  responsibility for seeking out acquisitions.  </P> <P> The other general partners are William D. Walsh and Robert A. Ferris, who  worked with Lillie at Arcata Corp., a printing and redwood forest products  company.  </P> <P> Sequoia Associates, based in Menlo Park, has interests in printing, heavy  equipment manufacturing, forestry and agricultural operations, food  manufacturing, photographic supplies and training and education.  </P> <P> It holds controlling stakes in a number of companies, including Pacific Fruit  Growers-Packers in Wenatchee, Wash., and Sequoia Pacific Systems in Exeter,  Calif., which prints labels, business forms and election ballots and builds  ballot machines. It also prints the All-Star baseball ballot forms.  </P> <P> While at Lucky, Lillie weathered a 1986 hostile takeover effort by New York  investor Asher B. Edelman that prompted a dramatic overhaul of the Dublin,  Calif., food retailer. To fend off Edelman, Lucky sold its money-losing Gemco  stores, sold or spun off some specialty retailing chains and paid a one-time  dividend to shareholders.  </P> <P> Within months, Wall Street analysts began applauding Lucky's return to  profitability. The company's successful policy of offering consistently low  prices and shunning double coupons and other costly marketing gimmicks last  year drew the unwanted attention of rival American Stores, which operates Alpha  Beta.  </P> <P> Last June, Lucky succumbed to a $2.6-billion acquisition by American Stores.  Although Lillie was viewed as a possible contender for a top post at American  Stores, that was not to be, and he resigned once it appeared that American  Stores would win approval to merge Alpha Beta and Lucky under the Lucky banner.  However, American Stores continues to be stymied by an antitrust challenge by  California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp.  </P> <P> Before joining Lucky in 1979, Lillie was president and chief executive of  Leslie Salt Co. in Newark, Calif. Earlier, he was with General Paper Corp., a  subsidiary of Boise Cascade Corp. MARTHA GROVES  </P></p>

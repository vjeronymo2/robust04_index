			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, member </F> of the Presidential Council, by Qatari News Agency, via  telephone from Doha; date not given]    [Text] His Eminence Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, member  of the Presidential Council in the Republic of Yemen, has blamed  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] for the outbreak of the current  fighting. He explained that the government had done everything  in its power to prevent the present clash, and even offered  "major concessions." The YSP, however, proceeded to escalate to  crisis, until it has reached the point where it is today. Shaykh  'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani revealed, in a telephone interview with  the Qatar News Agency, that the pro-secession forces in the  South were receiving outside aid. He expressed his doubt,  however, that the secessionists would be able to take advantage  of this assistance. In his interview, al-Zandani criticized some  of the Arab media for the way they were covering the events in  Yemen, and called upon them to check their accuracy in the  treatment of these events. He also called for a clear and strong  Arab position that supported "truth and constitutional  legitimacy." In this connection, the Presidential Council member  lauded Qatar's position on the Yemen crisis, saying that "our  brothers in Qatar have stood with us in our predicament, and  stood with truth, unity, and legitimacy." Shaykh al-Zandani said  in the interview that the forces of legitimacy and unity were in  a secure position, and that they were now very close to Aden. He  categorically denied the rumors about the presence of other Arab  forces fighting alongside them.    Responding to a question about the background of the events,  Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani said in his Qatar News Agency  interview that the Socialist Party that had ruled the southern  part of Yemen for 23 years, and that the communist regime had  used the union as a cover, after the fall of the communist  parties of other countries of the world, though they still were  working for secession, and retained their hegemony over the  southern and eastern governorates. They had, he said, spent the  funds allocated to them, and budgets, for services benefiting  their party, and never cared about the union.    He added that the Socialist Party had never changed its  agenda, even now, and still acted in line with the philosophy of  struggle and the existence of contradiction, which it fed in  creating the crisis. Furthermore, it still had a factory making  alcoholic beverages, and encouraged sectarian, tribal, and party  conflicts.    He went on to say, "Then this party began to mortgage its  policy to foreign interests and lost its appetite for the unity  of Yemen, people, land, and government. So the crisis flared  up." He said that the instigator of the crisis was 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, who started it after his return from America on last 19  August, while the House of Representatives had put its trust in  the coalition government on the third of that month.    He added that 'Ali Salim al-Bid had begun to escalate the  crisis after his "seclusion in Aden." He made life hard for  people, until the crisis reached the point of military  engagements. He said that the government had offered concessions  that deserved consideration in order to avert collapse, but in  spite of them the explosion took place in Abyan on the day the  "Pledge and Accord Document" was signed.    In his interview, His Excellency Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid  al-Zandani enumerated many facts as evidence that it was the  Socialist Party that had started the trouble and brought things  to where they were now. He said that the Socialists were behind  the fighting that took place in Shabwah, 'Umran, and Dhamar,  between units of the armed forces. He said that the government  had done everything in its power to contain these events, and  keep their scope as narrow as possible, but the Socialist Party  was engaged in plans to stir up and escalate the fighting in  several regions, and this forced the government to take steps to  protect its army and people, and to protect the union and the  legitimate government.    The president of the Yemeni Presidential Council indicated,  however, in his answer to a question, that there was a large  anti-secession group in the Socialist Party, which opposed the  party's plans, and its voice was now being heard against the  leadership. He said, "We wanted the Socialist Party to change  its ideological and political conduct, to bury the past, and to  resume a good life, but it utterly rejected this opportunity."    In response to a question about whether it would be possible  for the government to deal with the Socialist Party in the event  the party's leadership changed, he said, "The government has  laid down conditions for that, the first of which is that we  cannot put down our arms unless the rebels submit to the  legitimate government and the results of the April 1993  elections. And they must turn over war criminals for trial." As  to whether the present war might turn into a civil war, Shaykh  al-Zandani expressed his confidence that the Yemeni people in  the South were even more dedicated than the people of the  Northern governorates when it came to getting rid of the  Socialist Party, because they had tasted the bitterness of that  party's rule for 23 years.    He added, "Many of those who are fighting the Socialist  Party  are from the southeastern governorates. As soon as they were  assured that they would be protected from the Socialist Party  and its maltreatment of them, and once they had the opportunity,  they proclaim their true opinions of this party.    Addressing the Socialists' position in the House of  Representatives now that events had run out of control,  al-Zandani said, in his interview with the Qatar News Agency,  that some of them were still members of the House of  Representatives' presidential commission, and that there were  other members of House of Representatives who were now among the  most vehement opponents of the Socialists.    He added that "the wartime conditions could not besiege  several Socialist Party members of the House of Representatives,  who left the House of Representatives when some roads were  blocked." In response to a question about the military  situation, al-Zandani expressed "regret, because our brothers,  especially those close to us, have not made the effort to seek  out the facts." He went on to say that "union forces now are  close to Aden, in Abyan. The media attacking us says that the  battles are taking place on the former border. We do not know  whether the call for Arab unity has now become a crime, or  perhaps the union of Arab countries is now an atrocity. Is it  now a crime to safeguard our legitimate government, freely  chosen by the people, and to oppose a mutiny? We cry to God  about this oppression of our loved ones, neighbors, and  brothers."    He said that the city of al-Dali' was now under union  forces'  control, and that the people in the Southern provinces only  wanted to be reassured that the government would protect them  from communist oppression, for them to show their true feelings.  He indicated that secessionist brigades were surrendering one  after the other, and joining the forces of the legitimate  government.    He explained that the biggest obstacle on the road to Aden  now was the site of al-'Anad [military base], as it was a very  strong fortress, with an airport and various equipment, and was  surrounded by steep mountains.    Turning to rumors that some Arabs, from Sudan and Iraq, were  fighting alongside government forces in Yemen, the member of  Yemen's Presidential Council said that these reports had  absolutely no basis in truth. He said Sudan itself had denied  it, and that there had been Iraqis in Aden for a long time;  there were also Somalis fleeing the war in a camp in the  Southern governorates.    He expressed his regret that there was "media deception  whose  objective was to mislead," and that there was "a political  movement at the pan-Arab level, based on the circumstances of  the Gulf war, and for other reasons, to slander some Arab  countries."    Addressing Qatar's position on the crisis, Shaykh al-Zandani  said that "our brothers in Qatar have a special place in our  hearts, a place that has grown even dearer in this crisis. A  friend in need is a friend indeed. Our brothers in Qatar have  stood with us in our predicament, and stood with truth, unity,  and legitimacy, and with their faith. They have adopted clear  positions for which we thank them." He went on to say, "We say  to the Arabs, `Ask yourselves, do you support mutiny against  governments? Are you now for a socialist, communist party that  fights Islam?'" In response to a question about whether the  Southern forces had foreign backing, Shaykh al-Zandani that  "there is foreign backing, which we know about. If it weren't  for this foreign backing, they would never have dared to get  involved in something like this. But if this aid reaches those  who cannot use it, it will hurt the recipient and the giver."  Al-Zandani expressed his confidence that this would do nothing  to change the balance of power; it would not tip the scale in  favor of the mutiny. He said, "We are in the right, and God will  give us victory." Al-Zandani concluded by directing his remarks  to Yemeni communities abroad, saying that "this is a decisive  time for defining our position on this faction which has  abandoned its nation, faith, and consensus. Your army and your  people are dealing with this faction the only way they  understand."</p>

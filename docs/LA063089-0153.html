			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANSECO HAS POWER OUTAGE, BUT HIS INJURED WRIST PASSES ITS FIRST TEST  </P> <P> The fans marveled as Jose Canseco drove several balls far beyond the left-field  fence in batting practice Wednesday night, then cheered him in each of his four  at-bats during the game, expecting the same.  </P> <P> Instead, he didn't hit a ball out of the infield, managing only a scratch hit.  </P> <P> The appearance of the Oakland Athletics' outfielder, most valuable player in  the American League last season, began his second rehabilitation trip this  season in Huntsville, where he starred for part of the 1985 season with the  Stars of the Class AA Southern League.  </P> <P> Canseco, hitting third as the designated hitter, grounded to the pitcher in the  first inning of Huntsville's 4-3 loss to Greenville, S.C. In the fourth, with  no one on, he beat out a hit to deep shortstop. The next inning, with runners  on first and second, he popped up to first base, and in the eighth, with none  on, he struck out.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Canseco said, his left wrist felt fine. He hurt it in spring  training and reinjured it May 7 in the second game of an earlier rehabilitation  trip to Huntsville.  </P> <P> Thursday night's game was rained out.  </P></p>

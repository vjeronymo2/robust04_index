			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MASSACHUSETTS;  </P> <P> SEIZURE DRUG FOUND TO LOWER YOUTHS' IQS  </P> <P> A drug widely used to treat babies who have convulsions during high fevers can  at least temporarily lower their IQs and should not be routinely used,  researchers have concluded in a study published in the New England Journal of  Medicine. The medicine, phenobarbital, is the drug of choice for infants with  so-called febrile seizures. The researchers found a small but measurable  decline in the IQs of youngsters who took the medicine for two years.  </P></p>

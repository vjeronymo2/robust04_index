			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVERYBODY'S A CRITIC  </P> <P> Being a native Floridian with Cuban heritage, I almost died the first few  months in L.A. Luckily, our neighbors introduced us to El Rincon Criollo in  Culver City. It's unpresentable and tacky, but the authenticity is 100%. Even  the bread is authentic.  </P> <P> REBECCA RODRIGUEZ  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

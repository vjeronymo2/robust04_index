			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: NEC sets its sights on the 21st century - The Japanese group refuses to be blown off course by recession THERE is something almost quaintly old-fashioned in the optimism of Mr Tadahiro Sekimoto, the white-haired, bespectacled president of NEC. NEC, with Y3,774bn (Dollars 29.5bn) in sales last year, dominates the Japanese personal computer market and is the world's biggest maker of semiconductors. Mr Sekimoto is exuberant about the future, even though his company just reported a 61.7 per cent decline in consolidated pre-tax profits in the year to the end of March. NEC's share price has dropped 10 per cent in the past month; over 25 per cent since the start of the year. Capital spending this year is being cut by 19 per cent. Semiconductor prices have fallen and NEC is losing money in its home appliance division - Y28.87bn last year, which is a painfully large amount next to total pre-tax profits of Y51.44bn. Some of NEC's competitors are talking about the need to lower expectations on future growth, to work for higher quality profits, and to narrow the focus of research and development. For Mr Sekimoto, however, the recession in the electronics industry is merely a bump on the road, to be navigated and forgotten as it recedes quickly in the rear-view mirror. 'Our Japanese-style management is not affected by the immediate results; we are not that short-sighted. 'We are looking at least five years ahead, sometimes 10 years ahead,' he says. This is perhaps the expected response from a man who has been at the helm of a leading Japanese company for 12 years, and as vice-chairman of the Keidanren, the leading business federation, is in effect a certified board member of Japan Inc. There may, however, be more behind Mr Sekimoto's show of optimism than mere bravura and ritual adherence to the sacred canons of Japanese management. Mr Steve Myers, analyst at Jardine Flemming, says: 'In the domestic market, NEC's performance in the past year has been exceptionally impressive.' After growing at 20 per cent a year for five years, sales of personal computers in Japan last year declined by 8 per cent. Yet NEC sales grew by 3 per cent to 1.35m units. As a result, its share of unit sales in the Japanese market has risen to 60 per cent from the roughly 50 per cent share it has enjoyed in recent years. NEC's proprietary computer operating system is becoming ever more entrenched as the de facto Japanese standard, even though it is incompatible with any other operating system in the world and in spite of efforts to unseat it. IBM has attempted to create an alternative, DOS/V, a Japanese variant of Microsoft's MS-DOS, capable of running Japanese language programmes and any software written for IBM computers worldwide. NEC's customers, however, appear satisfied with the hardware, software and service they are receiving from their traditional supplier, or at least not dissatisfied enough to switch vendors. In part because of NEC's domination of the PC market in Japan, Mr Sekimoto argues NEC is well set for the era of 'downsizing' - the move away from large mainframe computers to smaller, yet powerful workstations and PCs - that has shaken the computer giants such as IBM. While this may be true, in fact downsizing is only an expected trend in Japan. Mainframe sales in Japan grew last year, and NEC won 18 per cent of the market, with sales of 1,448 units and a 26 per cent growth in revenues. In total, NEC's sales of computers and electronic equipment grew by 11 per cent last year to Y1,949bn. But NEC did encounter problems in semiconductors. In the mid-1980s NEC reduced its dependence on the price-volatile dynamic random access memory chips, which account for 25 production of chip production. This helped to insulate NEC from the initial downturn in the market last year, which was concentrated in Dram chips, but was little help when the entire market turned soft. NEC's external sales of electronic devices, mainly semiconductors, fell by 4.9 per cent last year to Y617bn, although, after including chips for internal use, production increased 2.7 per cent to Y946bn. Semiconductors sales, however, are highly cyclical and the Electronic Industries Association of Japan has forecast continuing growth in the market for electronic devices at about 6 per cent a year. Mr Sekimoto says that NEC should be able to beat the average rate of increase. Sales of communication equipment were also down by 3.7 per cent to Y1,001.6bn, but this, too, is an area of expected high growth, even if NEC loses market share in a domestic market where competition is increasing. Perhaps the only genuine blight on the accounts is NEC's Y193.2bn operating costs on Y164.4bn of sales in home electronics, which consists of VCRs, satellite dishes and the like. Mr Sekimoto speaks glowingly of the prospects of using NEC technology in high-definition television. Yet NEC's persistence in the highly competitive arena of consumer electronics, where it is a marginal player without an established brand name, appears more than anything to be a tribute to the difficulty Japanese companies have quitting a business. Mr Myers commented that there was a significant misallocation of engineering resources. It is plain that in spite of much talk in Japan about the need for structural change in industry with the end of an era of rapid growth, Mr Sekimoto is not about to let NEC be blown off course by the recession. NEC is, of course, making concessions to the recession, including the cut in capital spending to Y210bn, mainly in the semiconductor business. This will help reduce future depreciation charges, which have swollen 30 per cent in three years to Y222.5bn last year. Recruitment is being cut this year by 14 per cent to 1,200. Even so, NEC is increasing research and development spending this year by 3 per cent to Y310bn, and Mr Sekimoto has no plans to overhaul the company's wide-ranging scientific and technical programmes. He says: 'Our growth rate depends on the success or failure of our development of new technology.'</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Jobless rise increases government discomfort: Figures prompt unease among investors UNEMPLOYMENT rose again last month, according to official figures released yesterday, triggering nervousness on the foreign exchange markets and unsettling the government further after a week of poor economic statistics. The jobless total increased a seasonally adjusted 5,800 in August following a sharply revised increase of 4,300 in July. The number of people out of work and claiming benefit now stands at 2.92m, or 10.4 per cent of the workforce. The August monthly increase was the second in a row and went some way towards reversing falls in unemployment that occurred between February and May. However, the jobless total is still lower than it was in April. The news contributed to unease among investors, already unsettled by an attack on the prime minister's leadership by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor. The pound dropped a pfennig to close at DM2.4625. Yesterday's figures from the department of employment contained other worrying signals. Average earnings growth remained lodged at 3.5 per cent in the year to July suggesting that pay settlements have hit bottom ahead of the rate of inflation. After the surprise jump in headline inflation earlier this week, the news on earnings may undermine confidence that inflationary pressures are dead. There was also a sharp downwards revision to the latest productivity figures after the rebasing and reweighting of manufacturing output figures. In the three months to July, output per head grew by 6.7 per cent compared with the previous three month period. The figure for June was revised down from 8.2 per cent to 7.2 per cent. Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, drew attention to a 20,000 rise in employment in the three months ending June, the first quarterly rise in employment for three years. 'A small rise in unemployment of 5,800 is not unexpected at this stage of the recovery when individual monthly figures will vary.' The Treasury said the latest figures indicated a slow labour market recovery even though they showed small rises in unemployment in the last two months. Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, called for a 1 per cent cut in interest rates and a 'substantial package for growth' in the November budget. 'These figures show unemployment is still the biggest problem facing the country. The feeble recovery is now in danger of stalling.' he said. Optimism declines in labour market, Page 10</p>

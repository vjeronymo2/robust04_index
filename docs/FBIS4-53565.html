			<p>BFN     [Text] Sendai, May 20 KYODO -- Opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) President Yohei Kono said Friday that  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is likely to choose a cabinet  resignation en masse if a no-confidence motion is adopted.    Kono told a press conference he thinks Social Democratic  Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama's call for dissolving the  Diet through dialogue is intended to keep political reform alive.    In a meeting with Hata in Tokyo on Tuesday, Kono indicated  that the LDP would submit a no-confidence motion against the  cabinet after the Diet enacts the fiscal 1994 national budget.    Kono told a press conference that Hata "is likely to select  resignation en masse under the circumstance generally  envisaged," rather than call a snap election of the House of  Representatives.    Kono said, "it is necessary to do away with the weak  minority  government."    "People can see what (Hata's) cabinet is like in  deliberations on the fiscal 1994 state budget starting next  week," Kono said.    The LDP will question the cabinet's policy at the lower  house  budget committee, assessing the timing for submitting the motion  in a way that the people can support, he said.</p>

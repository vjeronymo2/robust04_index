Scope of the Problem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2.1.1. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Chemicals are an integral part of our lives, with the capacity to both improve as well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as endanger our health. The general population is exposed to chemicals with neurotoxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properties in air, water, foods, cosmetics, household products, and drugs used therapeutically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or illicitly. Naturally occurring neurotoxins, such as fish and plant toxins, present other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazards. During the daily life of an ordinary person, there is a multitude of exposures, both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntary and unintentional, to neuroactive substances. Under conditions of multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposures, identifying the substance responsible for an adverse response may be difficult.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA's inventory of toxic chemicals is greater than 65,000 and increasing yearly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concerns have been raised about the toxicological data available for many compounds used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercially (NRC, 1984).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is not known how many chemicals are neurotoxic to humans. However, estimates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been made for subsets of substances. A large percentage of the more than 500  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registered active pesticide ingredients are neurotoxic to varying degrees. Of 588 chemicals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed by the American Conference of Government and Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), 167  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected the nervous system or behavior (Anger, 1984; CDC, 1986). Using a generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broad definition of neurotoxicity, Anger (1990a) estimated that of the approximately 200  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals to which 1 million or more American workers are exposed, more than one-third  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may have adverse effects on the nervous system at some level of exposure. Anger (1984)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also recognized neurotoxic effects as one of the ten leading workplace disorders. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a number of therapeutic substances, including some anticancer and antiviral agents and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abused drugs, can cause adverse or neurotoxicological side effects (OTA, 1990). It has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated that there is inadequate toxicological information available for more than three- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fourths of the 12,860 chemicals with a production volume of 1 million pounds or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (NRC, 1984). It should be noted, however, that estimates concerning the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxicants vary widely. O'Donoghue (1989), for example, reported that of 488  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds assessed in his chemical evaluation process, only 2.7% had effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nervous sytem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2.1.2. Examples of Neurotoxicity and Incidents of Exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> There is a long-standing history associating certain neurological and psychiatric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disorders to exposure to a toxin or chemical of an environmental origin (OTA, 1990) (Table  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2&hyph;1). Lead is one of the earliest examples of a neurotoxic chemical with widespread  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure. This metal is widely distributed with major sources of inorganic lead including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industrial emissions, lead-based paints, food, beverages, and the burning of leaded gasolines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organic lead compounds such as tetraethyl lead have been reported to produce a toxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> psychosis (Cassells and Dodds, 1946). If exposure occurs at relatively low levels during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development, lead can cause a variety of neurobehavioral problems, learning disorders, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> altered mental development (Bellinger et al., 1987; Needleman, 1990). Over the years,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Government regulations have been developed to decrease human exposure to lead,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and as a goal an intervention level of 10  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/dcl whole blood has been recommended (CDC,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991). Lead exposure in the United States has decreased significantly during the last several years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

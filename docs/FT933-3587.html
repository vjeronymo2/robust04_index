			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Foreign exchange dealers enter the 21st century: A look at the growing competition in automated trading systems For nearly a quarter of a century, Reuters, the news and information group, has been the world leader in the provision of electronic trading systems for banks which deal in currency markets. But this week, Reuters will find itself in competition with some of its best clients, a consortium of the most powerful banks in foreign exchange. Both sides are about to enter battle by offering rival automated dealing systems which can simulate the work done by brokers in the foreign exchange market. The products they are pioneering may change the face of one of the most actively traded financial markets in the world, one where global turnover has reached Dollars 1,000bn a day. Last year, Reuters launched its 2000-2 automated brokerage system after several years developing it at an estimated cost of Pounds 60m. It was followed in April by Minex - a service backed by Japanese institutions  - much used in Asia. On Wednesday, at 8am in London, dealers will be able to trade on terminals run by the Electronic Broking Service (EBS). This system, which cost around Pounds 40m to launch, has been backed by a dozen leading banks in foreign exchange - such as Citibank and Chase Manhattan - who have formed a consortium with Quotron, specialists in electronic information. 'This is where the 21st century begins for foreign exchange dealers,' says Mr Peter Bartko, chairman of the EBS partnership. 'In the long term, people have to accept that human brokerage doesn't have a great future.' Brokerage still plays a considerable role in currency dealing. Roughly 60 per cent of deals in the currency markets are now done by traders in two banks - or counterparties - who call one another up directly. The remainder of deals are done through brokers, who bring together diverse buyers and sellers. Commercial banks rely on brokers for a good proportion of their business and value their knowledge of the market. But they complain that the commissions charged for broking a deal are very high. Automated brokerage terminals do the same job as humans at a reduced cost. A bank dealer using any of the three on offer can advertise a buy and sell price on dealing screens across the globe. Another bank dealer then 'hits' the price by typing instructions on to a terminal. Only when the deal is done are the identities of both parties revealed. The banks are attracted by the reduced cost of commission. But they fear that 2000-2 will help Reuters monopolise the market in electronic dealing systems. Mr Bartko admits that this is one of the principal motives for this week's launch of EBS. Reuters has 19,000 conventional dealing terminals in banks around the world. On Mr Bartko's estimate, some 50 per cent of global foreign exchange transactions take place on them. 'Reuters 2000-2 could move that figure significantly higher,' he says. He argues that the banks would be 'at the mercy' of Reuters if its control of transactions jumped to 70 per cent. They would be in a position to dictate customer charges. Some bank dealers also argue that Reuters could change the structure of the currency market, if it so wished, by selling more systems to non-banking customers who are becoming important movers of international capital. EBS has one advantage over rival systems: the banks backing it have 35 per cent of turnover on the London foreign exchange market. That means EBS could establish high levels of liquidity very quickly. Mr Bartko says liquidity is the key to success. 'You need to have 50 banks using a system to make a professional market in, say, the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate. We already have the critical mass.' By contrast, he says that Reuters 2000-2 cannot offer big volume deals in the main currencies because the large banks have not moved over to using it. But Reuters is confident. Mr Bob Etherington, the company's international marketing manager, takes EBS seriously but dismisses fears that Reuters is seeking to increase charges by monopolising the market. 'In the last 12 years, the prices for using the Reuters Monitor Dealing Service have not kept up with inflation,' he said. 'We have not abused out position at all.' Mr Etherington believes that 2000-2 will acquire greater liquidity, but he will not reveal volume levels. 'From the start, we set targets for the number of trades we wanted to see and we are meeting those targets.' He also believes that it is far too early to judge the performance of 2000-2. 'It takes a long time to establish these systems in the marketplace as we saw with our earlier systems,' he says. 'You are asking dealers to start trading in a way they have never traded before, and that can take time.' Officials at EBS admit that Reuters has such huge resources that it can wait to see how automated brokerage develops over many years. And the pioneers of these systems know it will take a long time to bring currency dealers around to using them. One hindrance to automated brokerage is that traders must make a brokered deal by looking at a screen and tapping buttons on a keyboard. That takes longer than listening to the broker shouting a price on the phone and answering 'done'. In a market where every second counts, that costs money. Dealers are also nervous to offer a buy/sell price knowing that either side of the price can be 'hit' by any currency dealer in the world. That is a more frightening prospect than operating through a trusted broker or dealing with a known counterparty, especially when exchange rates are volatile. Automated currency brokerage may never catch on. But it may also be the dawn of a Brave New World - a development no less significant than the launch of the early computerised trading systems in currency markets in the 1970s. The banks merely want to ensure that, if this is the technology of the future, Reuters is not alone in developing it.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- AUTOMATED DEALING: A THREE-WAY FIGHT  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Reuters 2000-2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Launched last year with 23 subscriber sites in two countries.  -Now more than 230 dealing sites in 28 cities in 17 countries.  -System has reached initial target of 1,000 trades a day, each for a   minimum 1m units of the currency dealt.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Electronic Broking Service  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  -To be launched Wednesday by Quotron and consortium of banks in London,   New York, Zurich and Amsterdam.  -Will start with 200 dealers in 60 banks and institutions.  -Dealers invited to trade in standard amounts of Dollars 5m in   Dollars/DM and Pounds 5m in Pounds/DM.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Minex  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Went live in April, backed by a consortium of Japanese banks and   brokers, KDD, the Japanese telecom company, and Dow Jones Telerate.  -Systems in New York, Chicago, London, Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo.  -Does not disclose the number of trades crossed or terminals used.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

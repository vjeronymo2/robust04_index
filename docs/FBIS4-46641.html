			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ilgonis Upmalis, chief of the bureau to </F> control the withdrawal of the Army of the Federation of Russia,  and Ludis Pavilonis, his deputy, by Viktors Berzins: "They  Leave; Facilities Remain; The Russian Army Is Leaving So Briskly  That the Latvian State Cannot Keep Up With Resolutions on the  Former Army Facilities."]    [Text] In summary, the number of resolutions by the  government, which would determine the future ownership of the  facilities, is unable to keep up with the number of acceptance  and committal acts.    [Pavilonis] During its time, the Supreme Council passed a  resolution stating that the Council of Ministers must review the  case of each such facility and adopt a resolution on awarding it  to either the municipality or some other party, all within a ten  day period.    In practice, this cannot be done because the process takes  too long. Before the Cabinet of Ministers adopts the resolution,  the resolution bill must be written, in conjunction with the  judicial division and other institutions. In total, about 10 to  15 signatures must be collected. When these and the archival  reports are gathered, the case is reviewed by the appropriate  committee of the Cabinet of Ministers, and if the latter finds  that all of the documentation is in order, only then is it  presented to the administration. In a meeting of the  administration, the final resolution is adopted on the  disposition of the facility.    [Berzins] Then a whole month would go by ...    [Pavilonis] Ye-es (drawing out the word)... You said one  month? Now let's take a look at the list of facilities returned.  For example, Cesis rayon, Sarkani, medical warehouses. Committal  act -- April 27, 1993. Administrative resolution -- March 5,  1994. Almost one entire year! Naturally, it doesn't take this  long for everything. Now, here is another entry: committal act  -- June 8, 1993, resolution by the Cabinet of Ministers --  January 4, 1994. Half of a year. And there are more and more.    [Berzins] At such a rate, we will never get rid of the  Russian Army!    [Pavilonis] We are getting rid of the Russian Army, because  they are no longer in these facilities. The Army says "so long"  to those areas as soon as there is an acceptance and committal  act.    [Berzins] What happens to the vacated facility during the  time between the committal act and the adoption of the  administrative resolution?    [Pavilonis] The municipality must provide protection to make  sure that nothing happens, but it is not allowed to take over  ownership. It cannot allow in a private organization, nor do  anything else.    And what happens if the municipality has agreed to be the  owner, but then some interested ministry turns up, which decides  something as follows: Why should the municipality have it? We  need it! We will turn it over to the municipality, then prepare  a resolution to have it turned over to us. And they prepare and  receive the resolution by the Cabinet of Ministers. Now the  occupant selected by the municipality must be evicted. Can the  municipality feel secure and confident: Although the Cabinet of  Ministers is preparing these resolutions very slowly, they will  be finished someday, and then -- who will be the legal owner of  the facility? There have been numerous precedents where the  facility has been taken away from the municipality.    Now about protection. The municipalities are not paid for  providing protection, and they must find the money from internal  reserves. But, when the municipality is turned out of some  facility, it says: -- We are removing our protection, but pay us  for the period during which we provided protection. -- But the  ministries, in turn, have no money, and so they just don't pay.    [Berzins] What should be done to speed up the disposition of  the former military facilities?    [Pavilonis] At the least, we should increase the number of  members in the Ministry of Finances group that prepares the  administrative resolution bills, so that we can catch up with  the acceptance and committal acts. Naturally, this is impossible  to do in ten days, since signatures cannot be obtained at such a  rate, but let them attempt to do it in twenty days. Don't  prolong it to a year.    [Upmalis] The next meeting of the commission led by Mr.  Kosisis will be dedicated to a discussion on how to speed up  production of these administrative resolutions.    In order to adopt a resolution, which will have a completely  singular significance for the commission, and the  administration, and so that there will be no basis for an  argument by any entity, there must be clarity on what is under  each facility; who owned the land? Has the owner submitted a  claim? Who owned the facility built before 1940? All of this  archival information is essential. Plus, we need the plans of  the building or facility. In the beginning, while the military  unit was still in there, they were impossible to obtain. Now, we  have made an agreement with North West Military Group Commander  Mayorov, and there are no longer any refusals. We even received  them for the Maiznicas Street facility, which contains the  counterintelligence unit. It is a complicated matter to gather  all of the archival information, to obtain the necessary  documents from the Land and Property Reclamation commissions.    If it is absolutely certain that the land under a facility  belongs to the municipality, then, naturally, the facility  belongs to the municipality. If a mistake is made at the meeting  of the administration, then this could lead to the curious event  that the administration, by its resolution, gives the  municipality's land to some ministry. Mistakes happen, many  mistakes -- because incomplete documentation is submitted.    Commercial organizations are very quick in using this to  their advantage when they are interested in a certain facility.  As you could say, they climb over corpses, with the help of  false information, with various incomplete reports, to attempt  and sometimes even succeed to establish the grounds for their  claim. Municipalities are also guilty. And there are cases where  all of the interested parties do not want to settle their claims  in accordance with the law, and then the only way to clear up  the confusion is by the prosecutor and the court.    There will be a "mad dash", there will.    [Berzins] Let us assume that the Russian Army will leave by  August 31. The majority of military units will probably prolong  the turnover of the facilities as long as they can. The "mad  dash", presumably, will occur in July and August...    [Pavilonis] Maybe there will be much more of a "mad dash"  towards the end, but I can say that at present they are turning  over their facilities on a somewhat regular basis. As soon as an  area is empty, they draw up the acceptance and committal act:  please, take it and do what you will. It is no longer the way it  was at one time, -- major discord: Mayorov was not signing the  acts, Moscow was simply not allowing him to sign -- the military  unit area was empty, but it was not turned over. Now these  matters are being handled promptly.    [Berzins] There is probably still a great deal left to  settle.    [Pavilonis] Yes. There are still 191 Russian Army units in  247 facilities in Latvia.    [Berzins] How many have been turned over this year?    [Pavilonis] Twenty-one units with 86 facilities.    [Berzins] Twenty-one units in four months. For the remaining  four months -- 191. How can this be accomplished without a "mad  dash"?    [Pavilonis] There will be a "mad dash", there will...    [Berzins] They will make a "mad dash", but they are most  likely prepared for it. But are we, likewise, prepared to handle  such a mountain of returned property? The facilities should at  least be protected. And it will also be necessary to make  determinations...    [Pavilonis] Up until now, if there was an owner, the take  over and protection did not create any major problems.    [Berzins] But there can be no owner until the Cabinet of  Ministers confirms one. But that grindstone is turning very  slowly.    [Pavilonis] The Cabinet of Ministers is issuing resolutions  out of turn for certain facilities that may be needed more  quickly. But even so, the number of resolutions has not managed  to keep up with the number of committal acts.    [Berzins] So, we already couldn't keep up when there were  relatively few facilities turned over. What will happen when the  "mad dash" starts and there are many facilities to take over and  decide on? How can these be protected to avoid their destruction  and demolition?    [Pavilonis] It is possible that illegal activities will  occur. If some official wants to "screw" someone, he could say:  -- You are managing this property illegally, and I am suing you  and throwing you out.    [Upmalis] The only positive thing is that for those  facilities where the Army unit is still present, likely owners  have already appeared. As for what remains -- I don't think  there will be a problem with taking over facilities located in  Riga. The major facilities -- training grounds, airfields --  have already been taken over. There is still the matter of Adazi  and Dobele, where the 25th brigade is situated. There is still  the matter of "Strautini" in the Aluksne rayon, where a few  complications will most certainly arise. There is also the 32  meter high radio-telescopic antenna in the Ventspils rayon,  which has not been awarded to anyone, yet. In turning over this  facility, we are looking for possibilities of better utilization  and preservation, because it is so specialized and so far into  the forest that it will be impossible for the municipality to  preserve it. Discussions about this facility are being held with  the Russian Scientific Academy about cooperation among  scientists from Latvia, Russia and other nations, all united  under of the "Kvazar" program. Although the problems are  monstrous -- this facility takes up 209 hectares of the forest,  Latvian scientists do not have the strength to manage it, and  the Russian side does not have the strength to organize and  finance it, because, in order to prepare this facility for  scientific purposes, the equipment must be changed. There are  also high ranking officials in Latvia who would like to see this  unique antenna turned into ashes and dust, because this is what  some foreign services have supposedly recommended.    However, delays can be foreseen in the preparation of the  administrative resolution bills. It will be a major job, and, in  my opinion, after just one year, it is doubtful whether we will  have all of the administrative resolutions in order for a  property to be legally registered, etc.    Insatiable ministries are swallowing up plans and  priorities.    [Berzins] Four years have already elapsed since Latvia  declared independence. Soon, it will be three years since Latvia  was recognized as independent. After half of a century, the  foreign army is finally leaving, but only now, at the last  minute, we are starting to worry about what to do with the  Latvian land and the buildings constructed on this land for  military purposes. We are looking for owners. Haven't we  composed any sort of comprehensive program?    [Pavilonis] There are no comprehensive programs. When the  commission on the takeover of military facilities has examined  the case agreed upon, the question may be raised: what do you  intend to do in this facility? And this does not happen every  time.    [Berzins] This question doesn't have to be raised? If no one  else wants it, then just take it away?    [Pavilonis] Yes. But, if there is more than one contender,  then each is asked what he intends to do there.    [Berzins] Is it possible that there are some good facilities  that no one wants?    [Pavilonis] There are some. Then basically the Supreme  Council's resolution is in effect that the municipality must  provide protection.    [Berzins] Even if that means from now until eternity?    [Pavilonis] Let the municipality decide how to manage it.    [Berzins] But then it would manage everything which happened  to be in its territory, as, for example, the cooperative and  state cooperative farms, which appear to be unnecessary at  present.    [Pavilonis] If no one wants to take over a facility, then  the  Russians could be requested to take down the facility and plant  grass. A green meadow would be left behind.    [Berzins] Of course you can ask, but will they do it? And  even if they would take it down, who will have the nerve to ask  them, when everyone is celebrating that "Thank God! They're  finally gone!" Let's keep them here, so they can dawdle with the  demolition?...    [Pavilonis] In some cases, it was headed in that direction.  The Ventspils military unit vacated the territory, but the  Ventspils municipal government did not want to receive this  territory, if it was not included as a property owner. However,  this land belongs to the state.    [Berzins] It seems as though we have not had enough time to  resolve these and other sticky questions. But then, while all  details may not be worked out, we could at least form a general  conceptual program...    [Upmalis] Such a program has been very difficult, if not  impossible, to set up because the ministries and municipalities  have been so greedy. In the beginning, when these facilities  were still very far from being turned over, all of the  ministries presented their proposals and requested so many  facilities that, when they reached the stage of actual takeover  and examined them with their own eyes, they understood: the  territory is enormously large, and they would have to pay taxes  on it, and so, at the very last moment, they started to refuse  these facilities.    And all of our plans -- we had beautiful plans! -- were gone  with the wind. For example, the Ministry of Defense was given  absolute priority, and some others were also given priority. But  now, the Ministry of Defense has refused, on more than one  occasion, to accept facilities, which have been turned over  already, and now, we don't know what to do with these  facilities. Like the Daugavpils fortress, for example, and that  is not the only one. In the Naujene rural district, close to  Daugavpils, there is also a miliary facility that was requested  by the Ministry of Defense, but then refused. After that, the  Ministry of Internal Affairs refused it. In the end, after this  facility was already ransacked, when there was no longer  anything there, it was graciously offered to the municipality.  But Mr. Geiba said: "Nothing can be done there anymore, so we  are also refusing to take it".    The point is reached that a facility literally goes to ruin  because of irresponsibility. That is what happened with Vainode  airport, as well. If they had not granted the request by the  Ministry of Transportation to be assigned this facility, without  asking the Ministry of Transportation what it wanted to do with  the Vainode airport, then, in my opinion, it may have been  possible to save this facility. Now it has been totally  ransacked, and a large number of residential buildings stand  empty and destroyed. It all looks very sad. That is what happens  when a ministry agrees to accept something, but when it is  necessary to start managing the property, it is unable to do so.    [Pavilonis] The saddest aspect is that the residential  buildings remain uninhabited. We see and hear in Riga that many  have no place to live. But, there, they have large five story  buildings remaining empty and going to ruin.    [Berzins] The misfortune lies in that the Russians could not  take them along, and we cannot take them to Riga. Nor to some  city closer.    [Pavilonis] And why not. Vietumis does that: the  construction  company can take apart a large five story panel building, bring  it closer to the city and "set" it up. I am not sure what this  accomplishes, but at least the materials don't have to be  assembled from scratch.    In Paplaka, already quite some time ago, the municipality  inherited large residential buildings that were unwanted by  everyone. They said: -- We don't have anyone to put in them,  because, for the majority, we have our own private homes.    Private firms, fighting for a place in the sun, have a  propensity for buying former military facilities from the  Russian Army.    [Berzins] But you are saying that all types of illegal  actions are occurring, court hearings, one company, wanting to  get in, chases out another one, which happens to be there  already...    [Upmalis] Some of the returned facilities have been bought  up  by firms, which none of the Latvian institutions have been  unable to determine what type of company they are.    For example, what is Lat-West-East, which has purchased a  petroleum base still containing an army unit from Russia, and  the sales contract states that this army unit can remain in  Latvia and on the firm's territory, until such time that Russia  decides to remove its Army from there. In such a case, who  decides whether the Russian Army can be present here in Latvia?  The administration of Latvia, Russia, or the firm? And,  unfortunately, we are unable to do anything concrete. The only  thing was when members of this military unit, which is located  in the Viesturs Prospect petroleum base, and is owned by  Lat-West-East, came to me and asked if I would please issue them  driving permits for their automobiles, so that they could  perform their routine activities, and I replied: -- You sold  your territory, and you no longer have any here.    There are very many similar occurrences.    Furthermore. It is still possible for firms to purchase a  facility from the Army, and backdate the sale. This is because  it is still not down in writing that firms must register and  notarize the contracts for the sale of these facilities.    If you are a military unit commander and you have a seal,  and  I am a firm representative and I have a seal, and we perform the  sales transaction using sales checks, then we would have no  problem concluding a document dated, for example, August 1, 1991.    If everything has been performed to the letter of the law,  plus, if the firm at that time was registered in the Latvian  Registry of Businesses, then, in my opinion, no Latvian legal  institution will be able to prove that this was an illegal  action.    There is another painful matter that I would like to focus  attention on: various firms that manufacture firearms have  turned up in Latvia.    I am still uncertain about the licensing of such firms. One  has moved in to an army manufacturing plant, which remains  un-returned. It has made the purchase from Russia, and in quite  an unusual manner. As we know, all manufacturing plants in  Russia are part of the State Property Fund (SPF). That is not a  military structure. Thus, the firm has made its purchase not  from the Army, but from Russia's SPF. Thus, it would seem that  SPF has property in Latvia, since it is able to make the sale.    With respect to the firm La Con, in the Daugavgriva fortress  territory, which, according to our views, is not operating in  conformity with the laws of Latvia, we have submitted materials  to the prosecutor's office for review. Our bureau does not have  the right to review -- legally or illegally. We have not yet  received the findings from the prosecutor, although we have in  our possession agreements concluded between the firm and the  Latvian naval forces on the use of the facility for 15 years.  The facility is assigned to the Ministry of Defense, but the  naval forces have already managed to conclude an agreement with  the firm, without organizing any competitions, which they should  have done. Many firms have signed up for this Daugavgriva port  territory.    [Berzins] What is the major attraction there?    [Upmalis] Undoubtedly, the port. Agreements have been  concluded with the blessings of the commander of the naval  forces without, as far as I can tell, coordination with the  Ministry of Defense. We can "thank" Mr.Zeibots, Mr. Zingis and  the rest of the leading workers for this. This is no surprise,  because the firm has a high ranking "benefactor", who is in the  practice of lobbying. He is Mr. Kaza, who is attempting to  support this firm with all sorts of means. I have a list of its  founders. It was founded by the tradition principle: at the  forefront is a person of Latvian nationality, who is a citizen,  and all the rest -- people of Russian nationality. That is the  traditional manner for companies. They say that the list of  founders was later amplified with the name of Mr. Kaza.    I am most concerned in these cases, because they are not  holding competitions on the basis of the business plan, as  defined by the law.    This company, unfortunately, has taken down many major  buildings which are still in unassigned territory.    I could mention many, many facilities for which the  concluded  actions will have to be reviewed by the prosecutor's office in  time. This is because the documents concerning these actions,  which we have available to us on the respective facility  takeover, and those -- most interestingly! -- which the firms  have not submitted, are, in our opinion, not too clean.    At one time, we had the plenary powers of the entire Council  of Ministers, now we have only one -- the plenary power of the  Ministry of Defense, and that is too little for us to be able to  control the conclusion of all these actions. We also do not have  to right to use sanctions against firms that pursue illegal  actions.    Often with the help of a high ranking person, they go around  the bureau, and have various ministries do the resolving, in  accordance with their own views.    The bureau is not involved with the takeover of facilities.  The bureau is concerned with the control of facility takeovers  -- how they are turned over.    The commission led by Mr. Kosisis, -- the commission on the  takeover of military facilities from the military forces of the  Russian Federation, can also only make recommendations, and on  the basis of such, the Cabinet of Ministers adopts resolutions  on the utilization of such a facility.    Only they understand    [Berzins] Can we assume that the bureau has a complete  picture of the Russian military units and military facilities  still remaining in Latvia?    [Pavilonis] Yes. All have been accounted for and entered in  the records. Nevertheless, there are times when some military  unit shows up which is not in our records. Either it had been  very well hidden, or was newly formed. That happened when the  15th Air Army Headquarters at 55 Brivibas Street was eliminated.  The military personnel remaining in Latvia relocated to Skulte  airfield, where a new military unit was formed. Such a trick had  not been anticipated in our documents.    [Berzins] Do they come to you for driving permits?    [Pavilonis] Not only that. If, for example, officers need to  cross the border, drive somewhere on official business, they  come to us for a permit. Permits to relocate automobiles. To  bring out property. In this manner, we learn that a new unit has  formed. This has been a rare occurrence recently. Thus, we have  to assume that all of the military units present in Latvia have  been accounted for.    [Berzins] When did it become clear that everything was  included?    [Pavilonis] Two years ago, when the bureau started its work,  two thirds of the military forces were known. The remaining  third was accounted for in six months time.    When we started working, all units present in Latvia were  considered to be secret. The Russian Army would not give any  lists. When we could say: here you have such a military unit,  there -- that type, when we brought all ends together, only then  did the veil of secrecy fall away. Recently they released a  formerly highly secret document -- a summary of how many  military units have been in Latvia since 1940. And not only  military units, but also equivalent units -- institutions with  various names which did not have a military unit number, but  were simply issued a number. However, they have not admitted  that the secret units with box office box numbers are theirs.    [Berzins] Then who do they belong to?    [Pavilonis] We are now trying to find out who started  issuing  post office box numbers for secret workshops and secret  factories. Our bureau does not have extensive materials on the  post office box factories.    [Berzins] But don't the factories exist? And what about  their  products?    [Pavilonis] The factories exist, but the products, which  required the "post office boxes", have not been manufactured for  a long time. There were secret workshops in VEF, Komutators, the  Liepaja agriculture machinery factory, and many other places. As  soon as ownership of the All-Union factories was tuned over to  the Republic of Latvia, the manufacture of military products was  discontinued.    [Berzins] Minor battles are being waged over the special  military factories.    [Pavilonis] We have to find a compromise. If both sides  refuse to budge from their positions, then the factory will be  ransacked. The Russian Army is secretly bringing out the major  machinery. If they cannot manage to get it across the border,  they sell it to some commercial concern, and the factory is left  unable to function.    [Berzins] But maybe there is nothing wrong with bringing the  machinery out. Let them do it in full force -- there won't be  anything for the followers of Interfront to rally behind. The  Latvian Army, most likely, will never have that many tanks to  keep a factory busy doing repairs at full capacity for a whole  growing season.    [Pavilonis] The factories that were not needed by Latvia  were  all low level and have already been eliminated. But there are  also those, which can be utilized expediently, and which have  relatively modern equipment. It is economically more practical  to save them, instead of eliminating them.    [Berzins] But we already have factories standing, which  cannot produce anything substantial. What good will it do to  have additional factories?    [Pavilonis] While the products of Latvia's industries have  remained in warehouses until now, none of the military factories  have full warehouses. Everything was sold. Their products were  not only for the needs of the military units, but also goods for  their personal consumption. And, likewise, these did not remain  in warehouses. They were either of better quality, or the  management was more exacting in production, and issued only as  many products as needed.    Worthy, worthless.    [Berzins] And nothing worthless will remain behind after the  Russian Army leaves?    [Upmalis] There are at least three bunkers, which we don't  know how to utilize. One in Adazi, in Muceniekos -- two. The  15th Military Air Army Force Command Point in Muceniekos and the  North Western Military Group Commander's Command Point in Adazi.  They are two to three story underground buildings, containing  equipment which consumes a great amount of energy to maintain  suitability for occupancy -- pumping out underground water, etc.  There is very high electrical consumption.    [Berzins] Let Mr. Mayorov take them along.    [Upmalis] We could allow him to do that. The demolition  involves major problems. Likewise, with the bunker in Muceniekos  -- it contains enormous amounts of reinforced concrete, all  covered by soil. Should we allow it fill up with water? That is  dangerous -- it could cause accidents. Blow it up and then bury  it? Or maybe keep it as a historical monument and turn it into a  tourist attraction.    Mr. Pavilonis, however, is very economically minded -- these  bunkers would be suitable for mushroom cultivation, because a  constant temperature and humidity can be maintained in them. The  problem is that there are many bunkers and only one vegetable  farming company, Riga, which would not be able to manage  everything. If only there were funds to install an appropriate  boiler system -- the one built by the Army is too large to use  for such purposes.    [Berzins] Aren't there also doubts about utilizing the  formerly Baltic Military District, now North Western Military  Group's Pentagon (read -- headquarters -- V.B.)  building for Latvian army purposes -- even though a huge  quantity of all types of listening devices remain planted there?    [Upmalis] We will have a great deal of problems with it. But  how can you compare listening devices with live KGB agents, who  are employed by our leading firms?!    [Berzins] Our Saeima, with amazing sincerity and for a long  time, has been occupied with the KGB sacks and the five deputies  suspected of collaboration, while several hundred KGB staff  members are living high off the hog.    [Upmalis] I personally know a person who admits that he  worked for the KGB. Looking at the list of a certain firm's  founders, he showed me names of people he had worked with. And  this is a very famous firm's founders list. Thus, if these  gentlemen have healthy, very powerful firms, then why talk about  five Saeima deputies, who probably don't have the financial  means to influence anything today. Such firms have much greater  possibilities. Everyone knows that, but nothing is done about  it. That is why we need a law on these KGB agents, which, I  believe, we will have soon.    I like the position taken by Mr. Bojars from the very  beginning: yes, I don't deny I was such, but now I work for the  good of Latvia, and so, accept me for what I am. If everyone who  worked there would come forward to confess, and regret his  sins... Patriotism is not dependent on where a person  worked, but, rather, on how he did his job,  what he did in his place of work, and how  he is acting at present.    [Berzins] The Pentagon on Elizabetes Street will probably  leave at the very end of the withdrawal term.    [Pavilonis] The 15th Air Army Headquarters left, even though  some of its military units were still here. We assume that the  North Western Military Group Headquarters will do the same. In  private conversations, they are saying that they won't be the  last to leave their premises.</p>

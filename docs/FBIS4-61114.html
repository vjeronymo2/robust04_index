			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Olga Garbuzova report: "Amendments to State of Emergency </F> Law. Deputies Hasten To Take President Under Control"]    [Text] Further work on the draft law "On the State of  Emergency" started yesterday in two State Duma committees -- on  security and on legislation. The final version of the draft law  should be ready and put before the lower chamber of parliament  before 15 May.    At the moment, there are two variants of the law "On the  State of Emergency." Distinctions between the two (the first  one was proposed by Deputy Viktor Mironov and dubbed the  "Internal Affairs Ministry variant;" the second one is known as  the "committees' variant) are not so great, neither do they  differ much from the RSFSR law "On the State of Emergency"  signed by Boris Yeltsin on 17 May 1991. There is, however, one  important distinction, but it is provided for in the Russian  Constitution: Whereas in the past a state of emergency could be  imposed both by an edict of the president of Russia (with  consent from the Supreme Soviet) and by an edict of the Supreme  Soviet presidium (with an immediate notification of the  president), now, in line with the Constitution, a state of  emergency shall be imposed only by the president's edict. This  edict shall subsequently be approved by the Federation Council.    The "Internal Affairs Ministry variant" defines in more  clear  terms the forces and means brought into play to make a state of  emergency hold. First and foremost these are territorial  internal affairs organs and armed forces stationed on that  territory. It is also supposed that the Ministry of Internal  Affairs and the Federal Counterintelligence Service shall, on  the president's decision, be in charge of bringing in additional  forces without having to agree this with the federation  components' organs of power. Army units from other regions can  be introduced in exceptional cases and on the president's  decision alone.    In the parliamentary committees they are more worried over  how to monitor the observance of laws during a state of  emergency. Article 37 of the draft law says that the Federation  Council and the commission to be formed by it shall, throughout  the period the state of emergency is in effect, monitor the  observance of laws and conduct inspections of corresponding  territories.    As regards the circumstances and the list of measures to be  applied under a state of emergency, they are virtually the same  as in the 1991 law. The grounds for imposing a state of  emergency are divided into two groups. The first includes  attempts to change the constitutional system, mass disturbances  accompanied by violence, and interethnic conflicts. The second  one includes natural disasters, epidemics, and major accidents.  Like in the previous law, a state of emergency cannot be in  effect for more than 30 days if it is imposed over the entire  territory of Russia, and more than 60 days if imposed over part  of the country's territory.    There are no serious differences in the drafts. Why such a  hurry to pass the new law? Members of the committees must fear  that now that the former law is only partially effective, there  may arise a situation where a state of emergency is imposed  without sufficient legal grounds and parliament would be able  neither to prevent its imposition nor exercise control over the  observance of law on the territory affected by the state of  emergency.</p>

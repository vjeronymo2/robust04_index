			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Bonn-Berlin choice splits the nation GERMANY'S population is split down the middle on whether Bonn or Berlin should be the country's seat of government, writes David Goodhart. A poll for Stern magazine, from a sample of 1,126, gives 48 per cent for Berlin, 46 per cent for Bonn, 6 per cent undecided. In west Germany there is a majority of 55 per cent for Bonn and 40 per cent for Berlin. In east Germany 82 per cent favour Berlin, 12 per cent Bonn. Only 50 per cent of west Berliners and 70 per cent of east Berliners are for Berlin. The Bundestag will decide on June 20. Deputies are thought to be almost as divided as the population at large.</p>

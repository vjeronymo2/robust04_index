			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / US trade deficit up as exports decline The US trade deficit rose sharply in April to Dollars 8.4bn (Pounds 5.5bn) against a revised Dollars 6.9bn in March, official figures indicated yesterday, putting additional downward pressure on the US dollar in foreign exchange markets, Michael Prowse writes from Washington. The rise in the deficit was larger than most economists expected and mainly reflected a 3.3 per cent decline in exports from March to Dollars 56.2bn. Imports fell slightly to Dollars 64.6bn. Part of the weakness in exports, however, reflected an erratic decline in exports of gold bullion. The figures pointed to a widening gap in the trade performance of goods and services. The deficit on goods rose to Dollars 13.3bn against Dollars 11.5bn in March. The surplus on services rose to Dollars 4.9bn against Dollars 4.6bn. The overall deficit for the first four months was Dollars 32.7bn against Dollars 20.8bn last year, indicating a deterioration in the US's external position. The deficit on goods so far is Dollars 50.2bn, indicating the US is heading for its worst showing on merchandise trade since 1987 when it exceeded Dollars 152bn. The poor figures, however, mainly reflect faster economic growth in the US than in other leading economies, rather than a loss of US competitiveness. The deficit may thus decline once Europe and Japan emerge fully from recession.</p>

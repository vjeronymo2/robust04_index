			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Karlsruhe (DPA) -- A group called "27 June Movement  -- Georg von Rauch Commando" has claimed responsibility for the  fatal car accident of Hesse CDU [Christian Democratic Union]  politician Bernhard Saelzer on 18 December. The federal  prosecutor's office announced today in Karlsruhe, in response to  an inquiry, that it has started investigations into persons  unknown suspected of setting up a terrorist organization and  supporting the terrorist Red Army Faction (RAF).    In a letter claiming responsibility, which was made  available  to WIESBADENER TAGBLATT, it said: "It was no accident, even  though it looked like one. We manipulated his Mercedes 300 SE  in such a way that it was impossible to tell what caused  Saelzer's accident despite the most thorough of examinations."    On 27 June this year, the operation aimed at finding the RAF  members Wolfgang Grams and Birgit Hogefeld took place in Bad  Kleinen. Georg von Rauch was shot in December 1971 in West  Berlin during the search for members of the Baader-Meinhof  group, the predecessor of the RAF.</p>

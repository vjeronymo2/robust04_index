			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / O&amp;Y bankssplit over rescue for Canary Wharf BANK LENDERS to Olympia and York's Canary Wharf office development in east London are evenly split on whether the UK subsidiary should be placed into administration under UK insolvency procedures, senior bankers said yesterday. Sources close to O&amp;Y's negotiations with the 11 lenders said around a third of the lenders, including Barclays of the UK, believed administration was preferable for Canary Wharf. Three or four other banks, including Lloyds of the UK, were arguing it would be better to keep Canary Wharf as a going concern under O&amp;Y's ownership. The remaining banks are undecided. 'The banks' positions can change,' said a senior banker. However, he pointed out that banks would probably have to decide next week whether an administrator should be appointed or whether they would provide a Pounds 30m facility to meet Canary Wharf's financial needs for the next month. The 11 lenders have so far provided around Pounds 1bn for the project. The banks involved include Citicorp of the US, Credit Suisse of Switzerland, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia, also from Canada, Credit Lyonnais of France, and Barclays and Lloyds of the UK. On Wednesday, they provided an emergency loan of Pounds 5m to Canary Wharf, but these funds will be used up in the next few days. O&amp;Y had difficulty securing even this small sum, bankers disclosed. Credit Lyonnais originally refused to provide its share of the money, because it felt O&amp;Y was not providing enough financial information nor making strenuous-enough efforts to raise the money by selling assets in Canada. In a separate development relating to O&amp;Y's US operations, Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, said yesterday negotiations with potential tenants in a 53-storey building at 55 Water Street in Lower Manhattan had apparently collapsed. In downgrading the rating of the single-purpose company which owns the property, S&amp;P raised doubts whether funds were available to finance improvements necessary to induce lease renewals or attract new tenants.</p>

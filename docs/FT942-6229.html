			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Supreme Court clears way for human rights conference Filipinos link arms to escort foreign delegates to attend a human rights conference on East Timor in Manila yesterday. The Philippine Supreme Court yesterday cleared the way for the conference to open on schedule. It overturned a decision by a lower court that in effect banned the conference. Indonesia, accused by human rights groups of widespread killings, torture and detentions since it annexed East Timor in 1976, has bitterly opposed the privately organised conference. Bending to this pressure, President Fidel Ramos's government banned foreigners from attending and expelled 11 of them, but about 25 delegates managed to slip through.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: IMAGE CONSULTANTS CAN TAKE JITTERS OUT OF  MAKING THAT BIG PRESENTATION  </P> <P> When you own a small business, you not only run the business, you are the  business. And because most business owners can't afford a full-time public  relations person, the owner usually serves as the company spokesperson.  </P> <P> But what if you are shy in public and feel uncomfortable when asked to answer  questions or speak to groups? Do you stay awake all night before you have to  make a presentation? Do your palms sweat? Does your throat tighten before a  speech?  </P> <P> If so, you may want to consider working with an image or communications  consultant. There are many to choose from, especially in Southern California --  the image capital of the world.  </P> <P> Joe McLean Jr., vice president of an asbestos removal company, admitted that he  was petrified when he had to make presentations to trade or civic groups.  </P> <P> "I got ill the night before," said McLean. "I used to stand behind the podium  and read the speech, grateful that the lights were off while I showed the  slides."  </P> <P> As public speaking became a major part of his role at P. W. Stephens  Contractors in City of Industry, a public relations firm referred him to On  Camera, a West Los Angeles communications consulting firm. After several hours  of training and confidence building, McLean said he now speaks to groups about  three times a week and would think nothing of addressing an audience of 1,000.  </P> <P> "Anybody who wants to get out and sell their product and doesn't do this kind  of thing is kidding themselves," said McLean.  </P> <P> On Camera's Christen Brown and Peter Lownds work with authors, business owners  and anyone else who is anxious to boost confidence and overcome stage fright.  </P> <P> Working with clients in front of a video camera, Brown and Lownds try to bring  out what's best in people, rather than try to change them.  </P> <P> "The camera is a phenomenal tool," said Brown, a former psychologist and  television personality. "People have to see themselves as others see them."  </P> <P> By watching themselves on tape, the clients observe their quirks or nervous  habits. Brown said most people don't realize that more than half of the total  impression made during an oral presentation comes from nonverbal cues. Most of  the rest comes from the speaker's voice; less than 10% results from the actual  words spoken. "I once listened to a man giving a brilliant speech, but one hand  was betraying him by jingling the coins in his pocket," said Lownds, who is an  actor and language teacher.  </P> <P> Communications consultants at On Camera and elsewhere rely on breathing  exercises, visualizations and role playing to help clients relax and be  themselves on camera.  </P> <P> During a recent session with Stuart Brown, an attorney and investment banker  who wanted to refine his Southern "good ol' boy" image, Lownds pretended to be  a high-powered Hollywood mogul interviewing Brown for a job.  </P> <P> The first videotaped session revealed Brown's nervousness. He was unaware that  he was rubbing his thumbs together when he spoke. Brown also tended to lean  back in his chair, looking sleepy, rather than attentively sitting forward.  After a few hours of training and practice, Brown appeared confident, relaxed  and a step ahead of the interviewer.  </P> <P> Clifford Scott, vice president of Scott, Lancaster, Mills, Atha, a small  Century City advertising agency, said he turned to On Camera when he felt his  sales presentations to clients needed more pizazz. "Advertising agencies spend  a tremendous amount of money on the content side, but most agencies don't spend  much money on the form," said Scott. He said the advice he received has  dramatically improved his firm's presentations to new clients.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TIPS ON TALKS  </P> <P> Consultants Christen Brown and Peter Lownds offer the following guidelines on  public speaking:  </P> <P> Learn to relax before making any presentation.  </P> <P> Take deep breaths, inhaling to a count of five and exhaling to a count of 10.  </P> <P> Stretch your whole body.  </P> <P> Relax by rolling your neck in circles, three times in each direction.  </P> <P> Shake your hands vigorously.  </P> <P> Don't eat a heavy meal before a speaking engagement or interview. Digestion  takes a lot of energy.  </P> <P> Since cold water can constrict your vocal cords, sip room temperature water,  preferably with a squirt of lemon juice, if you need to moisten your mouth.  </P> <P> Fill your speech or presentation with illustrations and examples.  </P> <P> Never memorize a speech. Know the exact beginning and the exact end and the  middle will fill itself in.  </P> <P> Make sure your gestures complement your words.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Andersen Study Shows Owners Are Optimistic  </P> <P> The 1989 Arthur Andersen Enterprise Survey reveals some uplifting projections  for small business in the 1990s. Andersen polled more than 4,500 chief  executives on a variety of economic, social and business issues. The companies  represent a cross-section of regions and industries, with sales ranging from $1  million to $120 million.  </P> <P> Almost two-thirds of the companies reported an increase in sales over 1988,  with one-third growing 10% or more. Nearly 75% predict an increase in sales for  1990. Nearly 85% of the employees at the companies surveyed can expect a raise  in 1990, and employees at more than 80% of the companies received one this  year.  </P> <P> About 40% of the firms expanded their work force, but more than 80% said they  were having trouble finding qualified managers and technical people. More than  43% give U.S. public secondary schools a poor rating.  </P> <P> More than three-quarters of the respondents said the recent flurry of leveraged  buyouts is bad for business. However, almost 30% of those surveyed said they  are considering selling their business and 69% said they would sell to a  foreign investor.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based small businesses seem to take the best care of their  employees. Fifty-eight percent of local firms surveyed provide between 96% and  100% of their employees' health-care premiums, compared to 50% of respondents  elsewhere.  </P> <P> Of the Los Angeles respondents, 52% are involved in manufacturing and 21% are  involved in both service and distribution. Most have been in business for 15  years or more.  </P> <P> Annual total compensation was concentrated in the $100,000 to $250,000 range.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Free Forum Offers Advice to Southland Entrepreneurs  </P> <P> People who would like to start a small business or who already run one can get  free advice Saturday at a "Small Business Success Fair" sponsored by Counselors  for Urban Entrepreneurs, a program offered through the office of Los Angeles  Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> About 15 experienced business people will offer advice on everything from  raising capital to doing business with city agencies. The fair runs from 9 a.m.  to 4 p.m. at the Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw Mall, at Crenshaw and Martin Luther  King boulevards.  </P></p>

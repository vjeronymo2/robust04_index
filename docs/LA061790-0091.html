			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICER KILLS MAN DURING RESPONSE TO ALLEGED FIGHT  </P> <P> A San Diego police officer, responding to a reported domestic dispute at a home  Saturday morning, shot and killed a man who was threatening to strike the  lawman with a metal baseball bat, according to police.  </P> <P> A police account, released in the afternoon, stated that officer Brad Phelps  discharged a single shot from his 9-millimeter, semi-automatic service revolver  as the bat-wielding man approached the lawman in a "threatening manner" and  appeared poised to swing the bat.  </P> <P> Officer Phelps fired when the man was less than 10 feet away, according to  police.  </P> <P> The incident occurred about 10:30 a.m., inside the victim's South San Diego  home, in the 3800 block of Hemlock Avenue, police said.  </P> <P> Officer Phelps and two other lawmen had gone to the residence in response to a  report of a man beating his pregnant wife, police said.  </P> <P> The victim, identified as Luis Frank Perez, 28, was struck in the head, police  said. He was dead at the scene.  </P> <P> Also present at the home was the victim's wife, Maria Perez, 17, who is about  seven months pregnant, according to police and a nursing supervisor at Scripps  Memorial Hospital in Chula Vista. The woman, who had no visible injuries, was  being held for observation at Scripps, the nursing official said.  </P> <P> The incident comes after a recent rash of law enforcement shootings in the San  Diego area that has provoked an outcry from various rights groups, including  the American Civil Liberties Union, who have questioned whether officers have  been using sound judgment before firing. Law enforcement guidelines generally  permit lawmen to use lethal force only if their lives or the lives of others  are threatened.  </P> <P> Representatives of area law enforcement authorities, including the San Diego  police, have defended the actions of their officers and maintained that each  incident is investigated thoroughly.  </P> <P> The official police account of Saturday's shooting, while making no judgment on  whether the use of force was justified, stated that the officer responded to a  clear threat -- a man wielding a "full-sized metal baseball bat."  </P> <P> Officer Phelps was reassigned to an administrative post -- standard procedure  in incidents involving shootings by city police officers -- pending resolution  of the case, said police spokesman Sgt. Fred England.  </P> <P> Authorities say all police shootings are subject to an internal review as well  as a criminal investigation by homicide detectives, who forward the results of  their inquiries to the district attorney. The district attorney is then  responsible for determining if lethal force was justified.  </P> <P> San Diego police provided the following chronology of Saturday's shooting:  </P> <P> Three uniformed officers -- Phelps, Norman Ernsbarger and Robert Martin --  arrived at the residence about 10:30 a.m. and could hear the sounds of a  "violent argument" coming from inside the small house, police said.  </P> <P> An "uncooperative" male occupant responded when police knocked at the door,  according to the official account. The officers say they heard a woman  screaming inside the dwelling, prompting them to enter.  </P> <P> At that point, according to police, the man retreated to the kitchen area,  where he picked up the bat, which he held with one hand behind him. He refused  to drop the bat despite "numerous" commands to do so, police said.  </P> <P> Each officer then drew his service revolver, police said. Officer Phelps fired  the fatal shot when the man approached, wielding the bat, according to police.  </P></p>

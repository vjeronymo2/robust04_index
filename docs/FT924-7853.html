			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (15) Parisian showcase links two cultures - Shiseido, a powerful player in the international cosmetics industry THERE are few parts of Paris that are quite as French as the Palais Royal, the sumptuous squares and arched arcades built by Cardinal Richelieu in the 17th century and now colonised by such Parisian institutions as Jack Lang's arts ministry and the Grand Vefour, one of the oldest and finest restaurants in the city. Hidden in the arches is a prettily painted shop with astrological symbols and animal images sketched on its walls in different shades of purple and elegantly-shaped flasks of perfume in the windows. This is the Haute Parfumerie opened earlier this year by Shiseido, the Japanese company which is one of the most powerful players in the international cosmetics industry, as a showcase for its European interests. Shiseido spent more than Dollars 2m to create its Haute Parfumerie. It sells its perfumes from the shop, but sees it less as a regular retail outlet than as an extension of its publicity programme along the lines of the lavish beauty salons owned by the established French fragrance houses, Guerlain and Boucheron. The Haute Parfumerie also marks the latest stage of Shiseido's expansion in Europe. Shiseido first ventured into Europe in the early 1960s, when it started selling its products in Italy. It formalised its Italian links in 1968 by setting up Shiseido Cosmetics (Italia) as its first European subsidiary. Italy was used as a testing ground throughout the 1970s - 'in the early days we treated the Italian operation very much as an experiment,' says Mr Yukata Goto, chief executive of Shiseido International (France). 'And we learnt a lot from our experience there." In 1980 Shiseido was ready to launch a fully-fledged assault on the European market, where it faced strong competition from indigenous companies, including L'Oreal of France, as well as the US groups, Revlon and Estee Lauder. The group set up new subsidiaries in France, Germany and, later, in the UK. Shiseido also introduced specially developed versions of all its ranges  - perfumes, skin care products and cosmetics - for the European market. Its Italian experience had demonstrated that it could not expect to sell the same formulae in Europe as in its native Japan. 'The demands of European consumers are different for every product type,' said Mr Goto. 'The Japanese tend to prefer lighter, more subtle fragrances than the Europeans. There are also differences in skin types and in the climate, which is much more humid in Japan.' Similarly Shiseido decided to adopt a different approach to marketing. In 1980 it appointed Serge Lutens, a French designer and stylist, as its international image creator. He has since co-ordinated every aspect of its publicity across different international markets ranging from its advertising campaigns to the decoration of the Palais Royal salon. But until recently Shiseido shipped its specially developed European ranges over from its factories in Japan and the US. This year it opened its first European production plant, a factory at Gien in France. SHISEIDO now directly employs 700 in Europe, where it made sales of Dollars 134m in its last financial year, an increase of 17 per cent on the previous year. This means that Europe now represents 30 per cent of its sales outside Japan, or 3.3 per cent of the group's overall Dollars 4.06bn turnover. This means that Europe now plays a pivotal part in Shiseido's attempts to increase its overall share of the international cosmetics market from 11 per cent to 15 per cent by the year 2000. Shiseido plans to concentrate on expanding its distribution, rather than manufacturing, activities in Europe. The opening of the Haute Parfumerie in the Palais Royal forms part of this strategy being, as Yoshiharu Fukuhara, Shiseido's worldwide chief executive, put it, 'an ideal bridge linking our two cultures.'</p>

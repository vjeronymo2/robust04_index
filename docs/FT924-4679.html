			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Verson moves back into the black with turnround to Pounds 1.08m Paul Cheeseright, Midlands Correspondent GREATER stability returned to the affairs of Verson International, the Midlands-based machinery manufacturer, during its first half when it turned in pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.08m. This compared with a loss of Pounds 4.7m in the 1991 first half and a pre-tax deficit for the year to last January of Pounds 12.3m. Earnings for the six months to July were 0.72p (losses 3.42p) but again there will be no interim dividend. However, Verson is planning a capital reduction in order, 'to restore the company to a position where, technically, it can resume payments of dividends in the future.' Verson is now entering a new phase of its existence on the back of the sale of one US company, Taylor-Winfield, and the purchase of another, Niagara, the development of tighter links with C Itoh and Hitachi of Japan and a series of new banking arrangements. During the first half, when turnover at Pounds 39.05m was marginally lower than the Pounds 40.04m recorded in the same period of 1991, all but one of the UK companies, now almost solely dependent on exports, traded profitably. And there has been a substantial improvement in the US orderbook. But the first half figures are flattered by the one-off royalty payment of Pounds 3.8m from C Itoh, while the effect of higher orders on the profit-and-loss account will not been seen until the next financial year. Typically, Verson products have a delivery period of nine or more months. This suggests that pre-tax profits in the second half will be lower than in the first and that the benefit of a stronger flow of orders will not be fully felt until 1993-94.</p>

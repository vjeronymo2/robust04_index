			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> HELP ARRIVES AFTER THEFT AT RESEDA  </P> <P> Mike Stone wanted his team to steal some bases. Instead, his team's bases were  stolen.  </P> <P>  And their bats. And batting helmets. And balls. And catching gear.  </P> <P> Stone, the Reseda High baseball coach, was flabbergasted last week when he went  to the team's supply shed and found the cupboard bare.  </P> <P> Not even a doughnut was there.  </P> <P> "Somebody busted the door off," Stone said. "All of it (the equipment) was  stolen. It wiped out our entire baseball supply."  </P> <P> Stone estimated the loss of equipment at $1,000, including eight aluminum bats  that belonged to the players. Stone donated $100, $250 came out of student body  funds and the father of a former player donated baseballs. "People just kind of  came to our rescue," Stone said.  </P> <P> Easton Aluminum Inc., a Van Nuys sporting goods company, donated eight aluminum  bats.  </P> <P> "Coach Stone gave me a list of every bat that was stolen," said Mike Danford,  the company's product manager for bats. "We tried to replace them one for one."  </P> <P> Danford estimated the value of the replacement bats, including an additional  prototype bat that the company plans to market this summer, at between  $600-700.  </P> <P> "They've really saved us," Stone said of Easton.  </P> <P> Armed with the new bats, perhaps the Regents can still save themselves. Reseda  is 4-11 and last in Mid-Valley League play at 1-10.  </P> <P> The missing Link?: Sylmar's newly hired basketball coach, Larry Link, realizes  that he has his work cut out for him. He was hired last week to replace Billy  Reed, who left the program after three losing seasons. The Spartans were 3-13  last year and rarely have had reason to brag about their basketball program.  </P> <P> "We're starting from scratch," Link said. "We're known for baseball and we have  an up-and-coming football program. Basketball has been viewed only as the  season between those sports. Maybe we can change that attitude so that people  look at basketball as equal to the other two sports."  </P> <P> Link, 44, is a 1968 graduate of San Fernando Valley State (now Cal State  Northridge), where he played basketball and baseball. He played basketball for  one year in Europe before becoming a tennis coach. His only basketball coaching  experience came from 1982 to '84 at Hamilton High, where he replaced Yutaka  Shimizu when the current Kennedy coach transferred.  </P> <P> Earning his stripes: It was the last college basketball game for Simi Valley  baseball Coach Mike Scyphers, and it also marked the end of his short-lived  movie career.  </P> <P> The cable station Showtime has been airing a movie titled "Candy Stripe Nurses"  in its red-eye time slot this month. As a senior point guard at Cal State  Northridge, Scyphers briefly appears in uniform during game action. The movie  features Scyphers and several teammates in a win over Fullerton State in the  1974 season finale at Northridge.  </P> <P> The movie, a 76-minute bomb that was given a one-star rating in the TV  listings, is rated R and has all the melodrama, suspense and skin that its name  implies.  </P> <P> "I don't think I've ever seen the whole thing," said Scyphers, who said he has  received phone calls from friends reminding him to watch. "I remember one  (teammate) had a pretty big role, and that the hair and clothes of the actors  looked pretty bad."  </P> <P> Uh, yeah, when the actors wore clothes. Lucky for Scyphers, his basketball  career ended on a better note than did "Nurses." Scyphers nailed a  just-for-the-heck-of-it toss from half-court as the game and his career ended.  </P> <P> It didn't make the movie.  </P> <P> Whiteside's white knight: Poly's Harold Whiteside, who suffered a broken jaw  March 29 when he was hit by a pitch and has been playing ever since with his  mouth wired shut, nearly dropped his jaw when his coach told him of the plans  of an area dentist.  </P> <P> After an item about Whiteside's injury was published, a Van Nuys dentist called  Coach Jerry Cord and offered to make Whiteside a protective mouthpiece, free of  charge.  </P> <P> "He said he'd done it before and that he'd like to help Harold if he could,"  Cord said. "When he told me how much it would normally cost, I made sure Harold  made it down there."  </P> <P> Paid to stay: How much is a high school baseball game worth? Well, to the  Highland Hall Hawks, a Westside League game against Grace Community carried a  $75 price tag for just one player.  </P> <P> The Hawks each kicked in $5 to keep junior third baseman Steve Francis in town  for a few more hours. Francis was scheduled to return home to New York City and  would have missed a first-place showdown with Grace Community.  </P> <P> Francis' parents moved from New York to teach at Highland Hall but returned  East two weeks ago. Francis stayed through the weekend to attend the school's  senior prom and extended his departure a few more hours to play in the Hawks'  8-3 victory. With the $75, Francis exchanged his ticket for a later flight and  went one for three in the Hawks' 21st consecutive league victory.  </P> <P> Staff writers Steve Elling, Vince Kowalick and John Lynch contributed to this  notebook.  </P></p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cadbury rights fears Fears of a rights issue returned to haunt Cadbury-Schweppes after the food group told an analysts meeting that it continued to look for acquisitions in Europe. The remarks, which came at a conference on the company's confectionary strategy, upset a nervous market and the shares tumbled 7 to 472p in an average 1.3m. Shares in Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel gave up 20 to 440p after the company once again pushed back the opening date, pinpointing continued disagreements with constructor TML, and the need to raise additional revenue. One analyst said simply: 'It is best to be out of this stock. It has always been a high risk project and it will continue to be.' But Mr Clive Anderson at Smith New Court was less bearish, saying: 'There is no new negative that has appeared today. Investors have seen far worse in terms of uncertainty.' Eurotunnel is on the reserve list for entrants into the FT-SE 100 Index. Some dealers are sceptical that it will be included when the steering committee decides in June. British Aerospace jumped 14 to 288p after a strong recommendation from long term bull Henderson Crosthwaite was reported in the weekend press. The broker now believes the company has a break-up value of 600p, against its previous forecast of 450p. Sentiment was further boosted by a belief that BAe was about to clinch an order for Hawk aircraft from Indonesia. Engineering group Vickers was boosted by a recommendation from Robert Fleming published at the end of last week. The shares firmed 3 to 135p. In the motors sector, strong bid speculation returned to Lucas Industries, sending the shares sharply ahead in spite of going ex-dividend. They closed at 135p xd, on volume of 2.6m and strong activity in the traded options. International conglomerate BTR, which has been holding presentations in the City, was once again named as the most likely predator. The word is that should BTR decide against a bid for Lucas, it still intends to make an acquisition in the near future. The shares finished 6 up at 613p on volume of 3.6m. Further speculation over possible rights issues in the property sector was raised by Smith New Court, fuelling more talk of the recovery said to be under way in the maligned sector. Smith said the issue will be made to 'stabilise overgeared companies and to make acquisitions', with British Land, MEPC and Hammerson the most likely to tap the market. The broker predicts that cash calls in the next 18 months will raise around Pounds 1.3bn. Hammerson, reporting results today, fell 9 to 320p amid dividend worries. MEPC added a penny at 388p and British Land a penny at 260p. Disappointing results from Associated British Foods hit the shares badly, making it the worst performing stock in the FT-SE 100. The shares declined 16 to 479p. Sector specialists said the stock would remain weak until a restructuring of the bakery business. A cautious note from Kleinwort Benson, together with profit-taking, was said to have weakened Tate &amp; Lyle, off 6 at 415p. Geest retreated 8 to 440p as some in the market felt it lessened the chance of a bid following weekend reports over US interest in Fyffes. Surprise Sunday newspaper stories that Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was poised to bid for Lord Stevens' United Newspapers were dismissed. One analyst said a company with enough problems of its own bidding for a group that had twice its capitalised value would be 'Eighties-style lunacy'. The rise in United of 7 to 580p was generally attributed to broker enthusiasm, while Saatchi's gain of a penny to 172p suggested that, even without United's denial of the story, the market gave it little credence.</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / How to Spend It: A new class of great designers - Today's students are tomorrow's stars. Lucia van der Post admires the work of the class of '92 IT IS NOT often that many of us get the chance to see just what splendid work is being done in art schools and colleges up and down the country. We hear word from abroad of how much admired our British schools are, how inventive and creative the young are, but on the whole, unless we take time and trouble to visit the degree shows of the colleges close to where we live, we have, by and large, to take it all on trust. In recent years there have been two important attempts to bring together under one roof the best work of the best students. Zeev Aram, as a labour of love, because he has spent his whole life in the design world, traipses up and down the country every summer, scouring some 40 of Britain's best art schools. At his own expense he then brings the pieces that pass his particularly scrupulous aesthetic and functional tests to his showroom in London's Kean Street, in Covent Garden, where later in the autumn (from September 18 to October 9) the work can be seen. Zeev Aram always hopes particularly that captains of industry, heads of big manufacturing combines and other commissioners and inspirers will come to the show, for there he believes they will find the talent that will help them produce the products that will sell. The New Designers Exhibition starting at Islington's Business Design Centre on July 9 is slightly different. It is much larger to start with  - the work of some 1,000 different designers will be on show - and it is therefore less stringently edited. However, it is full of life and zest. Far from being a mere academic showcase, these days even the youngest designers have got street-wise and clued up on the ways of the market place, which means that almost everything on show is for sale. If there is anything that has already been sold that you really want you may be absolutely sure that its designer/maker will be keen and ready to make you something almost like it. The spectrum covered is vast - there is colourful glass from designers such as Marianne Buus, whose beautiful green jug is photographed here. There are witty and beautiful pieces of furniture, there are hats and scarves and shoes and jewellery, there are lights and rugs, silver, pewterware or ceramics. Above all, there are some truly lovely textile designs. Many of them have clearly been influenced by the somewhat New Age symbolism pioneered by English Eccentrics but the results are often so beautiful that one simply wants to frame them and hang them. There are several reasons for going to the exhibition - anybody who is looking for products or designers to revitalise his business will find himself spoiled for choice. Anybody who is interested in what the next generation of designers is up to, just how talented, how original, how lively they are, will be fascinated to see the vast range of disciplines on show. Those who want a jolly day out and a chance to buy some original presents will be not be disappointed, while those who are thinking of commissioning a special piece for a special occasion will seldom get a finer chance to find one. You should make especially sure not to miss the section headed One Year On where you can catch up with the work of those who graduated just a year ago. Prices will range from Pounds 20 to about Pounds 2,000 (for a heavily inlaid marquetry table from the Parnham School of Furniture Designs) but there will be lots to choose from at under Pounds 100. The exhibition opens on Thursday, July 9 at 10 am and closes at 8 pm on Friday. It runs from 10 am to 6 pm on Friday 10 and Saturday 11 while on Sunday July 12 it is open from 10 am to 4 pm. Admission charge is Pounds 4, OAPs, Pounds 2.50.</p>

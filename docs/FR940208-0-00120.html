This is needed to balance the costs, even if found not be significant. The Economic Analysis (page 60) states, ``To properly compare benefits and costs, the full range of each must be considered.'' The study fails to do this; therefore, the existing study cannot be used to exclude any of the proposed critical habitat areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conducting a quantitative study of species benefits is a costly and lengthy process that was not possible within the court-mandated deadlines. Even with results of such a study, allocating the benefits of preservation and recovery of an endangered species between the various actions required is an extremely difficult task. If species preservation were accomplished entirely through designation of critical habitat, then the full value of benefits could be attributed to that action. Typically, however, preservation is achieved with multiple interactive management actions (e.g., federally listing as threatened or endangered, protection under State laws), each of which may be essential to recovery and no one of which can be singled out as the sole means by which a species is preserved or recovery attained. Given the data available, and without a clear delineation of the results of each management alternative, it is not possible to disaggregate the sum of benefits to identify that portion directly attributable to critical habitat designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 55:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One letter stated that the economic analysis does not address the impact of potential delays in both maintenance and new construction caused by designation of critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Actions that are authorized, funded, or carried out by Federal agencies are already subject to the jeopardy standard pursuant to section 7 of the Act, if such actions may affect desert tortoises. These actions require consultation between the action agency and the Service to determine whether or not they are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the desert tortoise. With designation of critical habitat, the Service will also determine whether or not such actions are likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. Both assessments will be made concurrently through consultation between the Federal action agency and the Service; therefore, designation of critical habitat will not result in any additional project delays. The Act requires the Service to issue a biological opinion within 135 days of the receipt of a request for formal section 7 consultation from an action agency. Therefore, the requirement for Federal agencies to insure that their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or adversely modify critical habitat would not result in project delays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 56: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One group stated that, given the long time frame necessary for recovery of the desert tortoise, the economic analysis should have considered the long-term effects of known or foreseeable projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Without knowing the details of future projects, the Service cannot know how or to what extent such projects may affect critical habitat or vice versa. The Service evaluated economic information provided on existing projects to determine if the benefits of excluding areas outweighed the benefits of designating those areas as critical habitat. The Service was unable to assign a cost to those projects that may or may not be proposed within critical habitat in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 57: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One group stated that the economic analysis of the effects of removing grazing from Federal lands was inadequate and understates the importance of grazing to the region's economy. Ranchers act as land managers for the Federal government. By eliminating ranching, the Federal government would have to expend additional monies for management. In addition, range improvements, associated with grazing on Federal lands, improve overall habitat quality by providing water sources and facilitating effective forage use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

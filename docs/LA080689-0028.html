			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN THE SIVER SCREEN TURNS RED: OPINIONS ON MOVIE VIOLENCE;  </P> <P> 'BATMAN THE KILLER IS NOT A HERO FOR OUR TIMES...'  </P> <P> The graphically violent movie "Batman" instilled in me a sense of evil. I was  depressed, not by its content so much as that fact that this hugely popular  movie has become such a symbol for both adults and youths.  </P> <P> Why aren't we making T-shirts, key chains, etc., that praise the virtues of the  movie "Field of Dreams" instead?  </P> <P> Do yourself and your family a favor -- go see "Field of Dreams." And buy your  kids a Superman comic book.  </P> <P> GREG O'SULLIVAN  </P> <P> San Gabriel  </P></p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Cost reductions behind Glynwed's improvement GLYNWED International reduced its workforce by 450 during the first half of this year as management continued to assault costs. Cost reductions and a fall in interest charges were the main factors behind the 48 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds 15.4m. The fall in the number of employees worldwide meant that in the last 18 months the group had shed more than 1,800 jobs, taking the payroll down to some 11,500 from a peak of 13,600 in 1989-90. There had been little or no improvement in Glynwed's markets since the 1991 first half, reported Mr Gareth Davies, chairman. Even in the highly profitable plastics division there had been a pause in the demand from key customers, like British Gas and the water companies. Activity in the engineering steels market remained low, although slightly higher than last year. Output from metals services businesses had been higher this year than in the closing months of last, but remained lower than it was in the first half of 1991. COMMENT Glynwed may be trying more to penetrate overseas markets, but the fact remains that about 70 per cent of its turnover is in the UK. The hopes it had of a gradually strengthening domestic economy have been thwarted, like everybody else's. Charting the course of profits is a question of setting poor markets against financial gains from past and, no doubt, future cost cutting. An outcome of Pounds 40m pre-tax for the year, translating into earnings of 13p a share, does not look unreasonable. That gives the shares, at 196p, a prospective multiple of 15; worth holding for an upturn in demand next year or 1994.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Milk marketing deadline set THE GOVERNMENT has set October 1 1994 as the deadline to end the UK's principal milk marketing scheme, according to the Agriculture Bill published yesterday. The Milk Marketing Board for England and Wales, along with the three milk marketing boards in Scotland, have until the end of next year to submit schemes for disposing of their assets to successor bodies. Proposals to turn the MMB for England and Wales into a single voluntary co-operative have run into opposition from the dairy trade.</p>

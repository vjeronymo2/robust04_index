			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THEATER NOTEBOOK: 'FLAME'S CALL' IGNITES INSIGHTS BY PORTRAYING EVERYDAY  CHARACTERS  </P> <P> "There are no heads or tails in theater of the absurd," pronounced Nitza Henig,  two of whose plays are included in a trio of one-acts opening this weekend at  the Shepard Theatre Complex in Hollywood under the title of one of them,  "Flame's Call."  </P> <P> Her first piece, "Repercussions," deals with the triangle of a mother, father  and grown daughter, a relationship unfolded in a series of letters. "After a  child leaves home, what's left?," asked Henig, an Israeli native. The  monologues, she said -- "hopefully like a long poem" -- revolve around "looking  to the past and trying to reach an understanding. Of course parents make  mistakes; we're all imperfect. That's reality."  </P> <P> Her longer piece, "Flame's Call," also uses everyday characters as metaphors  for larger issues. "It's a black comedy, based on a woman who has a little job  in a hospital, who's looking for love -- everywhere and anywhere," she said.  "Her emotions are bigger than life, and love is a very strong need."  </P> <P> A former actress and director who founded Minneapolis' experimental Theatre  From the Center in 1978, Henig's immersion in writing seven months ago has  resulted in three plays. She will see another of her works, "Strange Voyage,"  staged at the Burbage in April.  </P> <P> The middle piece of the evening is Samuel Beckett's "Rockaby." "It's about a  woman who sits in a rocking chair listening to voices," Henig said. "For people  who like strange theater, it's a good piece to see. But Beckett is not very  optimistic."  </P> <P> Also this month:  </P> <P> Tuesday: Maurice Noel's "Canaan Land," whose characters include "an aging  stripper . . . and a tart in a wheelchair" opens at the Cast-at-the-Circle  Theatre in Hollywood.  </P> <P> Italian actor Dario D'Ambrosi returns to Hollywood's Stages Trilingual Theatre  in his acclaimed "Nemico Mio" (Enemy of Mine) and, on March 20, in a new work,  "La Trota" (The Trout). Both will be performed in English.  </P> <P> Thursday: Van Nuys' California Cottage Theatre opens Roy Brocksmith's "Heddy!,"  a seven-character musical drama "freely adapted" from Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler."  </P> <P> In North Hollywood, Group Repertory plays host to a revival of Noel Coward's  "Present Laughter," about the comic trials of an English theater star.  </P> <P> Friday: Studio City's Theatre West presents its second annual Theatre West  Fest, a seven-week festival featuring 16 pieces generated in the theater's  acting, writing and directing workshops.  </P> <P> Caroline Kava's "The Early Girl," a seriocomic character study set in a house  of prostitution, gets a revival at the Attic Theatre in Hollywood.  </P> <P> The five members of the Supreme Court who voted to uphold the Georgia sodomy  statute are kidnaped and put on trial in Charles A. Larson's "To Be Left  Alone," premiering at the Burbage Theatre in West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Saturday: Just in time for St. Patrick's Day, Raymond Galvin's "Spite the Devil  for Awhile," a six-character comedy about an Irish immigrant family in 1940s  New Jersey, makes its premiere at Theatre/Theater in Hollywood.  </P> <P> Saturday: Harold Gould is Sigmund "Freud" in Lynn Roth's one-man biographical  drama, playing three performances only at the University of Judaism's Gindi  Auditorium in West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> March 19: After a six-year absence, the famed improv troupe "War Babies" will  be reunited for a three-night benefit for director Ted Schmitt at the Cast  Theatre. "This Time It's Personal" stars Maryedith Burrell, Caren Kaye, Susan  Krebs, Marsha Meyers, Jed Mills, Renny Temple and John Welsh.  </P> <P> March 20: Twenty-one years after its New York debut (which featured Larry  Hagman), Jay and Fran Landesman's "The Nervous Set" -- billed as "the only  beatnik musical revival and updated with rearranged music" -- opens at the  Heliotrope Theatre in Hollywood. Tommy Wolf wrote the music.  </P> <P> March 21: Fresh from an appearance at the White House, Joe Sears and Jaston  Williams return to Los Angeles with tales of Tuna, "the third-smallest city in  Texas," in their long-running, long-touring comedy hit, "Greater Tuna," opening  at the Westwood Playhouse.  </P></p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: A business built on benchmarks - The Professionals / Seeing how the experts look after their clients' money gives an insight into managing your own better. That's the theory behind Joanna Slaughter's series on private client investment managers. Today: Kleinwort Benson Alastair Begg, chief investment officer of Kleinwort Benson Investment Management, is not one for false modesty. 'We have one of the most disciplined approaches to asset allocation for private clients that there is,' he claims. That approach has been refined and rationalised recently. In January, KBIM produced three benchmark portfolios for private clients, adjusting the weightings to reflect the needs of those seeking income, capital growth, or a balance of the two. The benchmarks were built around certain assumptions, says KBIM director Andrew Gregory. These are: That the minimum requirement for most private clients is maintaining their assets in real terms. That equities will perform better than bonds in the long term. That the risk of a portfolio should be spread both geographically and industrially. Begg adds: 'The benchmarks are the rocks to which we hold fast. We make our decisions around them.' Take the benchmark portfolio for a 'balanced' private client. It has 15 per cent in index-linked gilts, 10 per cent in conventional gilts, 45 per cent in UK equities and 30 per cent in overseas equities, with the international exposure weighted equally between Europe, Japan, the Far East and America. Yet, KBlM's present market weightings for a balanced portfolio have far less money invested in bonds (just over 7 per cent), a 60 per cent exposure to UK equities, and a smaller exposure to Japan. The KBIM policy committee has regular global strategy meetings. The last policy decision it took was to sell some of its Japanese investments and place them into the Far East. Such a policy shift is reflected within 72 hours in the portfolios of discretionary clients and the 10 per cent of clients who are non-discretionary are alerted, too. Begg says this cannot be done in 24 hours because each client portfolio has to be studied to see if a capital gains tax liability will be triggered. For the same reason, there is a similar time frame when changes are made to KBlM's list of approved shares. The list, based on recommendations by the firm's 12-member research group, features 50 to 60 global shares and 25 to 30 in the UK. Interpreting it on behalf of clients is the task of the 25 portfolio managers. There is also a black-list of shares; this includes companies with opaque accounts. Begg says: 'We never hold the shares if we can't work out what is going on in the company because we can't research it.' Although KBIM sometimes invests directly overseas on behalf of the very wealthy - recently, it bought Philippines Long Distance Telephone for private clients - Gregory says portfolio managers 'would not make that kind of investment without putting in a basic fund first. If you want to invest in emerging markets, or somewhere like Japan, the best way to do it is through a collective scheme'. KBlM is an enthusiast for emerging markets and uses its own offshore fund or investment trust to give private clients exposure to this sector. Instead of investing according to an index, the firm weights each of the 24 emerging markets equally, on the ground that there is little or no correlation between the performance of the individual markets. When a market outperforms by a certain amount, the managers are forced sellers; when it underperforms, they are forced buyers. Begg says the strategy is unique to Kleinwort's emerging market funds and that the diversity reduces risk. KBlM's asset allocation and stock-picking disciplines do not mean that each private client is dealt the same hand of cards. Begg says: 'You can't put people into boxes, and there is no answer that is likely to be right for more than one client. Where I think the value is really added is by portfolio managers who have been here for a long time, who have known their clients for a long time, and who listen to them and translate what they say into a portfolio.' He adds: 'Death is our greatest source of client loss, by quite a long way.' Where appropriate, KBlM's portfolio managers use derivatives such as futures and options. Gregory believes derivatives will become an increasingly acceptable way of managing portfolios although he concedes that, as yet, 'it is not something that a number of clients are very comfortable with'. Although there is no hard rule about the acceptable size of portfolios, the minimum annual management fee of Pounds 1,500 largely dictates the level. Clients with less than Pounds 200,000 will be steered towards the firm's unit and investment trust service. Unlike many competitors, KBIM offsets fees against the commission generated during the charging period. No fee is payable on holdings of Kleinwort Benson unit trusts, offshore trusts and investment trusts. Clients also can benefit from KBlM's unusual status as a bank in its own right. It is regulated by both Imro and the Bank of England, and the services of Kleinwort Benson Private Bank have been designed specifically for clients with investment portfolios. Gregory points out: 'Clients can place deposits and borrow from KBIM, so the quality of the service we can offer is genuinely integrated. It gives us a very quick response to any requirement that clients may have.' KBIM is anxious also to emphasise that it is not interested only in the super-rich. Gregory says: 'There is a common misconception in the outside world that you cannot come through the door here without Pounds 10m. That is not so.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Investment managers: factfile 4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Kleinwort Benson (Kleinwort Benson Investment Management) Established: 1792  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Regulator: IMRO; Bank of England Number of offices in UK: Two Number of offices worldwide: 19 (group); 9 (investment management) Funds under management: Pounds 14bn (Pounds 2.6bn private clients) Number of UK private clients: 3,300 Number of expatriate/foreign national private clients: 700 Minimum investment for private clients: Pounds 200,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Current asset allocation for private clients: Balanced portfolio, UK equities, 60.54%; overseas equities, 32.2%; cash and gilts, 7.2%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Average annual portfolio turnover: 25-30%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fees: 0.9% on first Pounds 1m; 0.5% on next Pounds 2m; 0.25% thereafter; minimum Pounds 1,500 pa.

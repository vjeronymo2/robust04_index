			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: Philips suspends plans to produce HDTV televisions PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is suspending plans to produce for market televisions using High-Definition Television technology (HDTV). The move is the result of the UK government's decision in December last year to block a European Community Ecu500m (Dollars 412m) funding programme to develop and market HDTV. Ms Angelique Hoogakker, a company spokeswoman, said yesterday that because there were no programmes on the horizon for the European HDTV standard HD-Mac, the company felt it was pointless to produce HDTV-Mac televisions. 'We will complete the research and development of the HDTV-Mac set but we will not start to produce them until there is a firm indication that there will be programmes. 'The whole thing is dependent on money becoming available for the action plan to back production of such programmes,' said Ms Hoogakker. Mr Henk Bodt, head of Philips' consumer electronics division, said that to push ahead with HDTV-Mac production would be like introducing a car on to the market when there was no petrol available. Philips said yesterday that once it had completed HDTV research, it would focus on wide-screen television technology. Full development of HDTV-Mac was to form one of three strands of the Dutch company's drive to capture increased share in consumer electronics, the others being CD-I compact discs and DCC audio tape. Philips has not paid a dividend for two years, and has made some 50,000 redundancies since 1990.</p>

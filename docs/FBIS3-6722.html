			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Talk of The Week" feature] </F>   [Text] Recently a number of Vietnamese living in exile in  foreign countries have tried to distort and slander the  situation concerning Buddhism in Vietnam. They have made use of  the public disorder in the old imperial city of Hue to arouse  hostile forces in foreign countries to act against the  Vietnamese state. Under the label of protecting human rights,  they have claimed that the Vietnamese state does not respect the  freedom of belief, suppressing religions, and intervening in the  internal affairs of Buddhism. They have sent petitions to and  [word indistinct] talks to the World Conference on Human Rights  held in Vienna, Austria; sent petitions to governments of some  countries during the visits to these countries by Vietnamese  state leaders to protest and cause political pressure.    They have distributed many documents and literature with  reactionary contents, slandering reality. Culprits of the  public disorder occurred on 25 April 1993 in Hue city were put  to public trial on 15 November 1993 in Thua Thien-Hue Province,  meeting the people's requirements. The results of the trial  were supported by people. Many Buddhist superiors, bonzes and  nuns, and Catholic priests have maintained that the Hue public  disorder not only caused economic losses, but also caused bad  impression in and outside the country. However, the Vietnamese  state has given them leniency. The culprits themselves also saw  their guiltiness.    Meanwhile, those people living in exile have distorted and  made a ballyhoo that the Vietnamese state accused the innocent  people. Of these people, Nguyen Xuan Chau, head of the Van Hanh  Monastery in Australia, is the most madly (?violent). So what  kind of people Nguyen Xuan Chau is? [sentence as heard] And  what are his purposes?    Nguyen Xuan Chau, whose Buddhist name is Thich Quang Ba, was  born 15 April 1949 in Nhon An Commune, An Nhon District, Binh  Dinh Province in southern Vietnam. In 1962 he entered monkhood  at Hong Long Pagoda, Nhon An Commune. Passing through Buddhism  classes, in 1973 he entered the Nha Trang College of Buddhism,  and in 1976 he graduated from that college. In 1976 he was  [words indistinct] the reactionary plot, making use of Buddhism  in the Vietnam Buddhist Church, formerly Vietnamese Unified  Buddhism, to contact and transfer reactionary documents and  literature from the Vietnam Buddhist Church to Nghia Binh [Now  Binh Dinh] Province. By disseminating these documents and  literature, they aroused opposition and non-cooperation with the  revolutionary administration, slandering the state policy and  the political system, gathering a number of young men who dodged  military service to Phu Bon area in the central highland  Province of Gia Lai-Kontum to carry out illegal activities.    In 1983, he fled the country to Malaysia, then to Australia.  Now he is in Van Hanh Monastery in Australia. What is his  (?opinion) concerning the above mentioned accusation? What are  his current acts of sabotage in foreign countries? And what are  the purposes of these acts? We will deal with these issues next  Friday during our "Talk of the Week."</p>

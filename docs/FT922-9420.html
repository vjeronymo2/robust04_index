			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Suitors to lobby MPs next week - The Battle for Midland THE LOBBYING of members of parliament by Midland's two suitors will begin in earnest next week when senior executives from both Hongkong Bank and Lloyds are expected to meet Conservative backbenchers. A meeting with Mr William Purves has been provisionally arranged for next Wednesday or Thursday when the Hongkong Bank chairman is due in London. MPs are understood to have offered Lloyds a similar opportunity although details have yet to be finalised. It is expected that all Tory backbenchers will have the option of attending the meetings. The standard format is for those addressing such gatherings - usually scheduled to last about an hour - to be given up to 15 minutes to present their case before fielding questions. Mr Tim Smith, the Conservative MP for Beaconsfield and an officer of the Tory backbench finance committee in the last parliament, is understood to have played a leading role in arranging the meetings. Such is the geographic spread of the groups involved that interest among MPs is likely to be exceptionally widespread. Midland is next week expected to follow the example of its suitors in writing to all MPs. MPs recently received a letter from Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds chairman, arguing that the Hongkong offer failed to address 'the fundamental problems in the UK banking sector.' Hongkong Bank is expected to send out its own letter to MPs shortly. Meanwhile, Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, will this week field his first written questions on the tussle for Midland. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour front bench spokeswoman on City and corporate affairs, is to ask Mr Heseltine when he expects to be informed both of the EC competition directorate's views on the Hongkong proposals and of the Office of Fair Trading's opinion of the possible takeover of Midland by Lloyds. Mr Heseltine will also be asked whether he proposes any amendment to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's present approach to potential takeovers in which the implication for competition is the sole criterion taken into consideration.</p>

This is a despicable  anti-DPRK smear campaign, which grossly distorts the might of  the socialist economy of the DPRK making a long drive,  unaffected by the international economic fluctuation, and the  reality of Korean society where all people live a worthwhile and  happy life.    As far as the development of the Najin-Sonbong Free Economic  and Trade Zone is concerned, it is a project promoted under the  external economic policy of the DPRK. The DPRK Government has  consistently maintained the line of building an independent  national economy by enlisting internal potential and resources  to the maximum under the banner of self-reliance, while  establishing economic relations with other countries and  developing foreign trade on the principles of complete equality  and mutual benefit.    The project is promoted also in close relation with the  Tumen  River Area international cooperation and development sponsored  by the United Nations Development Programme. This shows an  aspect of the external economic development of the DPRK.    The Japanese reactionaries, however, describe it as "an  open-door policy to overcome economic difficulty." This is a  vicious slander against the DPRK.    Their anti-DPRK smear campaign is a graphic expression of  their perplexity in face of the invincible vitality of the  socialist system of the DPRK that satisfies the needs of the  people for food, clothing and housing.    The Japanese reactionaries must drop the false propaganda  against the DPRK, mindful that if they continuously resort to  the anti-DPRK smear campaign, they will get nothing good.</p>

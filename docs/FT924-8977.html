			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Arts: Oh] What a carry on up the Nile - Two new productions at Stratford-upon-Avon ANTONY AND Cleopatra is an uneven play at the best of times. It contains some of the most magnificent lines of poetic drama written by Shakespeare and - because of the poetry - the two central characters have huge potential stature. Some of the best lines extend to their aides, Enobarbus and Charmian. But apart from that, there are a lot of dreary battle scenes and there is not much to be said for the bulk of the Romans. Who remembers parts like Scarus and Tarus? To play it as a drunken romp is therefore perverse. John Caird's production at Stratford starts badly and improves only in the final 15 minutes. The opening set looks like Son et Lumiere at the Sphinx. And if the set is weak, the costumes are worse. This Roman-Egyptian ragbag could have come out of a dressing up box kept in the attic in case somebody wanted to play charades. Antony (Richard Johnson) is an ageing, lecherous slob. Cleopatra (Clare Higgins) looks like a slut until she puts on her robes after Antony's death and has her immortal longings. I know that there is some justification for this in the text. Cleopatra is referred to as a gypsy and Antony is clearly past his best. On the other hand, this is not the Antony and Cleopatra that we know and love. It is scarcely conceivable that a couple so sordid could speak the beautiful lines that they are entrusted with. To be fair to them, they do not always try. Most of the poetry is thrown away. When Antony says 'The long day's task is done', he speaks as if he were Winston Churchill with a cigar in his mouth. Paul Jesson as Enobarbus also suffers. He is a dull man with a beard. When he makes his best-known speech ('the barge she sat in'), it seems wholly out of character and one wonders what it is doing in a production like this. We should not blame the actors. This is director's theatre and presumably Caird took a decision to play up the weaknesses rather than the strengths. There is no sense of the Roman machine, toy battles predominate and Rome seems as drunk as Egypt. The Roman banquet is played like a seedy Boat Night supper. Again, that possibility is in the text, but is hardly a central theme. This Antony and Cleopatra reminds me of a new play I saw in London earlier in the week: Keith Waterhouse's Our Song starring Peter O'Toole. They have the same subject: a man over the top falling for a younger mysterious, wayward girl. It is to that level that Caird has reduced Antony and Cleopatra. Someone in the RSC should have warned him early on that he was going too far in the wrong direction. Meanwhile, at the RSC's Other Place in Stratford was the premiere of School of Night by Peter Whelan. This struck me as over-ambitious even for so promising a playwright, mainly because Whelan is trying to do too much at once. At one level there is a lot of fun and games between Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Kyd of the Revenger's Tragedy and it is amusing to pick up the literary and biographical references. At another, he is demonstrating that England, far from going through a golden age in the last decade of Queen Elizabeth I, was more akin to a police state. Nothing wrong with that: there is a good deal of evidence to support his thesis and Whelan, we know from his Bright and Bold Design at The Pit last year, is well versed in political history and theory. At the same time, School of Night is presented as a thriller. As such, it is mediocre and obscure. The biggest failing, however, comes from showing Marlowe as a Faustus figure believing in Dog not God, leading to lines like 'Dog help me' and 'Dog Almighty'. These scenes are embarrassingly bad and get in the way. The more interesting failing is the attempt to have a dialogue between Marlowe and Shakespeare on how, while admiring each other's work, they had different aims as playwrights. This dialogue is never properly joined and it is unclear to me what Whelan is seeking to say. Nevertheless, his work is worth watching. School of Night is directed by Bill Alexander and Marlowe is played by Richard McCabe who would find the task easier if Whelan had made up his mind about what sort of character he was. Sometimes it seems that this Marlowe was simply over-impressed by clever people at Cambridge.</p>

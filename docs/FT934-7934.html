			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Boost for loans to Latin America STABILITY and economic growth in Latin America is changing the way the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the US political risk insurer, does business in the continent, according to Mrs Ruth Harkin, Opic president. The organisation, 40 per cent of whose activity is in Latin America, plans to shift from insurance towards loans, raising the amount available for loan guarantees from Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.5m) for each project to Dollars 200m. This will enable it to become involved in large projects such as the planned Argentina-Chile gas pipeline. Compared with much of the group's portfolio, such as the former Soviet Union and Gaza Strip, 'this region begins to look stable,' Mrs Harkin said. 'There is going to be less demand for insurance coverage but more for loan guarantees.' The organisation expects to offer at least Dollars 1.7bn in insurance, loan guarantees and equity to support US private investment projects in Latin America this fiscal year, against Dollars 1.4bn in 1992-93. The figure could be 'significantly higher,' Opic said. 'In Latin America our relationship has matured and we feel comfortable about expanding and changing our role,' added Mrs Harkin, who is leading an Opic mission to Brazil, Argentina and Chile focusing on environmentally-related business. The Opic delegation, sponsored by 20 US companies including Chase Manhattan Bank, is the first to focus specifically on the environment, a sector growing by 25 per cent a year.</p>

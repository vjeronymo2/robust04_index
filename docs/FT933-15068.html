			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DIRECTIONLESS trading continued to dog stock index futures with the September contract slipping 10 points on the previous day's close, writes Christine Buckley. After a steady opening which saw the contract start at 2,863 and touch 2,872, a spate of lunchtime selling knocked the shine off and set a downward course for the day. Some blame was put on the buoyant activity in the FT Mid-250 which is diverting attention from the FT-SE 100 with the knock-on effect on footsie futures. With the past resistance level at 2,900 many traders seem to now be focusing on the 2,850 mark with anything below that stimulating some buying and anything above sparking selling. The day's low was in the last half hour of trading when September dipped to 2,838 and pushed up 1 to close at 2,839, trailing cash by 5 points. Volume was 8,918 contracts. Turnover in the traded options fell to 24,314 lots against the previous day's 32,387. BP was the top stock option at 2,021 lots.</p>

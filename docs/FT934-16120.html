			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Student protest in Cambodia About 1,000 Cambodian students took to the streets of Phnom Penh yesterday in a peaceful protest against compulsory French language classes at their technical institute, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh. It was the first mass demonstration seen in the capital since government police and army units bloodily suppressed an anti-corruption protest in December 1991. The students were angry that French-promised educational assistance to their school was linked to their having to learn the language of their former colonial masters. Earlier this year King Norodom Sihanouk had pledged that his country, a French colony until 1955, would become a member of the French-speaking community of nations. Many younger Cambodians would prefer to learn English.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Dumping claim by US Steel Steel tube producers led by US Steel Group yesterday filed anti-dumping charges against competitors from seven countries, claiming that they had seized a quarter of the US market by offering their products at as little as half their production cost. The charges cover seamless steel tube used for drilling oil and gas wells, and are aimed at imports from Argentina, Austria, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and Spain. Austria and Italy are also accused of illegal subsidies which could lead to the imposition of countervailing duties. Mr Thomas Usher, president of US Steel, said that imports of the oil drilling tubes had tripled in 1993 and continued to surge this year. He said the seven countries had now captured 23 per cent of the US market, pushing down prices and jeopardising his company's new Fairfield seamless tube mill. The US Commerce Department must now investigate whether dumping and subsidisation exist, while the ITC will examine whether the US industry has been materially injured.</p>

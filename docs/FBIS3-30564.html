He  told reporters after meeting with both Bosnian and Serb  officials: "I regret to tell you that these discussions have not  reached an agreement yet."    "The major difference is that the Bosnian side wants to have  the withdrawal of artillery, mortars and other heavy weapons out  of range of the city of Sarajevo and be placed under UNPROFOR  (UN Protection Force) control. This is not acceptable for the  Serb side," Akashi said.</p>

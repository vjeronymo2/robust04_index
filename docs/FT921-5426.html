			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Six-month blues TRADING was extremely slow on the UK money market, with little movement except in short rates. While today marks six months of the 10 1/2 per cent base rate, dealers will find little to celebrate. When the rate fell last September, the markets expected another cut to follow soon. It failed to materialise, and some dealers are even discounting any cut before the general election. 'The market wants a base rate cut but doesn't know when to expect it,' said Mr Peter Luxton, senior economist at Barclays. 'Most estimates see it happening some time within about the next 20 working days. 'If it doesn't come, then it's difficult to know how the markets will react.' The subdued market was not helped when the liquidity shortage proved less amenable to the authorities' efforts to relieve it than it had on Monday. The Bank of England forecast a moderate shortage of around Pounds 600m, mainly due to Pounds 646m of treasury bills and maturing assistance, and Pounds 306m of bills for repurchase. It did not operate on the early round, but later revised its forecast to Pounds 650m. Even then, however, it purchased only Pounds 22m of band 1 and 2 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. In the afternoon the forecast increased again to Pounds 750m, but the Bank still took out only some of the shortage, purchasing Pounds 108m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. The remaining shortfall was partly covered by late assistance of Pounds 415m. Early overnight rates hovered around 10 1/4 per cent, but firmed to 11-10 7/8 per cent after midday and went as far as 12-11 3/4 after the 2pm shortage forecast, before drifting off to 11-10 1/2 per cent at the close. Other rates were little changed, with the key three-month interbank stable at 10 3/8 -10 5/16 per cent, although the March short sterling contract dropped four basis points to 89.69. German call money rates firmed slightly to 9.60/70 per cent, from 9.55/65 on Monday, on fears that Bundesbank reserves were rather low. As expected, the Federal Reserve added reserves to the US system through two-day system repurchase agreements. Federal funds had been trading at at 4 3/16 per cent, above the presumed target of 4 per cent.</p>

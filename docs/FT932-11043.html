			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Council patrol aims to cut crime A NORTH-EAST local authority is setting up a street patrol to try to reduce crime on housing estates. It is believed to be the first such patrol in Britain to be run by a council. The 'community force', approved this week by Sedgefield District Council's policy and resources committee, will comprise 11 uniformed officials on patrol. Under the scheme, they will report by radio to a control depot which will alert police to crime. The force will also consult residents on social problems, liaise with police and other groups, call on vulnerable householders and advise on crime prevention. The service, expected to cost Pounds 220,000 in its first year and Pounds 180,000 a year thereafter, will be funded by the council. It has been favourably received by Durham police. But the Police Federation said the community force was a sad comment on government underfunding of the police.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa beats target with reduction in deficit Lufthansa, the German airline set for privatisation later this year, performed better than expected in 1993. The parent company returned a pre-tax loss of DM50m (Dollars 30m) compared with DM297m in the previous year. This reduction in losses was better than the target of halved losses, the airline said yesterday. The improved results reflected a boost in sales combined with reduced costs. The number of passengers carried rose by 3.8 per cent and the volume of freight by 5.4 per cent. This helped offset falling prices and turnover remained flat at the 1992 level of DM15bn. Total operating costs dropped by DM500m during the year, 3 per cent of the total. This was mainly due to staff cuts: the number of employees fell by 4,000 during the year, saving DM300m. Lufthansa has already said that it aims to break even at the group level in the current year after losses of less than DM500m in 1993. The government is likely to reduce its 51 per cent stake this year by not taking up its entitlement to new shares in a large rights issue planned by the airline.</p>

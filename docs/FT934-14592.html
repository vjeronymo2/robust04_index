			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Lotus does better than expected LOTUS Development, the US personal computer software company, reported higher than expected third-quarter earnings, boosted by strong sales of its applications programs for Windows, the popular Microsoft PC operating system. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 18.3m, or 41 cents a share, compared with Dollars 7.3m, or 17 cents, before a stock-sale gain in last year's quarter. Analysts had been predicting earnings of about 34 cents a share. Revenue totalled Dollars 240.1m, a 16 per cent increase over the corresponding period last year. 'We continued to see strong growth in our Windows desktop and communications businesses,' said Mr Jim Manzi, president and chief executive. 'Our international business grew 26 per cent year-over-year for 50 per cent of the quarter's revenue, and growth in our Windows business continued to more than offset the decline of what was once our core business - Dos spreadsheets.' Among the new products launched by Lotus during the quarter was SmartSuite 2.1 for Windows, a new version of a suite of programs that includes database, spreadsheet, wordprocessing, graphics and organiser programs. In September, the company announced plans to consolidate its Cambridge, Massachusetts, operations in one facility to achieve an annual cost savings of Dollars 10m beginning in 1996. Net income for the nine-month period totalled Dollars 45.8m, or Dollars 1.04 a share, excluding a second-quarter charge of Dollars 19.9m , or 45 cents, associated with the acquisition of Approach Software, a database software company.</p>

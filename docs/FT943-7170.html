			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Ruhe warns on Eurofighter German defence minister, Mr Volker Ruhe, said that the Bonn government would not buy the Eurofighter 2000 if it proved to cost the DM150m (Pounds 63m) per aircraft which the German National Audit Office has calculated. 'I can only warn the industry that if it is considering prices like that, the Eurofighter will not be built, said Mr Ruhe. In an interview with Stern magazine, he added that it was not the place of the audit office to recommend that Germany should buy Russian MiG-29 aircraft instead. 'When the German parliament decides on ordering (the aircraft) in 1995, the two most important criteria will be performance and the concept of European industry,' he said. The audit office's controversial report also recommends that Germany delay any purchase of Eurofighter until 2006. However, most experts believe the DM150m figure to be wrong. Industry sources say that the current estimate is around DM103m, against a government target of DM90m. The current year's Eurofighter development funding is due to be debated by German parliamentary committees on 6 September.</p>

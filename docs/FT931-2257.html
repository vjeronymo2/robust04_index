			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Armagnac's allure - Pure column-still Armagnac is not cheap OUR TASTEBUDS work in peculiar ways. Put a row of good cognacs on the table and nose your way through them, then try an Armagnac. It will appear coarse, eclipsed by the ethereal refinement of old cognac. Yet, there are times when only Armagnac will do; that rich, fruity, pungent spirit so close to its native Gascon soil. The late-20th century has begun to blur the edges of the two great French brandies, pushing Armagnac a little way towards its more famous cousin. The Armagnacais who are implicated in the movement will tell you that there is an historical justification for what they are doing, and they are correct. On the other hand, they are referring to a period of history which predates our century, and to spirits which few of us have been lucky enough to taste. What is important is not how Armagnac was made in Victorian times but that the motivation for change has been dictated by backroom accountants demanding an earlier return on investment. What, then, are the differences? They begin with the soil. The best in Armagnac is the sand and clay of Bas Armagnac. Tenareze is a heavier blend of chalk and clay, while Haut Armagnac makes the worst spirits on its wholly chalk soils. In Cognac, chalk soils are considered the best. To a large degree the vines are identical which make the thin, acidic wines which distil to make great brandy. The dominant variety is Ugni Blanc or Saint Emilion. In the past Folle Blanche used to be the best in both areas, but this died out in Cognac before the second world war: only in Armagnac does an appreciable amount survive. Four or five growers continue to make a pure Folle Blanche Armagnac. In Armagnac there is also the Colombard grape and the Baco. The hybrid Baco will have to go before 2010, but it has its fans. Growers counter that it is only good because it is planted in the best vineyards of Bas Armagnac. The chief difference lies in distillation. Both started out with the onion-shaped pot which distils in batches. At the turn of the century, Armagnac went over to the column still, a cheaper, continuous process. When the first legislation was introduced to govern spirit distillation in 1936, there were no pot stills left in Armagnac. The law was amended in 1973 and many distillers took the chance to install a battery of cognac-like pot stills. Spirit runs off a pot still at a higher degree of alcoholic strength than a continuous still: 70 or more per cent, as opposed to as little as 52 per cent from the column. The pot-still spirit is cleaner, with fewer impurities. There is a disadvantage, however: you miss out on that powerful aroma of prunes, incense, spices and wild mushrooms and make a spirit which is neither Armagnac nor cognac, for pot-still Armagnacs rarely achieve any distinction in old age. Where the commercial incentive comes in is that pot still spirits are ready to drink rather earlier than those made in a column still. You might market a pleasant drink when it is only two or three years old, providing you add a little cane sugar and caramel and stick it in a new oak barrel to give it a nuance of vanilla. Almost all 'three-star' and many VSOP Armagnacs are made in this way, and pot-still spirit will be found in varying proportions in Armagnacs up to XO level. After that, deluxe and vintage Armagnac is produced by the traditional, continuous still. Even traditional Armagnacs age more quickly than cognac. It is hotter in Gascony than in the Charentes and, throughout the summer months, distillers often lodge casks in hot lofts where the spirit gains in strength. The famous 'ranclo' character of old sherry, nuts, dried apricots and wild mushrooms creeps in earlier in Armagnac, when the spirit is about 10. In Cognac, you generally have to wait until it is over 25. Wise blenders transfer their Armagnac from wood to glass demijohns after 30 years; otherwise, the woodiness becomes overpowering. This was demonstrated by an 1888 Armagnac from the Bas-Armagnac firm of Samalens. Extract of Armagnac, Pierre Samalens called it. It had been 80 years in cask. Armagnac may sport a vintage date, a privilege denied to cognac. These vintage Armagnacs are available readily although many of the houses prefer their blends, which represent house styles as opposed to the caprices of the weather. Pure column-still Armagnac does not come cheap. The merchant house of Larressingle makes a nice spicy 'Tres vieil Tenareze' at Pounds 25 from Balls Brothers (311 Cambridge Heath, London E2, tel: 071-739-1642). Samalens' prune and iris-scented Vieille relique will set you back about Pounds 50 from Harrods (071-499-6292 for other stockists). The slightly harder style of Tenareze is well represented by the Armagnacs of Chateau Pomes Peberere. Arthur Rackham and The Vintner shops sell the 1961 vintage at Pounds 52.99 but, if you baulk at that, there is a pure column-still VSOP at Pounds 18.89. For the more aromatic spirits of Bas Armagnac, the Domaine de Mouchac 1976 is made in a benchmark style (Pounds 50 from Lay and Wheeler of Colchester (0206-577-272). The very best Armagnac I have tasted this past year, however, is the Folle Blanche from the Domaine de Boignieres with its delightful aromas of flowers and apricots. It is just what Armagnac ought to be and worth every penny of Pounds 70 from Bloomsbury Wine and Spirit (071-436-4763) or Harcourt Fine Wine (071-723-7202).</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Iskandaryan: "Hot Spot. Three </F> Questions From Tskhinvali or the Trigger Has Not Been Pulled  Yet...Russia Is Tired of Bearing Her Cross in the Transcaucasus.  But There Are No Alternatives. Who Else?..."]    [Text] It seems the world has already managed to forget  about the events that occurred only two years ago in South  Ossetia. The subject of war, as it relates to Georgia, has been  enriched recently by the bloody war in Abkhazia and the battle  with the Zviadists in western Georgia.    Today, intensive negotiations are being conducted concerning  regulation of the situation around Abkhazia, but the fate of  South Ossetia continues to be merely a subject of academic  discussions. Yet, the internal situation in the self-proclaimed  republic is extremely difficult, and the reason for this is the  uncertainty of its fate. This is understood quite well in  Tskhinvali by practically everyone I was able to speak with. But  destinies, including of this territory, are not decided in the  capital.    The recent Supreme Council elections of the South Ossetian  Republic made it possible to form a leadership consisting of  relatively moderate politicians. In a fairly short period of  time, a number of high officials of South Ossetia repeatedly  announced rather loudly the desirability and need to begin the  negotiation process with Georgia. Either there was no answer  from Tbilisi at all or it was interpreted as negative.    Thus, the head of the Georgian state, Eduard Shevardnadze,  having evaluated the new membership in the South Ossetian  parliament as "people with whom one could work," subsequently  stated that they did not recognize the elections or the Supreme  Council as such.  <H5>  In Dagomys There Is an Elder, but What About Tskhinvali? </H5>   In the agreements that, on Russia's initiative and with her  direct participation, were signed on 24 June 1992 in Dagomys by  the leaders of Georgia and approved by the leaders of South  Ossetia and the Chairman of the Supreme Council of North  Ossetia, the point about ceasefire, separating the opposing  sides, and introducing peacekeeping forces into the zone of  conflict was the major one but not the only one.    The Dagomys agreements stipulated that compliance would be  overseen by a specially created Mixed Oversight Commission (SKK)  made up of representatives of Russia, Georgia, and North  Ossetia. In the first stage of the activity, it turned out that  a mechanism had been created that was fairly successful for such  cases.    The Mixed Oversight Commission handled many problems,  including the then critical problem of releasing or exchanging  prisoners of war and supplying the local population with food  and fuel, and coordinated the operations for confiscating  weapons from illegal armed formations. Unnoticed at first  glance, but extremely important in the commission's activity  today, is the fact that its decisions were reported to the high  officials of Russia and Georgia, which made it possible to react  promptly to the change in the situation.    Approximately a year ago, the Mixed Oversight Commission  quietly faded out of sight without leaving a trace. They are  trying to keep track of and analyze the problems of the war torn  land and its residents today through short inspection trips from  Moscow and Tbilisi, and there is no system to these visits, just  as so far there are no apparent results.    In South Ossetia, any kind of news or rumor about an  inspection spreads immediately, and the words of one of the  secondary guests from the Russian Government to the effect that  "out of every three rubles Russia will give Georgia, one is  intended for South Ossetia" initially evoked euphoria. As always  in such cases, the euphoria was quickly replaced by  disenchantment because so far the republic has received neither  money nor construction materials to restore the practically  destroyed economy.    Nobody in Tskhinvali believes the promises of Georgian  visitors at all. The recently appointed minister of affairs of  Shida Kartli (this--Inner Kartli--is what they call South  Ossetia in Georgia), Vazha Khachapuridze, visits only the  Georgian villages around Tskhinvali. And, those rare guests from  Tbilisi who go to the actual capital of South Ossetia give  various figures and dates.    The last sum of a half billion was promised a month ago. At  the same time, it must be recalled that almost a year and a half  ago a special multilateral commission determined the sum of  damages caused by the war to South Ossetia at R43 billion. At  the exchange rate at that time, this was almost $25 million. Now  it is half as much. But, even in the aforementioned Dagomys  agreements, the Georgian leaders promised to pay for two-thirds  of the damages.    If one keeps in mind the current lamentable condition of the  Georgian economy and its complete dependence on Russian aid,  although it has not been received so far, one can draw the  conclusion that the entire sum will lie on Russia's shoulders  one way or another.  <H5>  The Russian-Georgian Border--Is It the Ossetia-Ossetian </H5> Border?    In April of last year, the Russian parliament at the time  adopted the Law on the State Border of the Russian Federation.  The demarcation with the so-called nearby foreign countries was  difficult, and the innocent bystander might be reminded of  anything at all but a well-considered state policy.    First, the Russian border guards were withdrawn from the  Transcaucasus to the Northern Caucasus where it was decided to  create new "boundaries of the Motherland." So, they organized  the North Caucasian border district with a staff in Stavropol,  which is far away even from the new boundaries.    The development of the basic forces has proceeded in various  ways. In some places, it has not occurred at all--for example,  in the Chechen Republic, which according to the new Russian  Constitution is a part of the Russian Federation. And, in some  places, it has proceeded with enviable acceleration and the  unenviable quality that traditionally corresponds to  acceleration such as, for example, in North Ossetia.    Border guards have had to be stationed in the republic,  which  has little land and many people and is already impossibly  overloaded with troops. The traditional Caucasian hospitality  can hardly compensate for the absence of the necessary quantity  of barracks and staff premises or provide any apartments or even  rooms in dormitories for officers.    The second stage of the construction of the new Russian  border led to a situation where now our border guards are again  guarding the outer borders of the former USSR in the  Transcaucasus. The only place they have not moved in yet is  Azerbaijan. The name of the border district has also changed--it  is now the Special Caucasian Border District.    It turns out that the Russian Federation now has two  concentric borders. And, there is a gaping hole in the nearer  one--Chechnya. And, the border in North Ossetia is being  reinforced in a planned way. One of Fazil Iskander's heroes  could not understand at all-- is Abkhazia Adzharia or not. It is  also difficult to understand in real life what the Russian  Border Troops are guarding at the northern Russian portal of the  Rokskiy Tunnel--the border between Russia and Georgia or between  one Ossetia and the other.    The state border that passes through the middle of the  territory populated by just one ethnic group evokes no  enthusiasm in either North or South Ossetia, but it is not  causing any special protest either. From time to time. So far,  the law on the border has not been fully enforced here, as,  incidentally, is also the case in South Dagestan, on the land of  the Lezgin people. With the border strip, the border regime, and  special passes for local residents.    In South Ossetia, even now, they think that the Russian post  with the armored equipment at the entrance to the area was  placed here to close off the border in the event of "special  circumstances." And, border and customs control is carried out  not here but several kilometers below, on the territory of North  Ossetia, where its own border personnel are also located.    Another paradox noted in connection with the border  innovations is the implementation of the agreement on service in  Russian border troops by citizens of sovereign states of  Transcaucasia. This decision is rather strange in and of itself.  But, there are cases where it obviously cannot work, and this  apparently should be stipulated, especially at the high  legislative or governmental level.    Who, for example, should protect that same Rokskiy crossing  from the South Ossetia side--citizens of this territory or  recruits from Georgia? It is quite clear what could happen if it  were the Georgians. After all, the residents of South Ossetia  are afraid not only of closing the border in and of itself but  of what could happen as a result of a new outburst of military  activity.  <H5>  Which Is More Important--Moscow or the CSCE? </H5>   After Russia's actual withdrawal from political  participation  in the South Ossetian fate and supervision of the implementation  of the agreements that were reached with such difficulty,  participants in the CSCE mission tried to fill this sacred  position. It would seem that the fact of keeping peace is  important in and of itself, and whoever ends up first here is  not so important. But, as one can see from a brief acquaintance  with the situation in South Ossetia and its environs, nobody can  replace Russia in this region. And, it would even be strange to  think otherwise. Such is the case with the CSCE as well.    Periodically the CSCE in Tbilisi and Tskhinvali put forth  various plans to begin the negotiating process, but the example  of Abkhazia, which is appropriate in this case, shows one thing.  Namely: None of the countries participating in the CSCE or the  United Nations are ready to actually pay with money or the  health of their subjects for the peace process in the outskirts  of the former USSR. None of the great powers except for Russia,  since it is the only one vitally interested in real peace along  its nearby boundaries. And, in this region, Russia carries more  weight than all the rest of the countries of the CSCE taken  together. Without Russia's participation, obviously, the problem  of South Ossetia is not likely to be solved.    A member of the State Duma who visited South Ossetia  recently, Aleksandr Dzasokhov, advised the chairman of  parliament, Lyudvig Chibirov, without rejecting aid from the  mission of the CSCE, still to place any real hopes in Moscow.    It seems that only Moscow is capable of breathing life into  the plans for beginning real Ossetian-Georgian regulation. Well,  Russia was the initiator of the ceasefire, and she apparently  will have to continue to bear her cross. Otherwise, the brief  period of relative peace in South Ossetia could come to an end.  Out of a flimsy peace, it is necessary to try to make a strong  one.</p>

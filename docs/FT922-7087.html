			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / World Trade News: EC threat to banana exporters LATIN American exporters of bananas to the EC could face curbs under the European Commission's latest plans to protect its traditional, mostly Caribbean suppliers, David Gardner reports from Brussels. Last month, Brussels imposed quotas on so-called 'dollar zone' banana exporters, plus a 20 per cent tariff, ahead of next year's single market. Central America, Colombia and Ecuador provided three-fifths of the EC's 3.4m tonnes consumed in 1990. The assumption was that this would now be consolidated, with an extra 3 per cent-a-year 'dollar' quota to accommodate rising consumption. EC suppliers from outlying areas such as France's Martinique and Spain's Canary Islands, and from Caribbean and African producers linked to the EC by the Lome Convention, would have their higher-cost produce protected. Brussels' latest view on the quotas (in a document to be sent to interested parties) is more restrictive than expected. 'From a Latin American point of view, it's fairly much a disaster,' one observer said. Under scenarios listed, 'dollar zone' producers would have only 1.4m tonnes (two-thirds of what they supply now) guaranteed. An extra 900,000 tonnes would be licensed out to 'dollar zone' and traditional suppliers, as would 3 per cent annual increments thereafter. A decision is not expected before July.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / TSB to end its operations in Northern Ireland TSB GROUP, the sixth-largest UK bank, is to withdraw from Northern Ireland and sell its 56-branch network there to Allied Irish Banks, the largest bank in the Irish Republic, for Pounds 111m. The deal will make AIB the third largest banking group in Northern Ireland, after the Northern Bank and the Ulster Bank. At present it has 45 branches in Northern Ireland. The two banks have an estimated combined share of about 25 per cent. Mr Peter Sutherland, AIB chairman, said the TSB acquisition was an important ingredient in AIB's strategy of increasing its strength in its core market. 'It is one of the biggest ever private sector investments in Northern Ireland and is a vote of confidence in its economy,' he said. TSB said yesterday that it had been approached by AIB about the sale. 'It is good for TSB Group shareholders, whose investment in TSB Bank Northern Ireland is being sold for a price well in excess of book value,' said Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB chairman. AIB has paid Pounds 42.5m in goodwill, above the Pounds 68.5m book value of the operations, which last year made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 17.7m, including a pensions holiday benefit of Pounds 1.25m, on total assets of Pounds 697.2m. It has given an undertaking that there will be no compulsory redundancies in Northern Ireland among the 1,400 employees of the two banks as a result of the TSB takeover. Mr John Taylor, an Ulster Unionist party MP, said yesterday that AIB still did not employ people on a basis which reflected the religious composition of Northern Ireland and called on the bank not to discriminate against Protestant employees in any rationalisation. In the past there have been allegations that both banks contravened fair employment rules in Northern Ireland with AIB alleged to employ a disproportionate number of Roman Catholics while TSB allegedly leaned towards Protestant employees. Mr Gerry Scanlan, AIB chief executive, said that there would 'definitely not be a rights issue' to fund the TSB purchase. Last year AIB made an IPounds 160m (Pounds 145m) rights issue to finance a Dollars 217m (Pounds 125.8m) bid for Baltimore Bancorp in the US. However, the bid was eventually abandoned because of the parlous state of the US banking sector. TSB Group has struggled to contain losses on bad debts by Hill Samuel, its merchant banking subsidiary. In March, Sir Nicholas told shareholders that the bank faced a sharp cut in interim profits this year because of continuing losses on corporate lending by Hill Samuel.</p>

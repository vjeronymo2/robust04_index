			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Travelling by Clubb class - The future for CTR without Robert Montague Mr Ian Clubb, the new chief executive of Central Transport Rental Group, was yesterday plotting the company's strategy without the man he once described as crucial to the future of the business. Mr Clubb took over the position at the indebted trailer rental company, formerly known as Tiphook, on Wednesday prior to Mr Robert Montague, the former incumbent, being declared bankrupt at Oxford county court yesterday. Mr Clubb will also continue as non-executive chairman and with his other directorships at TLG, Expro and First Choice. Mr Montague, who founded Tiphook 16 years ago, building it into one of the largest container groups in Europe, has personal debts said to be in excess of Pounds 35m. 'There is no doubt that the loss of Robert Montague is a blow,' said Mr Clubb yesterday. 'He added value. He is someone who really understands the trailer rental business. But life goes on. 'We have been aware of the possibility of Robert's bankruptcy for some time and have been putting into place contingency plans.' These have included a rationalisation programme at the group's headquarters, involving hefty staff cuts and relocating out of palatial Whitehall offices into more sombre surroundings in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. It has also meant devolving more responsibilities to the regional managers. 'We have an excellent team out there, and I am convinced that we can take the business forward from here,' Mr Clubb said. CTR recently reported sharply reduced losses of Pounds 7.2m for the half-year, although debts stood at Pounds 502m against shareholders funds of just Pounds 26.3m. Industry opinion is divided over the group's long-term future. 'Robert Montague's departure is the best thing that could have happened for CTR,' said Mr Michael Williams, chief executive of Dawsongroup, which specialises in trailer rental. 'He has done a lot of damage to the company and had an adverse effect on the industry. He was too busy fighting fires to get on with the day-to-day things.' Mr Jim Cleary, a former director of TIP, Tiphook's main rival in the European container market, said: 'What Robert Montague achieved was tremendous. This is a people business and he was very good at it. CTR will need a new chief executive who can build relationships with its major customers and motivate the sales force.' As important, he stressed, was the need for capital expenditure, a view echoed by industry analysts. 'CTR needs either a massive restructuring, or a big backer,' said one. 'Otherwise it will not be able to update its fleet and compete.' Another suggested that CTR's best hope lay with a friendly takeover as happened with GE's capture of TIP. 'There may be a future for CTR, but it will need considerable investment, and shareholders will not be the source of it,' he said, a reference to the group's long-suffering investors who have seen the shares drop from nearly 600p three years ago to just 33p yesterday. Mr Clubb agreed that a restructuring was inevitable, possibly some time next year, with a debt-for-equity swap considered the most likely solution. Mr Montague's future is less assured. Although bankruptcy disqualifies him as a director, CTR had planned to employ him as a consultant. 'I very much wanted to keep him on in some capacity but the legislation in this area made it too difficult,' said Mr Clubb. A friend yesterday described Mr Montague as 'deeply distressed' at being made bankrupt. His creditor banks were last night discussing the appointment of a receiver to his estate, which includes an Pounds 8m mansion in Oxfordshire and a Pounds 7m yacht. He is thought to have run up the bulk of his debts - possibly as much as Pounds 20m - by borrowing money against his shareholdings in Tiphook in order to take up his rights in the three issues the group made in the second half of the 1980s. His lifestyle reflected his borrowings and included sports cars, a private jet, a country estate and cattle breeding, which earned him a reputation as an icon of the entrepreneurial 1980s. Mr Montague's popularity with investors soured in the 1990s as Tiphook's fortunes began to wane and he attracted considerable criticism for the hefty salary increases - he earned Pounds 1.3m last year - and options benefits. 'Robert Montague's legacy is to leave behind a business that is the market leader in Europe,' Mr Clubb said yesterday. Both Mr Montague and CTR investors may feel they have paid a high price for that position.</p>

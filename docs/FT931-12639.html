			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Remy issues warning on profits for 1992 REMY-COINTREAU, one of France's leading drinks groups, issued a profits warning for 1992 because of the sluggish economic environment and the impact of high French interest rates, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. Remy, which has extensive interests in champagne as well as its signature Remy-Martin and Cointreau spirits brands, suffered a 7.5 per cent fall in turnover to FFr4.39bn (Dollars 823m) in the nine months to December 31. The company said that it had experienced a recovery in demand during the third quarter, but this had failed to compensate for the reduction in sales during the first half. It did not disclose details of its profit performance in the first nine months, nor of its probable performance for the full year to March 31. However, the company confirmed that it anticipated a reduction on its FFr271m net profits of the previous year.</p>

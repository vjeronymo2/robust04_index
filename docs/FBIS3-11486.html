In the Caribbean city of  Cartagena de Indias, the minister said: "What we know is that  the Cuban Government is maintaining its former position,  previously stated to our ambassador in Cuba, meaning the  guerrilla summit was not held there." Villegas emphasized: "We  believe that as long as we do not have enough evidence proving  otherwise, we obviously have to believe the Cuban Government."    On Saturday, media sources reported that Cuban President  Fidel Castro denied his government had sponsored a meeting of  Colombian guerrilla leaders on the island. He reaffirmed his  pledge to Colombia, in other words, to not interfere in its  internal affairs. Castro ruled out the possibility various  Colombian guerrilla leaders had participated in the Fourth Latin  American and Caribbean Meeting for People's Solidarity and  Self-Determination, held late in January in Havana.    The Colombian Government demanded an explanation from the  Cuban Government on the alleged presence of Guerrilla  Coordinating Board (CG) leaders in Cuba, and it warned that  relations between the two countries would suffer a great setback  if the rumor was confirmed.    Castro talked with Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin  over the telephone and said he had ordered an investigation,  while adding that he had individually verified all the names of  the people who attended the solidarity meeting so he could  guarantee with certainty that there were no guerrilla members.    On Thursday, Sanin said that based on information received  from the Attorney General's Office, "we have serious evidence  that Cuba possibly welcomed the guerrilla members, who  apparently participated in a political summit."</p>

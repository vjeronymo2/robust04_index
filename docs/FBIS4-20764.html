			<p>CSO     [Text] Dubai--An economic study summed up the idea of  establishing a free-trade zone in Saudi Arabia by confirming  that hosting joint ventures in the free zone would best serve  the developmental, economic, and social goals in the Kingdom.    The study, prepared by Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahim Fu'ad Faris,  economic advisor in the office of the Minister of State and  Chief of the General Monitoring Bureau in Saudi Arabia,  indicates that "hosting joint ventures in the free zone  represents an important step toward gradually liberalizing  production factors on scientific bases. It will also help  indirectly to achieve economic integration among Arab countries  or the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] states."    He said in his study, published in the most recent issue of  TA'AWUN [Cooperation], published by the Secretariat General of  the GCC states, that "for the hosted projects to produce the  desired results, the Kingdom would follow a selective policy  with the aim of establishing a free industrial export zone, and  not only a free port. Industries would be located there to help  create new added value."    He indicated that supporters of establishing a free zone in  Saudi Arabia hope it would achieve several objectives, such as  diversifying the economic base and boosting the participation of  the industrial sector in the GNP. Industry currently accounts  for 10 percent of GNP, and oil accounts for more than 90 percent  of the Kingdom's total exports, despite the remarkable  development the petrochemical industry and other industries have  achieved. The study noted that supporters of a free zone seek to  encourage greater private sector participation, as an active  free zone and the private sector's cash flow inside and outside  the country offer the private sector investment opportunities to  carry out its important role. The free zone can also help to  transfer and develop usable technology to serve the needs of the  Saudi economy. Proponents of the idea, according to the  study, believe the free zone could increase the non-oil GNP  growth rate by increasing demand for locally produced raw  materials; stimulating exports of goods and services; reducing  substitute imports; and using and training domestic labor. They  also see the possibility of bringing home Saudi money abroad and  attracting foreign capital, as well as helping to support the  competitive ability of the industries the Kingom takes part in.  Saudi Arabia's petrochemical production has trouble penetrating  European markets, for example, because of taxes and other  obstacles, negatively effecting the competitive ability of these  industries. The establishment of joint ventures with other  countries in the free zone would support these industries'  competitive ability.    Dr. Faris believes that "the Kingdom should heed the example  of other countries so that Saudi Arabia will not repeat their  unsuccessful experiences with projects that were hastily  implemented during the oil boom." He pointed out that "the idea  of establishing a free zone must be founded on the basis of its  own merits."    The study contained two propositions, one supporting the  idea  of establishing a free zone in the Kingdom, and the other not  supporting it. It mentioned "that some of the encouraging  factors that show the possibility of establishing a free port in  the Kingdom are: Saudi Arabia's pursuance of a free economy  policy; the volume and international standing of the Saudi  economy, estimated at $50 billion annually; abundant capital and  liquidity; and the excellent reputation and confidence the  Kingdom enjoys in global financil circles, in addition to its  political and economic stability."    Among the obstacles and negative aspects of the  establishment  of a free zone in the Kingdom are, according to statements not  supporting the idea, the high cost. Despite the Kingdom's  excellent infrastructure, the establishment of the zone would  require the spending of large sums, possibly in excess of $10  billion. The free zone in 'Jabal 'Ali, constructed in the late  1970s, cost $2.5 billion, or the equivalent of $10 billion in  1988 prices.    Besides that, free zones have failed to achieve their  goals--such as the transfer of appropriate modern technology--in  numerous countries. And free zones have social and political  effects that, it is expected, Saudi society would reject. As to  economic freedom in the Kingdom, some people believe the Saudi  economy enjoys sufficient economic freedom, and that the  establishment of a free zone might not add all that much to it.  For another thing, free zones are not considered, from an  economic standpoint, to be part of the host country. If there  were a concession agreement between Saudi Arabia and another  country as the first country's condition for custody, then the  free zone's products might not benefit in this case, as its  products would not be Saudi, even if the Kingdom's share in  those goods were substantial.    The study concluded by saying that establishing a free zone  in the Kingdom would require conditions, among them the use of a  system sufficiently flexible in terms of guiding measures for  establishing imported labor and their families; stimulating the  financial market in the Kingdom; lifting many curbs, while  retaining controls or enacting similar ones to reduce chances of  repeating the stock exchange experiment in Kuwait; and studying  incentives, to aid the success of the free zone without damage  to the local market in the form of taxes, duties, administrative  measures, control of foreign currency, and arbitration. It added  that while the 'Jabal 'Ali free zone was the first to enter the  free zone world, Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia and  Iran, are considering or may consider their own free zones. It  is expected that competition would intensify after the  establishment of these zones, ending the chances of most or even  all of them for success. Thus it would be necessary to invite  relevant Arab countries, particularly the GCC states, to  coordinate among themselves to avoid trouble.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: AOUITA WINS 5,000 METERS, TAKES SEASON TITLE  </P> <P> Said Aouita capped a brilliant season by posting the world's second-fastest  5,000-meter time Friday to win the the Grand Prix track and field overall men's  title for the third time in four years.  </P> <P> However, the Moroccan's time of 13:06.36 at Monte Carlo, Monaco, was  overshadowed by an injury to his right calf, which he said might keep him out  of next week's World Cup at Barcelona, Spain.  </P> <P> "I don't know if I can go," Aouita said after earning the $25,000 prize that  goes to the overall winner of the 17-stop IAAF-Mobil Grand Prix. "I'll be  seeing a doctor tomorrow and then I'll decide."  </P> <P> Two-time Olympic gold-medal hurdler Roger Kingdom, who set a world record in  the 110-meter high hurdles two weeks ago, started the day tied with Aouita for  the men's overall lead but finished third to Colin Jackson of Britain and  American Tonie Campbell, who tied for first in 13.22 seconds.  </P> <P> However, even if Kingdom had won his race and finished in a tie with Aouita, he  would not have shared the overall title under complicated IAAF rules.  </P> <P> In other events:  </P> <P>  -- Olympic bronze medalist Danny Everett of Los Angeles beat world  record-holder and Olympic silver medalist Butch Reynolds in an American  400-meter showdown, 44.59 to 45.06.  </P> <P>  -- Rodion Gataullin of the Soviet Union won the pole vault at 18 feet 8 1/4  inches. World record-holder and Olympic champion Sergei Bubka, who has an  injured right leg, finished fourth at 18-4 1/2, after his only jump of the  night.  </P> <P>  -- Ray Stewart of Jamaica won the 100 meters in 10.13, as two-time Olympic  gold medalist Carl Lewis finished third in 10.30.  </P></p>

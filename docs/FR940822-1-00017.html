			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulation relative to use of nontoxic shot and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concomitant endorsement by the Service of steel shot has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated some controversy. Some hunters still believe that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steel shot is less ballistically efficient than lead and can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damage shotgun barrels, although the Service believes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> majority of hunters have accepted steel as an effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative to lead. However, resistance to the use of steel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shot is undoubtedly creating an unknown level of noncompliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the requirement to use nontoxic shot for waterfowl and coot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hunting. The availability of an alternative to steel shot will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide the public greater choice during an interim period and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thus, could improve hunter compliance with nontoxic shot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in waterfowl hunting situations. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased hunter use of this alternative shot could benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upland game bird habitats, and upland game birds as well, through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the diminished use of lead shot in those areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service is proposing this conditional, interim approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the basis of what is known about the toxicity of bismuth and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tin, principally the former because it makes up almost all of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the shot. However, test results with tin include those by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grandy et al. (1968) in which there were no deaths associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with mallards dosed with tin shot. For bismuth, there are three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially recent and relevant studies that support this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a 30-day acute toxicity study now being completed with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bismuth-tin shot, Sanderson et al. (1994) report no mortality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with dosage of mallard ducks. Although the dosage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phase and preliminary analyses have been completed, concluding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tissue examination and analyses remain to be carried out.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, this concluding work will be completed before any final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking; when reviewing the preliminary results, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> doubtful that any dramatically different findings are yet to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sanderson et al. (1992), over the course of a 30-day acute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity study on captive-reared mallards with three different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shot-types, i.e., lead, essentially pure bismuth and iron shot,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found no mortality associated with bismuth. Further,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculations on the absorption of bismuth based on estimated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excreted quantities, with known amounts in blood, liver, bone and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> muscle (a range of none to minute amounts) suggest that most of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the bismuth eroded from the shot as a result of gizzard action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was excreted in the feces. Sanderson et al. (1992) state that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``All nine ducks (three control, three Bi8 and three Fe8) examined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the end of the study had normal amounts of muscle and abundant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fat depots. Internal organs were within normal limits. No  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant differences were observed among the three groups of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ducks.'' (Numbers behind symbols refer to dosage rates, i.e., 8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bismuth and 8 iron shot, which is the maximum number of the range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified by the experimental design.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ringelman et al. (1992) conducted a 32-day acute toxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study which involved dosing game-farm mallards with a shot alloy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of tungsten-bismuth-tin (TBT), which was 39, 44.5 and 16.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent by weight, respectively. No dosed birds died during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trial, and behavior was normal. Examination of tissues post-euthanization revealed no toxicity or damage related to shot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure. Blood calcium differences between dosed and undosed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> birds were judged to be unrelated to shot exposure. Although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bismuth concentrations in kidney and liver were near detectable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits, they did not differ between dosed and undosed birds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This study concluded that ``...TBT shot presents virtually no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential for acute intoxication in mallards under the conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this study.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sanderson et al. (1992) have reviewed the relevant, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mostly earlier, literature with regard to the toxicity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bismuth. This literature provides little in the way of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparison to the results of the types of toxicity studies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by the Service and cited here. However, this literature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides findings which tend not to create a concern for any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential metallic bismuth-related intoxication in waterfowl when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingested. Although there have been some human neurological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems reported that are related to chronic use of organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bismuth compounds, bismuth (especially metallic) is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered a serious industrial hazard to humans. A common use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of bismuth is in pharmaceuticals for stomach ailments; bismuth is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the principal active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> &reg; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The studies cited here for support of the application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represent only the first of a series of three toxicity tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by 50 CFR 20.134, before a final approval can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given to the applicant by the Director of the Service. The other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two toxicity tests required are for: (1) long-term chronic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure; and (2) reproduction. The Service believes it has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient flexibility in the regulations to approach final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval in a step manner. That is, acute toxicity tests and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other toxicity information suggest that a 1-year conditional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval can be provided without significant risk to migratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bird resources. If indicated, second and third 1-year approvals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be provided until the series of toxicity tests are completed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at which time, final approval may be made. This series of tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have to be completed before the Service would consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final approval of bismuth-tin shot as nontoxic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bismuth-tin shot is currently approved by the Canadian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wildlife Service for use in nontoxic shot zones on a conditional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis under terms similar to those described above. Bismuth-tin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shot is also used in several European countries, and elsewhere in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the world.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> References:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> Grandy, J.W., L.N.

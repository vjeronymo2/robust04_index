			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The "24 Hours Newscast" consulted some Central  American foreign ministries -- that allegedly support Bernd  Niehaus [Costa Rican foreign minister] -- on the candidate for  whom they intend to vote in the election for secretary general  of the Organization of American States. Some of the Central  American officials charged that they are being pressured by the  United States to change their vote.    The first country consulted was Costa Rica, home of Foreign  Minister Niehaus -- President Cesar Gaviria's closest rival.  Here they are already claiming victory.    [Begin recording] [Jose Joaquin Chaberry, unidentified Costa  Rican official] We are certain we will win. We are very certain  of this. We have reiterated this during the past months and the  past days....    [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] But do you believe  pressure is being exerted?    [Chaberry] I repeat Foreign Minister Niehaus' words: If  there  is pressure, we will report it. [end recording]    El Salvador maintains its position to support Niehaus,  although Deputy Foreign Minister Rafael Alfaro said they are  being pressured to favor President Cesar Gaviria.    [Begin recording] [Alfaro] We continue, nevertheless, with  our firm support for Foreign Minister Niehaus.    [Reporter] Mr. Deputy Foreign Minister, is it true that  there  has been pressure on the part of the U.S. Government on the  Central American nations?    [Alfaro] During a meeting we held several days ago in Mexico  City, an English-speaking nation said it had been directly  pressured by other nations interested in garnering support for  President Cesar Gaviria's candidacy.... [end recording]    Honduras, a nation recently visited by President Cesar  Gaviria, expressed a great deal of liking for him, but it  supports Niehaus because a prior commitment had already been  made with him.    [Begin recording] [Protocol Director Ricardo Alonso Florez]  We believe that in the first round the Central American nations  will vote for the Costa Rican candidate, because he is Central  American. Eventually, if there is a runoff election, a different  decision could be made. [end recording]</p>

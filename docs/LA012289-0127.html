			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP WRAPUP / ROB FERNAS;  </P> <P> 2 BEST SOUTH BAY GIRLS' BASKETBALL TEAMS WON'T MEET  </P> <P> One of the great injustices of the prep basketball season, at least from a  fan's standpoint, is that the powerful girls' teams from Morningside and Palos  Verdes will not meet.  </P> <P> Because they play in different leagues and are classified in different CIF  playoff divisions, there is no chance that the two best girls' teams in the  South Bay can settle the question of "Who's No. 1?"  </P> <P> Instead, both teams are making a mockery of their respective leagues.  </P> <P> Morningside, the top-rated Division I team in California, improved to 17-1  overall and 7-0 in the Ocean League this week with lopsided wins over South  Torrance, 106-29, and Centennial, 90-32.  </P> <P> But the scores don't tell the whole story.  </P> <P> In Wednesday's game with South, Morningside Coach Frank Scott made senior guard  Jo Jo Witherspoon the DS (designated scorer) in an attempt to break the school  single-game record. Witherspoon easily set the record with 69 points, scoring  49 by half-time and sitting out most of the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Scott said afterward that he is going to let junior center Lisa Leslie set the  record next year.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes, meanwhile, twice managed to break the school record for most  points scored in a game.  </P> <P> The Sea Kings, ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section 4-A Division, first set the  mark Thursday in a 102-17 win over Beverly Hills, then eclipsed it Friday night  with a 107-22 whipping of rival Rolling Hills. Those games came on the heels of  Tuesday's 71-27 romp over Inglewood.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes' three-game total score this week: 280-66.  </P> <P> As usual, 6-4 twins Heidi and Heather Burge did most of the damage for the Sea  Kings. Heidi averaged 31.7 points over the three games, and Heather, coming  back after missing three games because of illness, scored 33 against Beverly  Hills and 20 against Rolling Hills.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes is 15-3 overall and 7-0 in league play.  </P> <P> Actually, Morningside and Palos Verdes did have a chance to meet earlier this  season. Both were entered in the Santa Barbara Tournament, but Palos Verdes  lost in the semifinals to Southern High of Louisville, Ky., and Morningside  lost to Southern in the final.  </P> <P> Neither Morningside nor Palos Verdes has lost to a team from California.  </P> <P> With its two Ocean League victories this week, Morningside's girls extended  their league winning streak to 65 games, good for fourth place on the all-time  Southern Section list.  </P> <P> With two more wins next week against North Torrance and Redondo, the Lady  Monarchs will tie Bishop Diego for third place.  </P> <P> Riverside Poly holds the record with 97 consecutive league wins from 1978-85  during the era of Cheryl Miller, followed by San Gabriel with 80 from 1979-86.  </P> <P> Morningside's streak started in 1982.  </P> <P> Boys' basketball teams in the Bay, Ocean and Camino Real leagues have some  chasing to do at the halfway point of the season.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills (Bay), Morningside (Ocean) and St. Bernard (Camino Real) have  each opened up two-game leads heading into the second round of league play.  </P> <P> Can they be caught?  </P> <P> "I don't know if anyone can catch (Rolling Hills) or not, but I think it will  be a great game with Inglewood and a great game at our place," Torrance Coach  Carl Strong said Thursday night, after his team suffered an 85-76 loss at  Rolling Hills.  </P> <P> The first-place Titans benefited from a favorable schedule in the first round  of Bay League play, facing three of the top challengers -- Beverly Hills,  Inglewood and Torrance -- at home. Rolling Hills now has to play those teams on  the road.  </P> <P> "We had all the advantages in the first round," said Rolling Hills Coach Cliff  Warren. "The second round will be completely different. Our players know they  have to improve."  </P> <P> Rolling Hills leads the league with a 7-0 mark, followed by Torrance and  Inglewood (both 5-2) and then Beverly Hills and Leuzinger (both 4-3).  </P> <P> Leuzinger might be the team to watch in the second round. After starting out  0-3, the young Olympians have won four straight.  </P> <P> In the Ocean League, Morningside appears headed for its fifth league title in  the last six years after completing the first round with a 7-0 record.  </P> <P> The Monarchs are in an advantagious position, playing host to second-place  Redondo (6-1) and third-place Centennial (5-2) in the second round after easily  beating those teams on the road.  </P> <P> St. Bernard, led by the inspired play of 6-11 center Ed Stokes, appears in good  shape in the Camino Real League with a 6-0 mark and a two-game bulge over St.  Monica and St. Anthony (both 4-2). Moreover, St. Bernard will play host to St.  Monica, which gave the Vikings their toughest first-round game.  </P> <P> Westchester ventures into the thick of the Metro League basketball race this  week, playing host to Fairfax on Wednesday and then traveling to meet unbeaten  Manual Arts on Friday.  </P> <P> Westchester (12-3 overall) and Manual Arts are each 5-0 in the Coastal  Conference, with Fairfax trailing by two games at 3-2.  </P> <P> Zan Mason, a 6-7 forward headed to UCLA, led four Westchester players in double  figures Friday with 27 points as the Comets beat Palisades, 84-65.  </P> <P> Hawthorne's track team won two relays and got a look at the team that might  present the stiffest challenge to its quest for a third straight state title  Friday night at the Sunkist Invitational indoor meet at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Hawthorne's mile relay team of junior Chris Alexander, sophomore Eric Allen and  seniors Kevin Gatlin and Curtis Conway won with a time of 3 minutes, 24.7  seconds, barely edging out Oakland (3:24.8), which proved it will have to be  reckoned with in June.  </P> <P> A good start by Alexander and a strong anchor leg by Conway, the Cougars' top  sprinter, made the difference. However, the squad did not live up to the  expectations of Coach Kye Courtney, who had hoped for a 3:15 time.  </P> <P> Hawthorne also won the 8x160 relay in 2:14.3, but the Cougars missed a chance  for another victory when Conway scratched from the 60-yard dash for football  players because he had not recovered from the mile relay.  </P> <P> The Cougar girls won the 4x160 relay in 1:14.9 and were runners-up in both the  2-mile (10:08.8) and mile (4:05.5) relays. Individually, Kesha Marvin of  Hawthorne took third in the 500 (1:09.9) and teammate Rhonda Kennerson was  second in the 880 (2:19.4).  </P> <P> Carson and Banning have played some memorable basketball games in the past, but  Friday night's Pacific League meeting was no contest.  </P> <P> Led by 16 points from forward Vince Washington and 15 from guard Raymond  Bennett, Carson ran away from its rival, 75-56, at home. The decision left  Carson with a 9-7 overall mark and 2-2 Southern-Pacific Conference record,  while Banning slipped to 8-10 and 1-4.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Mohamed Farah Aidid, USC chairman and leader of  the Somali National Alliance [SNA], and USC chairman and his  large delegation have returned to Mogadishu after visiting a  number of African and Arab countries and participating in the  Nairobi conference of Somali leaders. Addressing thousands of  people who gathered to welcome him at the 1 July Independence  Square, Mohamed Farah Aidid spoke about his visit to Djibouti  and Uganda where he attended the Pan-African Movement Congress  conference. [passage omitted]    He said although a few people believe that a government  cannot be formed in the country that is not the case. On the  week-long meeting in Addis Ababa between the SNA and the Somali  National Movement [SNM] and the movement's stand on the Somali  people's unity, Mr. Aidid said the SNA supports the SNM stand as  this is a remedy for the Somali people's unity and will serve  the aspirations of the people living in the northwestern  regions. He appealed for this constructive step to be welcomed.    The SNA leader also spoke about the failed preparatory  conference which was scheduled to be held in Mogadishu and  which, he said, was caused by meetings of the Somali Salvation  Democratic Front and the Somali Patriotic Movement, and because  of the situation in Kismaayo. The SNA has never requested a  postponement of the conference, but only supported the  postponement requests from other quarters. He said that Somali  organizations, including the SNM, would meet in Mogadishu on 30  May to discuss the government structure to be formed, taking  into account each organization's influence.    He appealed to those involved in preparing the conference to  assist in specific areas, and to try not to interfere in the  areas they have not been assigned to. Mr. Aidid called on the  Somali people to guard against those who make it a habit to  serve foreigners, until a government is formed. He referred to  the importance of peace, the peace agreements in the central and  northwestern regions, and the Kah Hotel agreement. He wished  the outgoing peace conference in Kismaayo success.    Aidid demonstrated how self-seekers serving foreigners are  responsible for setting the brotherly SNA people against each  other. [passage omitted] Mr. Aidid called for the protection of  foreigners in Somalia. Speaking on his own behalf and on that  of the SNA, Mr. Aidid congratulated the Somali people and the  world Muslim community on the occasion of 'Id al-Adha.</p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JORDAN HASN'T PAID DUES TO EARN ALL-TIME HONORS  </P> <P> To rate a place on the NBA all-time starting team, a player must be impressive  on several counts -- including longevity, statistics and winning.  </P> <P> Two of Scott Ostler's recent all-time picks, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, are  approaching serious all-time consideration.  </P> <P> However, Michael Jordan, another of Ostler's selections, has less than four  full seasons in the NBA. So far, Jordan is a flash in the pan in comparison to  Jerry West and Oscar Robertson.  </P> <P> MARTIN MARKOVICH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

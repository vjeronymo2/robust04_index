			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Amstrad in computer printer venture Amstrad, the consumer electronics group headed by Mr Alan Sugar, is re-entering the mainstream computer printer market through a collaborative agreement with Jarfalla ICC, the Swedish computer printer manufacturer that until last week was 100 per cent-owned by IBM. Prototypes of the first jointly developed product, a compact ink jet printer using a new type of print head, were being shown at the CEBit European computer fair which opened in Hanover yesterday. Mr Malcolm Miller, Amstrad's group managing director, said, 'We have been looking for opportunities to increase the price competitiveness and technological performance of our computers and computer related products. 'I believe this collaboration may lead us back into the printer market, a sector we put on the back burner some time ago, awaiting such an opportunity.' Amstrad engineers have designed the printer cabinet, carriage assembly and the electronics which drive the new printer while Jarfalla has designed the shuttle assembly including the critical print head. Mr Miller said the new printer, which is due to begin shipping this summer, will be sold both as an Amstrad badged product and available for OEM manufacture. Jarfalla, which has annual sales of about Pounds 100m and has been making printers for almost 25 years, was IBM's biggest printer manufacturing facility. As part of IBM's retrenchment last year, it was one of four European IBM plants which were set up as 'independent business units' run by their local managements and warned that if they did not make a profit within 12 months they would close. The company is now jointly owned by IBM Svenska, which has a 35 per cent stake, and Atle Forvaltnings, a Swedish venture capital group. In recent weeks Amstrad has made a flurry of product announcements including a new range of highly competitive personal computers built around Intel's 80486 microprocessors, new facsimile machines and advanced feature telephones. Yesterday Mr Sugar and Mr Bordan Tkachuk, Amstrad's sales and marketing director, underlined the group's renewed commitment to the 'brown goods' sector by unveiling new ranges of audio, VCR, and satellite products.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Paris backs off student reforms MR Jack Lang, education minister in the new French government headed by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, has moved swiftly to suspend the implementation of the university reforms proposed by his predecessor, Mr Lionel Jospin. Mr Lang yesterday praised the purpose of the Jospin reforms: 'Their objective is good,' he said. But since they had led to misunderstandings, he was postponing their application. The 'misunderstandings' of the Jospin reforms led to waves of mass protest demonstrations by university and secondary school students. The centre-piece of the reforms was to have been a simplification in the choice of first-year degree subjects, from 45 to around 12. In addition, a modular form of credits was proposed, coupled with a new University Studies Certificate which would be available at the end of the first year, for those students who wanted to take a break. Mr Lang has also backed away from moves to cut down on the teaching of classical languages. At present, Latin is said to be studied by some 350,000 students, and Greek by 30,000.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Akai makes losses as domestic sales sink AKAI Electric, the Japanese video and audio equipment maker, yesterday blamed a Y247m (Dollars 1.97m) pre-tax loss for the year to the end of November on the collapse of domestic demand for consumer electronics and on currency fluctuations in the European market. The Tokyo-based company, which reported a pre-tax profit of Y2.4bn in the previous year, said sales fell 13.5 per cent to Y56.6bn, reflecting the particularly harsh conditions in the domestic market, where video cassette recorder output slid 21.4 per cent in the third quarter last year. During the same quarter, tape recorder output by the Japanese industry fell 24 per cent and that of stereo components was down 5.3 per cent. A record fall in Tokyo department store sales in December suggests that trading conditions for consumer electronics makers will get worse before they get better. However, Akai is aiming for a 6 per cent increase in sales this year to Y60bn and a pre-tax profit of Y200m, with increased VCR demand in Europe expected to compensate for a sales decline in sales in Japan. Increased demand is not expected until the second half, and the company is forecasting a first-half loss of Y800m. Akai said capital spending would be reduced from Y2.6bn last year to about Y2bn, and the company has announced that it will be more flexible in choosing components suppliers in an attempt to cut costs.</p>

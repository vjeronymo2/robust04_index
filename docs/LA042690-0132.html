			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POWER STATION BLAST BLACKS OUT TORONTO  </P> <P> A hydroelectric transformer station exploded Wednesday night, blacking out  downtown Toronto and surrounding areas in Ontario province, causing traffic  chaos and sending thousands of people into the streets. Looting was reported.  </P> <P> The blackout forced theaters, malls and stores in the busy downtown area to be  evacuated. There was no immediate report of arrests or injuries.  </P> <P> One Canadian radio report said 90,000 homes and 10,000 businesses were affected  by the power outage, which officials said began at about 8:10 p.m. and lasted  about two hours in much of downtown. In other sections of the city, power  continued to be out past 11 p.m.  </P> <P> Ontario power spokesman Bill Friday said the power cut out after the explosion  and fire, which was blamed on equipment failure.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] With Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro in  attendance, a class to demonstrate how to maintain agricultural  equipment and machinery took place at the Alquizar Municipality  Miscellaneous Crops Enterprise in Havana Province. Del Toro is a  first vice minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR].    A group of leaders and specialists from Minaz [Ministry of  the Sugar Industry], Minbas [Ministry of Basic Industry], Micons  [Ministry of Construction], and (CATM) participated in this  class.    Earlier, FAR specialists led by Division General (Ramon Pato  Guerra) had contributed to creating the conditions that  facilitated this demonstration -- which is today extremely  important, according to Army General Raul Castro, because the  nation has the unavoidable need to maintain the equipment,  parts, and technical resources that are temporarily immobilized.  Castro also said this is a timely moment to extend the FAR's  preservation expertise to all branches of the economy.    The Armed Forces are so far maintaining millions of pieces  of  equipment, which range from tanks and armaments of all kinds to  gas masks. Over 500 technical cadres and machinery experts in  Havana and other provinces have seen this demonstration. The  intention is to hold this kind of workshop all over the country.    The participants in this class toured various departments,  warehouses, and workshops belonging to this enterprise, where  they saw what measures have been taken to counteract humidity  and to preserve hydraulic and lubrication systems and the costly  resources used in irrigation.    Everywhere, there is one constant: economizing with material  and human resources, with new principles of organization, and  technical discipline.    [Begin recording] [unidentified man] That is, not only does  everything depend on resources, but much also depends on  attitude, and how we confront problems, and on everything...  [rephrases] on an organizational system about which, as is  known, we indeed have quite a bit to learn (?from) our FAR  comrades.    [Rosales del Toro] In the demonstration that was given here,  we have been able to see how, very simply, using the same  installations and the same comrades -- with the magnificent  training and experience they have -- but by establishing a  system, and maintaining the methodological procedures, and  applying these experiences that all the organizations...  [changes thought] and we can say that it is not just the FAR,  because we have (?drunk deeply) of the nation's experiences  [returns to original line of thought], these things can be  introduced.    I am completely sure that the year 1994 can become a year in  which to rescue the Revolution's fundamental resources, to  preserve them, and guarantee that for the next two or three  years, we have at least a response, on the basis of what we  already have, on the basis of what we already possess.

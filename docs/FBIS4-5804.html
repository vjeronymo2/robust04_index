			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- The leader of the  coalition's largest party on Thursday [14 April] balked at a  proposal by the party's No. 2 man to give the authority to  discuss how to reconcile intraparty policy differences to the  coalition's deputy chiefs.    Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of  Japan -- SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters, "I can  never approve of that proposal" by SDP Secretary General Wataru  Kubo to allow the secretaries general of the coalition to hold  substantial discussion on narrowing an intraparty gulf over key  policies, such as defense and diplomacy.    Kubo advanced the proposal as the chairman of get-togethers  of the deputy chiefs of the coalition partners.    Murayama's remark came a day after key coalition strategist  Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of the core coalition party  Shinseito [Japan Renewal party], called for bridging  intracoalition gaps over four key policy fields, including  Japan's stand on the suspected North Korean nuclear weapons  program.    The other three fields are Japan's tax system reform, basic  defense and foreign policies as well as administrative reform  combined with deregulation.    Murayama dismissed the rumors rift with Kubo, saying the SDP  secretary general merely "advanced the proposal as the chairman  of meetings of the secretaries general as a tentative step."    "There are no differences between me and Mr. Kubo," Murayama  said.    Ozawa and Kubo respectively put forward calls for  reconciling  the intra-alliance gaps after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  seven-party alliance went through various crises and turbulence  due to policy differences over the past eight months.</p>

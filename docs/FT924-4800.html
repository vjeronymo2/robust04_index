			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / World Trade News: China deal for Jones &amp; Shipman JONES &amp; Shipman, one of the UK's three remaining publicly quoted machine tool companies, has won a Dollars 750,000 (Pounds 493,400) order from Wuxi Engine Works of China for a purpose-built honing machine and a CNC production cylindrical grinding machine, writes Andrew Baxter. The deal is a boost for the UK machine tool industry's morale, which has been dented by the Matrix Churchill affair and the recession. The Wuxi Engine Works, of Jiangsu province, is one of China's leading turbocharger and industrial diesel engine manufacturers.</p>

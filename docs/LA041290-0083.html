			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NATIONWIDE;  </P> <P> CENSUS RETURNS MAY FALL SHORT OF GOAL  </P> <P> The Census Bureau is now uncertain whether 70% of Americans will return their  census forms as it had hoped, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> "Fifty-five percent is today's figure (for forms returned), and we're still  hoping people will get them in," said the spokesman. On April 26, the bureau  will send enumerators to interview members of households from which forms have  not been received. In some cases, the enumerators will find that homes have  been torn down or are temporarily vacant. For each percentage point below 70%  in the response rate, the Census Bureau has estimated to Congress it will have  to spend $10 million for extra interviewers.  </P></p>

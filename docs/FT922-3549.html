			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Mexico faces hard choice in keeping oil out of Nafta - In the first of a series on the North Atlantic free trade area / A look at the effect of the proposed pact on the Mexican oil industry WITH Cuba, Argentina, and the ex-Soviet Union all opening up oil exploration to foreign companies, Mexico's reform-minded government might be expected to do the same. But wary of tackling Mexico's most potent nationalist symbol, the government insists that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) will not allow foreign exploration of Mexican oil, nor lead to the privatisation of Petreleos Mexicanos (Pemex). President Carlos Salinas at Pemex's recent 54th anniversary was clear enough: 'The property of oil stays uniquely and firmly under the control of the Mexican state'. Mexican trade negotiators have repeated this so often, that there can be little doubt that risk, or wildcat, contracts will not be permitted. The US, sensitive to Mexican nationalist sentiment, has in any case stopped short of demanding changes that would allow wild-catting. The government has ordered Pemex to produce plans for radical reform following the Guadalajara gas explosion in which more than 200 people died. The company is likely to be broken up into subsidiary companies looking after areas such as exploration, refining and gas sales, with the core company operating as a giant contractor. While the government does not intend to sell Pemex, at least in short term, the reform is likely to lead Pemex to contract out much more work to foreign companies. Reform details are likely within the next few days. In the meantime, the US is eyeing other opportunities. The petrochemicals industry is calling for direct investment in Mexico's basic petrochemicals; the gas and oil companies want to sell gas and refined products to the Mexican end-user; contract companies want to make it easier to sell Pemex equipment, and to carry out drilling and other services. The US government may also want a secure oil supply from Mexico guaranteed. Pemex has baulked at such demands, but the Mexican government will concede most of them, because they are consistent with plans to turn Pemex into a modern and lean oil company, focused on production and exploration. Plans to modernise Pemex pre-date the latest reform programme as well as negotiations over Nafta. The government cut the number of petrochemicals reserved to the state to 19 in 1989, and has made clear the number will be cut further after Nafta is signed. Likewise, Pemex has already decided to follow the path the big oil independents took in the 1960s and contract out drilling work to specialist companies. These turn-key projects, to be financed by a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 710m) loan from the US Eximbank, do not break Mexico's constitution, since the company's payment does not depend on the amount of oil found. The first such project was awarded to Triton International last spring, which drilled into the ocean in a record 127 days, half Pemex's normal time. Since then, EPN Sonat, a joint venture between the US company Sonat and the Mexican EPN Arval has won two contracts worth Dollars 100m to drill six wells in the Bay of Campeche. The turn-key projects will not attract the big US oil companies, who rarely do drilling contract work, says Mr Ed Porter of the American Petroleum Institute in Washington. Instead, the market will be left to the small independent engineering and drilling companies. Nafta will make such contracts easier for US and Canadian companies by cutting the paperwork, middlemen, and preference Pemex has in the past shown to Mexican contractors. Perhaps, above all, says Mr Rafael Quijano, of the Petroleum Finance Corporation in Washington, and a former Pemex employee, Nafta will 'create an environment in which contract business can flourish'. But given that total Pemex investment in exploration and production is Dollars 1.7bn this year, the contract work might be worth at most Dollars 500m a year. Many foreign oil companies still hope Mexico will relax regulations against foreign equity investment, but some time after Nafta is signed. Even by the most pessimistic estimates, Pemex has 30bn barrels of crude equivalent in oil reserves, and thus a production reserve ratio of 21-1, double that in the US. Pemex's pressing economic problem is not in finding oil, which is what the big oil independents can offer Mexico, but bringing it up to the ground. That kind of work does not require risk contracts. The US gas producers may have more luck than the big oil independents. Imports of natural gas into Mexico have grown rapidly, because of greater industrial development along the border, and environmental regulations demanding more gas use. Demand is expected to continue to rise, which would require substantial investment in new gas pipelines. Mexico may let US companies build the pipes, but this would require changing current regulatory law. While Pemex may be unwilling to abandon its monopoly in energy exploration, it desperately needs help in refining products; Pemex imported a record Dollars 1.25bn of petroleum and petrochemical products last year. It intends to build a new refinery in central Mexico soon, and expand production at existing ones, at a cost, according to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, of at least Dollars 8bn. Pemex is looking for a foreign partner in building and financing a refinery, although Pemex will operate the facility. The trouble for Pemex is that little foreign interest has been shown in the schemes Mexico has proposed. Engineering companies do not want to receive payment in refined crude. Oil companies do not want Pemex to operate the final facility, and would like to sell oil they have refined in the Mexican market. One foreign oil executive suggests that as Mexico's import bill for refined products climbs, the government will open up refining and the sale of refined products to foreign oil companies, some time after Nafta is signed. The Guadalajara disaster, for which Pemex was blamed, is increasing the pressure for change. However, opening up exploration and production remain difficult, since the property of oil would still remain 'firmly in the hands of the state'.

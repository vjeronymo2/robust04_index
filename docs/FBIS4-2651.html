			<p>BFN     [Text] Over the past year, Gansu's anticorruption struggle  has scored some initial successes with the result that the  province has now wiped out some of its notorious malpractices.    Since last August, all levels in Gansu have conscientiously  carried out three anticorruption tasks outlined by the central  authorities, with the result that a total of 712 leading cadres  have confessed and rectified their wrongdoings. Of a total of  391 leading cadres with concurrent jobs in various economic  entities, some 261 have resigned one of their two jobs.    In the September-December period of 1993, the discipline  inspection and supervision organs at all levels in Gansu  investigated and handled a large number of major and serious  cases in a timely fashion. They filed for investigation and  prosecution a total of 610 law-violation and  discipline-violation cases involving a total of 94 cadres at the  county or provincial department section level, and a total of 10  cadres at the prefectural or provincial department level, 54.48  percent of which have now been wound up. They conscientiously  investigated and severely handled a batch of major economic  cases, including 167 cases involving 10,000 yuan or more each,  and recovered economic losses worth 12.8 million yuan.    The provincial discipline inspection commission held its  enlarged second plenary session yesterday to sum up the  province's anticorruption struggle over the past year and made  arrangements for the province's discipline inspection and  supervision work in 1994.    Sun Ying, the provincial party committee deputy secretary,  and Yang Huaixiao, provincial party committee standing committee  member and provincial vice governor, attended yesterday's  enlarged plenary session.</p>

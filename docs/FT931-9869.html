			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Arts: Richard III - Theatre The story goes that in previous centuries actors playing Richard III would shift their deformity from left to right from night to night. This reduced the risk of back problems such as have afflicted Simon Russell Beale who had to withdraw from the RSC's production at the Donmar Warehouse because of a slipped disk. Beale will return to the part at Stratford next month. Meanwhile Richard has been taken over by Ciaran Hinds, an actor in an altogether different mould. Beale is small and agile, almost double-jointed. Hinds is physically large and, in this part at least, deliberately clumsy. Visitors to the Warehouse will have recently seen Hinds playing Samuel Byck in Stephen Sondheim's Assassins, and Richard III is an appropriate play to follow, for what is it about but a series of assassinations? Richard like Assassins is directed by Sam Mendes and some of the techniques are becoming familiar: for instance, the use of the separate cubicles at the back of the stage. The production was seen at the Other Place in Stratford last summer. It is not the best that Mendes has done. The costumes, located loosely somewhere early in the 20th century, are dull. There is not enough to differentiate the characters. Too much of the play comes across as a pageant without spontaneity. Possibly one is over-influenced by the Northern Broadsides production, seen at the Riverside Studios in December, and has come to expect Richard III to be fun. Mendes's production is a little too like a run-up to Macbeth without the poetry and without the depth. He treats it too much as history and not enough as melodrama. Nevertheless, there are some excellent scenes and one sub-theme in particular is played for all it is worth. This is the relationship between Richard and Buckingham which becomes central to the plot. Stephen Boxer's Buckingham is not just another toad or accessory to the crimes. He is the man who, like Lady Macbeth with her husband, urges Richard on. Later, again like Lady Macbeth, he quails and Richard knows when to drop him. In the early stages of this production, Buckingham is almost the best part in the play: Boxer is outstanding. Then there is the set-piece towards the end when the ghosts of his victims come to visit Richard in his dream on the eve of battle. Mendes directs this as if it takes place in a subdued tavern in Cheapside. Richard sits slumped over his wine at one end of the table. At the other end is Richmond, the future Henry VII. The ghosts come in together and drink round the table to Richmond's victory. There is Mendes at his best. He is less happy in handling the women in general who, most of the time, simply record and prophecy doom. He does not catch their fickleness in the way they can succumb to Richard. On the small Donmar stage, Hinds suffers for his size. His hump looks like a pillow, even a kitbag, strapped across his shoulders. He has sleeked back hair and an off-putting long brown coat. Yet when he plays Richard as the religious devotee, pretending to be reluctant to accept the crown, he seems a much more versatile actor. Still, playing the role as a hulking straight murderer is a perfectly legitimate interpretation. I enjoyed it. Donmar Warehouse (071) 867 1150. The production runs until February 20, then moves to Tokyo and Rotterdam, before going home to Stratford</p>

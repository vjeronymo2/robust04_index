			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (19): Banks slower to catch on - Applications debate CONSIDERING banks have always been among the leading exploiters of computing, they have come quite late into electronic data interchange (EDI). While the likes of Tesco were starting to trade electronically in 1987, the first EDI banking services were not launched until Barclays and National Westminster entered the market in 1990. This business is growing rather slowly, not least because some of the early users of EDI, notably retail chains, are balking at the cost. One suggestion is that the turmoil in the banking market in recent years has made the banks desperate to find new ways to make profit and they see EDI as a golden opportunity. Tesco director Mr Dave MacInnis sums up the view of many business customers: 'The whole idea of paperless trading through EDI is that it cuts administrative costs. Yet these bank services want to charge four times what it costs to process a cheque. 'We regard that as excessive and we are somewhat in dispute with the banks. It's a shame, because we have electronic trading throughout the business chain but at the end of the process we still have to produce a piece of paper, a cheque.' A measure of the gap between the retail chains and the banks is the reply from Mr Saif Rahman, business development manager at National Westminster responsible for EDI services: 'Four times the cheque-processing cost? I say that is very cheap, considering the services we are offering.' NatWest's Bankline Interchange service was developed on an IBM AS/400 computer by Terence Chapman Associates, a London consultancy and systems house, at a cost of Pounds 1.8m. The system is linked to all the main UK EDI services, run by INS, AT&amp;T-Istel, IBM and British Telecom, so that companies exchanging orders and invoices by EDI can complete the trading circle by making payments and notifying the recipients electronically, too. The service offers prompt payment, the provision of information such as remittance advices to recipients and facilities such as the ability to sign off batches of payments but assign different settlement dates to each item. Saif Rahman says the service combines the good points of the BACS national payments clearing service and of traditional cheques. 'We offer the speed of BACS and the control and information provided by cheques,' he says. 'BACS is not the system for complex payments: the amount of information you can provide is limited, so you can't include details such as discounts, invoice numbers and so on. 'If you send magnetic tapes of payment details by courier to BACS, you get an acknowledgement by post, so there is some time before you know the transactions have been received and are being processed. 'With an EDI service, the network itself confirms the time it received a message and the time it was looked at by the recipient.' Saif Rahman's views on BACS are backed by Food Brokers, a middleman between the grocery and pharmaceutical trades and retail groups, including Tesco. 'We've tended to shy away from BACS, even though it gives us cleared funds, because we lose a bit of control,' says Mr Duncan Knight, Food Brokers' administration manager. 'We actually prefer to collect payment ourselves and key in the information in the way we want. 'Our payment terms are 30 days, so if a cheque hasn't arrived after that time, we can chase it the next day. If payments are made by BACS, it can be two or three days after the customer has sent the tape to BACS before you know whether you've been paid. 'You have to check with the bank and they have to make their own checks, so you're backwards and forwards with phone calls.' Saif Rahman at NatWest says the main benefits of bank EDI services are prompt payment, which enables companies to negotiate discounts with their suppliers, and control and efficiency through the information provided by the service. HE believes the discounts argument is one reason why retail chains in particular have not rushed to sign up for the services: the huge numbers of low-value items passing very quickly through supermarkets already enable big retailers to negotiate good discounts. Even so, he believes the likes of Tesco are wrong in comparing the cost of a BACS payment or of a cheque and a postage stamp with the cost of a bank EDI service. 'The banks charge roughly Pounds 1 for a payment and a remittance advice with their EDI services,' Mr Rahman says. 'Research by the Inter-Bank Research Organisation and others shows that the cost of producing a cheque and sending it with a remittance advice starts at Pounds 1.60. 'It's not just an 18p stamp - there's a time-cost, the cost of the cheques, probably specially printed with the company logo, the cost of keeping the cheques secure . . . and so on.'

			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HONIG CHANGES MIND ON UCLA SCHOOL MOVE  </P> <P> A delegation of parents flew into Sacramento Monday and persuaded State Supt.  of Public Instruction Bill Honig to support their campaign to keep the  University Elementary School on the UCLA campus and not move it into the Santa  Monica public school system.  </P> <P> Until Monday, Honig favored the move because he likes the idea of  university-run lab schools in public school settings. Honig's staff was working  with UCLA administrators and officials of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified  School District to smooth the way for the move.  </P> <P> After meeting with the lab school delegation and members of his staff for 45  minutes Monday afternoon, Honig changed his mind.  </P> <P> "They had a good idea -- taking that school and making it not just a research  institution but a place where we can take some of these curriculum framework  ideas and figure out how this could happen in regular schools," Honig said.  </P> <P> Honig was referring to new state curriculum requirements in math, science,  history, English and language arts. "I hope UCLA will give this suggestion  serious consideration," he added.  </P> <P> Part of the parents' plan endorsed by Honig also calls for the 450-pupil  University Elementary School to remain on campus, working closely with a new  Center for Human Development and Cultural Diversity.  </P> <P> Kathy Seal, a member of the delegation that met with Honig, said the parents  "got what we came for."  </P> <P> UCLA officials want to move the lab school, the last in the state, to Santa  Monica to make way for a $76-million Graduate School of Management.  </P> <P> They also have argued that the lab school could fulfill its research function  better as part of an urban school environment.  </P> <P> However, the Family School Alliance -- the lab school's main support group --  has pointed out that the Ocean Park neighborhood of Santa Monica, where the  school would be relocated, is rapidly becoming gentrified and upper-income and  no longer offers much of an urban mix.  </P> <P> They also question the wisdom of building a $7-million to $10-million school in  Santa Monica-Malibu, a district where enrollment is declining.  </P></p>

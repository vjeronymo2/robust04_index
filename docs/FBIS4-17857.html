			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Foreign Minister's Deputy Vitaliy  Churkin will continue to serve as the president's special envoy  in former Yugoslavia in the near future. This was reported in  an interview with Interfax on Thursday by the Ministry's  Spokesman Grigoriy Karasin.    He recalled that at their meeting on Bosnia in London on  Tuesday [26 April], experts from Russia, US, EU, and UN had  decided to set up a contact group for work with the conflicting  parties. "This tallies with the plan suggested by Russia of  further joint steps. This design provides for work at expert  level to pave the way for a meeting between the foreign  ministers of Russia, US, and EC countries, and subsequently for  a summit on a Bosnian settlement," Karasin said.    In his words, such a contact group is already at work.  Russia is represented in it by the First Deputy Director of the  Foreign Ministry's European Department Alexey Nikiforov, the  United States by the President's Special Envoy Charles Redman.  Other participants in the contact will be represented at the  same level.    According to Karasin, Nikiforov will take over from Churkin  the bulk of technical work. Churkin will be called in only for  crucial decisions, Karasin explained.    In the words of yet another senior Russian diplomat,  Churkin,  who is known as the "Moscow shuttle" abroad, will still be  responsible for events in Yugoslavia at the Russian Foreign  Ministry but will apparently scale down his trips abroad.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / BT claims training saves Pounds 227m British Telecommunications has calculated that Pounds 7m spent on training junior managers saves it Pounds 227m a year. Two occupational specialists at BT have conducted what they say is one of the first projects to quantify the savings achieved by training. Mr Keith Coley, manager of competency, development and applications, and Mr Geoff Lee, manager of management development processes, carried out a three-year training evaluation which discovered that mistakes made by 159 junior managers cost the company Pounds 2m. They said that a similar level of mistakes by the whole area of junior management would have cost more than Pounds 227m. In a report to the British Psychological Society annual occupational psychology conference in Birmingham yesterday, the specialists said that in-house training courses had raised performance to a level that earned the company a further Pounds 71m on top of that which it would have lost through poor performance. Mr Coley said: 'At the time that we started this study we found no method available which gave us a financial approach to the development of training.' The formula they applied, they said, satisfied the company's accountants. The researchers said they assessed the direct costs of mistakes, the time taken to rectify them, the indirect costs of time wasted and the costs of loss of business. These were balanced against the added value of training and its cost.</p>

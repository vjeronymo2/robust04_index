			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Unitech hit by low Japanese contribution A SHARP drop in the contribution from a Japanese business reduced interim pre-tax profit at Unitech, the electronic components group, by 42 per cent from Pounds 7.81m to Pounds 4.55m. Unitech's main Japanese interest is its 50.6 stake in Nemic-Lambda, a power supplies company floated on Tokyo's over-the-counter market in 1991. Mr Peter Curry, group chairman, said Nemic's sales had dropped by 20 per cent between the second and third quarters of last year and stayed at that low level. As a result its pre-tax profit contribution had fallen from Pounds 5.9m to Pounds 1.25m. Overall, group turnover slipped to Pounds 117.2m (Pounds 131.1m) in the six months to November 30, although the majority of the decline reflected discontinued activities. Operating profit in the continuing power supplies, connectors and control products businesses fell 39 per cent to Pounds 6.46m. Nearly Pounds 1m less was paid in interest charges, which totalled Pounds 1.99m. The group is 55 per cent owned by two Swiss companies: Elektrowatt, an industrial group which has two seats on Unitech's board, and Saurer Gruppe, vehicle of the financier Mr Tito Tettamanti, which has no representation. In 1989, soon after the two came in, Unitech's share price rose to nearly 400p. Yesterday it closed at 167p - up 2p. Mr Curry, who founded the group in 1962, said that leaving aside Nemic, profits had increased from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 3.3m. The main areas of improvement were North America, which accounted for 30 per cent of sales, and the UK and Germany. In the US, economic recovery and increased exports had enhanced the figures. In the UK, a range of power modules launched two years ago had proved a success. Control products subsidiaries in these two countries had also done well. Mr Curry said the biggest second-half question was what improvement could be achieved in Japan after some cost-cutting. Net debt had increased by Pounds 18.9m to about Pounds 60m since the end of last year, the bulk of which was accounted for by exchange rate movements. Gearing of 57 per cent was, however, an improvement on the 77 per cent prevailing in November 1991. The interim dividend was held at 2.1p. Earnings per share, slipped to 3.4p (4p).</p>

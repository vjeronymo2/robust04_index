			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1305 GMT on 21 March carries a live  relay of the news conference by Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency  President Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister  Haris Silajdzic, and Bosnia-Herzegovina Justice Minister Kasim  Trnka on the recent signing of the Bosnian-Croatian  federation/confederation agreement in Washington. The questions  are posed by unidentified correspondents either in English or  Serbo-Croatian and a simultaneous translation is provided both  ways. The news conference lasts approximately 40 minutes    All the answers by President Izetbegovic and Prime Minister  Silajdzic are fully texted.    Before the first question is asked, Izetbegovic tells the  reporters that "there will be no special statement. We have  given enough of those. We are at your service."    Asked whether the federation/confederation agreement is the  "final solution" to the relations with the Croats and whether  the same is planned with the Serbs, Silajdzic says "I am afraid  that the term final solution has bad connotations, but the  solution is in the federation, and it has been done in good  faith. I hope that it will be implemented in good faith. The  same solution would be, and is going to be presented to the  Serbs and offered to them for acceptance. This is all I can say  about it. The draft constitution is already there, and is of  course available in English. Thank you."    An unidentified reporter asks whether the federation and  confederation with Croatia allows the Serbs, or their republic,  to confederate with Serbia, and Silajdzic says that "It is only  natural that the Serbs live in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I must  remind you here that the whole federation concept is based on  the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Within that, it is only natural that the Serbs, the Bosnian  Serbs, have certain ties with Serbia. That is of course a  matter for discussion at negotiations."    Replying to the question as to when the confederation  agreement could come in force, Izetbegovic says "After the  solution to the entire issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina, that is,  after the issue with the Serbian side is resolved. If that  issue is not solved within a reasonable amount of time, then the  sides will agree on whether to start the implementation of the  confederation agreement. However, we will first try and find a  solution with the Serb side in Bosnia- Herzegovina, that is,  find a peace solution for the entire Bosnia." Izetbegovic then  says that "I have proposed to President Tudjman that he come to  Sarajevo, this invitation is in the works, and I think it will  be sent out today. I do not know how you have already heard of  it. This is this morning's decision. I think that it is high  time President Tudjman came to Sarajevo. The invitation is to  be sent out because we believe that it would be a step toward  the implementation of the agreement. There are also certain  practical issues that could be solved on that occasion between  Bosnia- Herzegovina and Croatia. There are many such issues and  that is why I believe that this visit will be useful."    Asked to comment on the decision of UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali to end the work of the commission for the  investigation of war crimes, Silajdzic says that "I have heard  about the announcement by the secretary general that the  commission would cease work. This is the war crimes commission.  I do not know about any definite decisions, I only know about  the announcement. I must say that it surprised all of us. War  crimes are war crimes and cannot be [word indistinct] by  investigations. War crimes cannot be ended by an administrative  decision. Nobody has the right to forgive the war crimes in the  name of the victims. It would be very unusual, and I think that  it would set a precedent if the commission were to cease work  investigating war crimes on account of a lack of funds. We are  sure that the commission will continue to work, and the funds  will be found for the commission to continue."    Izetbegovic adds that "I could say here that the funds have  already been secured by private sponsors, even though we do not  think that this will be sufficient. The United Nations must  continue to finance the commission. I am sure that the work of  the commission will not cease regardless of whether the United  Nations will continue to finance it. We will try and make sure  that the United Nations continues to do so."    Responding to a question regarding the solution to the issue  of territories that have been ethnically cleansed or are under  Croatian control, Silajdzic says that "The federation is based  on universally known human rights, and the human rights are  practically the main ingredient of the draft constitution, the  main part of the draft constitution. The right of return is one  of the rights that will be implemented in this federation. It  is quite clear that all the people who have been expelled from  their homes will have the right to return to their homes. The  minimum that we can do for those who have suffered so much is to  give back to them the basic right to return to their homes."    Izetbegovic interrupts, saying that "I would only add here  that the results of ethnic cleansing will be ignored in all  solutions. All the information, and the draft constitution  clearly says so, [changes thought] the demographic picture will  be the picture represented at the census of 1991. Therefore no  ethnic cleansing will be taken into account. There is a certain  provision for that in the constitution."    Silajdzic says "If I may add, human rights are placed  immediately after the establishment of the federation. So  before any division of responsibility between the federation,  the government, and the cantons, before anything else, there are  human rights. It is no coincidence, this is based on our  conviction that what has happened in Bosnia is actually a savage  and gross violation of human rights."    A reporter asks whether there will be any government-imposed  restrictions on the movement of the population after Sarajevo is  opened, and Izetbegovic says that "there will be no restrictions  except those that your government, too, would impose. Only  persons against whom criminal charges have been brought will not  be allowed to leave the city. I would like to stress that it  was us, our government, who insisted that the roads be opened as  soon as possible. We have demanded the opening of the southern  road, the road that goes via Hadzici. The Serb side, however,  was opposed to this. Therefore there will be no restrictions  apart from the usual ones."    The same reporter asks whether a "mass exodus" is expected  once the city is opened, and Izetbegovic replies that "I expect  that far more people will enter the city than leave it. We are  afraid of problems connected to that, the program of  accommodation, employment, food, and so on. No, we do not  expect that the people will leave the city. However, we will  not prevent anyone who wants to leave from doing so."    Asked to comment on the fact that the United Nations have  found a number of heavy weapons within the exclusion zone around  Sarajevo, Izetbegovic says that "I have not received this  morning's statement, but we know. I think that two or three  times at these news conferences, you will remember, we have been  pointing to the fact that there are still weapons within the  exclusion zone. We have been pointing to these things.  According to our information, there are a lot more of those  weapons. I would like to remind you of a report we sent out  some 15 days ago and, as far as I can remember, these weapons,  these tanks, were mentioned there."    Asked to comment on the fact that the Herceg-Bosna  Representative Council has issued a statement that they would  condition the federation agreement on the confederation  agreement, Izetbegovic says that "There is a provision in the  signed document that the confederal agreement would be  elaborated on after the federation is implemented. As far as I  know, that was also the view of the Croatian side during the  negotiations. However, we do not exclude a different solution  if an agreement is reached. I do not think that anything stands  in its way except that, in our view, the problem of peace should  be solved in Bosnia-Herzegovina prior to the establishment of  the confederation. This has been the general view, to do that  before entering the confederation with Croatia."    Replying to a question on the protection of human rights,  Justice Minister Trnka gives a detailed account of the  provisions in the draft constitution regarding various courts  that would be authorized to deal with such matters. Izetbegovic  adds that "Apart from the court for human rights, there will be  the institution of ombudsmen, which, by the way, originates from  Nordic law, and these will naturally consist of local judges.  However, during the transitional period, during the first four  to five years, European and international judges will take part  in the work of these bodies. They will be nominated by the CSCE  and the International Court of Justice. Anyway, during the  first five years, foreign judges will also participate in these  bodies. Both institutions, the court for human rights and the  institution of ombudsmen, will exist."    Asked by a reporter about the territory of the future  federation, Silajdzic says that "I think that, if I may say so,  Article 1 says that the federation will consist of those  territories with majority the Bosniak and majority Croatian  populations. That is the definition of the federation. The  definite maps will be drawn after we conclude the talks with the  third side."    Another reporter asks Izetbegovic what will happen if the  referendum in Croatia rejects the confederation agreement, and  Izetbegovic says that "If it is rejected and if, according to  their laws and their constitution, a referendum has to be held,  so if it is rejected, then there will be no confederation. The  federation and the confederation are not linked. We have gone  for both the agreements, however, from the legal point of view,  these are not two connected things. The federation has been  detailed, and it will become valid when the Assembly ratifies  it. That is when it will become valid. As for the  confederation, that depends on whether [words indistinct] and of  course -- you asked me what if a referendum in Croatia rejects  it -- there will be no confederation. However, the federation  stays. The confederation is an agreement between two sovereign  states."    An unidentified reporter cites a statement by Ivan Bender,  member of the Croatian delegation, that there can be no  federation without the confederation, and Izetbegovic says that  "Mr. Bender is not authorized to give such statements. That  will be done by the relevant bodies. That is his personal view  and we have to respect that, but he is not authorized. This is  just the personal and individual view of Mr. Bender."    Replying to a question on the future relations with the  Serbs, Izetbegovic says that "we will start any talks with them,  regardless of the options on offer and those accepted, with the  demand for the return of the territories. I can repeat that,  and I have said it before, we still stand on that position. Any  talks with the Serb side, and of course we still do not know who  will participate -- you know that there will be a Serb assembly  on Sunday [26 March] -- we will wait for the results of this  assembly before any talks. This assembly is a very important  body, and it is an important event. Anyway, we will start any  talks with them with the issue of returning territories, and the  talks will develop depending on the response to that question.  I would like to stress in connection with this Serb Assembly,  that the Croatian assembly in Sarajevo on 6 February was a very  important occasion in the things leading up to the Washington  events."    A correspondent asks whether there was any talk in  Washington  about the Government's minimal territorial demands, and  Izetbegovic says that "there was no talk of that. I can only  say that questions regarding maps did arise, particularly during  the last meeting prior to our departure. That was only an  exchange of views, not a demand for us to define our minimum.  We repeated our demand that the territories had to be returned.  I did not have the impression that such a demand was rejected  or that it was met with disapproval."</p>

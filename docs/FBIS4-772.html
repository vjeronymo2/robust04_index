			<p>BFN     [Text] The Freedom Front has called on all parties apart  from the National Party and the ANC to participate in a joint  meeting at which a demand for the postponement of the election  would be formulated. Party leader Constand Viljoen told a  public meeting in Kraaifontein in the Western Cape last night  that the aim was to ensure that the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]  and the Conservative Party [CP] could also be included in the  poll.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent James Barkhuizen] The  Kraaifontein meeting was the biggest so far on the Freedom Front  election tour. General Viljoen told more than 1,500 supporters  that election in the present climate of violence and without the  IFP was unthinkable. He said the smaller parties would urgently  have to consider the fairness of the election.    [Viljoen, in progress]...and if we decide that it is not the  case, then we should put a joint case to the Independent  Electoral Commission to say that we smaller parties, with the  exclusion of the ANC and the National Party, we feel that this  is not a free and fair situation.

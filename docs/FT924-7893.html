			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Japanese petrochemical producers post declines MITSUBISHI Petrochemicals and Mitsui Petrochemicals, two of Japan's leading petrochemicals producers, yesterday reported sharp falls in profits as a result of the sustained downturn in the Japanese economy. Mitsubishi Petrochemicals, Japan's largest petrochemicals producer, reported a 69.2 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y6bn (Dollars 48.7m) in the six months to the end of September. The company's sales were 10.4 per cent down at Y187bn. A fall in demand from industrial customers was compounded by an average 13 per cent fall in prices. About 41 per cent of Mitsubishi Petrochemicals sales come from bulk chemicals, such as plastics. It is Japan's largest producer of polystyrene and polyethylene. At the peak of the recent boom in the Japanese economy, Mitsubishi Petrochemicals made a record annual pre-tax profit of Y54bn for 1989-90. The company said sales of phenol fell by 15.5 per cent from the first half of last year, while resin sales were 6.7 per cent down and sales of special-use chemicals were 2.1 per cent down. The sales downturn has made it harder for the company to cover the higher depreciation cost of its investment in new facilities, such as the Kashima ethylene plant, which is operating well below capacity. Mitsubishi Petrochemicals is forecasting a Y15bn pre-tax profit for the year as a whole, about 50 per cent down on last year on sales of 390bn down 4.2 per cent. Mitsui Petrochemicals reported a 54.4 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y3.6bn in the first half of the year. Mitsui Petrochemicals, which exports about 16 per cent of its output, said it had managed to contain the fall in its sales to 4.8 per cent largely through increasing exports. It said its domestic prices fell by 10 per cent.</p>

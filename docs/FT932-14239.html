			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Letter: No contravention of Gatt rules by Japan's low-alcohol tax Sir, I read with interest Michiyo Nakamoto's article, 'Japanese low-alcohol tax sinks EC spirits' (March 24). The article leaves one with the impression that the new tax rates for low-alcohol whiskies in Japan somehow contravene the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Those new tax rates have recently been imposed on low-alcohol whiskies, which began coming on to the Japanese market at the start of this fiscal year. The new rates apply equally to domestic and foreign products, and therefore neither penalise foreign products nor break Gatt rules. Japan is not alone in producing low-alcohol whiskies, which are naturally taxed at a lower rate than full-strength whiskies. Distillers in both Canada and France also produce and sell low-alcohol whiskies. Moreover, as you know, whisky and lemonade can be found in the British market. In fact, mizuwari is taxed under a system much like the one used in the UK for low-alcohol beverages. It does not seem appropriate to single out Japan in this matter. The crux of the issue is that European Community regulations prohibit whisky distillers in the EC from producing and selling 'whisky' which is less than 40 degrees proof. The issue at hand, therefore, lies not with questions of tax discrimination on the part of Japan. With regard to the tax differentials that Michiyo Nakamoto mentions in her piece, I would like to emphasise that they have narrowed considerably as a result of the 1989 revision of Japan's Liquor Tax Law, which was undertaken in accordance with the recommendation of a 1987 Gatt panel. Those differentials have dropped from 1:16 to 1:5 for shochu and whisky, and from 1:2 to 1:1 for shochu and white spirits (based on percentage of alcohol).

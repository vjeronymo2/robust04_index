			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Sims shares fall 53p on warning prompted by rising beef prices SHARES IN Sims Food Group tumbled 53p to 129p yesterday as the meat processor and supplier announced that profits before exceptional items and tax in the year to March 31 would be about Pounds 6m. Last time operating profits rose 19 per cent to Pounds 11.3m. Sims also revealed that there would be non-recurring exceptional charges of Pounds 6.5m, which would result in pre-tax losses of about Pounds 500,000 were the company to decide to adopt FRS 3 accounting practices. The annual dividend will be reduced from 11.25p to 7.5p with a final of 4.5p, 'a level of coverage we can live with and grow upon', according to Mr Brian Ford, chief executive. Yesterday Mr Ford said that although beef prices to the consumer had risen by only 7.5 per cent since January, cattle prices were up to 25 per cent higher, and were not expected to fall in the next two to three months. It was this more than anything else which prompted the warning, he said. In the same period, lamb prices grew by up to 60 per cent, but they had fallen off a little in the past two or three weeks. Mr Ford also said that the impact of sterling's devaluation was first felt in January since when 'UK beef and lamb has been very cost attractive to mainland Europe'. Some 33 per cent of all beef in 1993 will be exported, thereby contributing to a shortage of supply. In the catering division, three out of 11 plants had been closed and all the fresh meat operations were being reviewed. Some Pounds 4.8m of the provision relates to this with the balance of Pounds 1.7m to cover the costs of closing non-core activities.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: London A busy week for the gilts market kicks off with the publication today of the minutes of the September 7 meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England. The debate about last month's base rate rise will be closely scrutinised, with traders obviously interested in clues about future interest rate policy. In addition, there is a full menu of statistics in both the UK and the US, with markets most likely to concentrate on the inflation data on both sides of the Atlantic. Many expect recent signs of strong US economic activity to lead to an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve this week. August's inflation data in the UK were rather disappointing; analysts are hoping that the underlying annual rate will have dropped back to 2.2 per cent in September, from August's 2.3 per cent. The headline rate is expected to have stabilised at 2.4 per cent. On Friday, the Bank of England will announce the stock for the next gilt auction. Ms Katy Peters, senior economist at Daiwa Europe, is expecting the Bank to pick an ultra-long stock. 'It's a cheap part of the yield curve, they haven't issued such stock for a while and there's lots of institutional demand,' she says.</p>

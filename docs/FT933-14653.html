			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: GM cautious on third quarter GENERAL MOTORS is optimistic about its second-quarter sales results but third-quarter production schedules are not overly aggressive, Mr John Smith, the group's chief executive officer, said yesterday, Reuter reports. Mr Smith, speaking to reporters at a US-Japan business conference in Cleveland, said GM had a 'good' second quarter. He addded that the US car maker's vehicle sales were 'much stronger than anyone else on the retail side'. However, he said there was still a lot of uncertainty in the market place and GM had not been too ambitious in planning third-quarter production. According to Ward's Automotive Reports, GM plans to produce 655,000 cars in the third quarter, up 46.9 per cent from a year earlier. It also intends to produce 380,000 trucks in the third quarter, up 26.2 per cent from the third quarter of 1992. 'Those schedules don't look overly optimistic,' Mr Smith said. He said the European vehicle market was still very weak, but added that GM's European operations were performing satisfactorily. 'We're satisfied with how we're doing' in Europe, he said. Meanwhile, General Motors' Powertrain Group said it has agreed to supply Toyota Motor Manufacturing USA with iron engine blocks for Toyota's 2.2-litre engine beginning in mid-1994. The blocks, destined for Toyota Camrys built in Georgetown, Kentucky, will be produced at GM's Defiance, Ohio, facility. GM said it would provide 180,000 blocks annually for the 16-valve engines. GM said the agreement was part of a strategy to expand the business to secure jobs for General Motors and United Auto Workers-represented employees. GM Powertrain's plant in Defiance manufactures grey iron and nodular iron castings and employs 3,773.</p>

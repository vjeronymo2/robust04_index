			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Mircea Dascaliuc report from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] MOLDOVA PRESS has issued some information denying  rumors according to which the sentence to death by shooting,  pronounced in the case of Ilies Ilascu by the court of the self-  proclaimed Dniester Republic was carried out yesterday, on 9  January, after one month had passed since the respective  sentence had been pronounced. The MOLDOVA PRESS correspondent  contacted competent sources at the Presidency, Parliament, and  Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Moldova, which  categorically denied these rumors, calling them ill-favored and  conniving in the current social-political context, their  disseminators having other goals in mind than the ones directed  by common sense and healthy reasoning.    According to MOLDOVA PRESS, Ilie Ilascu continues to be  imprisoned in the Chlinaia-Grigoriopol Prison. As a matter of  fact, in an interview granted exclusively to our radio station,  Mr. Nicolae Andronic, president of the parliamentary  subcommission in charge of solving the conflict in the eastern  rayons of the Republic of Moldova made the following statement:    [Begin recording] [Andronic] What can happen because one  month has passed? I do not know where the term one month comes  from, but in the old legislation, which the Dniester Region is  currently observing, it is not stipulated that the sentence  should be carried out within one month or less than a month.  The respective legislation stipulates that in two days the  accused can still submit an appeal for a pardon.    [Unidentified reporter] Then why was the term of one month  mentioned for submitting the pardon appeal in case of a sentence  against which, the court stated, no appeal can be made.    [Andronic] Thus, again, the term one month was used more as  a political than a legal term. A certain date was announced to  ruffle spirits and set an ultimatum, maybe not a direct one, but  an indirect one. However, I want to tell you that, currently,  the date of 12 January is expected when the State Duma will  start its proceedings in [word indistinct]. After Maracuta's  [Grigore, president of Dniester Republic Parliament] latest  visit there, he found people to support among those who [word  indistinct] as a results of the elections in the Duma. This in  order to receive something from Moscow. [end recording]    [Dascaliuc] This was the statement made to our correspondent  in Chisinau, by Nicolae Andronic, president of the parliamentary  subcommission in charge of solving the conflict in the eastern  rayons of the Republic of Moldova.</p>

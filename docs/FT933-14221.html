			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Tiphook Tiphook's reputation for impenetrable accounting will only be enhanced by its latest changes. Since the bulk of its revenues are in dollars, the switch to dollar-based accounting is superficially reasonable. All the more so since most of its debt and almost 50 per cent of its shareholders are in the US. But blaming a Pounds 77.3m profits hit on these accounting changes is rich when most of the charges would have been incurred anyway. The Pounds 16m cost of unwinding its interest rate swaps position would have affected profits under its old policies. So, too, would the punitively expensive Pounds 21m cost of redeeming Pounds 150m of preference shares. Such irritations might have been overlooked had Tiphook's underlying business held much appeal. But with poor annual figures, a patchy trading outlook and escalating competition, the company has a real fight on its hands. Year-end gearing of 473 per cent, which comes close to the ceiling imposed by its articles of association, constrains it further. Although high gearing is normal for leasing companies, a likely interest bill three times forecast profits is a worrying ratio nonetheless. Despite the hefty dividend yield, there seems little reason to risk holding Tiphook's shares.</p>

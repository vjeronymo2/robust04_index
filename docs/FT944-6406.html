			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Balladur calls for a more flexible Union The French government yesterday fired its first salvo of proposals for constitutional reform of the European Union in 1996, calling for more flexible integration in a non-federal Union and for reform of EU institutions to make them more democratic and efficient. The proposals, timed to produce some German reaction during the Franco-German summit which began in Bonn yesterday, came in newspaper articles by prime minister Edouard Balladur and his European affairs minister, Mr Alain Lamassoure. Writing in Le Monde, Mr Balladur made clear that France would seek to retain its central position in the new variable-speed Europe he envisages. He wrote: 'To avoid being shifted off to the west, and therefore marginalised by the enlargement of the EU to the north and east, France must set itself several objectives - to deepen further the Franco-German relationship, to develop co-operation with the UK particularly in defence, and to tighten its links with Italy and Spain', as well as promoting EU policies towards the Mediterranean. While a deepening of the Paris-Bonn axis might justify a new version of the 1963 Elysee treaty between the two countries, Mr Balladur said an enlarged Europe 'could not be federal', and warned some members of Germany's ruling Christian Democrat party against seeing in the Brussels Commission 'the beginnings of a federal executive'. A federal state 'would mean that one would expand considerably majority voting. Therefore the five big states representing four-fifths of the (Union's) population and wealth could be put in a minority'. This would be unacceptable for France. In comments that will appeal to Eurosceptics in the UK as well as in France, the French prime minster said enlargement would require the Union to be more modest in its funding and its calls on the resources of member states. He also complained that the European Court of Justice's rulings were too expansive in extending the powers of the Union. Mr Lamassoure was even more specific. Writing in Le Figaro, the minister said 'subsidiarity', or taking more decisions at national and regional levels rather than in Brussels, would have to be rewritten in 1996 'in a more precise, more homogenous and more restrictive way'. Bringing more states into the Union would 'reduce the subjects of common interest' between them, he said. In an effort to meet France's main worries about a bigger Union's decision-making efficiency with Germany's desire for greater democracy in the EU, Mr Lamassoure suggested hiving off the Council of Ministers' management role from its legislative function. Mr Lamassoure broke new ground by suggesting a two-tier executive, along the lines of German corporate structure. The Council would remain the Union's supervisory board, but under it might come either a 'directorate' (composed of bigger states, plus some smaller ones on a rotation basis), or a 'more personalised' system around the person of a secretary-general, as at the United Nations or Nato. Indeed both models could be tried, the directorate for internal Union business and a secretary-general to steer EU foreign and defence policy. France and Germany agreed at their summit meeting last night to study giving the Ukraine EU funds from its regular East European aid budget instead of proposed loans that EU ministers have blocked. Britain and France have resisted support for Ukraine until it agrees reforms with the IMF. But yesterday France agreed with Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl that the EU should give Kiev money out of its Tacis aid programme.</p>

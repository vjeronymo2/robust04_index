			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Letter: Cost of a smile Sir, The article by Christopher Lorenz ('When service with a smile is missing by a mile', January 10) is worthy of a follow-up to explore this thought.

Smaller companies must supply first, only to find no matter how efficiently or agreeably they so do the opposite applies and payment is delayed.

An official from the Directorate-General for Energy of the  Commission of the EC also said the two sides have had fruitful  cooperation in the field for more than 10 years.    He emphasized that Sino-Europe cooperation will make an  important contribution to both the industry and market of global  energy since China is the third largest energy producer and  consumer in the world.    It was reported that the Sino-Europe energy industry  meeting,  sponsored by the Directorate-General for Energy of the  Commission of the EC and China's State Science and Technology  Commission, will be held on March 17-18 to increase energy  cooperation between the two sides.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano from "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Rafael Angel Caldera believes that the  National Congress should approve the constitutional reforms as  quickly as possible. He said that it is no secret that the  constitutional reforms will not solve the country's urgent  problems but will instead serve to set the guidelines for the  new nation that Venezuelans can build.    The president made these statements during the presentation  of a new book by COPRE [Presidential Committee for State Reform]  President Ricardo Conveias entitled "A Constitution for the  Future [Una Constitucion Para el Futuro],'' a collection of  reflections on the constitutional reform draft bill that the  bicameral commission, over which Rafael Caldera himself  previously presided, will present.    [Begin recording] [Caldera] At this time, with the country's  need for change and a need to face up to its problems, the topic  of constitutional reform is fundamental and cannot be postponed.  I am convinced of the country's urgent need to carry out  constitutional reforms. Parliamentary experience shows that a  draft bill in the lawmaking process that is begun during a  legislative period, even though it may be badly needed,  generally speaking does not get approved until the following  legislative period. There would be no reason to waste all that  effort during the preceding period and not take advantage of the  fact that with only one more debate to go in the Senate a big  commission that represents all sectors and fulfills all hopes  could review the bill in depth for a second debate in the  Senate, for reconsideration in the Chamber of Deputies, and then  submit it this year to a popular referendum.    [Conveias] It is a delicate task but one of great  significance, especially taking into account the country's  current situation. Congress, in assuming this huge and delicate  job, will somehow reconcile itself and give the country the  possibility of having a new constitution through a popular  referendum. We believe a deadline should be set for this and we  must all assume the sacred mission of naming a constituent  assembly, which will be complemented with the favorable vote  cast by the majority of voters the day of the referendum. This  task is important, it is a priority, and it should not restrain  congressmen from carrying out other important legislative and  control tasks. [end recording]    Dr. Conveias insisted that their intention is not to impose  deadlines on Congress but that congressmen should impose it on  themselves so they can be in tune with the Venezuelan people's  demands.</p>

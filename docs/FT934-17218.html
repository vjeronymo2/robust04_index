			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lively trade as third quarter closes THE LAST trading session of the third quarter of the year saw UK equities return to the upward trend, although gains were trimmed towards the close by a sell-off in stock index futures. The market was helped along by demand for oil shares on the back of the Opec output agreement. Trading volume was higher but this reflected a good deal of end-of-quarter traffic in non-Footsie stocks. The day started well, with firmness in the December stock index futures contract helping a market already looking forward to the final quarter of 1993, for which further gains on the Footsie have been predicted by many stock market analysts. At best, the FT-SE 100 Index was 13 points up at 3,043.5, close to Tuesday's high point of the latest rally. But this proved as far as the market was to go yesterday, and a slow start to the new Wall Street session, which was 5 Dow points off in UK hours, cut into the premium on the futures contract. In late afternoon the stock market was heading back towards overnight levels, but a final rally took the FT-SE 100 to 3,037.5 for a net rise of 7.4. However, the FT-SE Mid 250, lacking the preponderance of blue chip oil and bank stocks, closed 1.2 easier at 3,433.2. Seaq volume of 694.8m shares compared with 511.7m in the previous session, with non-Footsie business increasing its share of the total to around 62 per cent. On Wednesday, retail business was worth Pounds 1.31bn, fully maintaining the good business levels achieved in equities. With many fund managers effectively out of the market as portfolios were wrapped up for presentation to their trustees, there was a slight air of unreality in the market. Traders took a cynical view of intermittent rumours of impending takeover moves in the Footsie list and looked forward to a return to more normal activity on Monday morning. Today, the first day of the final three months of the year, also brings the close of the current two week equity trading account which has been featured by a generally unimpressive flow of company results. The stock market has also been recovering this week from the shock administered by the dramatic political developments in Russia. However, the spurt of corporate developments this week, including the Pounds 703m deal between Grand Metropolitan and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, as well as the Pounds 358m MGN placing, has re-kindled stock market interest on the takeover/acquisition front. Equity strategists have also drawmn attention to the evident readingness of the institutions and securities houses to take up rights issues and large lines of stock when they have come on offer. BP and Shell were responsible between them for about half of the final gain in the Footsie, and the rest of the sector was also strong as crude oil prices continued to firm up behind the Opec agreement to rein in production for six months. Among domestic stocks, retail and consumer shares showed little confidence in prospects for the base rate cut predicted in some quarters. But bank shares found buyers on hopes that lending business will improve rapidly as recession pressure eases. Gains among building stocks reflected a good interim report from Redland.</p>

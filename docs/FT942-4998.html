			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Future of the OECD The fiftieth anniversary of the conference at Bretton Woods is focusing attention on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Completion of the Uruguay Round is set to transform the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade into the World Trade Organisation. The end of the secretary-general's current term of office in September ought to force a similar re-evaluation of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. What justifies such re-appraisals is not these anniversaries, but fundamental political and economic changes. Institutions that underpinned past successes must be kept up-to-date, if they are to serve well in future. The OECD is unique by virtue of its limited membership, now 25 (following Mexico's accession in April), along with the wide range of areas it covers. These include all aspects of economics; statistics; agriculture; trade; energy; the environment; public sector management; education, employment and social affairs; science, technology and industry; and fiscal, financial and business policies. Affiliated to it are the International Energy Agency and centres for advising former communist countries and research on economic development. Many significant initiatives have emerged from discussions in the OECD, since it replaced in 1961 the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation, itself the overseer of the Marshall Plan. One was how best to respond to the structural shocks of the 1970s. Another was the secretariat's analysis of producer and consumer subsidy equivalents in agriculture. Yet another is the effort, on the agenda of this week's ministerial meeting, to promote a consensus on measures to lower unemployment. The OECD plays a central role in the preparation of internationally comparable statistics, which help debates on such subjects as health, ageing and the environment. It has also become the chosen forum for negotiations to limit subsidies to shipbuilding and export credit. The OECD needs to remain the focal point for inter-governmental discussion of this wide range of topics. But it will also have to change. The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia are banging on the door. Argentina, Chile, and Brazil, with which the OECD has contacts, might become members, following Mexico. In east Asia, there are several countries that might follow South Korea, due to join late next year. In principle, the OECD should embrace all advanced market economies. But it must not become as unwieldy as the United Nations. This can be managed only by alterations in the way it is now run. The current principle that all members are entitled to a seat at virtually all tables will have to end. Smaller members could be grouped into constituencies. Regional sub-groups could be established. Sub-groups might also be formed out of those interested in particular topics. Also necessary is streamlined decision-making. At present unanimity is the rule. Weighted voting would help facilitate executive decisions in a larger, more diverse grouping. Such a change in voting should help a secretary-general determined to play a more powerful role in shaping the global policy debate. Much depends on who is the successor to Mr Jean-Claude Paye, who has been in place for 10 years. Challenging the French incumbent are Mr Donald Johnston, a former Canadian minister backed by the US, and two other European candidates - Lord Lawson, the former UK chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Lorenz Schomerus, a senior German economics ministry official. All of these candidates have merits, though none seems to have the perfect blend of intellectual weight, political clout, diplomatic ability and administrative experience. Probably Lord Lawson comes closest. As David Henderson, former head of the economic department, has pointed out, 'OECD has neither money to offer nor the power to give instructions; but what happens there can have influence on governments and a wider public opinion, if the work of the organisation is professionally competent, objective and timely.' The next head of the OECD must, above all, be someone able to initiate and promote such work to gov-ernments and to a wider public.</p>

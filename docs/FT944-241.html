			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / The fax war: A high-tech challenge in Saudi Arabia In a non-descript, three-bedroom apartment in north-west London a traditional Saudi meat stew simmers on the kitchen stove, as Mr Mohammed al-Massaari, dressed in a white caftan, stands over a row of modems. This is the headquarters in-exile of the Committee for the Defence of Legitimate Rights in Saudi Arabia, an organisation that every Tuesday spends 10 hours sending 800 faxes to Saudi Arabia and 200 to other embassies and press centres. Mr al-Massaari, a physics professor turned Saudi dissident, and his partner, Mr Saad al-Faguih, a surgeon, were jailed for launching the CDLR - which advocates greater government accountability and stronger adherence to Islamic values - in Saudi Arabia in 1993. On their release, they fled to London, applied for political asylum and went shopping - for fax machines, modems, computers and a copier. For the past eight months, they have bombarded Saudi government offices, businesses and universities with faxes. 'We've sent faxes to the king himself and his defence ministers,' says Mr al-Faguih. 'We have their private numbers,' he adds, with the glee of the computer hacker who has beaten the system. The faxes they send are libellous inventories of alleged incompetencies and corruption, spiced with accusations of sexual peccadilloes. Typical are remarks such as 'prince X is fond of flogging people in his office. Sordidly he often uses shoes on his victims', or 'X leads a group of sexual deviants who have terrorised the people of the province'. Last week's fax carried a warning that a leading hotel owned by the Treasury department had installed hidden cameras to record the guests' 'very intimate' moments with the intention of blackmail. The CDLR's own fax machines, meanwhile, receive a barrage of grievances, sometimes factual, sometimes fictional, from supporters in the kingdom. Drawing such complaints has required ingenuity - in the form of telephone lines that allow Saudis to call without being traced. 'We had two limitations,' says Mr al-Faguih. 'US telecommunications operators, such as MCI, AT&amp;T and Sprint, do not have facilities to connect Saudi Arabia with the rest of the world, and people do not have calling (telephone credit) cards in Saudi Arabia.' The CDLR solution has been a no-charge number, which connects callers, via MCI, AT&amp;T or Sprint, to a number in the US. That Washington DC call is then forwarded to the CDLR in London by a local telecoms carrier. The CDLR has also purchased two calling-card numbers, issued by AT&amp;T and MCI, that can be used only to dial its London offices, and disseminated the numbers throughout the kingdom. The itemised bills for all these calls are seen only by the CDLR. For the sophisticated user, the CDLR promises a newsletter will soon be available via E-mail. Mr al-Faguih says he is also negotiating with several US companies for a contract to fax the newsletter on the CDLR's behalf. He says he has received an offer from a US company to fax the newsletter which would reduce by half his monthly costs of Pounds 30,000 (financed by Islamist supporters within the kingdom). Even without such advances, the CDLR faxes have presented a growing nuisance to a sensitive government. Saudi rulers, when they comment at all on the CDLR, adopt an air of haughty dismissiveness. 'They are nutcases,' says a prince. 'These faxes don't represent any increase in the kingdom for their point of view.' Nevertheless, members of the ruling family find them irksome. The government is used to controlling information sources. A team of censors sits daily in an office in the Saudi information ministry ripping offending pages out of foreign newspapers, blackening news pictures, or striking out with a giant black X any advert for alcohol. The royal family has also tried to prevent uncontrolled satellite TV broadcasts in the kingdom. In a land where media sources are purged of anything deemed un-Islamic, anti-Saudi, critical of the rulers or even just saucy, the faxes make popular and gripping reading. And the Saudi government is disconcerted by their political effect, although officials claim that the problem is not that the faxes are galvanising an anti-government mobilisation, but that they are damaging people's view of the kingdom. The faxes are also demonstrating the paucity of Saudi Arabia's information policies. Many of the faxes are sent to western journalists, who, starved of other information about Saudi politics, have given their allegations play. For such journalists, there is no one in the kingdom who can be contacted for an official rebuttal, or to put another side. Some of the princes admit that the government has found no satisfactory way of responding to the publicity that the CDLR has created. Last month, the Saudi government offered visas to about a dozen western reporters in an attempt to redress this problem. But this new openness did not seem to have percolated far into the Saudi bureaucracy. After a fruitless 45-minute interview, one FT correspondent's Saudi minder helpfully said of the senior official in question: 'He doesn't really like talking to journalists, so he was not going to tell you anything.' Another Saudi response has been to urge the British government to get rid of the troublesome Mr al-Massaari and his London fax HQ - a topic that was high on the agenda of prime minister John Major's recent talks in the kingdom. Mr al-Massaari's request for political asylum in Britain was refused last month, though he is now appealing. But being forced to leave the UK is unlikely to force him to abandon his modems. The CDLR may long for the pure Islamic state of the 8th century, but it has embraced the telecommunications revolution of the 20th century. Mr al-Faguih says: 'Khomeini's was a cassette revolution, ours will be a fax revolution.'</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (8): Search for technology - Research and development 'In the past five years, our research and development has lagged behind wage rises. This is the principal reason for our deteriorating trade balance.' Mr Kim Chul-Su, Korea's trade and industry minister, was scarcely exaggerating when he addressed foreign journalists last month. Korea badly needs technology to compete in world markets. Foreign competitors are understandably reluctant to supply it, given Korea's reputation as an industrial powerhouse. But research is not Korea's strong point. According to one western analyst, the country's total expenditure on research and development last year was less than that of General Motors. R&amp;D is now high on the agenda of both government and industry. Mr Young Soogil, a senior economic adviser to the government, says: 'For the past couple of years, the Ministry of Finance has been working on what we call the G7 project. There are 11 specific advanced technologies in which we'd like to be self-sufficient by the year 2010. 'We don't want advanced capability in most areas, but in niche technologies. The ministry's model is Switzerland, which is not an advanced country in terms of the spectrum of technologies but has unique capability in specific areas. This strategy would give us room for strategic alliances with other countries.' In other words, Korea is looking for bargaining power. This applies equally at the corporate level. At Samsung's Advanced Institute of Technology, outside Seoul, Mr Kang Jong-Hoon says: 'In the 1970s and 1980s, we had to buy everything. All the technologies were coming from outside. We just assembled, using cheap labour, and re-exported to the US. That's not the paradigm any more. We don't have cheap labour or cheap materials. Since all our competitors are well aware of our situation, they don't want to sell us technology any more. 'Then, it was like an elementary school kid begging from an uncle. Now it's a high school kid. Some day, we want to be eye to eye with a company like Sony. But the key is bargaining for technology.' In the past, Korean companies have not always been scrupulous about intellectual property rights. In that respect too, life is getting harder. At Samsung Electronics' headquarters in Seoul, Mr Kim Hun says: 'Technology transfer is getting harder. Companies around the world are finding business slow, so they are looking more closely at the value of their patents. 'A good example in our industry is Texas Instruments, which made more than half its money from its patents last year. The Americans and the Japanese are both pushing us into a corner on patents. That's why we have to have our own new technologies. Even if we have one single technology which the others don't have, that puts us in a better bargaining position.' But Samsung is at the sophisticated end of Korean industry. Whether the average Korean manufacturer can or should devote time and money to genuinely new technology is an open question. A western diplomat says: 'Everybody is talking about high technology at present, but they can't actually get into communications technology or advanced materials. Their strengths will be more in the sophisticated end of shipbuilding or cars.' The Korean tradition is not notably inventive in terms of pure research. A senior British executive in Seoul says: 'The Koreans don't have lateral thinking in their education system. And their R&amp;D establishments are commercially funded, so perhaps too targeted. Maybe the Koreans should send more people to British universities.' One of those commercially funded establishments is the Institute for Advanced Engineering in Seoul. The Institute, which was set up last year, aims to combine industrial research with running a graduate school for PhD students. It is funded by Daewoo, one of the nation's large conglomerates, and works almost exclusively on Daewoo projects. The Institute's president, Professor Chung Kun-Mo, ticks off some areas of interest: car engines, heavy water nuclear reactors, manufacturing technology in shipbuilding and earth-moving equipment. Most of the list sounds like intermediate technology, of a kind which the new government has recently been recommending to industry. Professor Chung does not wholly accept this. 'The point is synthesis. The government's emphasis on intermediate technology has a lot of merit, but it's often misunderstood. What we're talking about is highly sophisticated technology in sectors where intermediate technology has been used traditionally.' Take, for example, steelmaking. 'A traditional steel mill is intermediate technology. But you can employ all kinds of laser technology, for instance, and microsecond diagnosis of the product.' Or take textile manufacture, where Daewoo is heavily involved. 'Nobody yet knows how to use micro-electromechanical devices here, but we're working on it. You can use sensors to determine the thickness of a thread, but when it comes to speed it has to be controlled by experience. It should be possible to control that through local sensors. 'Or take engines. At how many points of an auto engine do we use sensors? There could be a lot more diagnostic sensing used on a continuous basis, to improve engine efficiency. If we can make cheap diagnostic sensors and control mechanisms, we can produce a much more efficient engine from existing types. Some scientists want to go to the laboratory and start from scratch. We say, let's make money by improving those industries which have been milk cows for us in the past.' Understandably, there is a defensive undertone here. As a newly high-wage economy, Korea is being hustled out of low-cost industries such as textiles, and is naturally anxious to slow down the process. But there are some industries - notably electronics - where the tone is more aggressive. At Samsung's research laboratories, Mr Kang says: 'There are areas where we lead the world: in the digital video disc recorder, or in some fields of semiconductors.' But despite individual successes, Mr Kang is realistic about the task ahead. 'In semiconductors or flat display panels, we have a gap of one or two years. In product design, or making things that are compact, look good and work well, we've got a lot to do. The problem is that as a young company, we had to concentrate on the hot technologies. To excel, you need to be good at everything.'</p>

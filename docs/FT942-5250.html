			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (9): Drought may be over - The Nuclear Industry Two events last April underlined the volatile mood in Canada's nuclear industry. Mr Zou Jiahua, China's vice- premier, visited the suburban Toronto offices of Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd (AECL), reinforcing hopes that Beijing will use its Candu heavy water reactor to meet part of its fast-growing power needs. The high-profile Chinese visit symbolised AECL's optimism about the Candu programme's future. A 700-megawatt Candu unit installed at Wolsong, South Korea, in 1983 has won acclaim for two years in a row as the world's best-performing nuclear reactor. AECL has won orders for three more units at Wolsong since 1990, and expects to be a front-runner for reactors in Romania, Turkey and Indonesia, as well as China, over the next few years. Two weeks before, however, came the latest of many upheavals within AECL's ranks. Its chief executive quit after less than a year at the job. Over the past four years, the government-owned company has had three chief executive officers and four chairmen, while 10 of its 12 government-appointed directors have been replaced. AECL has been through several painful restructurings over the past decade as the prospects for nuclear energy have waned, and government funding has contracted. In particular, AECL has battled to bring a sharper, more commercial focus to its research arm, whose payroll is about three times bigger than the Candu division. Uncertainty about the future of nuclear power has taken a toll on the Candu programme. This division's payroll has shrunk from 3,600 to 1,000 employees over the past decade. Much of its effort during the 1980s was directed at service work on existing Candu and other reactors. AECL announced another round of cuts late last month, including a 15 per cent reduction in its total payroll over the next two years. Nonetheless, Mr Don Lawson, who heads the Candu operations, is optimistic that the new orders from Korea herald the end of the long drought for the nuclear industry. Construction of a Candu reactor at Cernavoda in Romania is again in full swing after being interrupted because of the 1989 revolution. AECL and its Italian engineering partner, Ansaldo, now have complete charge of the site. 'The quality of work has been as good as anywhere else,' Mr Lawson says. 'What we've done is to put a fence around the site, with western work practices within the fence.' Drawing on staff from several Canadian utilities, AECL will run the plant for the first 18 months. About 150 Romanian operators are being trained at a Candu power station in New Brunswick. AECL's marketing efforts are at present focused on Turkey, where the government is expected to call for bids later this year for one - possibly two - units at Akkuyu, on the south coast. TEK, the Turkish utility, signed a letter of intent for a Candu reactor in 1983. But financing problems related to the unusual ownership and operating structure of the project scuppered that deal. The transaction is likely to be more straightforward this time around. Mr Lawson says that AECL has already arranged CDollars 1.5bn in financing for the Canadian content of its renewed bid for the Turkish contract. Its partner, the Dutch arm of John Brown, the UK engineering and construction group, has brought in support from the UK, Netherlands and Spain. Asia will be the biggest source of business over the next few decades, predicts Mr Lawson. AECL is banking on its success in Korea to win orders from Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and China. But the company is also crossing its fingers for a revival in nuclear power's fortunes closer to home. One prospect is Saskatchewan, the prairie province which is the world's biggest uranium producer but has so far steered clear of nuclear power generation. AECL hopes that Saskatchewan will order a smaller version of the 700 MW Candu 6 reactor. A relatively simple 450 MW model, with a construction time of less than three years, is at present on the drawing boards. Elsewhere in North America, several first generation nuclear reactors are nearing the end of their planned 40-year life. Environmental groups are certain to fight any move to replace them with new nuclear units. However, the power station sites have already been approved for nuclear use, and the infrastructure is in place. Mr Lawson predicts that orders from North American utilities will restart within 15 years.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Korean cars to be made in Germany Kia Motors is to become the first South Korean carmaker to assemble passenger vehicles in Europe. The company, Korea's second largest motor manufacturer, plans to build up to 30,000 vehicles a year at the Osnabruck plant of German automotive and engineering group Karmann. The Korean company announced yesterday it had signed a deal with Karmann to produce its Sportage four wheel drive sports-utility vehicle at the Karmann factory in northern Germany. The agreement is a landmark in the development of the world's auto industry, and signals the determination of Korean vehicle producers to break into European and North American markets. The move comes a decade after the Japanese motor industry took its first steps into car assembly in Europe. Four Japanese vehicle makers now assemble cars in Europe, and a fifth has a plant under development. The Korean motor industry has embarked on rapid overseas expansion. Kia, the second-largest Korean vehicle maker, recently began selling cars in the US under its own brand after entering many European markets for the first time last year. Daewoo Motor, the third largest Korean producer, plans to enter the European market in 1995-96 and recently established a technical centre for new vehicle development and engineering in the UK. Hyundai, the leading Korean vehicle maker, said last month it planned to increase its vehicle production capacity by 60 per cent to 2m units by the year 2000. It plans to build more foreign production sites to reinforce its presence in overseas markets. Kia said yesterday that production of the Sportage would begin in Osnabruck early next year. Initial output is planned at 15,000 a year, but Kia said it was aiming to double output later to 30,000 a year with both four-door and two-door versions. In the first phase the Sportage vehicles will be assembled from CKD (completely knocked down) kits shipped from Korea, but Kia said that in the medium term it planned to involve 'as many German and European components suppliers as possible'. In the longer term Kia plans to increase the European content of the vehicle to around 60 per cent. Karmann is a long-established German automotive engineering group, which specialises in low-volume production of niche vehicles for other carmakers. With a total workforce of 7,197 and a turnover last year of DM1.3bn (Pounds 520m), it assembles the Volkswagen Golf convertible and Corrado and the Ford Escort convertible.</p>

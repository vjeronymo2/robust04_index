			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Observer: British blossom Who said that foreigners can't get ahead in Japanese banks? David H Drewery, 55, who had spent all his life with Lloyds Bank until three years ago, has won a place in banking history books by becoming the first non-Japanese to be appointed a main board director of a big Japanese bank - Daiwa, 25th biggest in the world. New York-based Drewery, who parted company with Lloyds when the latter sold its US business to Daiwa in March 1990, seems a little abashed by his speed of ascent up the Daiwa hierarchy, especially since he can't speak Japanese. Presumably, Drewery's old bosses at Lloyds will be conducting some sort of post-mortem, since the promotion suggests that the Japanese have been able to make more of a go of the business than Lloyds.</p>

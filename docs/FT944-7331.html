			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Law to offer protection for disabled workers Disabled people will be protected against discrimination at work under long-awaited legislation, the government announced yesterday. Mr William Hague, minister for the disabled, told the Commons it will be unlawful for an employer to treat a disabled person less favourably than others unless there are 'justifiable reasons'. He said the proposals represented the greatest advance for disabled people in the history of the country. But Labour said they did not go far enough. Mr Hague refused to say how much the proposals would cost industry. He said a full compliance-cost assessment will be produced alongside the bill when it is published before the end of the year. The Department of Social Security said the costs to business would be well below the estimated Pounds 17bn cost of implementing the private member's bill for the disabled proposed earlier this year by Mr Roger Berry, Labour MP for Kingswood. One official said the proposals could cost employers about Pounds 50m a year for the next 15 years. Ministers are examining ways of ensuring that no company will pay adjustment costs above a specified percentage of their profits. The Confederation of British Industry said it was important the measures would not be 'unnecessarily costly to business'. The Institute of Directors said the statement contained 'open-ended commitments which could prove very costly'. Mr Hague said employers will have to make 'a reasonable adjustment where that would help overcome the practical effects of disability'. But he added that regulations would 'ensure adjustments do not involve excessive costs'. Employers with 20 or fewer workers will be exempt from the legislation. The government also intends to abolish the quota scheme that requires employers with 20 or more employees to employ at least 3 per cent of registered disabled people. It believes the scheme is unworkable and fails to meet the needs of the disabled. A National Disability Council is to be created to advise the government. Mr Hague said: 'This will be a new, powerful voice for disabled people in the decision-making process.' But the new body was criticised for not being strong enough. Employers 'where practical' will have to remove physical and communication barriers preventing access by the disabled to goods and services. But Mr Hague said employers will have to make modifications 'only to the extent they are readily achievable and subject to a financial limit'. Financial services are to be included in the new statutory right of equal access.</p>

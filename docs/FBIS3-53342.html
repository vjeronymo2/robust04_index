[Frayj] Good morning and welcome.    [Al-Minufi] With the peace talks now under way between the  Palestinians and the Israelis in Taba, we are surprised by the  Israeli Government's decision to build a new settlement on Mount  Olive. In your view, what are the reasons for this action?    [Frayj] I denounce the confiscation of Arab land and the  construction of settlements during negotiations and following  the signing of the agreement and the mutual declaration [between  Israel and the PLO]. This is not a sign of goodwill and casts  doubts on Israel's desire for peace. I believe that this action  has more arrogance than benefits for Israel. Mount Olive is  densely populated and every inch of it is owned by Arabs,  including the monasteries that have been in existence on this  holy mountain for 2,000 years.    [Al-Minufi] The negotiations being held in Taba between the  Palestinians and Israelis have achieved positive results within  the civilian committee, but there is still stagnation within the  security committee. What is the reaction in the Palestinian  street to these talks?    [Frayj] There is mistrust among the Palestinians. This  mistrust is deepening day by day. The Israeli measures in the  occupied territories are worsening. They are not easing the  tension, they are not allowing family reunions or freeing  Palestinian prisoners, etc. The mistrust is deepening and could  have a negative impact on the peace process.    [Al-Minufi] April is the deadline for implementing the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, but so far the  two sides have not settled the differences impeding the  implementation of the agreement. What effect this could have on  the Palestinians?    [Frayj] According to the information we receive from the  talks in Taba, there is tangible progress on the transfer of  powers, but some (?difficult) obstacles remain regarding the  security issues. Judging by the information we received from the  Palestinian delegations, I believe that the Israeli troops will  begin withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho before 13 April.  [passage omitted]</p>

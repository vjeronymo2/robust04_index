			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Fashion: The Global Wardrobe - Going out to dinner / Frankfurt Dinner time is show time, and everyone makes an effort. Even the waiters. Diamond stud earrings twinkle, while tortoiseshell alice bands restrain the 'romantik-look' shoulder-length locks favoured in certain Italian quarters, keeping them out of the soup. South of the river Main in youth-conscious Sachsenhausen, the anything-goes rule applies with a vengeance. No-one can match young Frankfurters' skills in studied scruffiness. The bag-lady principle is heavily applied: five layers of shirts, vests and waistcoats, all visible and all costly. Failure to wear jeans at every hour of the day appears to be a mortal offence. Unbuttoned flannel shirts (the business this autumn) show off either extravagant underwear on the women or depilated tanned male chests. Carefully-slit jeans reveal the flesh on both sexes. The quality improves, but the entertainment-value fades further to the north, in central Frankfurt's restaurants and beyond in the suburban uplands of the Taunus hills, where seasonable Steinpilzen cepe mushrooms at DM20 (Pounds 7.60) a mouthful, set off the diners' lingering tans. Rising numbers of grey pony tails on male heads reflect Karl Lagerfeld's hero status and the local shortage of barbers not trained in the slash-and-burn school. But apart from when they are rigged out in black tie  -every man dressed like a conjuror - the men are a dull lot. Dark suit, white shirt, long face. The fluffy jumpers plague appears to have abated among Frankfurt women who have adopted a nattier style for dinner. It is acceptable to wear a pair of posh-label jeans coupled with a white cotton shirt and a black blazer in the stuffiest restaurants. Jewellery is crucial: emerald earrings, for choice. In keeping with the times the mood is more modest, but no one wants to go out for dinner only to be outshone by the waiters.</p>

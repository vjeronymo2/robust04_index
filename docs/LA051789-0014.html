			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUNK DRIVERS  </P> <P> It has been just over three weeks since my younger brother, Alan, was killed in  a head-on car collision with a drunk driver. Three college students died and  two were hospitalized in San Diego.  </P> <P> The first newspaper that I picked up upon resuming normal activities had  headlines of a legally-drunk woman running down several teen-agers and killing  three of them. This springtime has also had a rash of deaths involving young  people who are drinking and driving.  </P> <P> Our family suffered great personal loss and society suffers staggering  financial costs due to drinking and driving. We, as a society, bear part of the  responsibility for these deaths. We allow alcoholics to drive on our roads and  kill our families.  </P> <P> I have read that in Sweden a first offense for driving after drinking requires  a mandatory 6-month jail sentence. This has not solved their alcohol problems,  however, I understand that they have greatly reduced their drunk-driving  deaths.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most vocal group for tougher laws against drunk driving is MADD  (Mothers Against Drunk Driving).  </P> <P> Prior to my brother's death, I was too busy to be involved with MADD. Must we  all lose a loved one before we get involved?  </P> <P> I urge your support of MADD, as well as any local, state or federal legislation  to strengthen drunk-driving laws. Finally, start with yourself: Don't drink and  drive; don't let your friends drive after drinking.  </P> <P> SCOTT VOORMAN  </P> <P> Oxnard  </P></p>

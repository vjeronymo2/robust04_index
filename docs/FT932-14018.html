			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs angry at cut to World Service THE BBC World Service fears it may have to close a number of its foreign-language radio services because of threatened cuts to its funding. The Foreign Office, which funds the BBC World Service, has confirmed a Pounds 5m cut in budget for each of the three years from 1994 to 1997. More than 220 MPs from both sides of the Commons have signed an early day motion opposing the cuts, expressing 'grave concern' at potential damage to Britain's reputation 'as the fount of accurate and unbiased news.' The World Service, which broadcasts in English and 38 other languages to an audience of more than 1.2bn, has also been asked to draw up contingency plans for further cuts of 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent.</p>

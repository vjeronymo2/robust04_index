			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by Section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, FAS has submitted a copy of this proposed rule to OMB for its review of these information collection requirements. Other organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments regarding this burden estimate or any aspects of these information collection requirements, including suggestions for reducing the burdens, should direct them to the Acting General Sales Manager, FAS, USDA, at the address above, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, New Executive Building, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for the Foreign Agricultural Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with state and local officials. See the notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 46 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule has been reviewed under the Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. The proposed rule would have pre-emptive effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations, or policies which conflict with such provisions or which otherwise impede their full implementation. The proposed rule would not have retroactive effect. Administrative proceedings are not required before parties may seek judicial review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Agriculture is committed to carrying out its statutory and regulatory mandates in a manner that best serves the public interest. Therefore, where legal discretion permits, the Department actively seeks to promulgate regulations that promote economic growth, create jobs, are minimally burdensome and are easy for the public to understand, use or comply with. In short, the Department is committed to issuing regulations that maximize net benefits to society and minimize costs imposed by those regulations. This principle is articulated in Executive Orders 12291 and 12498. The Department applies this principle to the full extent possible, consistent with law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has developed and reviewed this regulatory proposal in accordance with these principles. Nonetheless, the Department believes that public input from all interested persons can be invaluable to ensuring that the final regulatory product is minimally burdensome and maximally efficient. Therefore, the Department specifically seeks comments and suggestions from the public regarding any less burdensome or more efficient alternative that would accomplish the purposes described in the proposal. Comments suggesting less burdensome or more efficient alternatives should be addressed to the agency as provided in this Proposed Rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would govern the donation of agricultural commodities overseas pursuant to section 416(b) of the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1431(b)) and the Food for Progress Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C. 1736o). These regulations contain many provisions that have been standard terms of agreements with recipients, i.e., Cooperating Sponsors, for a number of years. As of October 1, 1991, the Agency for International Development no longer is a signatory to section 416(b) program agreements and pursuant to E.O. 12752, 56 FR 8255, the Secretary of Agriculture was delegated the President's responsibilities under the Food for Progress Act. Accordingly, it is appropriate for the Department of Agriculture to promulgate regulations to govern operations under these two programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, the regulatory provisions herein would apply equally to both programs; however, certain provisions dealing with the sale of commodities and the use of local currencies generated from such sales apply only to the section 416(b) program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested parties should carefully read the full proposed rule. Of particular note are the following points:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Nominations of shipping agents for Cooperating Sponsors participating in the Food for Progress Act will be made to USDA in conformity with the conflict of interest provisions currently applicable only to section 416(b) and of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (Pub. L. 480). This will place all USDA concessional export programs on the same basis regarding conflict of interest reviews in connection with shipping agents. In this regard, the proposed regulations include limitations on commissions that may be paid to shipping agents that follow the limitations currently proposed for shipping agents participating in the title I, Public Law 480 program. See 57 FR 53607, November 12, 1992. Comments received regarding these limitations are presently being reviewed and will also be considered in relation to this proposed rule. These proposed rules, however, would also limit the agents commission to a percentage of the gross freight attributable to the ocean segment of any movement that may be contracted on a through bill of lading or involve obligations at discharge such as bagging grain. This limitation is included because freight charges attributed to inland movements to many destinations receiving section 416(b) and Food for Progress commodities are relatively high due to various difficult conditions in these countries. CCC does not have an effective mechanism to determine the reasonableness of these charges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. These regulations apply only to agreements for the donation of agricultural commodities and not to any sales to Cooperating Sponsors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Specific criteria are established to govern the approval of agreements or of activities under such agreements. Detailed information is required in the Plan of Operation submitted in connection with a section 416(b) agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The proposed rule contains detailed procedures for the procurement of ocean transportation including requirements for competitive bidding in the fixture of vessels on charter terms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The regulations include specific guidance for ocean carrier and inland claims and for disposing of commodities unfit for intended use. In this regard, the regulations would adopt procedures similar to those in effect for title II, Public Law 480 shipments and should be familiar to many Cooperating Sponsors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

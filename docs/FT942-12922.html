			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Hersant sells stake in Hungarian newspaper Hersant, France's largest newspaper publisher, is abandoning its investment in the Hungarian national daily newspaper, Magyar Nemzet. Socpresse, part of the French group, is selling its 92 per cent stake in Magyar Nemzet, Hungary's fourth-largest national newspaper, to Hirlapkiado Vallalat, the state-owned media holding company. The parties to the deal refused to disclose the purchase price but it is understood Hersant took a loss of FFr40m (Dollars 6.9m) on its investment. The group has been an aggressive buyer of provincial titles in France and newspapers in other European countries, but its acquisitions have a mixed record. Hersant's 14 newspapers in Poland, including leading national daily Rzeczpospolita, have been generally profitable; but Diario 16, the Madrid daily, has suffered financial difficulties, as has Magyar Nemzet. Magyar Nemzet executives blame the publication's losses on Hungary's overcrowded national newspaper market, in which 14 titles serve a population of 10m. News Corporation, the media group controlled by Mr Rupert Murdoch, paid Dollars 4m in 1990 for 50 per cent stakes in daily Mai Nap and weekly Reform. Last year News exercised an option to sell its investment back to the Hungarian partners. Analysts believe only one national is clearly profitable - Nepszabadsag, the largest circulation newspaper, controlled by Germany's Bertelsmann.</p>

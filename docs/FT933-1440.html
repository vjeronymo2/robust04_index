			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Bureaucracy swells cost of German unity THE costs of German unification have been swelled by bureaucracy, officials dining out in five-star hotels in Berlin, and the inefficient use of energy, the Federal Court of Auditors said yesterday. In a measured, but critical 220-page annual report about how unification has been used to run up unnecessary expenses, the Court of Auditors concluded that unless waste is cut, the finance authorities will be left with little room to manoeuvre. But the report by the Court of Auditors, an independent institution which acts as a watchdog in monitoring how budgets are spent in the state sector, also reveals Germany's propensity for bureaucracy and waste. For instance, if thermostats which regulate the temperature of water and heating were installed in state-run housing and enterprises, it would save over DM100m (Pounds 40m). At the moment, heating in many public institutions can only be controlled by opening or closing the windows. If a new computer was installed in the eastern German railway network, it would save DM27m, as well as cutting the numbers of personnel who spend a great deal of time writing out tickets by hand. The Court of Auditors also reckons that the eastern railways bureaucracy is employing between 20,000 and 30,000 people too many, which is costing the taxpayer between DM1.3bn and DM1.8bn a year. The Patent office comes under scrutiny too. When the two offices were merged after unification, the staff swelled from 180 to 588, many of whom are simply not needed, the auditors argue. Unification also gave western German officials sent to Berlin to open branches of the federal ministries an excuse to spend up to DM137 a day on lunch in the city's five-star hotels. Even the Treuhand is criticised. The auditors call for much greater control over the privatisation agency's operations and finances.</p>

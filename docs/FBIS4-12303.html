			<p>BFN     [Text] Pakistan has refuted press reports as totally  baseless suggesting that the United States has proposed to  Islamabad to freeze the Kashmir issue. A Foreign Office  spokesman briefing newsmen in Islamabad today said Pakistan has  received neither any paper nor any nonpaper on this subject.  [sentence as heard]    To a question, the spokesman said Pakistan resents deeply  the  proliferation of false and defamatory statements from India  alleging the involvement of Pakistan's Inter Service  Intelligence in the internal affairs of India and other  neighboring states. He said Pakistan Government rejects  categorically statements made in this connection by the chief  minister of Assam, director general of its police, and the  article in the Indian newspaper THE INDEPENDENT.    To another question, the spokesman said the entire spectrum  of Pakistan-U.S. relations would come under review during the  three-day visit of the U.S. deputy secretary of state, Mr.  Strobe Talbott, beginning from Friday [8 April]. The spokesman  said the agenda of talks is very broad and we are prepared to  discuss all the issues faced.</p>

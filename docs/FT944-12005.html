			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Surge in tobacco profits lifts BAT A surge in tobacco profits in the US and recovery in Brazil helped BAT Industries overcome weakness in its general insurance business to report a 21 per cent increase in third-quarter pre-tax profits to Pounds 551m from Pounds 455m. The stronger than forecast result pushed profits for the nine months ended September to Pounds 1.5bn, up 10 per cent from a year earlier. 'There should be a worthwhile increase in our pre-tax profits for the year, enabling us to maintain our progressive dividend policy,' Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said. BAT remained hopeful that a New York court would overturn attempts by the Federal Trade Commission to block its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) takeover of American Tobacco. The FTC will argue in the case, beginning in New York on December 5, that the deal would reduce competition. Tobacco trading profits for the nine months rose 13 per cent to Pounds 920m, excluding a Pounds 135m extraordinary gain a year earlier. Cigarette volumes rose by 5 per cent. In the US, third-quarter profits at its Brown &amp; Williamson subsidiary nearly trebled to Pounds 111m and doubled in the nine months to Pounds 328m. US profits were depressed last year by Philip Morris' savage price cutting on 'Marlboro Friday'. Since then the market has stabilised with Kool and GPC Approved, BAT's leading brands, improving their market shares. Mr Martin Broughton, chief executive, said the jump in US profits reflected special factors but there was good underlying growth. Financial services contributed Pounds 674m to group trading profits, up 3 per cent from a year earlier. Eagle Star's profits fell Pounds 13m to Pounds 104m because of a sharp drop in investment returns to Pounds 99m. Its underwriting loss fell to Pounds 28m from Pounds 99m. Allied Dunbar, BAT's UK financial services business, raised its trading profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 124m on premium income up 10 per cent at Pounds 1.32bn. Farmers, BAT's US insurer, showed a marginal increase in profits to Pounds 391m with its life business improving in the quarter. BAT said Farmers' claims from last year's San Francisco earthquake were expected to exceed earlier estimates of Dollars 1.35bn. A 16 per cent increase in nine-months tax to Pounds 466m and an increase in minority interests to Pounds 83m from Pounds 71m left earnings per share ahead 6 per cent at 30.8p.

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> 'TUTTI FRUTTI' URGED AS GEORGIA SONG  </P> <P> A proposal to make Little Richard's "Tutti Frutti" the state's official rock  'n' roll song was introduced in the Georgia Legislature today.  </P> <P> Rep. Billy Randall (D-Macon) introduced the measure, saying it was intended to  give some overdue recognition to "Little Richard" Penniman, a Macon native  whose style was copied by many of the rock stars of the early 1960s, including  the Beatles. "Tutti Frutti," Little Richard's first big hit, reached No. 2 on  the rhythm and blues chart in 1955 and later achieved classic status as a rock  standard. Among its lyrics is the memorable: "Wop bop a loo bop a wop bam  boom."  </P></p>

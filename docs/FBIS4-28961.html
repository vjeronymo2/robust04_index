			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 9 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) --  Prominent figures of Japan including political scientist Takeshi  Ishida and lawyer Tsukuo Imamura met the speaker of the House of  Representatives and the chairman of the House of Councillors on  June 2 and handed them a letter urging the adoption of a special  Diet resolution on Japan's responsibility for the war and  apology and the establishment of an ad hoc committee for the  investigation into postwar compensation.    Recalling that many Asian people were killed in Japan's war  of aggression, they strongly demanded a thoroughgoing  investigation into the outstanding issue of postwar compensation  including the forcible drafting of Koreans and the issue of  "comfort women for the army", the publication of its results and  the clarification of the responsibility.    They said that the Diet should immediately adopt a special  resolution on the responsibility for the war and apology with  the approval of both houses and apologize for Japan's past  crimes.</p>

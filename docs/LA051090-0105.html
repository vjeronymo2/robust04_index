			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SPRINGING AHEAD, FALLING BACK;  </P> <P> POLY: THE SCHOOL'S FORTUNES CHANGE WITH THE SEASONS, BUT TWO-SPORT STANDOUT  JONATHAN CAMPBELL REMAINS A CONSTANT.  </P> <P> Arms pumping, legs churning, teeth clenched, Poly High junior Jonathan Campbell  rounds third base, his teammates roaring their approval as they leap from the  bench.  </P> <P> The relay from the distant North Hollywood left fielder to the shortstop  becomes merely a drill. But Campbell approaches home plate running harder  still, looking like a football running back in a baseball uniform.  </P> <P> Campbell leaps, arms outstretched, reaching for home plate. He lands amid a  cloud of dust, gloved hands sliding across the plate, helmet tumbling over his  eyes.  </P> <P> Home run, Jonathan Campbell-style.  </P> <P> "He's a hard nose," Poly baseball Coach Jerry Cord said. "But he's not at all a  bully-type hard nose. More of an All-American-type hard nose."  </P> <P> A fitting description of the blond-haired, blue-eyed Campbell, a muscular  5-foot-10 1/2, 183-pound junior with an easy grin and a strong bat.  </P> <P> He is a driven player with a full-throttle approach. In a conference game  against Van Nuys this season, Campbell tagged up and scored on a medium-to-deep  fly ball to right field. He was on second base at the time.  </P> <P> Said Cord: "You just don't see that." In the aforementioned win over North  Hollywood, a game in which Campbell homered twice, he made his greatest impact  in the field. With Poly leading by a run in the fourth inning and two runners  on, Harry Marks launched a fly ball well over Campbell's head. Campbell turned  and sprinted. With no fence in North Hollywood's left field, he continued to  pursue what seemed an uncatchable ball.  </P> <P> His chase scattered a group of North Hollywood football players practicing deep  in the outfield and ended in an over-the-shoulder catch some 380 feet from home  plate.  </P> <P> Marks, halfway around the infield by then, simply stopped and threw his helmet  in disgust.  </P> <P> Campbell's words match his actions. This is a guy who, when asked whether he  wanted to bat with the bases loaded in a pressure situation, responded  quizzically: "Isn't that what we play for all our lives? To get up in that  situation?"  </P> <P> Such a competitive fire is engaging. And it is constant.  </P> <P> In the spring, Campbell trots out to left field and bats third for the team  ranked No. 4 in the region by The Times, a team unbeaten in conference play, a  team with a 22-3 overall record and a legitimate chance to win a City Section  4-A Division title.  </P> <P> In autumn, Campbell toils with a football tucked under his arm; he is a  two-time All-Pac-8 Conference running back who spent his junior season plowing  for 1,159 yards and 12 touchdowns. But he endured defeat after defeat for a  downtrodden Poly team that finished 1-8-1.  </P> <P> Behold the athletic life of Jonathan Campbell, in which winning and losing seem  to be dictated by the calendar.  </P> <P> In the fall after football games, Campbell admits, he and his teammates will  head to a local fast-food joint, eat a few burgers and, sadly, just go home.  </P> <P> But in the spring?  </P> <P> "It's great, it's great, it's great," Campbell said with a grin. "After the  game, I don't have to feel depressed or anything."  </P> <P> Depression has no place on the diamond during this bull-market year. Poly is  stacked with depth -- so much so that Campbell, for all his talents, does not  dominate the statistics.  </P> <P> Pitcher Eddie Castellanos boasts an 11-0 record, best in the region. Rodrigo  Dorame, a right fielder and pitcher, is batting .380 and has driven in a  team-high 26 runs. Second baseman Roy Lozano, an excellent defender, is batting  .338 with a team-high seven doubles. Senior shortstop and cleanup hitter Gabe  Chavez has knocked in 21 runs and is batting .319. Third baseman Marlon  McKinney is batting .354 with 17 RBIs.  </P> <P> "There's a total difference in confidence," Campbell said of the disparity  between programs. "We don't feel like a team could really beat us if we're at  our best. Whereas in football, we just don't have that confidence. We don't  just play on the football team. We worry too much about what we have to do."  </P> <P> For his part, Campbell is playing well in his first varsity baseball season. He  is batting .350, with 21 RBIs, second most on the team. Campbell leads the team  in runs scored with 27 and is second in stolen bases with 13. But his  contributions, if you listen to his coaches, rise above mere numbers.  </P> <P> "I'll take a dozen of him," Cord said. "If you have a dozen Jonathan Campbells  on your team. . . . Well, you wouldn't win 'em all, but you wouldn't lose  many."  </P> <P> In one early-season game that Poly was winning easily, Cord pulled his  starters. While most savored the respite, Campbell grabbed a helmet then raced  toward first base -- where he coached for the remainder of the game.  </P> <P> "He won't settle for anything less than maximum performance," football Coach  Fred Cuccia said. "And he doesn't know how good he can be. . . . After he ran  for 280-something (287) yards against Verdugo Hills, he kept telling the team,  'I'm nothing special. I'm just part of the team.' "  </P> <P> Team talk aside, Campbell relishes individual play. Which might explain his  preference in sports.  </P> <P> "In football, I guess, you can hide if you're not good," he said. "You can hide  and not do your job. But in baseball, you're right there in the open.  Everybody's looking at you and the pitcher just goes at you, and what you do  with it, you know, depends on you."  </P> <P> But Cuccia, a veteran coach who is in his second year at Poly, might have  started to resuscitate the football program. The spring football class at Poly  has an enrollment of 90 -- 70 more than last year. Cuccia credits part of the  upswing to the on-campus recruiting done by Campbell and his teammates.  </P> <P> "You have to give them a program where they're having fun and experiencing  success at the same time," Cuccia said. "Poly hasn't been able to do that in  the past, but we want to have our kids enjoy what they're doing and get almost  the same thing that Jerry has going in the baseball program."  </P> <P> Because McKinney, Dorame and Campbell are football players, Cuccia takes more  than a passing interest in the baseball program. Cuccia was in the dugout when  Poly's 12-game win streak ended in a 7-6 loss to Birmingham in the Holt-Goodman  tournament final.  </P> <P> Campbell had been doubled off third base in the final inning to kill a Poly  threat. After tearing off his jersey, Campbell sat in the dugout, alone, elbows  on knees, and stared off in the distance. No one dared approach him.  </P> <P> "I saw him after that game and he was just devastated," Cuccia said. "He's just  a tremendous competitor. That's what sets him apart from all the other kids at  Poly."  </P> <P> Witnessing that intensity also piqued Cuccia's interest on a personal level.  </P> <P> "I'm really looking forward to having him (next fall)," Cuccia said. "And you  tell the other schools out there that they can't have him. He's ours."  </P></p>

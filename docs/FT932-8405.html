			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television Male summer absenteeism strikes the nation today, oddly coinciding with the first one-day Cricket International between England and Australia (BBC1, 10.40am). This Morning (ITV, 10.35am) tries hard to beat off the cricket competition by offering something utterly new - Loyd Grossman on a gastronomic journey through France. The BBC still performs a public service. One of its more valuable offerings is Open Space (BBC2, 7.40pm), where members of the public use its facilities to make programmes. Tonight's is by Jill Wright, director of the National Library Campaign, fighting the decline in library funding. Eat Your Greens (Channel 4, 8.30pm) is a small-screen pleasure. An instructive food programme; beautifully filmed and edited; and presented by a very unsnobby cook, Sophie Grigson. But the joy of the day for London commuters like myself will be watching the first of a new series of Inside Story (BBC1, 9.30pm). It promises to go behind the scenes of British Rail and explain why things go so wrong. Bad Company (BBC2, 9pm) concludes the dramatisation of the Carl Bridgewater murder.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by R. Levin: ``Three Quarters of a Century Later: </F> Kaskad NPO and Siemens Resurrect Cooperation'']    [Text] Who would have thought that one of the world's  largest ``electronics'' firms today--Germany's Siemens--was the  forefather of the recently still supersecret Kaskad NPO  [Scientific-Production Association], which served for a long  time as the center for design of Soviet missile and space  systems and communications technology? Of course, the roots of  this story go back into the middle of the last century, when the  young engineers Karl Siemens and Johann Halske founded the Main  Telegraph Shop in Russia.    In those distant years, the Siemens-Halske Trading House did  many useful things for the Russian state--it laid the world's  first telegraph cable line between St. Petersburg and Kronstadt,  linked practically all of the country's major cities by  telegraph, and during the Crimean War of 1883-1856 it extended a  telegraph line from Moscow to Odessa, and from there to  Sevastopol, an object of fierce fighting. The list of  interesting facts connected with the activity of Siemens and  Halske in Russia also contains this: The first telephone  conversation between St. Petersburg and Malaya Vishera occurred  in November 1879 using telephone instruments equipped with a  signaling whistle, designed by these two German inventors.    Things began to go downhill for the Main Telegraph Shop  Joint-Stock Company in October 1917. Two years after the  revolution the joint-stock company was nationalized, the Germans  were run out, and a new name appeared on the sign--Elektrotest,  RSFSR Supreme Council of the National Economy, which the  enterprise possessed until its renaming in 1977 as the Kaskad  NPO. Work proceeded in the association under strict secrecy:  This is where they designed, introduced and serviced strategic  missile systems of all generations and powerful antimissile and  antispace systems, and created modern computer equipment,  communications apparatus and all kinds of other ``smart''  electronics. They say, by the way, that the NPO retained the  traditions of Siemens, inasmuch as it always had construction  and installation subdivisions occupied in the manufacture,  assembly and adjustment of telecommunications systems.    Conversion opened the road to searching for new forms of  activity, and to cooperation with foreign firms. It was then  that the ``fathers'' of Kaskad remembered their German  ``relative'' and decided to restore the old contacts. Thus last  year the Agreement on Providing Agency Services and on Wholesale  Trade was signed between the Kaskad NPO and Siemens, while just  this January a department for the sales and service of Hicom  institutional automatic telephone exchanges made by Siemens  appeared in the NPO.    This was all communicated at a press conference held in June  in Moscow's President Hotel by executives of Kaskad, the RF  Ministry of Communications and Siemens. From this day forward,  in addition to maintaining its ``classical'' profile, the NPO  will acquire a new one--it will become the official  representative of Siemens in Russia, and it will introduce  Hicom-100 communications equipment--small institutional  automatic telephone exchanges with a capacity of up to 64  numbers--into our communication networks. It will also  introduced Hicom-300 digital institutional exchanges, which make  up a modern TsSIS [not further identified] system making it  possible to transmit speech, data, facsimile and teletype  information, and are intended to connect from 30 to 10,000  subscribers. All of these exchanges are adapted to our networks,  and are certified by the RF Ministry of Communications.    Kaskad has already received more than 50 orders to install  Hicom systems, including from the communications departments of  presidential and government organizations, enterprises of  aviation and automotive industry, and a number of joint firms  and commercial organizations. In order to make development of  the new market more effective, to raise competitiveness and to  pursue a coordinated investment and technical policy, the  association established an international joint-stock company of  the same name.    Many who were present at the press conference wondered if  ``invasion'' of Kaskad by Siemens might damage our defense, in  behalf of which the NPO is still successfully working.  Resolutely rejecting this possibility, Russian Minister of  Communications V. B. Bulgak assured those present that such  cooperation will bring nothing but benefit. And when he went  into some generalities on the topic of imports of communications  equipment in the recent past, today and in the future, the  minister presented a number of interesting figures.    As it turns out, prior to the 1990s 65 percent of all  automatic telephone exchanges and 30 percent of cables laid in  the USSR were foreign-made, particularly in CEMA countries and  Yugoslavia. Just in the last 10 years 1,140 exchanges were  acquired from the former Yugoslavia. Today, Russia still  continues to purchase 45 percent of its communications equipment  on the basis of international credit, although according to V.  B. Bulgak the situation will change in a year or a year and a  half. Joint ventures established in our country during this time  will gear up their work to full capacity, and things that had  been acquired before from across the border will be produced for  the most part in Russia.    All right then, if Siemens EWSD automatic telephone  exchanges  are already being set up in Kiev, why not organize production of  the same Hicom exchanges in Moscow, let's say, with the  participation of Kaskad? Well, while such an idea is only food  for thought, Kaskad and Siemens are beginning to work together  once again, like in the times of the Telegraph Shop.</p>

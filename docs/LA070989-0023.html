			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT  </P> <P> It's been three years and several false starts, but a spokeswoman for producer  Dino De Laurentiis tells us that film maker Michael Cimino will be back to work  early this fall directing the remake of "The Desperate Hours," with Mickey  Rourke reprising the Humphrey Bogart role from the 1955 film.  </P> <P> The tense suspense drama was based on the Joseph Hayes play about an escaped  convict who holds a man and his family hostage. The latest adaptation, by  writers Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal, reunites producer, star and  director, who last teamed for "Year of the Dragon" (1984).  </P> <P> Cimino is currently scouting Dallas locations for the film, which is being  produced by Pathe Communications for distribution by Warner Bros. -- De  Laurentiis' first project since the demise of his financially beleaguered De  Laurentiis Entertainment Group.  </P> <P> Since making the little-seen "The Sicilian" in 1986, Cimino has been attached  to several stalled films, including the adaptation of Truman Capote's  "Hand-Carved Coffins"; "Michael Collins," the director's long-cherished project  on the legendary Irish rebel; and "Santa Ana Wind," a romantic thriller.  </P> <P> Despite Cimino's checkered career, the spokeswoman said, "Dino has nothing but  praise for Michael's work. . . . He considers him a brilliant talent and plans  to do several films with him."  </P> <P> Come late fall, the busy Rourke (currently in Rio, filming the steamy "Wild  Orchid") has the title role of "El Cordobes" for Five Star Productions,  scheduled to shoot in Spain. Rourke is preparing for the role of the  flamboyant, legendary matador under the tutelage of veteran matador Manuel  Benitez. Luis Valdez directs for producer-writer Simon Raphael Abehsera.

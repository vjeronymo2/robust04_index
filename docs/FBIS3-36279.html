			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Igor Krondo; from the "Military Courier" program] </F>   [Text] [Krondo] The first phase of Russia's motor vehicle  championship has taken place in Moscow Oblast's Bronnitsy. For  the first time in the history of motor vehicle sport there was a  display of military motor vehicles and technical servicing  facilities, mobile workshops, and heavy traction vehicles with  which the Russian Army is being equipped. Alongside the  well-known two-, three-, and four-axled Mustang-class KamAZ  trucks which won prizes in the 1992 Paris-Dakar Rally, new  vehicles were also on display. They included high all-terrain  capability wheeled and tracked GAZ-47 and GAZ-47-04 vehicles  designed to carry personnel and light arms. It is planned to  equip the mobile forces which are currently being formed with  these vehicles.    Heavy traction vehicles also demonstrated their  capabilities.  They can easily haul a tank or a strategic missile complex from  a battlefield, or out of crater, ravine, or bog. The pride of  our military motor vehicle industry is of course the Vityaz  range of double-unit tracked vehicles with a loading capacity of  10, 20, or 30 tonnes. Marshes, bogs, and quicksands are no  threat to them. They easily cope with muddy roads in spring and  fall and snowdrifts in winter, and are able to float across  rivers and lakes.    [N.A. Zazulin, chief of the Russian Defense Ministry Main  Motor Vehicle Directorate] I can claim with utmost confidence  that the Vityaz, which comes in the 10-, 20-, and 30-tonne  version, is unparalleled in the world. Swedes, Canadians, and  others have shown great interest in this equipment. Honestly,  these machines are unique.</p>

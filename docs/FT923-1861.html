			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Management: Nuts and bolts of giving power to the people Few modern management concepts have generated as much noise and confusion as the overworked term 'empowerment'. Some executives fear it will undermine their authority and even remove their jobs, while others see it as the only way their business will prosper, even survive, in the 1990s. One reason for the confusion is the word itself. In the US, it has been used for more than a century in political circles to describe the gaining of power, especially by minority groups. Over the past few years business has caught the habit, but has employed - and parroted - it far too loosely. Like much American business hyperbole, there is often less to empowerment in US companies than meets the eye or ear. Sometimes the word is used merely to dress up consultation - what David Bowen and Edward Lawler, two academics in the field, call 'suggestion involvement'. McDonald's, the fast food chain, uses this form of very limited 'empowerment'. A second, more real, type is what Bowen and Lawler call 'job involvement'. This entails extensive job redesign, so that employees use a variety of skills, often in teams. They have considerable freedom in deciding how to do the necessary work. Despite the increased empowerment that it brings, the job involvement approach does not change higher-level strategic decisions about organisation structure, power and the allocation of rewards. These remain senior management's responsibility. A third level is what the two academics call 'high involvement' - a form practised by Federal Express, the Herman Miller furniture company, and the redoubtable Johnsonville Sausage of Sheboygan, Wisconsin. A much-admired enterprise, its founder and chief executive, Ralph Stayer, has become one of the best-known evangelists of the US empowerment movement. (Sadly for fans of evocative company names, his was recently changed to Johnsonville Foods). With 'high involvement', under Bowen and Lawler's definition, employees become involved not just in how to do their jobs, or how effectively their team performs, but also in the whole organisation's performance. Virtually every aspect of the organisation is different from that of a control-orientated one. Information on all aspects of business performance is shared horizontally across the organisation, as well as up and down the (delayered) structure. Employees develop extensive skills in teamwork, problem solving and business operations. They participate in work-unit management decisions. There is profit sharing and employee ownership. Whether one agrees that all three levels warrant the term 'empowerment', it is vital to distinguish between them to understand what the term can mean. It is equally important to know which form suits different situations. A widely-quoted academic article by Bowen and Lawler earlier this year is helpful here.* It makes the vital point that there is no single approach which is ideal in every industry, company, function or situation. Like so many other things in management, the ideal degree and form of empowerment is contingent upon circumstances. The second reason for confusion over the concept is that the word is too often used without its mirror image: responsibility. This is not the fault of two of the people most responsible for the popularity of the concept, Tom Peters and Robert Waterman, who were co-authors a decade ago of the best-selling business book ever, In Search of Excellence. In subsequent, separate volumes in 1987, called respectively Thriving on Chaos and The Renewal Factor, they each rammed home that empowerment carries with it much greater responsibility, as well as the need for higher performance. Indeed, some American pundits and companies now prefer the term 'high performance' to those of either 'high involvement' or 'empowerment'. In France, the latter word is hardly ever used. 'The French call it 'responsibilisation'', says Paul Evans, professor of organisational behaviour at Insead, the European business school based south of Paris. Yet in German-speaking Switzerland and parts of Germany, 'empowerment' is gaining a foothold, as being preferable to the German equivalent 'Ermaechtigung'. A third problem is confusion between empowerment and delegation. 'Empowerment is not just a matter of pushing more responsibility down an organisation,' says Evans. 'It's stupid and crazy to do so to people who don't have the skills and competences to take control over their work.' Evans is echoed by Jack Furrer, director of management education at Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals multinational. 'All too often, delegation equals dumping,' he says. 'Sometimes it's more positive and consists of a balance between direction and autonomy. But it still usually lacks the element of support which empowerment involves.' A fourth problem is the obvious one, that power-conscious managers are put off by empowerment war stories such as the one at Johnsonville Sausage, where Stayer admits happily that he gave away much of his authority for the benefit of the company's motivation and performance. At Ciba-Geigy, however, reluctant managers have been told as part of the company's 'leadership and teamwork' programme that in new-style organisations, one does have to share power, although this does not mean surrendering it. 'People still need direction', says Furrer. 'Managers need to create an environment which suits both themselves and their employees.' Furrer, who subscribes to the theory of what is known as 'situational leadership', says that the relative balance required between direction, support and autonomy varies according to each person and circumstance. Another way of putting this is to say that, except in a few very democratic organisations, the empowerment of middle managers and other employees always needs to have boundaries. 'High performance groups are focused on relatively tight objectives and are measured accordingly,' says one top American human resources executive. 'They have fences around them and people know where they are.' That said, there is no getting away from the fact that the fundamental principle of empowerment is radically different from the traditional western one of 'command and control', in which bosses transfer their ideas into the hands of the workers. Instead, it rests on Konosuke Matsushita's much-quoted dictum** that the survival of companies today 'depends on the day-to-day mobilisation of every ounce of intelligence' within them. That implies a very different relationship than in the past between leaders and followers, managers and managed. But it also explains why full-steam empowerment programmes have developed a nasty habit in the US of hitting the organisational buffers after several years. That, in turn, is partly why it is far more effective for most companies to introduce empowerment as part and parcel of an 'organisational re-engineering' programme than for them to give it the limelight on its own. * Sloan Management Review Spring 1992 (from MIT).

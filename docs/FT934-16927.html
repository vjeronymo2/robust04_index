			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / People: Racing world goes turbo Lee Richardson is swapping one mode of transport for another in his drive up the career ladder. Currently a senior marketing executive with Hertz, the world's largest car rental and leasing organisation, Richardson, 36, has just been appointed marketing director of the British Horseracing Board. He joins the BHB on November 1. Richardson qualified as an engineer with General Motors in 1979 and joined Hertz in 1981. He was Hertz's European marketing manager for the company's continental Europe Leasing Division in 1986 and spent two years in Brussels. He returned to London and took over as marketing and sales director for the UK Rent A Car operation in 1990. Last year he was made director of market planning, covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Soon to finish his MBA from the University of Strathclyde, Richardson is a member of the Chartered Institute of Marketing. He says that as a life-long enthusiast for the turf he will be bringing a 'consumer's understanding for the product' and that his central task will be to 'develop a sustainable long-term marketing strategy for the Board'. The Board was set up this year to raise the profile of an industry which currently employs some 100,000 people in the UK. Betting turnover is about Pounds 6bn annually, and about 5m people go to the races each year. Its purpose is to secure the finances for the industry, attract more sponsorship and general ensure it becomes more commercially-minded. But Richardson believes the sport is perhaps in danger of failing to attract a younger group of consumers, and that is one important issue which he intends addressing by using marketing skills. 'This is a marketing job first and foremost,' says Richardson, ready for the off.</p>

Campbell's total sales declined by 1 per cent, to Dollars 1.75bn, while earnings per share increased in line with net profits, to 64 cents. The company said operating profits from North America were up by 18 per cent to Dollars 261.1m, with sales from continuing businesses rising by 3 per cent. Soup volumes improved by 6 per cent, helped partly by the acquisition of a noodle manufacturer and some new lines. In the biscuit and bakery division, operating profits declined by 5 per cent to Dollars 24.9m, while marketing expenditure increased in a fiercely competitive sector. At Campbell International, profits were flat at Dollars 14.2m, although operating margins improved. Campbell operating profits in the second quarter were 15 per cent higher at Dollars 300.2m.</p>

Answering questions posed by journalists yesterday, Qammuh  said the stability of the dinar inside and outside Jordan is  guaranteed by the foreign currency cover.    He expressed the hope that coordination and cooperation in  all fields will continue between Jordan and the Palestinian  entity in the future.    Qammuh held a news conference at the Customs Department in  which he explained all aspects of the implementation of the  sales tax and its impact on the Jordanian economy and citizens.</p>

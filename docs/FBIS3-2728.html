			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Public figures at  various levels here today voiced their strong criticisms  following Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's tabling of his  remaining political reform package to the Legislative Council on  Wednesday [9 March].    They saw the action taken by the British Hong Kong  authorities as a further step to deliberately sabotage the  Sino-British cooperation over the Hong Kong issue. They urged  local residents to make concerted efforts with the Chinese side  to ensure a smooth transition of the territory in 1997.    Chris Patten's remaining political reform package regarding  the 1994-1995 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong was tabled to  the Legislative Council yesterday afternoon. The first part of  his reform bill was introduced last December.    Both parts of Chris Patten's so-called democracy reform bill  were tabled under the circumstance where no agreement was  reached between China and Britain despite the fact that the  Chinese side had made its utmost efforts in the past 17 rounds  of the Sino-British talks over the Hong Kong issue.    The Chinese side has repeatedly warned that any unilateral  action taken by the British side in this aspect before an  agreement is reached between the two sides is in gross violation  of the joint declaration, the Basic Law as well as the  agreements and understandings reached between the two countries.    Wong Siu-yee, a local member of the Urban Council, said that  the real intention of the British side by unilaterally tabling  Patten's reform bill was to continue the British influence over  the territory, which it took away from China by armed forces in  the late 19th century, after it is returned to China in 1997.    Another local public figure, Rita Fan, said that the British  side claimed, on the one hand, that the door for the  Sino-British talks was open, while, on the other hand, it had  slammed the door by taking unilateral actions.    Fan, a female member of the Preliminary Working Committee,  said that one can not entirely depend on the cooperation of the  British side in the other fields as Britain has taken an  uncooperative attitude towards the political issues.    Wong Siu-lun, a professor from the Sociology Department of  Hong Kong University, said that under the situation in which the  basis of the Sino-British cooperation over the Hong Kong issue  has been ruined by the British side, the Chinese side should  work closely with the local residents and be prepared for the  long-term development of the future special administrative  region.</p>

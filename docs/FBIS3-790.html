			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Election campaigners of the Democratic Party [DP]  youth in the Western Cape got their second rebuff this afternoon  when they were forced to leave the Good Hope College of  Education campus in Khayelitsha. A vociferous group of ANC  [African National Congress] supporters blocked their entry to  the college building. The DP leader in the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region, Mr. Tony Leon, held an  impromptu meeting with the students representative council and  the college administration. The DP then decided to withdraw  from the campus. Mr. Leon said their being barred from both the  Good Hope College and the Peninsula Technikon in Belville  earlier today made a mockery of the Electoral Act.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOLD OFF BY A GREEDY FEW, TO OUR VAST HARM  </P> <P> The headlines proclaim Sony's agreement to purchase Columbia Pictures. But  earlier this month a more historic moment in the continuing saga of American  decline passed almost unnoticed by media and politicians alike: For the first  time since the '50s, foreign investors earned more from their investments in  the United States than our citizens derived from their enterprises abroad. And  this gap will widen as the foreign takeover of American business continues on  its grim, inexorable course.  </P> <P> Thus, the "trade deficit" will now be augmented by a "profit deficit" to swell  the flow of American income and jobs to other countries. By the time we reach  the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor in 1991, our "partners" will have achieved  with money what our "enemies" could not do with weapons -- substantial control  over the lives and destinies of the American people.  </P> <P> The Japanese and Europeans are buying America. Motivated by shortsighted greed  and a softening of the American spirit, we are willing sellers.  </P> <P> In the past week, Japanese companies bought control of one of America's leading  business lenders and Sony's deal to purchase one of our largest media and  entertainment conglomerates came to fruition. In the short run, a handful of  owners and top executives make a great deal of money from their sellout of  American enterprises. In the longer run, all of us will be losers, as the  profits that once went to enrich the citizens of this country go instead to  Tokyo or Bonn or London.  </P> <P> These buyouts, unlike investment in manufacturing, do nothing to create wealth  for America. We simply substitute foreign capital for American. The  substitution does not add to our income or production. It will do the opposite  by transferring the benefits of American enterprise to others. They will get  richer while we become a poorer country.  </P> <P> Nor can the cost be measured in dollars alone. Financial institutions control  the direction of investment, are influential in deciding what we build, the  direction in which business expands. The so-called entertainment industry --  which includes television and even publishing -- helps shape American values  and influences our attitudes toward ourselves and the world. By allowing  foreign control over such powerful forces, we are allowing crucial decisions  about the country's future to fall into the hands of foreign enterprises and  the governments that encourage and often subsidize their depredations.  </P> <P> This rapidly accelerating trend must not be allowed to continue. The future of  this nation cannot be determined in the boardrooms of Tokyo and Europe; their  occupants have no stake in America and do not share its heritage or its  aspirations. To them we must appear a succulent plate from which the choicest  morsels can be plucked. The American economy -- the goose that lays the golden  egg -- is being quietly dismembered and shipped across the ocean to enrich  other lands.  </P> <P> I find it hard to contain my indignation that we are permitting the foundation  of our prosperity to fall into the hands of those who care nothing about our  difficulties or the fair expectations and dreams of our people.  </P> <P> And it is our own fault. The Japanese and others are simply behaving as  old-fashioned predatory capitalists are supposed to behave. They are taking  what they can while the pickings are good. It is we, the Americans, who are  letting this happen. A handful of directors and managers -- once regarded as  trustees and engines of American well-being -- pocket their immense profits and  retire to their mansions and yachts. Our political leaders watch with silent  acquiescence, betraying their obligations to the people they serve and to the  generations that will follow.  </P> <P> There is another foreseeable, virtually inevitable consequence of this foreign  buyout of America. Our political financing laws are an irresistible invitation  to corruption. They have magnified the influence of the wealthy and powerful at  every level of government. Now, using their ownership of American enterprise as  a conduit, foreign interests will benefit from this corrupting process. By  helping finance political campaigns they will gain increased power to protect  themselves from adverse political action. Our representatives, even our  President, will have a constituency located beyond our borders.  </P> <P> It is important to realize that none of this is required by some law of nature  or even Adam Smith. We have the power to protect ourselves. The question is  whether the spiritual fabric of America has been too weakened -- by greed and  corruption, by a widespread sense of helplessness -- to mount a resistance.  </P> <P> At a minimum, all political activity by foreign-controlled companies and those  who work for them should be prohibited. But we can go much further. Foreign  control of American airlines is already prohibited and the amount of foreign  investment seriously limited. The same kind of constraints can be applied to  other sectors of the economy, especially those that constitute the framework of  economic and political activity, such as financial institutions, media,  transportation. The tax system could be revised to discourage sellouts to  foreign interests.  </P> <P> If we don't act, and soon, if we choose to stand by as if we were helpless,  then we will be accomplices in our own defeat -- the defeat of the powerful  dream that is America.  </P></p>

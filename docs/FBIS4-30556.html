			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Atsuki Maeyama] </F>   [Text] Rangoon, 21 June -- David Abel, Burma's minister of  national planning and economic development, told a Keidanren  [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations] economic mission  (headed by Marubeni Corp. Chairman Kazuo Haruna) that the  Burmese Government plans to enact "a privatization law" to  promote a shift toward a market-oriented economy and facilitate  foreign capital inflow. The Keidanren mission is currently  visiting Burma. The minister also said the government will take  measures to enable foreign firms to acquire state-run  corporations.    The Burmese Government has said if a privatization law is  enacted, state-run corporations will be able to establish joint  companies with foreign firms in various industries, and foreign  firms will be able to have capital stakes in state-run  corporations. The country has already enacted a foreign  investment law and a domestic investment law. However, it has  not had a comprehensive law on joint ventures in Burma.    The Keidanren mission also met with Khin Nyunt, first  secretary of the State Law and Order Restoration Council  (SLORC). In the meeting, Nyun called on Japan to actively  invest in Burma's agricultural and forestry industries, and in  programs to exploit natural resources. He also asked Japanese  companies to bear the costs for constructing hotels for the sake  of Burma's tourist development.    In response, Haruna first stressed the need for Burma to  further promote democratization, and said: "Although the  Japanese Government's Official Development Assistance (ODA) to  Burma has virtually been suspended (except for humanitarian  purposes), the private sector will work to promote economic  cooperation, while observing developments in your country."</p>

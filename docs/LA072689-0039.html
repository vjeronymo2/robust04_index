			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A House subcommittee granted a postponement until Sept. 15 for a second  appearance by Samuel R. Pierce Jr., former secretary of the Department of  Housing and Urban Development. He was previously scheduled to appear Aug. 4.  Pierce requested a delay on grounds that he was having difficulty in retaining  an attorney to accompany him to a hearing of the House Government Operations  subcommittee on employment and housing, which has been investigating political  favoritism and mismanagement at HUD during his tenure. The postponement was  granted by Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), subcommittee chairman.  </P></p>

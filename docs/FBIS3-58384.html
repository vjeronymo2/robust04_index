			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Philippe Marcovici editorial: "Bosnia: NATO's </F> Gesticulations"]    [Text] Under pressure from Paris, supported by several of  its European allies, Bill Clinton was yesterday forced to  brandish a threatening stick at the Bosnian Serbs. Against his  will. The U.S. President did not even want the Bosnian question  to be included on the agenda of the NATO summit in Brussels.  What is more: Addressing young Europeans in the Belgian capital  on Sunday evening [9 January], he did not even deign to mention  the word Bosnia in his speech. He eventually had to do so, on  pain of opening up a gulf in the alliance, which he wanted to  avoid on his first European visit.    Amid the wholesale slaughter in Sarajevo, French diplomacy  has therefore scored a point by forcing the United States to  abandon its extremely cautious silence. Francois Mitterrand  undoubtedly wanted to attribute this point to himself by making  belligerent statements which contrast strangely with what he was  saying about the former Yugoslavia not so long ago. Everybody  can change, including Mitterrand and Clinton. However, there is  reason to wonder about the scope of a change, which essentially  consists of citing UN Resolution No. 836 on the "security areas"  adopted last June. And we know what has happened since then.    UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who addressed the  National Assembly Foreign Affairs Commission in Paris yesterday,  took pleasure in reaffirming this. He reminded the states that  it is they who could be blamed for refusing to use force.  Speeches will not change anything, added the UN secretary  general, who was probably not in a charitable mood.    In Brussels, Clinton and Mitterrand chorused that talking  served no purpose if action did not follow. They will not be  criticized for saying that. Because they have already talked  too much, they have contributed -- especially the Americans --  to sustaining the Bosnian conflagration rather than  extinguishing it. By allowing the unfortunate President  Izetbegovic to believe that a military intervention was  imminent, they encouraged him to reject all peace plans in  succession, although the latest ones were consistent with the  demands previously formulated by the Muslim side. The same  causes are now likely to produce the same effects....    We will see what will come of the Brussels war drums. How  can we predict the future after almost two years of almost daily  contradictions, denials, and about-faces? The United Nations,  NATO, and Europe have exhausted their credibility in it. They  have cried wolf one time too many....</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Lukoil seeks western investors Lukoil, Russia's biggest oil producer, plans to float shares on western stock exchanges once domestic privatisation is completed next year, the company vice-president, Mr Vladislav Bazhenov, said yesterday. The company has discussed prospects for floating shares in New York or London with exchange officials and Mr Bazhenov said foreign investors had shown interest. However, foreign listings might be a long way off as the company's books would probably have to be examined by an international auditing firm.</p>

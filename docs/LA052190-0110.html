			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KCET'S 14 EMMYS LEADS LOS ANGELES AREA AWARDS  </P> <P> KCET Channel 28, with strong support from a dance program, stepped ahead of the  competition at the 42nd annual Los Angeles Area Emmy Awards presented Saturday  by the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences.  </P> <P> The public television station captured 14 Emmys to lead the field. It was  boosted by "ISO Dance Theatre," which won five statuettes, including honors for  best performers and entertainment programming.  </P> <P> Other multiple winners at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium show for KCET were the  series "Take Five: Arts and Culture" with three awards and "By the Year 2000"  with two.  </P> <P> KCBS Channel 2 and KABC Channel 7 earned 10 Emmys apiece, while KNBC took the  prize for best regularly scheduled daily news program among its eight trophies.  </P> <P> The KCBS news department accounted for six Emmys with wins in the categories of  spot news ("San Bernardino Pipeline Explosion"), news writers and investigative  reporting ("Gang God-fathers"), mini-documentaries ("Children Are Dying"), live  coverage of an unscheduled news event ("Wind Storms"), and camera crew -- hard  news breaking story ("Emergency Rooms").  </P> <P> KABC newscasts picked up five Emmys as the station tied KCBS for live coverage  of an unscheduled news event ("Earthquake Remote -- Santa Cruz") and also won  for instructional series ("Drugbusters"), commentary by Bill Press, film/tape  editors of hard news programs ("Puppy Mills") and film/tape editors of news  features ("Thrill Rides").  </P> <P> Two of four Emmys bestowed on KABC's "Eye on L.A." were for information segment  ("Guns") and special class -- program area.  </P> <P> Besides the best daily newscast award, KNBC's news department won for feature  reporting ("Mono Lake"), mini-documentaries ("Red Dawn") -- in a tie with KCBS  -- and camera crew -- news feature ("Town 4 cSale"). "Fred Roggin's Sports Bowl  '89" was named best sports special and his "Sunday Night Sports" segment titled  "Morganna" was an unlikely victor in the category of sports reporting.  </P> <P> On accepting his Emmy for the lighthearted feature about Morganna Roberts, the  buxom blond notorious for kissing professional athletes, straight-faced  producer Jeff Hoffman said, "Listen closely -- you'll be able to hear the sound  of hell freezing over."  </P> <P> Rounding out the evening's winners were KTLA with five awards, KCAL with four,  KTTV with two and KLCS and Continental Cable with one each.  </P> <P> Ted Meyers, the versatile KCAL broadcaster whose 56-year career began with  radio station KFAC in 1944, received the prestigious Governors Award.  </P> <P> Following is a complete list of winners:  </P> <P> Short Promo/PSA: "We Play the Lakers," KCAL.  </P> <P> Crime/Social Issues: "Taking Back the Streets" ("California Stories"), KCET.  </P> <P> Hosts/Moderators, Series: Lou Fant, Herb Larson, "Off Hand," KCAL.  </P> <P> Live Sports Coverage: "Lakers Basketball," KCAL.  </P> <P> Spot News: "San Bernardino Pipeline Explosion," Channel 2 News, KCBS.  </P> <P> Feature Reporting: David Garcia, "Mono Lake," Channel 4 News at 5, KNBC.  </P> <P> Children/Youth Series: "Teen Talk," KCAL.  </P> <P> News Writers: Chris Blatchford, "Gang Godfathers," Channel 2 News at 5, KCBS.  </P> <P> Film/Tape Editors of Hard-News Programs: Jim Eichenberger, "Puppy Mills,"  Eyewitness News, KABC.  </P> <P> Creative Technical Crafts: "Out of the Dumps" ("By the Year 2000"), KCET.  </P> <P> Education Special: "Never the Same," KCBS.  </P> <P> Sports Special: "Fred Roggin's Sports Bowl '89," KNBC.  </P> <P> Film/Tape Editors of News Features: Jim Eichenberger, "Thrill Rides," KABC.  </P> <P> Special Events: "Tournament of Roses Parade," KTTV.  </P> <P> Technical Direction: "ISO Dance Theatre," KCET.  </P> <P> Children/Youth Special: "Teens With a Mission," KCBS.  </P> <P> Feature Segment: "Doumani House" ("Take Five: Arts &amp; Culture"), KCET; "Joe  Frank: Radio Storyteller ("Take Five: Arts &amp; Culture"), KCET.  </P> <P> Sound: "A Musical Encounter in Los Angeles, the String Show," KLCS.  </P> <P> Mini-Docs: "Children Are Dying," Channel 2 News at 5, KCBS; "Red Dawn," Channel  4 News at 5, KNBC.  </P> <P> Sports Series: "The John Robinson Show," KCBS.  </P> <P> Live Coverage of an Unscheduled News Event: "Earthquake Remote -- Santa Cruz,"  Eyewitness News, KABC; "Wind Storms," Channel 2 News, KCBS.  </P> <P> Film/Tape Editors of Non-News Programs: Mary Ann Benson, Michael Gross,  "Swimsuits '89" ("Eye on L.A."), KABC.  </P> <P> Informational Series: "Health Fax," KNBC.  </P> <P> Public Affairs Series (Remote): "Fight Back!

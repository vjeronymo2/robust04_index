			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRES GO TO BULLPEN;  </P> <P> AS DAVIS, TEAM'S ACE RELIEVER, PONDERS FREE AGENT MARKET, CHICAGO LAW FIRM IS  BROUGHT IN TO MAKE A PITCH AS THE STOPPER  </P> <P> The Padres, in an attempt to re-sign pitcher Mark Davis, preferably before he  files for free agency, have enlisted a Chicago law firm to assist in the  negotiations.  </P> <P> Fred Lane, of the law firm Sonnenschein, Carlin, Math and Rosenthal, has been  retained by the Padres to help handle the negotiations with Beth Benes, general  counsel of the Padres. Benes, the personal counsel of owner Joan Kroc, also is  on the Padres' board of directors.  </P> <P> Padre President Dick Freeman said neither he nor Tony Siegle, vice  president/personnel, will participate in negotiations.  </P> <P> Davis, who saved a franchise-record 44 games this season, two fewer than the  major-league record of 46 set by Dave Righetti of the New York Yankees in 1986,  is eligible to file for free agency at the end of this month.  </P> <P> He earned $600,000 this season after making $500,000 in 1988. With his two-year  contract expired, Davis is expected to seek a minimum of $6 million over three  years.  </P> <P> Davis asked for a two-year contract for $2.3 million this spring but was turned  down.  </P> <P> Davis, 28, has until 15 days after the conclusion of the World Series to file  for free agency. His agent, Alan Hendricks, said that they have yet to  negotiate with the Padres since the season ended Sunday but that he expects to  resume talks by this weekend.  </P> <P> The Padres have one other player -- outfielder Carmelo Martinez -- who is  eligible for free agency but have decided that they will not attempt to re-sign  him. Infielder Tim Flannery was eligible for free agency but retired two days  before the end of the season.  </P> <P> The Padres have yet to decide whether they will bid for any other potential  free agents, Freeman said, and will arrive at a decision only when the filings  are complete.  </P> <P> Even though the final numbers are not in, the Padres are believed to have made  a profit once again for the 1989 season. They sold 2,286,795 tickets, Freeman  said, the second-largest total in franchise history, next to the 2.6 million  sold in 1985.  </P></p>

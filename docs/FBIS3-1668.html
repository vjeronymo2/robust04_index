			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["CHINA DAILY commentary": "Erroneous Steps"] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong's Legislative Council (Legco) on Thursday  passed the partial political reform bill proposed by Chris  Patten. Elated by his initial "easy success," the governor  quickly announced that he would put more parts of the electoral  reform package before Legco for deliberation.    This indicates that the British Government is bent on moving  further away from the accords concerning Hong Kong it had  formerly reached with China.    The Chinese Government has reacted to the erroneous steps  taken by the British side by declaring that any system forged  under the Patten plan, including Legco itself, will come to an  end when China recovers sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. And  Hong Kong's political structure will be decided by the Chinese  National People's Congress in line with the Basic Law.    This is a just and appropriate stand that we, like all our  fellow countrymen, with due sense of national dignity, voice  full support. [sentence as published]    The British have been vociferous that they only mean to meet  the basic political demands of the Hong Kong residents, as if  they were truly the champions of democracy.    But this can only incur the scorn and derision of anyone who  knows anything of the British colonialists track record over the  last two centuries.    The British have been in Hong Kong for more than 150 years  but have they ever treated the Chinese people there as their  equals? Why is it only now when they are being forced to quit  that they begin to show "deep concern" for the democracy of Hong  Kong? Are they really sincere or do they have ulterior motives?  If the die-hard colonialists are daydreaming of playing tricks  to obtain de facto political and economic control of Hong Kong  after 1997, they should be told that their dream will never come  true.    In the face of the unco-operative attitude of the British  Government, the Chinese side has affirmed more than once that it  will ensure a smooth transition for Hong Kong and continued  prosperity for the area. China can be expected to be as good as  its word.    However, Britain's hypocritical actions over Hong Kong's  future will inevitably have undesirable effects on Hong Kong and  its people. The British side must bear all the responsibility  for any adverse consequences which arise from its action.    If the British do care about the residents of Hong Kong as  they claim to, they should change track and mend their ways.</p>

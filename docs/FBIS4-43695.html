			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Gnutti Unveils Industry Ministry </F> Decentralisation"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 15 -- Industry Minister Vito  Gnutti today unveiled plans to bring ministerial services closer  to its users, especially the small and medium firms that are  Italy's industrial backbone.    The essence of the plan is decentralisation, a concept close  to the heart of a Northern Leaguer like Gnutti. A user-friendly  network of outlets will be set up nationwide, providing  businessmen with the information they often complain is slow in  coming from central offices in Rome, on tax breaks, funding, law  changes, and work opportunities.    For the preparatory period, Gnutti said a six-month  extension  would be necessary for staff seconded into the Industry Ministry  from other departments including the now-defunct southern  development agency. After that, staff will be taken on to man  the new outlying offices.    Boosting small and medium-sized industry is a key goal of  the  new-look ministry, Gnutti told the press. His targets include:  stepping up relations with the anti-trust authority; enhancing  protection for the consumer; transferring technology to small  and medium firms; seeking out new markets; boosting funding to  smaller firms; fostering broader share ownership; and pressing  on with ministry re-organisation.    On privatisations, Gnutti confirmed the government's  intention to press ahead with the disposals of INA [National  Insurance Institute], ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation],  ENEL [National Electric Power Board]. On EFIM [Manufacturing  Industry Holding and Financial Company], he recalled that the  liquidation deadline is January 25, and revealed that problems  in the armaments, rail and aluminium sectors had emerged from  talks with liquidator Alberto Predieri.</p>

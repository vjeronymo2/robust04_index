			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Swedish central bank follows the EC trend SWEDEN'S central bank, the Riksbank, yesterday cut Sweden's key marginal lending rate by 0.25 per cent to 9.0 per cent, the third reduction in interest rates in a month. The latest cut means that the marginal rate is now 3.5 percentage points below its level last November when the krona was floated, The Riksbank said the cut was justified by the general downward trend of interest rates in other west European countries. The central bank added that there was also reduced uncertainty over the outcome of Sweden's annual round of wage negotiations, following a settlement agreed between employers and engineering unions on Monday. It noted that previous cuts had been well received by the financial markets.</p>

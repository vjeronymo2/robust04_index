			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Chemicals 29% ahead Yorkshire Chemicals, the dyes and speciality chemicals company, pushed pre-tax profits up by 29 per cent from Pounds 10.1m to a record Pounds 13m in 1993. However, the shares ended 11p lower at 459p yesterday after Mr Phillip Lowe, the chairman, warned that market conditions were unlikely to improve in 1994. But he predicted that the company 'will continue to make progress'. 'Last year was tougher than we anticipated and I do not expect to see any general improvement until towards the end of 1994.' In particular, Mr Lowe is sceptical about the improvement in the UK economy. He added, however, that the company's important markets in America and Australia were 'set fair' and it was currently 'very busy across the field'. Turnover rose by 14 per cent to Pounds 112m despite an average reduction in prices of an estimated 4 per cent. About 90 per cent of the company's sales are overseas and Mr Lowe said that of last year's Pounds 3m profits increase about Pounds 1m was due to exchange rate movements. A further Pounds 1m was the interest benefit from last February's Pounds 24.3m rights issue. The best performance came from Australia where operating profits rose by more than Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.2m on sales up a third to Pounds 22m. Capital spending rose from Pounds 10m to Pounds 13.6m in 1993 and is expected to remain at that level in the current year. Earnings per share on the enlarged equity rose by 18 per cent to 21.1p. The dividend is lifted 6 per cent to 8.1p (7.65p). COMMENT There will be precious few chemical companies reporting record figures for 1993 so the market's response to Yorkshire's results looked slightly grudging. True, the chairman was gloomy about the market outlook. But then Yorkshire has never let economic problems get it down. Over the last few years it has generated very strong growth in Australia while the economy has been flat on its back. That growth came mainly from expansion into new pigment markets, a process which has a long way to go in other countries, while Yorkshire has still barely scratched the surface of the huge US market. With current exchange rates still helpful profits should reach Pounds 15.3m this year for earnings growth of about 12 per cent. But after a good run the shares are now on 19 times prospective earnings and are due a pause for breath.</p>

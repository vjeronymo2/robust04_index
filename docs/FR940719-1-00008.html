			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The committee reports that cherry size and quality are important to buyers. Consistency and dependability are equally important. Shipments of immature, low quality, under-sized Rainier cherries in recent seasons have resulted in disappointment by buyers and consumers. This reduces repeat purchases, and results in declines in prices and overall sales volumes. The general consensus of the industry is that some mandatory quality standards are needed to ensure buyer confidence. Voluntary standards have been unsuccessful.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cherry size is related to maturity and other quality factors. That is, larger sized cherries tend to be sweeter and of higher overall quality. This is supported by prices received for different sizes of Bing cherries. Market News data show that f.o.b. prices for 12 row sized Bings (54/64 inch diameter) averaged about $15.00 per carton in mid-June 1992. At the same time, 101/2 row sized (1 inch diameter) Bings were selling for about $25.00 per carton. This price relationship held steady throughout the season. Further, the committee has conducted research that shows that larger sizes correlate with higher maturity levels, and that larger sizes are preferred by cherry consumers. While research results and prices by size specifically for Rainier variety cherries are currently unavailable, industry consensus is that the same relationships are true for Rainier cherries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Washington cherry industry promotes the sale of Rainier through the Washington State Fruit Commission (WSFC), a State research and promotion program funded by industry assessments. The WSFC publicizes the current voluntary 1-inch minimum size standard for Rainier variety cherries in its promotion efforts. The WSFC has reported that it receives buyer complaints when such standards are not upheld. For example, three large retail chains cancelled all of their in-store promotions of Rainiers planned for the 1993 season due to the receipt of small, immature Rainier cherries early in the season. Thus, the industry believes it needs to establish minimum size and maturity standards to protect its investment in promoting the crop.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The general consensus of the Washington cherry industry is that the shipment of poor quality Rainier cherries is disrupting the marketplace and that some minimum quality standards are needed to maintain the Rainier cherry market. However, some disagreement was expressed at the committee meeting as to precisely what those minimum standards should be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some questioned, for example, the 101/2 row size requirement initially recommended by the committee, saying that this requirement would result in too many cherries being diverted to processors (an outlet exempt from regulation). Others stated that the smaller 11 row cherries have adequate sugar content. Still others opposed any size requirement, believing that other criteria (e.g., maturity levels) are more important than size and that size bears no relationship to those criteria. Additionally, concern was expressed that producers at higher elevations would be more adversely impacted than other producers by a minimum size requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In regards to this last concern, the committee concluded that producers at higher elevations should not be adversely impacted by the 11 row minimum size regulation, since these producers have demonstrated the ability to produce other varieties at acceptable sizes (e.g., Bing cherries). Further, a number of producers who farm at higher elevations attended the meeting, and stated that they would not have a problem meeting the proposed minimum size requirement, and that proper cultural practices (including pruning) would ensure that other producers achieve appropriate sizing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an attempt to reach an industry compromise, the committee rescinded its December recommendation to establish a minimum size requirement for Rainier cherries at 101/2 row size. It recommended instead a lower minimum size requirement of 11 row, coupled with a maturity requirement of at least 17 per cent soluble solids. This recommendation is considered to be conservative, in that most handlers in the Washington cherry industry pack to higher standards. The committee intends to conduct research during the 1994 and subsequent seasons to determine whether further refinements in Rainier variety cherry standards are needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule proposes adding a new provision to &sect;923.322, Washington Cherry Regulation 22, to establish a minimum size requirement of 61/64 inch in diameter for Rainier variety cherries, which corresponds to the 11 row size. To provide for variances in packing, a tolerance of 10 percent would be provided for undersized Rainier cherries. Further, the regulation would provide that not more than 5 percent of the Rainier cherries in any lot could be less than 57/64 inch in diameter, which is 111/2 row size, one size lower than the 11 row size. These tolerances are comparable to those in effect for other Washington cherry varieties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 923.322 would also be revised by adding a new section to require that any lot of Rainier cherries would have to contain a minimum of 17 percent soluble solids. The percentage of soluble solids would be determined by using a refractometer to measure the sugar level in a composite sample of cherries. This maturity test would be taken at the time of packing or just prior to shipment, at the option of the handler.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

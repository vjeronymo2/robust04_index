			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: NO ZOE, BUT LOTS OF COCO  </P> <P> One of the treats within "New York Stories," the new three-part movie about Big  Apple life by Martin Scorsese, Francis Coppola and Woody Allen, is the Chanel  fashion parade -- scaled down to kid size -- in Coppola's segment, "Life  Without Zoe." It turns out that 17-year-old Sofia Coppola, who co-scripted with  her famous father, worked summers at the Chanel atelier in Paris, according to  a Chanel spokeswoman in New York. The film, about a poor little rich girl who  is loco for Coco, is awash in berets, bijoux, bags -- even an enormous perfume  bottle -- from the East 57th Street boutique, the source tells us, but the  clothing is all from Paris. "Of course, there is no children's wear within the  Chanel collection," she adds, speculating that Big Apple teens of means  probably do mix "real Chanel -- in small sizes -- with other things." (The  12-year-old protagonist combines a houndstooth hat and jacket with torn jeans.)  And if it's not enough for Chanel worshipers to spot signature buttons and  bows, there is a cameo by Chanel No. 5 spokeswoman Carole Bouquet, who plays a  princess.  </P> <P> Not-So-Secret Service  </P> <P> Since returning to California, Nancy Reagan has had more time to have her skin  pampered at the Aida Grey Institut de Beaute in Beverly Hills. But nothing's  changed about the tight security measures that still accompany the former First  Lady on her every visit. According to Grey, Reagan's been in twice since her  husband left office, and both times, Secret Service agents arrived to check out  the salon before her arrival. And three agents remained with Reagan at the  salon during her treatments, she says, noting that the same procedures were  followed when Reagan visited during the preceding eight years. While Grey  clearly enjoys seeing more of her famous client, she's making no secret of the  fact that she'd also love to have Barbara Bush stop in so she could create a  "natural, translucent look" for the current First Lady to accent her "quiet  elegance."  </P> <P> Sixties Socks  </P> <P> E. G. Smith's Eric Smith was one of the first to get his foot in the door of  the '60s revival in fashion. It was three years ago that the sock designer came  out with his tie-dyed foot gear. Now he's added two more oh-so-'60s looks to  his line -- one pair of socks printed with "Love" and another with those famous  smile faces (which are also the trademark of the current Acid House music craze  in London). Smith has been spreading his message by sending out heart-shaped  greeting cards with socks that have "Love More, love Eric" written on the  soles. The smile-face version reads "Have a Nice Sock." Smith's neo-hippie  hosiery retails for about $8.50 at Bullock's.  </P> <P> It's a Goofy Business  </P> <P> Tina Cassaday, owner of the Beverly Hills' hair salon of the same name, seems  to travel with a walking advertisement. She was celebrating her birthday at  Disneyland recently with her 7-year-old-son, Justin, she tells Listen, when the  pair was spotted by one of her clients, Miko Brando, son of Marlon. According  to Cassaday, Brando liked Justin's layered hair style so much, he made his next  appointment on the spot. As they sing at Disneyland: "It's a small world, after  all."  </P> <P> Wonder Wardrobe  </P> <P> We had to do a double-take when we spotted a sophisticated-looking 13-year-old  in a body-hugging, polka-dot Guess? suit and huge hoop earrings recently in the  foyer of the Leo S. Bing Theater at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The  willowy brunette, whose long hair was pulled up in a high, knotted ponytail,  was whispering to a slightly older blond boy dressed in black with lizard-skin  boots. The two were Danica McKellar and Jason Hervey, known to "Wonder Years"  viewers as the winsome Winnie Cooper and junior-high tough guy Wayne Arnold. On  the hit ABC show, set in '68-'69, the youngsters frequently wear bell bottoms  and tie dyes -- truly vintage looks for actors born in the mid-'70s. McKellar  and Hervey were at a Museum of Broadcasting presentation on their Emmy-winning  sitcom, after which a show staffer confided that "the kids ask if people really  wore those things in the '60s. But some of the adult actors could just walk  right in in their own clothes."  </P> <P> Son's Red Letter Day  </P> <P> Another Hayman has entered the fashion fray. Robert, 30-year-old son of Rodeo  Drive retailer, parfumeur and Giorgio co-creator Fred Hayman, has become a  clothing manufacturer. In December, he introduced Red Square Wear, a unisex  clothing concept incorporating Soviet-inspired prints, such as a "double nyet"  pattern, a "little red man" motif and a sexy-woman design entitled "babushka."  Vanna White has worn the shirt that says "I love you" in Russian. "We're not a  political company, and we're not a peace movement," explains Hayman, who says  he merely has a fascination for Soviet imagery. Dad was initially skeptical,  the younger Hayman admits. However, he must be impressed now. In addition to  being carried at stores like Theodore, Fred Segal, Ron Ross and Nordstrom, the  line is available at Fred Hayman Beverly Hills.  </P></p>

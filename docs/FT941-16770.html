			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Reformers set for opposition role in Russia Russia's leading reformers believe they are unlikely to survive as members of the country's next government in the face of a surge in power of conservative forces. Pro-market parties did badly in the parliamentary elections last month at the hands of nationalist and communist groups, which are now set to dominate the new parliament. The reformers have told aides they are now preparing for an opposition role, and that the tide is flowing strongly in favour of a return to state-controlled, interventionist policies aimed at supporting industries and preserving employment. Western advisers, who had been assisting reformers preparing an economic plan for a new government, are now pessimistic about the chances of a reformist government being appointed. Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard University economist who advises Russian ministers, said last night that 'it looks as if it's pretty far down the road towards the end for the reformers. The return of the old guard is not inevitable still, but it now seems the most likely outcome'. Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister and the reformists' leader, said that a 'close coalition' of communists and nationalists had been formed which was 'imposing conditions' on the choice of leaders of the new parliament, which meets for the first time next Tuesday. He said the party he leads, Russia's Choice, would take no further part in talks on the appointment of a parliamentary speaker. At the same time, a range of decisions taken by President Boris Yeltsin and by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, point to their acceptance of the need for a centrist economic course in which industries - including military plants - will be heavily subsidised and a strong push made to form a tight economic union with former Soviet republics under Russia's leadership. Reformers say such a course would destroy any hope of financial stabilisation because of these republics' needs for cheap credits and subsidised energy. An agreement in principle reached this week between the prime ministers and central bank chairmen of Russia and Belarus to unite the two countries' economies under a common currency is seen by reformers as a strong indication the conservatives have won the internal argument. Mr Chernomyrdin, commending the deal this week, pointedly linked it with the lack of agreement with Ukraine, where the economy is in steep decline and pro-union forces are agitating for economic union with Russia. George Graham adds from Washington: Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, said the US would urge Mr Yeltsin to 'deepen the process of market reform', but that the west should pay more attention to the economic pain of the Russian people.

			<p>BFN     [Text] In 1993, the number of unemployed, registered by the  Russian employment agencies increased 1.5 times compared to  1992, reaching 7.8 million by the beginning of 1994, which  accounts for 10.4 percent of the able-bodied population, says  the Russian Central Bank's report to parliament.    The report also says that the growth rate of unemployment  was  "inadequate to the scope of economic recession." In 1993, the  rate of industrial decline stood at 16.2 percent (compared to 18  percent in 1002), says the Central Bank's report.    This document also says that the rate of the decline in the  fuel industry has grown two times, reaching 15 percent (compared  to 7 percent in 1992).    Agriculture was the most stable of the basic production  branches. In 1993, the volume of its gross produce went down by  only 4 percent.    The Central Bank's specialists believe that a fall in the  efficiency of production was due to the retention of excessive  workforce against the backdrop of massive stoppages. As a  result, wages increases and rising prices on raw materials  became the main factors accelerating inflation.    Unemployment is the worst in the Ingush Republic, and in the  Ivanovo, Pskov, Yaroslavl and Volga-Vyatka regions. The  Volga-Vyatka Region accounts for more than 10 percent of  Russia's unemployed, and for just about 4 percent of the  vacancies.    According to the report, unemployment has increased even  further. In the first quarter of 1994, the number of unemployed  was three time greater than the number of vacancies.</p>

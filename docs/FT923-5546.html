			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Books: Poems with appeal for modern minds - FT Children's Book of the Month THE MAGNIFICENT CALLISTO by Gerard Benson Blackie Pounds 5.99, 80 pages POETRY BOOKS FOR CHILDREN: A SIGNAL BOOK GUIDE by Brian Morse Thimble Press Pounds 4.50, 64 pages THERE are always difficulties inherent in writing for an age group to which one does not belong, and nowhere has this been more evident than in the endeavours by grown-ups in this century to write poetry for children. Until the early 1970s, it seemed that children's poetry would never quite manage to crawl out from under the shadow of a handful of grey eminences: Robert Louis Stevenson, Walter de la Mare, Eleanor Farjeon and those twin masters of nonsense, Lear and Carroll. Not that all these writers were not important poets, of course - to a greater or less extent, all of them were; but their collective influence was so pervasive that the majority of 20th century poets seemed unable to find voices of their own. The whole territory was rooted in nostalgia; enveloped in a Victorian-cum-Edwardian mist. The manners and the morals of the present seemed almost wholly absent. The urban child living with his mates in the post-war housing estates of UK cities could see at a glance that all this poetry stuff was beyond his ken. Someone had to arrive with sufficient courage and distinctiveness to give voice to these children and that person proved to be Michael Rosen, whose first collection, Mind Your Own Business, was published in 1974. It was a book that seemed - to use a phrase fashionable among executives in American children's television - to empower the child, written as it was in hectic free verse, rancorous, raucous and healthily subversive. This was not poetry handed down from above in well-sculpted quatrains, thrice blessed by tradition; it was, although written by an adult, verse that held up a mirror to a child's pre-occupations: all those nasty rivalries; the swift, fearful acts of vengeance; the carefree bouts of mental torture; all that reckless derring-do. Rosen seemed to unlock the very spirit of modern children in that collection and what he created was, of course, imitated by lesser talents - to such an extent, in fact, that a respected children's novelist, John Rowe Townsend, once gave Rosen's manner of writing the title 'urchin verse' as if to prove that he had spawned a movement. Since that time, poetry for modern children has not looked back; not only have anthologies abounded but there have been many individual collections of importance. These include books (bucking the trend I have just described) written by the likes of Ted Hughes, a poet difficult to categorise at the best of times, and Charles Causley, who has breathed new life into the longer narrative poem. This month sees the launch of an enterprising new series of poetry originals from Blackie, a publisher that has been building up a steady reputation for itself in this area over the past five years. The series is edited by anthologist Anne Harvey and among the first batch of titles is The Magnificent Callisto, an outstanding debut collection by Gerard Benson. Judging by the ease with which he moves through different styles of verse - from puns to Anglo-Saxon riddles; from poems rooted in urban experiences to well-tempered fantasies; from nonsense poems to animal verse - his is a strong and fully-mature talent. Benson is by no means new to the poetry scene: for many years, he has performed with the Barrow Poets, an ensemble of actors, musicians and poets based in the north of England that takes poetry into pubs, theatres and schools. He also helped to found Poems on the Underground, a poster campaign on the London railway system that has proved to be one of the most successful attempts in recent years to gain a more public audience for verse. Last year, he won the Signal poetry award for an outstanding anthology entitled This Poem Doesn't Rhyme, which seemed to prove by its very title that he, too, might be a disciple of Rosen. The new book demonstrates that he has not only absorbed Rosen's influence but also reached far beyond it. Not the least impressive aspect is the difficult verse forms within which he works (the Villanelle, for example), and his thoroughgoing mastery of such traditional matters as rhyme and metre. Poetry, this collection seems to remind us, is of course a form of self-expression and children need to regard it as such if it is to succeed in helping them to unlock their own lives. But it is also an art form, and good art is a difficult, demanding taskmaster which metes out its rewards only in strict proportion to the amount of effort expended. If any additional proof were required that children's poetry is alive and well, we need only consult a useful new guide entitled Poetry Books for Children, by the children's poet and novelist Brian Morse. He has usefully selected, categorised and commented upon 200 titles that are now in print. It is an embarras de richesses indeed.</p>

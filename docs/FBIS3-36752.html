			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Kvasov, leader of the Russian </F> Government apparatus, by Ruslan Ignatyev under the rubric "Only  in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA"; place and date not given: "Who Signed  the Government Decision on Journalists"]    [Text] For almost a week now the newspapers, radio, and  television have been commenting on the government decision  restricting access to presidium sessions for journalists other  than correspondents of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and ITAR-TASS.    It has also been reported that the leadership has revised  its  directive, however, and that the range of accredited  publications has been enlarged.    Your ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA special correspondent asked Vladimir  Kvasov, leader of the Russian Federation Government apparatus,  for an explanation.    [Ignatyev] Vladimir Petrovich, can we clarify matters here  -- did the government make the decision to which the mass media  are alluding and, if so, who signed it?    [Kvasov] The government has not arrived at any decision or  directive, even less a decree, which says that journalists are  barred from attending presidium sessions. As a rule such  questions are resolved in the course of work. There is no need  for the corresponding documents on this score, and therefore  there can be no signatures by members of the government. But  statements of the type that the government has revised its  decision are just insinuation.    [Ignatyev] Nevertheless, as we have already reported, such  an order has come from you personally. A representative of the  government press service told an ITAR-TASS correspondent about  this. You then confirmed this fact for us. Has anything  changed since then?    [Kvasov] No. I can repeat now that I gave only a verbal  instruction that the system of journalists' accreditation should  be regulated. The need for this arose when the government moved  to its new address. The move caused a certain confusion for the  work of a number of our services. As a result, people we did  not know and complete outsiders began turning up to presidium  sessions. The press published materials describing not the  essentials of the presidium's work but mere intrigue.  Furthermore, questions were assessed even though they were  still at the discussion stage and decisions had not been made on  them at the time.    [Ignatyev] Did such materials harm the government's work?    [Kvasov] These publications disinformed society,  destabilized the situation in the country, and cast the  government in an unfavorable light. A presidium session cannot  be a public spectacle. And the presence of journalists,  especially in large number, objectively introduces an element of  theater to the proceedings. Normal and constructive work  requires the appropriate conditions. Sometimes, however, a  casual phrase uttered by someone at a presidium session is blown  up into a real sensation in the press. This is why we want to  instill proper order here. There is nothing scandalous about it.    [Ignatyev] But why were Russian Television [RTV] reporters  not allowed into Government House last Saturday?    [Kvasov] I should think that, before guests come to visit  you, they inform you first. That is the usual way of things  everywhere. But to turn up without an invitation and then  hammer on a locked door is stupid to say the least. Then to  tell the whole country that journalists cannot get into the  White House is tantamount to self-criticism and an admission of  one's own helplessness. But to deal with specifics, the report  on this subject in the Vesti newscast is typical first and  foremost of the RTV leadership's work, namely, its inability to  reach agreement with the relevant agencies on obtaining the  necessary permission for filming. There is a definite procedure  for this established in our country, just as there is in other  civilized countries. It must be adhered to. For example, just  you try to get into a British Government session without an  invitation and see what happens.    [Ignatyev] As far as is known, the government was at work on  Saturday and discussed some serious issues....    [Kvasov] Yes, the government did work Saturday. However, no  questions requiring urgent and broad coverage in the mass media  were examined. Admittedly, that is my view. But if journalists  consider it necessary to report on this or that problem they can  get all the necessary materials and commentaries from our press  service.    [Ignatyev] Does your restriction on the presence of  representatives of certain publications, news agencies, and  television at government sessions not contravene the Law on the  Mass Media?    [Kvasov] I would remind you once again that there is no ban.  In response to new applications from this or that publication,  agency, or radio and television editorial office, lists will be  compiled and journalists will be accredited accordingly. But it  is not our intention to admit or bar particular correspondents.  In other words, this is not a question of the right to obtain  information but of the mechanism whereby that information is  obtained. The Russian Federation Government's press service,  headed by Valentin Mikhaylovich Sergeyev, deals with the work of  that mechanism. How that service works is another question.  Clearly we must investigate this properly. And is it not clear  why the government press service did not grant the relevant  materials to RTV when it came to Government House Saturday?  Well, that question is probably one for us to deal with. I  believe we will be able to answer it in the near future.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Deal simplifies ADT MR MICHAEL ASHCROFT, the controversial head of ADT which yesterday sold its indirectly held 49 per cent stake in Cope Allman Packaging, might be forgiven for crowing. The sale places a Pounds 117m price tag on the stake which many analysts have found extremely difficult to value. Not only does it reduce ADT's debt, more importantly, it clarifies parts of ADT's often complicated relationships with affiliate companies which have created misunderstanding and suspicion among shareholders, and markets in general. Yesterday's 37p rise in the share price to 500p reflects the value of the deal to ADT. It is possibly the first good news ADT has had to announce after last year's public fight with its largest shareholder, Laidlaw, and a grim period of watching the falling values of investments in companies like Lep and Christies. ADT is not receiving the Pounds 117m in cash immediately. At completion Bowater will pay Pounds 58m in cash with a further Pounds 9m over three years. In addition Bowater will give ADT a Pounds 50m transferable and interest bearing loan note. After the cash, this aspect of the deal is the most valuable to ADT. Instead of holding Pounds 102m in loan notes of uncertain value from Quoteplan, the subsidiary which owned Cope Allman, it now has marketable Bowater paper. ADT sold its 49 per cent stake in Quoteplan to Sechura, its Canadian affiliate, in 1990 for CDollars 90m, (Pounds 43m), financed by loan notes from ADT. At the last interim stage, ADT wrote down the value of its Sechura loan notes. As a result it is understood ADT will have to make only a small write-down on these notes. Sechura, where Mr Ashcroft and his wife now have a 29 per cent stake, will then be an empty shell with no assets and no liabilities. The end of ADT's Sechura chapter should go some way to clearing up what had become something of a hallmark of the Ashcroft way of management - the shuffling of assets between ADT affiliates and related companies which pass the auditors' scrutiny but leave shareholders and the City somewhat suspicious. In the 1990 accounts, for example, ADT did not take a 49 per cent share of Quoteplan's Pounds 10.3m net attributable loss into its own profit and loss account. Instead it took a profit on the sale of Quoteplan to Sechura. The sale also profitably ends Mr Ashcroft's involvement with Quoteplan which started with a failed bid in 1983 and led to a leveraged buy-out in 1988 at a time when debt financing was readily available. Had Quoteplan been floated at some future date - the intention was to float last December but market conditions were not propitious - ADT might have shared a slice of a larger pie. But few shareholders worried about ADT's debt would begrudge Mr Ashcroft acceptance of Bowater's offer. Had he not, ADT would still now be the largest creditor to a debt-laden business, neither a fashionable position to be in these days nor consistent with Mr Ashcroft's new strategy of reducing gearing.</p>

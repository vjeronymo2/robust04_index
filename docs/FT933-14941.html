			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Warning over Church finances THE Church of England will today be warned about the increasing financial difficulties it faces. The Church Commissioners will tell parishes that they must prepare to meet a far bigger proportion of clergy stipends. The commissioners now finance an average of 41 per cent of stipends but this is likely to fall below 30 per cent by 1996. The commission's report to the church's general synod meeting in York will be the first presented by Sir Michael Colman, chairman of Reckitt &amp; Colman and the recently appointed first church estates commissioner.</p>

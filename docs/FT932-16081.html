			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley cuts bonuses for executives MORGAN Stanley, the New York investment bank, has cut the 1992 bonuses paid to its leading executives by between 30 per cent and 45 per cent, despite making record profits, according to its annual proxy statement to shareholders. A company spokeswoman said that its performance relative to the rest of the securities industry had not been as strong as previously, and this was one of several factors which went into the compensation equation. Securities firms with retail operations had tended to perform better in 1992 than those with an institutional client bias, she added. Mr Richard Fisher and Mr Robert Greenhill, respectively chairman and president of the group, each received compensation of Dollars 6.25m, down 20 per cent from Dollars 7.81m in 1991. Their bonuses were cut 41 per cent to Dollars 2.86m. At Merrill Lynch, the largest US brokerage firm, Mr William Schreyer, chairman, saw his cash compensation rise 16 per cent to Dollars 5.2m, while Mr Donald Marron of PaineWebber received Dollars 7.7m, up more than 50 per cent. Morgan Stanley also announced yesterday that Mr Dick Cheney, defence secretary under President George Bush, was joining its board. PepsiCo Foods International, which bought a controlling share in Poland's Wedel confectionery plant two years ago, is to lift its initial five-year investment commitment by 25 per cent, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. Last year, Wedel saw sales increase by 52 per cent to 1,583bn zlotys (Dollars 95.8m) and reported net profit 48 per cent up at 240.7bn zlotys, due partly to a tax holiday.</p>

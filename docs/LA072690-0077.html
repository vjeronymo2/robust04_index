			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUNSET STREET FAIR BRINGS DIVERSE NEIGHBORS TOGETHER  </P> <P> The emcee, a young woman sporting chic black sunglasses, surveyed the audience  that surrounded the music stage Sunday evening on Sunset Boulevard: gay  couples, youths in punk-rock outfits, Latino families, senior citizens. Then  she gestured toward the band behind her and laughed brashly.  </P> <P> "You want to get up and dance?" she asked the crowd. "Then just do it.  </P> <P> "Do anything you want to have fun. Sunset Boulevard is yours for the asking."  </P> <P> More than 300,000 people took her up on the offer.  </P> <P> After a decade of forging through some rough financial, legal and political  waters, the Sunset Junction Street Fair finally may have found its groove.  </P> <P> The two-day block party was founded in 1980 to promote understanding between  gays and Latinos in Silver Lake, Los Feliz and Echo Park. After a low turnout  in Echo Park last year, the fair resumed its usual setting last weekend along  seven blocks of Sunset Boulevard between Fountain Avenue and Edgecliffe Drive.  </P> <P> The result, organizers and police agreed, was an unusually peaceful affair  marked by wildly diverse people, music and revelry.  </P> <P> "I liked the site better in Echo Park -- it had the water and the gardens --  but we didn't get the crowds," said Manuel Pumphrey, an Echo Park youth group  counselor who was working at a booth at the fair. "And having it on Sunset  gives it the true feeling of a street fair."  </P> <P> John Daniel Manzo, 13, and Fernando Saavedra, 11, were two of nearly 100 local  youths, some of them gang members, who volunteered as monitors at the fair.  During a break Sunday, the two ate a salary of free pepperoni pizza. But the  job's best benefit, they said, was the authority to scold adults for drinking  beer outside designated "beer gardens."  </P> <P> For Isaac (Little Bear) Urquidi and other Urban Indian Council officials, the  fair was an excellent forum for handing out literature and selling Indian fry  bread. Other activist groups, ranging from ACT UP/LA to Atheists United to the  Black Gay and Lesbian Leadership Forum, distributed petitions, buttons and  condoms.  </P> <P> Fair-goers needing more than food for thought feasted on corn on the cob, Cajun  chicken, Thai noodles, Greek gyros and burritos offered by dozens of vendors.  Many ate only after they had enjoyed carnival rides or the laser light show.  </P> <P> "They've got a lot of great booths here, a lot of different foods, and you can  see the latest dances," Tyrone Dunn, a 30-year-old amateur photographer from  Pasadena, said as he took photos of a makeshift, canvas-covered disco, where  gay and straight men and women danced. The fair has not always operated so  smoothly. The 1985 event was marred by brawls. The 1986 fair was canceled  because insurance costs were too high. And in 1987, organizers filed a $500,000  discrimination lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles, alleging losses in  revenue and reputation after police forced them to end a Labor Day weekend  fund-raising concert a day early. The lawsuit is still pending, according to  Micheal McKinley of the Sunset Junction Neighborhood Alliance, the main  organizer of the fair.  </P> <P> Last weekend, some fair-goers complained about the diversity of the crowd and  said they preferred the event in Echo Park.  </P> <P> "I don't like it this year. I thought there was going to be more kids and more  entertainment," said Stephanie Basquez, 12, who on Sunday accompanied her  mother at the fair. "It was better in Echo Park because there weren't that many  gays and lesbians."  </P> <P> But for the most part, visitors, organizers and police seemed pleased with the  festivity. About 60 officers were dispatched from the Northeast, Rampart and  Metro police divisions to cover the fair. On Saturday and Sunday, many could be  found sitting nonchalantly in chairs or on the hoods of their cars, watching  calm crowds pass by.  </P> <P> Officers said two minor fistfights broke out during the affair but there were  no arrests.  </P> <P> "The biggest emergency we've had was a lost parent," one officer said Sunday as  he monitored a medical tent. "And the biggest problem we've had to contend with  is the heat."  </P> <P> "It's taken a lot of work to get to this," said John Brown of the Sunset  Junction Neighborhood Alliance. In 1980, "there were some real fears and  tension about what was going to happen. But now you've got transvestites,  transsexuals, people in leather, you've got gay and lesbian couples, senior  citizens, Latino families.  </P> <P> "It's not a blending," Brown said. "It's more of a mosaic. And that's what the  street fair is all about."  </P></p>

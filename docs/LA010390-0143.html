			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ACTION FILMS PUNCH UP TICKET SALES TO $5 BILLION IN N. AMERICA;  </P> <P> MOVIES: SUMMERTIME MOVIEGOERS MADE UP FOR LACKLUSTER HOLIDAY SEASON IN RECORD  BOX OFFICE YEAR.  </P> <P> North America's movie theaters reaped a record $5 billion-plus at the box  office in 1989, powered by the punch of "Batman" and other highly promoted  action films.  </P> <P> Despite a lackluster Christmas holiday season, summertime moviegoers spun the  turnstiles at such a dizzying pace that the box office record of $4.45 billion  from 1988 was smashed, according to figures released Tuesday.  </P> <P> The box-office total, based on industry estimates, was set by fewer films: 446  features made their debuts in 1989, down 13% from the previous year.  </P> <P> In the studio-by-studio race, Warner Bros. was No. 1 with an estimated 17.1%  share of all American and Canadian tickets sold.  </P> <P> The studio's "Batman" was the year's biggest blockbuster. Its $251.2 million in  ticket sales was fifth-highest in history.  </P> <P> Disney, which some analysts did not expect to be competitive, finished fifth  with a healthy 13.8% share.  </P> <P> Although part of the revenue surge is attributable to higher ticket prices,  admissions are projected to be greater than last year.  </P> <P> In large part, the record year was propelled by expensive and heavily marketed  star vehicles such as "Batman," and "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," which  made $196 million, and "Lethal Weapon 2," which collected $147 million,  according to trade publications and private research firms.  </P> <P> Right behind, the lightly regarded "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" emerged as 1989's  No. 4 film with receipts of $130 million. It was followed by the 1988 holdover  "Rain Man" $127 million.  </P> <P> The rest of the year's top 10 are "Ghostbusters II," $112 million; "Look Who's  Talking," $109 million; "Parenthood," $95 million; "Dead Poets Society," $94  million, and "When Harry Met Sally . . . , " $91 million.  </P> <P> Owing partly to cold weather and that Christmas fell on a Monday, this year's  holiday season was off from a year ago. The scarce hits included "Back to the  Future Part II" and "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation."  </P> <P> The year's biggest flops include "Casualties of War," "Blaze," "We're No  Angels," "Old Gringo," "Fat Man and Little Boy," "The Abyss" and just about  every movie from the Orion studios: "She-Devil," "Valmont," "Great Balls of  Fire," "Erik the Viking" and "Heart of Dixie."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT HOME: WESTCHESTER: SUBURB WHERE LAX IS KING;  </P> <P> DESPITE DOMINANCE OF AIRPORT, COMMUNITY'S INSTITUTIONS THRIVE AND THE AIR IS  COOL.  </P> <P> Westchester calls itself the home of Los Angeles International Airport. It is  an apt description, for in this community of 50,000 the airport is king.  </P> <P> One-third of the land in the original Westchester community is now occupied by  LAX and its parking lots and buffer zones. The schools and shopping district  have not yet recovered from the airport's expansion in the 1970s, which removed  about 3,500 houses and displaced 10,000 residents.  </P> <P> Since then, hotels and office buildings have sprung up around the airport,  creating business opportunities for local residents, but little in the way of  shopping or other amenities.  </P> <P> The once-thriving retail center along Sepulveda Boulevard with its landmark  Loyola Theatre has been superseded by Fox Hills Mall in neighboring Culver  City.  </P> <P> And out of doors in Westchester, the whine and rumble of jet aircraft is  distant but almost always discernable. Yet Westchester's location and history  present advantages, too, mainly in its weather and community institutions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Neighborhoods Isolated  </P> <P> Situated on a mesa half a mile from the ocean, Westchester receives mists and  cooling breezes. And for all the traffic around the airport, the tracts of  single-family houses enjoy a surprising degree of peace.  </P> <P> Westchester's neighborhoods are isolated from other communities by the airport  on the south, the bluffs above Ballona Creek to the north and the San Diego  Freeway (405) to the east. Many of the neighborhood streets, traveling over the  gentle hills, curve slightly, giving greater intimacy to the housing tracts.  </P> <P> "I moved here to get away from the traffic and noise," said Jack Sivak, who  sold his house after six months in Manhattan Beach and bought another house two  years ago on Toland Avenue, a quiet, curving street lined with mature  liquidambar trees, not far from Loyola Marymount University.  </P> <P> A typical homeowner in Westchester, Sivak works in aviation -- he is an  aerospace consultant -- and has grown children who live elsewhere. He does not  mind that Osage Elementary School, around the corner, is closed for lack of  children. (It serves as a conference center for teachers.)  </P> <P> For him, Westchester is convenient to work and gives him "the advantages of a  beach community without the crowds."  </P> <P> Nor is he troubled by airport noise. "They were here before I was," he says of  the jets.  </P> <P> Mary Ann Holmes Schwarz, 55, moved to Westchester in 1953 when her father, an  airlines service manager, had wearied of the commute from Burbank. "He swore  that he would move to a place where if he had to walk to work, he could," she  said.  </P> <P> Westchester then was a raw suburb. Created willy-nilly in the 1940s to  accommodate aircraft workers, the community grew in population from 353 to  about 30,000 without a police or fire station, an emergency hospital or even a  direct telephone line to the rest of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> As late as 1949, it still had no barber shop, according to the late California  historian Carey McWilliams, who wrote about Westchester that same year for  Harper's Magazine.  </P> <P> "Never formally planned," he wrote, "the streets of Westchester are a jumble of  unrelated numberings and sharp, crisscrossing turns; only the oldest  inhabitants can find their way about with ease.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Community Group  </P> <P> "Yet despite these omissions, inconveniences and limitations, Westchester is  going ahead, raising money to build a town hall, seeking by a variety of  devices to improve community services."  </P> <P> A town hall was needed because the Westport Heights Civic Assn., the first  community group in Westchester, had been meeting in a Quonset hut on Truxton  Avenue.  </P> <P> McWilliams believed the cooperative spirit owed much to the fact that the  residents were all about the same: skilled workers and World War II veterans  who were ready to buy a house with GI financing and start a family.  </P> <P> The houses they could afford were likewise the same, and in fact were built by  just three developers: Silas Nowell, Frank Ayres and the team of Fritz B. Burns  and Fred W. Marlow.  </P> <P> Marlow had recently resigned as director of the Federal Housing Authority in  California, and his houses were aimed so exactly at the GI market that realtors  nicknamed them "Jeeps." Most of the houses sold originally for under $6,000.  </P> <P> Today, prices in the neighborhoods most distant from the airport range around  $390,000, said Mary Jo Bergstrom, a realtor in the area for 10 years. A  fixer-upper in Kentwood, closer to the airport, was recently reduced from  $344,000 to $324,000, she said.  </P> <P> The priciest area is along the bluffs west of Lincoln Boulevard, bordering  Playa del Rey. She said a view property on Riggs Place has been listed at $1  million.  </P> <P> Willis Marcom came to Westchester during World War II and got out of the  dry-cleaning business to sell real estate. And he soon had another calling as  well.  </P> <P> At Christmas, 1949, his wife was asked to stage a play for Kentwood Elementary  School, where she was PTA president. She did, and he played Santa Claus "skinny  as I was," he said.  </P> <P> "After the show was over, we had a party," Marcom said. It was such a good  party that in order to have more, Marcom and others formed an amateur stage  company called the Kentwood Players.  </P> <P> Marcom has been performing and directing with them ever since, six shows a  year, including a musical. The nonprofit company owns the Westchester Playhouse  free and clear, has a subscription list of 2,000 and guaranteed sellouts  through 1990.  </P> <P> Charles Reynolds would have lost his attachment to Westchester had it not been  for the Kent- wood group, which he joined in 1960.  </P> <P> He had come to Westchester to work for Hughes Aircraft, but moved to Redondo  Beach when his house was taken in the airport expansion. He now lives in Santa  Monica, but returns to Westchester almost every day to direct the players' next  production. "This is my family," he said the other day in the playhouse lobby.  </P> <P> Other community groups -- a symphony, women's and civic clubs -- have thrived  in spite of, or perhaps because of, the proximity of the airport.  </P> <P> "I think the airport today has helped to give us an identity," says Shirley  Pheil, whose business is to welcome new residents and introduce them to local  merchants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Apartment Buildings  </P> <P> "I think the community as we knew it is phasing out," Marcom said. "But now,  you know, people say that Westchester is the airport. Maybe it is. Maybe that's  the future."  </P> <P> Confined by the airport, new housing is almost entirely in apartments.  Parkwest, a complex of 444 units, nears completion on Lincoln Boulevard just a  few hundred yards from the airport's northernmost runway, where houses used to  stand.  </P> <P> "Now they're building apartments in places they said weren't fit for houses,"  Schwarz said. "I wouldn't live there."  </P> <P> She added that she has never considered leaving Westchester.  </P> <P> "I have everything I want here," she said. "We have the best weather, and  downtown Los Angeles is there when you want it -- we had tickets to the Music  Center for years -- but the rest of the time we're off here in our little  corner, and nobody even knows where we are."  </P> <P> Then she said, "Well, of course, we're next to the airport."  </P> <P> </P> <P> AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> 1989 estimate: 50,000  </P> <P> Median age: 35 years  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix  </P> <P> White (non-Latino): 74.1%  </P> <P> Latino: 15.7%  </P> <P> Black: 2.9%  </P> <P> Other: 7.3%  </P> <P> Annual income  </P> <P> Per capita: $18,675  </P> <P> Median household: $43,438  </P> <P> Household distribution  </P> <P> Less than $15,000: 14.2%  </P> <P> $15,000 - $30,000: 19.3%  </P> <P> $30,000 - $50,000: 25.1%  </P> <P> $50,000 - $75,000: 23.5%  </P> <P> $75,000 + 17.9%  </P></p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / About turn The Russian defence minister's call for a reversal of cuts agreed for the armed forces may be part of a personal campaign to keep his job, but may also signal a shift in Russian policy, diplomats said yesterday, writes Leyla Boulton. General Pavel Grachev announced on Wednesday that he would ask the new Russian parliament to reconsider a ceiling of 1.5m men for the year 2000. Gen Grachev is said to be at the risk of losing his job in a government reshuffle due next month because he has become unpopular with both President Boris Yeltsin and the armed forces.</p>

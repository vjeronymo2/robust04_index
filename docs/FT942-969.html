			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Management: In search of wages that work - A subdued and realistic approach to reward management is emerging as new pay systems prove more complex than predicted British companies continue to be obsessed with their pay systems. No fewer than one quarter of all companies changed their reward management structures during the past year, according to a recent survey of 1,000 companies. Many large companies are settling into their third-generation performance-related model since the early 1980s, with bonus schemes and share options for senior executives in a bewildering state of permanent revolution. Yet there is a more subdued and realistic mood among the high priests of reward management than in the heady days of the 1980s. The belief that a company's success depends primarily on adopting state-of-the-art pay systems is now regarded as naive. Motivation is a complex thing, and designing pay systems is fraught with difficulty. 'The most ardent supporters of performance-related pay recognise that it is extraordinarily difficult to manage well,' says Vicky Wright, a director of Hay Management Consultants. Counted among learning experiences is a clearing bank which based the pay of branch managers on the branch performance only to discover that cross-referrals to other parts of the bank - such as investment management - dried up because they were not included in the performance targets. Recent evidence of inappropriate insurance policies sold by commission-hungry staff is another reminder of the hazards of narrowly drawn, individualistic reward systems. But is the new realism in reward management delivering useful incremental reform? It has been doing so for some time in performance-related pay, where the tension between individual performance and group commitment is being grappled with. So is the sensitive link between performance pay and appraisal reviews, with assessment by colleagues and other such innovations being tried. Some companies are even recognising that the reason they want performance pay is not to distinguish between the good and the adequate but to stop giving pay rises to the inadequate. Useful advances are also being made in skill-based pay and in 'gain-sharing', incentive pay schemes that return the value of specific improvements to the employees responsible. In the more sensitive field of executive pay, and especially share options, many financial institutions have made clear that they want more rigour, but as yet there is little to show for it. Herein lies the unresolved tension at the heart of the pay revolution of the past decade. Central to that revolution has been the tearing down of national going rates for workers, and complex grading systems for managers that rewarded inertia and length of service as much as performance. In their place the 'internal labour market' has grown in importance, based on the premise that employers should seek the loyalty of employees by rewarding them according to individual performance and company performance. To the apostles of reform in the 1980s the rise of the internal labour market was not just about improving incentives but about transcending the historic divide between labour and capital. With more variable pay, it was argued, the wages bill rather than the number of employees would move up and down with the business cycle, allowing for a more stable, committed employer-employee relationship. Similarly, profit-related pay and share ownership would spread risk-sharing among all employees and even between employees and owners. Company performance might be an unpredictable thing but at least everyone would be affected in a similar way. The trouble is that progress towards the high commitment company has been linked to a large increase in income inequality within the company. Loosening the ties with national bargaining systems has handed more power to groups at the top of companies who have helped themselves to a larger share of the cake and undermined the belief that everyone is in the same boat. The most outrageous pay rises for top executives, running into tens of millions of pounds, have been the exception. But, according to Robin Harrison of pay analysts Incomes Data Services, gross pay for chief executives has risen on average nearly 600 per cent since 1979, while average earnings rose by half that. This appears to be more than a one-off change in differentials for top executives, whose pay was badly squeezed in the 1960s and 1970s. A typical story in last Monday's Financial Times revealed that John Clarke, chief executive of BET, the business services group, has received a 30 per cent increase in total remuneration, while Sir John Egan, chief executive of BAA, the airports group, enjoyed a 33 per cent rise. Average earnings are now rising at 3.75 per cent. Countless reports have highlighted the tenuous link between executive pay rises and medium-term company performance. But some argue that this misses the point. Executives of the largest British companies are now acquiring US-style pay levels (although managers in general are still at more modest European levels) and the justification for such extravagance is not motivation of the top executive but the healthy scramble it creates lower down for the top job. Evidently, many of the reward management gurus recognise this is a weak argument. In their book on reward management by Helen Murlis and Michael Armstrong, one of the 'key issues' listed at the end is: 'How do we justify paying vast (and, some people may feel, obscene) bonuses to our chief executives and directors and at the same time clamp down on pay increases for the rest of our employees (who also contribute)?' No one advocates a return to incomes policies and leased handmade shirts for senior managers. But market forces will not curb the excesses. Companies do not simply pay what they can afford. In a free labour market they must roughly match what other companies pay, whether for clerical workers or chief executives. But that does not mean that the pay levels set by the market are immutable. Behind the market are a host of cultural factors. How otherwise to explain well-known anomalies such as, for instance, the fact that engineers earn so much less than accountants? Executive pay is set by executives and approved by their boards and remuneration committees. When political and institutional pressures become great enough they will pay themselves less. That pressure has been rising and will continue to rise as recovery brings the usual worries about pay rises in general. The pay revolution has not delivered pay discipline or a better trade-off between pay and jobs at the macro level. Indeed, the re-emergence of 'pay drift', the gap between settlements and average earnings, is often attributed to over-generous performance pay. However, pay researchers have detected links between the new pay systems and rising productivity. Saul Estrin of the London Business School has noted a positive link between profit-related pay and both productivity and job creation. He also defends the government's tax breaks for profit pay, which now cover more than one million workers, pointing out that most companies were using profit pay before joining the scheme. Supporters of the pay revolution might argue that it has not yet been properly tried. Performance-linked pay is said to cover half the workforce but usually represents only part of the annual pay rise. The official New Earnings Survey for 1993 found only 3 per cent of gross earnings for non-manual workers came from incentive pay. And Paul Gregg of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research argues that the performance element for top executives is no greater than 20 years ago. Indeed, with a pay policy in the public sector, 80 per cent of pay deals coming in at inflation or above, and a differentials dispute on the railways, continuity in pay setting seems as evident as change.</p>

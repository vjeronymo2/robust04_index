			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Philips head denies that sale was to raise cash MR Jan Timmer, president of Philips, the Dutch electronics group, denied yesterday that the company's decision to end its semiconductor joint venture with Matsushita of Japan was motivated primarily by the need to raise cash in order to reduce debts. Speaking at the annual meeting, Mr Timmer said the price of Fl 3bn (Dollars 1.68bn) was 'not unwelcome but it was not our main goal'. He gave no details but said the partnership, which dates back to 1952, had been in need of revision. He also noted that Philips' 35 per cent stake in the joint venture, Matsushita Electronics Corp, had not entitled the Dutch company to management control. Mr Timmer, denying that the divestment was an abrupt decision, said Philips started considering pulling out of MEC two years ago. Philips has declined to be drawn on the book profit that it will realise on the sale of its MEC shares to Matsushita, which will now assume 100 per cent control. 'This windfall will help put us on the road to recovery, (but) the road to recovery is still long,' Mr Timmer said. He gave no forecast for 1993 results or the likelihood of a resumption of dividend payments, but repeated earlier predictions that the company's single biggest business, consumer electronics, would reach break-even in 1994.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Other Environmental and Energy Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The primary source of other environmental and energy impacts is expected to result from the operation of control devices used to remove or destroy organics in captured vapor streams. Electric motor-driven fans, blowers, or pumps, depending on the type of control device, are used for operations such as moving the captured organic vapors to the control device, circulating cooling water through a condenser, or pumping recovered liquids to an accumulation tank. Generation of the electricity to operate the control device often requires burning of fuel in an electric utility power plant which produces air emissions, wastewater discharges, and solid wastes. When carbon adsorption systems are used, the organic HAP removed from the vapor stream are adsorbed on the activated carbon in the control device. Once the carbon becomes saturated with organics, it must be regenerated or disposed of in a landfill. Regeneration of the carbon requires steam. Producing this steam in a boiler creates both secondary air and energy impacts. Disposal of the spent carbon produces a solid waste impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Control Cost Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Total capital investment (TCI) cost represents the cost to facility owners and operators to purchase and install air emission control equipment. The TCI costs in 1991 dollars to implement each of the regulatory alternatives is estimated to be approximately: $11 million for Regulatory Alternative 1, $14 million for Regulatory Alternative 2, $49 million for Regulatory Alternative 3, $57 million for Regulatory Alternative 4, and $78 million for Regulatory Alternative 5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Total annual cost represents the total cost to facility owners and operators each year to: Operate and maintain the air emission controls required by the proposed rule; perform the inspection, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting required by the proposed rule; and repay the capital investment for the air emission controls. The capital recovery was estimated using an interest rate of 7 percent applied over a period ranging from 10 to 20 years depending on the expected service life for each type of air emission control equipment. The total annual cost to implement each of the regulatory alternatives is estimated to be approximately: $4.7 million per year for Regulatory Alternative 1, $5.2 million per year for Regulatory Alternative 2, $24.5 million per year for Regulatory Alternative 3, $26.1 million per year for Regulatory Alternative 4, and $36.3 million per year for Regulatory Alternative 5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Economic Impact Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA performed an economic impact analysis using a model that simulates 60 separate waste disposal markets and then estimates facility and market responses to the costs of implementing the requirements of the proposed rule. All dollar amounts for prices and costs were adjusted to reflect 1991 dollars. The EPA made no projections of new off-site waste and recovery operations that would be affected by the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Air Canada postpones BWIA stake talks AIR Canada has suspended talks with Trinidad and Tobago Airways to acquire a stake in the Caribbean operator of the BWIA International airline. The move leaves the state-owned Trinidadian company continuing its two-year search for a partnership with an international carrier. The negotiations with Air Canada followed the failure of talks with other airlines, including British Airways and Delta Airlines, to buy into BWIA. Government officials said Air Canada's decision had nothing to do with BWIA's financial performance, but because Air Canada's management resources were too thin. BWIA had a net loss of USDollars 15.6m last year, following a loss of Dollars 24.2m in 1991.</p>

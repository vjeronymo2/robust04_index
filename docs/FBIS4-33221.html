			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Santiago, 2 Jun (EFE) -- Several Chilean  deputies from the Coalition of Parties for Democracy, which is  currently in power, have submitted a bill asking that Congress  request from the Defense Ministry a report on the trip made by  Army Commander General Augusto Pinochet to the Czech Republic.    Congressional sources said today that the report will have  to  give all the details of the purpose of Gen. Pinochet's trip, a  list of all the members of his delegation, the cost of the trip,  and its financing.    According to the sources, the bill will be voted on next  week. Some of the deputies who signed the bill said that  Pinochet's trip abroad does not do Chilean democracy any good.  [passage omitted]    Socialist Deputy Jaime Naranjo said that the problems  encountered by Pinochet abroad--before arriving in Prague he was  told to leave a hotel in Amsterdam--shows that Pinochet should  not continue as Army chief.    All of these events abroad "only discredit the country" said  Naranjo, in comments published by LA NACION. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reprot by Borka Rudic] </F>   [Text] According to the information of the Center for  Investigating War Crimes of the Prozor municipality, 153  prisoners have been released from the Heliodrom camp. Borka  Rudic reports:    [Rudic] Of these, 33 arrived last night in the Jablanica  municipality, where the War Presidency and other civilian organs  of authority of the Prozor municipality have their provisional  seats. The other prisoners left for the municipalities of  Bugojno and Zenica, where their families are.    All inmates of the Heliodrom camp should be released today.  According to what those who have already arrived in Jablanica  said, there are another 70 Muslims from Prozor in this camp in  Herzegovina. A further 25 of them are also expected to arrive  in Jablanica. The others expressed the wish to go abroad.    The release of the prisoners from the Heliodrom camp is a  result of the latest agreements between the Bosnia-Herzegovina  and the Croatian sides that were recently reached in Medjugorje,  and the endeavors to realize the Washington agreement in  practice.    Dr. Slobodan Lang also made a major contribution to the  successful release of the Muslims from this Herzegovina camp of  the Croatian Defense Council [HVO]. Even after the release of  these residents of Prozor, who were imprisoned nine months ago  and placed first in a prison in Prozor and then in Heliodrom,  according the local Center for Investigating War Crimes, the  fate of 200 Muslims from Prozor is completely uncertain.  Therefore, members of the civilian authority of that  municipality are appealing to the International Red Cross and  all other organizations to do whatever can be done to finally  find out what has actually happened to these 200 civilians.</p>

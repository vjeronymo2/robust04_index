Edited in the book are materials on the anti-Japanese  revolutionary activities conducted by President Kim Il-song from  March, 1935 to February, 1936.    In those days, President Kim Il-song set forth a new  strategic policy of dissolving the fixed guerrilla  bases-liberated zone and briskly conducting large unit  activities in wide areas, and wisely organised and led the  struggle to carry it into practice.    The collection gives a systematic description of the  revolutionary activities of President Kim Il-song from the  meeting of military and political cadres of the Korean People's  Revolutionary Army which he called and guided in Yaoyinggou,  Wangqing County, and to the period when he was making  arrangements for a historical meeting of military and political  cadres of the KPRA in Nanhutou, Ningan County, after the  successful second North Manchurian expedition of the main unit.    The book consists of three chapters and an appendix.    In the first chapter, it carries words (excerpts) of  President Kim Il-song recalling his revolutionary activities in  those days.    Recorded in the second chapter are individual reminiscences  of anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters and related persons, and  in the third chapter materials proving the revolutionary  activities of President Kim Il-song in those days.    The appendix deals with enemy's documents and publications  on  the then socio-economic situation in Korea.    The collection gives photo illustrations of battle sites,  historical sites and secret documents of the enemy on  revolutionary activities of President Kim Il-song.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUGMON ACCOMPLISHES TASK: RENDERING WEAPON HARMLESS  </P> <P> Forward Stacey Augmon of Nevada Las Vegas is always assigned to check the  toughest opposing player. When UNLV faced Georgia Tech in an NCAA tournament  semifinal game Saturday, he was assigned to Dennis Scott, the top gun in  Georgia Tech's Lethal Weapon 3 offense.  </P> <P> "It was a big challenge," Augmon said. "I knew he was looking forward to  playing against me and he took the challenge and came out launching. I couldn't  stop him in the first half."  </P> <P> Scott scored 20 points in the first 20 minutes as Georgia Tech took a 53-46  lead.  </P> <P> But Augmon limited Scott to nine points in the second half as the Rebels won,  90-81, to advance to the NCAA championship game Monday night against Duke.  </P> <P> "Stacey played great defense in the second half," guard Anderson Hunt said. "He  knew what he had to do."  </P> <P> What Augmon had to do was play more aggressively against Scott.  </P> <P> After making five of eight shots in the first half, including four three-point  shots, Scott didn't touch the ball in the first five minutes of the second half  because of Augmon. "He played great defense on me the second half," Scott said.  "He denied me the ball. I think the whole Vegas team was denying us the ball  and it got us out of our offense."  </P> <P> Although Augmon did a good job on Scott in the second half, he thought he could  have done a better job in the first half.  </P> <P> "Scott's a great player," Augmon said. "You can't take anything from him. He  still got 29. The thing I tried to do was hold him to the lowest possible  points. I can't go out and stop anyone. Great players are going to hit shots on  anyone."  </P> <P> But Tarkanian thought Augmon was being too modest.  </P> <P> "In all fairness to Stacey, Scott got quite a few of his points when we were in  our zone," Tarkanian said. "It seemed like every time we went to a zone he hit  a three-pointer and made us pay for it. I don't know how many he got directly  off Stacey, but I'm sure half of them came off our zone."  </P> <P> As the Rebels' best defensive player, Augmon said he takes more pride in his  defense than his offense. And he has shut down some of the nation's best  offensive players, such as Temple guard Mark Macon, who had 11 points before  fouling out in a loss to UNLV.  </P> <P> Although Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Cremins praised the aggressive defense Augmon  played on Scott, he felt Scott stopped himself in the second half.  </P> <P> "I knew Stacey couldn't stop Dennis Scott overall," Cremins said. "He's a heck  of a defender, but no one can stop Dennis Scott. The only one who can stop  Dennis Scott is Dennis Scott. But Augmon is a good athlete."  </P> <P> After opening the game in a zone defense, UNLV switched to a man-to-man defense  at the start of the second half. The defense seemed to confuse Georgia Tech,  which shot 66.7% in the first half. The Yellow Jackets shot just 34.5% in the  second half.  </P> <P> "I thought the second half we played really well defensively," Tarkanian said.  "We got after it real good and we shut down a lot of things. The first half we  didn't play with the intensity we wanted."  </P> <P> The Rebels opened the second half with a 17-4 run as Augmon scored five points.  While Augmon is recognized for his defense, he also is a good offensive player  as he proved last Sunday by scoring 33 points against Loyola Marymount and  Saturday with 22 against Georgia Tech.  </P> <P> "I take more pride in my defense than my offense," Augmon said. "A lot of  people say I should take more pride in my offense because it will take me  farther in life.  </P> <P> "But my role on this team is as the defensive stopper and to put a little  points on the board and that's what I did. I enjoy playing defense."  </P> <P> While UNLV's defense might have been the key, the Rebels' perimeter offense  came to the fore after Georgia Tech made a run late in the game.  </P> <P> Georgia Tech's sagging defense took away UNLV's inside game as forward Larry  Johnson got into foul trouble. But the Rebels picked up their outside game,  making 10 of 15 three-point shots.  </P> <P> Hunt, who had 20 points, broke out of a slump by making five of nine  three-point shots and Greg Anthony made three of four and scored 14 points.  </P> <P> Company: Penalty  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additional material would be incorporated by reference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and listed in 46 CFR 28.040: National Fire Protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association (NFPA 70&hyph;1987), sections 310&hyph;13 and 310&hyph;15 would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be incorporated in &sect;28.865; Society of Automotive Engineers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SAE, section J1475 would be incorporated in &sect;28.880; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Underwriters Laboratories, UL, standard 217&hyph;1985, ``Single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Multiple Station Smoke Detectors'' would be incorporated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;28.830. Copies of this material will be available for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection where indicated under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources listed in &sect;28.040.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before publishing a final rule, the Coast Guard will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit this material to the Director of the Federal Register  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for approval of the incorporation by reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal is not a significant regulatory action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard estimates that only 20 vessels out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an estimated U.S. commercial fishing fleet in excess of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 120,000 vessels would be affected by this rule. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule includes a number of grandfathered provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Coast Guard believes that existing equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> onboard these 20 vessels should be upgraded and replaced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only when the existing equipment is no longer serviceable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Small Entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include: (1) Small businesses and not-for-profit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations that are independently owned and operated and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not dominant in their fields; and (2) governmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An estimated 20 commercial fishing industry vessels are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved in the Aleutian Trade Act. A number of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels are owned or operated by small entities. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Coast Guard estimates that the cost of complying with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these revised proposed regulations will be minor. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact on a substantial number of small entities. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, you think that your business qualifies as a small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entity and that this proposal will have a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impact on your business, please submit a comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) explaining why you think your business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifies and in what way and to what degree this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will economically affect your business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

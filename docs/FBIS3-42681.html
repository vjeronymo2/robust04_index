			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yekaterina Achalova under the rubric "Election </F> Results": "`Women of Russia' Turned Out Most Frugal of All"]    [Text] Today the economic-financial commission of the  Central Electoral Commission completed a review of preliminary  financial reports of 13 electoral coalitions. The Control and  Audit Administration under the Central Electoral Commission will  conduct a complete audit of the reports in the first half of  January. On their part, the blocs practically completed the  compilation and analysis of expenditures.    The second installment of money provided by the Central  Electoral Commission to electoral coalitions (R50 million)  reached the addressees only on 6 December; therefore, many  simply did not have enough time to put it to use. In keeping  with Yeltsin's edict, the remainder of the money will be  transferred to the Central Electoral Commission's operational  account.    Of the blocs that made it to the parliament, the least  amount  of money was spent on the election campaign by Women of  Russia--R67 million. This coalition had not received money from  any source other than the Central Electoral Commission, and the  money from the latter was mainly used for advertising in the  mass media.    The Communist Party of Russia, in addition to the money  allocated by the state, also spent about R2 million from party  dues. As Gennadiy Zyuganov told a KOMMERSANT correspondent, the  propaganda work was conducted by communists on a "person to  person" basis and therefore turned out very cheap and highly  effective.    The Democratic Party of Russia spent approximately R400-R500  million. In the opinion of Yevgeniy Malkin, the chief of the  Democratic party's election headquarters, this money had been  used to a maximum effect: The party's rating increased  proportionally to increases in expenditures for expansion of  political advertising and pre-election propaganda.    According to Russia's Choice finance officers, the bloc has  spent almost R2 billion.    The Liberal Democratic Party did not submit information on  its election campaign expenditures. However, Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy said earlier that they had spent about R1 billion  on propaganda.    The Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc spent R380 million. As  Igor Yakovenko, a State Duma deputy and a cochairman of the  Republican Party of Russia, told a KOMMERSANT correspondent, the  money probably could have been used more effectively had it not  been for the bloc's organizational weakness: It had been set up  close to elections and its participants did not have enough time  to "get used to each other," and therefore the potential of each  was only utilized to a small extent.    The Agrarian Party of Russia did not go for outside  financing  sources, and only managed to spend one-half of the R100 million  allocated by the Central Electoral Commission.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Return on Investment in Election Campaign Among Blocs Elected to the State D-|  |uma                                                                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bloc or party                         |Money expended per 1 percent of votes |  |                                      |(in R million)                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |LDPR                                  |43.10                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Russia's Choice                       |127.06                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Communist Party of the Russian Federa-|8.58                                  |  |tion                                  |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Women of Russia                       |8.18                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Agrarian Party of Russia              |11.38                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc        |48.97                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Party of Russian Unity and Accord     |117.00                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Democratic Party of Russia            |80.94                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

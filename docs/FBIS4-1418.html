			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannebsurg April 27 SAPA -- Journalists and  Independent Election Commission [IEC] spokesman clashed at the  IEC's Midrand Gallagher Estate headquarters on Wednesday [27  April] over what was claimed to be the commission's evasiveness  over its blunders. The row came to a head when a televised press  conference on polling patterns of the day was ended before  journalists had completed their questioning.    The questions, focusing on the failure of polling stations  because of material shortages, became sharper when IEC spokesman  Mr Kumi Naidoo failed to provide statistics and specific answers.    Questioners repeatedly said the legalistic jargon in which  answers were couched did not relate to information continuously  received by them.    Mr Naidoo said the IEC was loath to bind itself to specifics  before it had verified the data available to it.    When the conference was halted at the end of the televised  slot, journalists objected and demanded that all their questions  be answered. IEC officials insisted, however, that a further  press conference would follow in an hour and the questions could  then be asked.</p>

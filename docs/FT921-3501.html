			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / RTZ shares rise on news of profits SHARES IN RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, rose against the market trend in London yesterday by 16p to 555p after the group reported a better-than-expected 36 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for 1991. In spite of the relatively gloomy outlook for metals demand in 1992, RTZ is maintaining its annual dividend at 19.5p a share. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 879m to Pounds 562m. Net attributable earnings, which RTZ said was the most relevant measure of its performance, fell 39 per cent from Pounds 507m or 51.4p a share to Pounds 308m or 31.1p after a Pounds 74m exceptional item (Pounds 46m net of tax). Mr Bob Wilson, chief executive, said that 'by no stretch of the imagination could these be called good results'. But he pointed out that while 1991 earnings were Pounds 199m lower than in 1990, operating cash flow remained strong at Pounds 744m, only Pounds 57m or 7 per cent less than in 1990. Although capital expenditure was higher at Pounds 307m (Pounds 272m), continuing high levels of cash generation ensured the balance sheet remained healthy, with gearing up only slightly from 25 per cent to 27 per cent. The exceptional item related to RTZ's decision to scrap the copper smelter at its Bingham Canyon mine near Salt Lake City in the US and replace it with an Dollars 880m (Pounds 513.9m) new one. Additional depreciation of the existing smelter is therefore necessary and the whole of this has been provided in 1991. Mr Wilson made it clear RTZ was keeping its options open about the Dollars 770m development of a gold project at Lihir Island in Papua New Guinea. He said that, even if Lihir went ahead with the smelter project, he would not expect RTZ's gearing to rise above 40 per cent. In the face of difficult economic conditions last year, RTZ accelerated the pace of efficiency improvements. In 1991 its workforce (not counting associates) was reduced by a further 8 per cent or nearly 4,000 to 44,600. In 1990 about 7,000 jobs were lost. The group warned that there would be more redundancies in 1992, particularly at QIT, the titanium dioxide subsidiary in Canada. Group turnover slipped 4 per cent to Pounds 4.89bn. Earnings from mining and metals fell by Pounds 61m to Pounds 308m while those for industrial minerals and manufactured products fell Pounds 29m to Pounds 140m.

They mean to say that he has  an outstanding ability to make political maneuvers and  breakthroughs that baffle the imagination. He changed direction  by suddenly announcing during his New Year's press conference  the postponement of the DLP convention originally scheduled for  May, and subsequently on 10 January hosting a luncheon in honor  of the three former presidents.    Where did the president get his idea of bringing abut a  turnaround in the political situation? His intimates unanimously  point out that it was his own well thought-out idea. If so, is  he a person who won't listen to others? [passage omitted]    In the process of adapting a political decision or selecting  personnel, President Kim widely utilizes public and private  channels. What he uses most is telephone conversation. In fact,  he avails himself of every opportunity to make phone calls to  many people to hear their opinions on various matters. He meets  some of them in person, although the frequency of such meetings  has decreased since he moved into the Blue House.    Said an official concerned: "President Kim seems to feel  that  overdependence on information furnished by official agencies  might cause information overload and that there is a limit to  his ability to listen to the public through these channels.  That is why he is in all ears to listen to opinions from all  sources." [passage omitted]    The president often makes the calls himself so that even his  secretaries are kept in the dark. Mostly he does so between the  end of the 2100 TV newscast and bedtime. When he moved into the  Blue House, he carried with him his personal telephone book that  he had kept when he lived in Sangdo-tong. Listed here, titled  "Telephone Reference," are the names and numbers of more than  800 persons, including those who are not well-known, such as his  classmates, hometown friends, those he contacted during his days  in the opposition, restaurant owners, etc. The list also  includes many of opinion makers in the economic, judicial, and  academic communities. [passage omitted]    Said an official: "President Kim has become acquainted with  a  surprisingly large number of people since he entered politics  some 40 years ago. Valuing his ties with these people highly,  he calls them up or meets them from time to time to hear their  opinions on a wide range of issues." He calls just to say hello  sometimes or to hear about the trend of public opinion.    When he discusses policy matters in the economic, judicial,  and academic circles, he hears a lot. Prominent among those in  the business community with whom Kim often consults are: Ku  Pyong-hoe, chairman of Lucky-Goldstar; Kim Sang-ha, chairman of  Samyang Co.; Kim Ung-se, president of Lotte World; Sin Kyok-ho,  chairman of the Lotte Group, and Pak Yong-hak, chairman of the  Taenong group. Lotte World President Kim is the father-in-law of  President Kim's second son, Hyon Chol.    In the academic community Kim consults with: Professors Pae  Chae-sik, Yi Kak-pom, Yi Myong-hyon, and Yi Su-song at Seoul  University; Professor Pak Yong-sik (former president) of Yonsei  University; Professor Kim Kye-su of the University of Foreign  Studies; Professor Mun Pyong-chip (former president) of Chungang  University; and Professors Ha Tok-mo and So Chae-kin of Tongguk  University.    Professor Pae was President Kim's classmate at Kyongnam High  School. President Kim often calls members of "Samsuhoe," an  alumni organization of Kyongnam High School. Reportedly, he met  them once in a group. The membership of Samsuhoe is about 80,  some of whom live in Pusan. In the judicial circles the  president consults with: Attorneys Kim Yun-to, Kim Hong-su, and  Mun In-ku.    The president also seeks opinions from many in the military.  Last spring while discussing the 12 December [1979] incident,  Kim said, "I recently met with Gen. Chong Sung-hwa."    A source close to President Kim said: "He got acquainted  with  many in the military because he himself served in the National  Assembly Defense Committee for many years when he was an  Assembly member. He seems to seek opinions from many military  figures, regardless of whether they are in uniform or on the  reserve list or in civvies."    There is one person whom we cannot omit when discussing  Kim's  private channels of communication. That is Hyon Chol, his  second son. He is currently taking a doctorate course at Koryo  University. It is said that he presents candid opinions to his  father on a wide range of issues.    In the December government and party reshuffle, including  the  replacement of Blue House senior secretaries, some belonging to  the Sangdo-tong inner circle were appointed. Some observers  attribute this to Hyon Chol's influence.    Chon Pyong-min and Yi Chung-pom are said to be assisting Kim  Hyon-chol. Shortly before the new Administration, Chon was  tentatively chosen for Kim's senior secretary for policy affairs  but was later struck from the list. Yi, on the other hand,  formerly served as Blue House secretary for executive oversight,  but resigned because of the controversy over the lawyer's  retainer.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Tao Guangxiong (7118 0342 7160)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--PRC Vice  Premier Li Lanqing said today: President Clinton's decision to  extend China's MFN treatment is beneficial to both countries.  However, China hopes that this issue can be settled once and  for all, which will speed up development of Sino-American  economic and trade relations in a steady and healthy manner.    Li Lanqing said when meeting with the economic and trade  delegation of the U.S. Chicago Management Association today:  The only way which lies before us is to enhance our  cooperation. We should transform past disputes into more  intensive cooperation and dialogue. He was optimistic about the  future development of Sino-American relations.    Li Lanqing said: The United States is the largest developed  country, whereas China is the largest developing country.  Enhancing cooperation will not only benefit our two countries  and peoples, but will also contribute to world peace, stability,  and development.    Madame (Carina Causkenarrow), general director of the  Chicago  Management Association, said: Chicago and U.S. business circles  are very glad about the settlement of the issue of China's MFN  treatment, which will maintain the strong business ties of the  two sides. Our current visit to China is precisely an  opportunity to discuss trade and investment between the two  sides.    Li Lanqing briefed the visitors on the situation of China's  economic development. He said: Now that China has opened its  door, it will open up wider and wider and nothing can close it.  Hence, China will provide greater and greater opportunities for  cooperation. He wished that the entrepreneurs from Chicago  could find new opportunities of investment and cooperation  through this visit.    The Chicago Management Association organized, for the first  time, a delegation to visit China at the invitation of China  Council for the Promotion of International Trade. The  delegation will also visit Shenzhen and Shanghai.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / A new Liffe together: Prospects for UK stock options The flood of young men and women in brightly coloured jackets who yesterday poured on to the recently-opened London International Financial Futures Exchange trading floor for the first time looked just like the futures traders who have been dealing there since late last year. But there was an important difference: yesterday's arrivals were the stock-option traders of the London Traded Options Market, sharing premises with the futures exchange ahead of the two organisations' merger, under the Liffe banner, on March 20. For the options traders, the move - and the merger - do not come a moment too soon. The UK stock options market, under the wing of the stock exchange, has been dying a slow death. Only the option on the FT-SE 100 index is consistently heavily traded; the 67 options on individual stocks have been dogged by low volume. Retail investors have been virtually absent from the market since the stock market crash of 1987. But the woes of the UK options market cannot be blamed solely on stock market weakness. The Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), the German exchange, OM, the Swedish exchange and Holland's European Options Exchange all traded more stock and stock index contracts than the LTOM last year. Individual stock options are caught in a nasty bind: without enough demand from UK financial institutions to create steady volume, investment banks are unwilling to commit the resources to making liquid markets. Yet without such liquidity, institutions are unlikely to be tempted in. The merger with Liffe and the move to share premises mark the options market's best hope of breaking out of this vicious circle. It will have an immediate impact on the one part of the market that is already doing well: the FT-SE index contract. Many traders predict that volume in the FT-SE 100 stock index option could double after the merger, partly because it will bring in Liffe members who had not previously been involved in the options market. 'At the point of merger, with the influx of new members, the initial impact will be on the FT-SE contract,' says Mr Tony de Guingand, chief executive of LTOM, who will be finance director of the merged exchange. The FT-SE options pit is situated about 20 yards from the pit where the index futures are traded - a distance designed to make it tricky for futures traders to work out the exact positions, and hence hedging needs, of options traders, yet to allow the two products to feed each other. 'The juxtaposition of the two products (the FT-SE option and future) will have a dramatic effect in boosting volume,' says Mr David Heron, head of derivatives at James Capel. There is less confidence about the future of individual stock option trading. To bolster the market, a number of changes will come into force when the merger takes place next month. The moves include concessions for marketmakers which allow them to avoid stamp duty and to finance their positions through the stock borrowing system, as well as other ways of making the market work more smoothly. In spite of these undoubted improvements, the merger almost failed because it was hard to find enough firms willing to act as marketmakers in individual stock options. In the end, six marketmakers came forward, but dealers say that may not be enough to provide adequate liquidity. The leading UK investment banks with large trading operations in the underlying stock market will not be making markets on individual options. They benefit from the tax and regulatory concessions offered to marketmakers, since they make markets in the underlying stocks. The larger houses had tried to shift trading of individual options on to a screen-based system, which they believed would have reduced costs. But this was vehemently opposed by trading firms such as City of London Options and Hills Independent Traders. These firms won the battle to keep trading on the exchange floor and have agreed to act as marketmakers, partly because of the associated privileges. But the threat of a move to a screen-based system has not gone away. If trading volume in options fails to pick up, it will certainly be reconsidered. In the meantime, the new relationship is off to a stumbling start, as the two markets live together but are not yet officially married. Until the merger takes place, the shares which entitle holders to trade equity options will not be issued, so some of the firms which subscribed are not yet eligible to trade. In the meantime, only LTOM members can participate, depriving the market of some new blood, including specialised derivatives firms which have made their mark on Liffe, such as Kyte Futures. Once the merged market is working fully, much depends on the participation of UK fund managers, the logical mainstay of the market given the heavy concentration of UK equities in their portfolios. They are focusing increasing attention on derivative products, since the government's recent clarification of legal and tax uncertainties, but have so far concentrated their attention on index products. Liffe expects about 50 new traders to become active in the market over the next 12-18 months. Even if many of these are focusing on index options, the influx of new participants will provide a fillip. 'I think we will see a substantial increase in index option trading, but also a core of active stock options,' said Mr David Kyte, managing director of Kyte Futures. The move to the new floor, at Cannonbridge, a development close to Cannon Street station in the City, removes the last vestiges of securities trading from the floor of the London Stock Exchange, deserted by dealers in underlying shares since Big Bang. Futures and stock index options traders have successfully retained the face-to-face dealing that the stock market has abandoned. For traders in individual stock options, the move and the merger it heralds offer a last chance to match that success.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CREDIT FOR MOM  </P> <P> Your article about the football player in Massachusetts who wanted his mom to  attend the father-son banquet (Sports, Dec. 5) has prompted me to write.  </P> <P> As a Mission Viejo mother of three sons who participated in sports from Little  League through some professional ball, I felt a similar discrimination. We moms  gave a lot of physical and emotional support to our sons and their athletic  quests, but when it was time to take a bow, the fathers were the ones  recognized.  </P> <P> It wasn't just the activities that we mothers were excluded from, however. When  was the last time you, the Los Angeles Times, wrote about "Brett Johnson, son  of Bob and Debbie Johnson of Mission Viejo"?  </P> <P> There is one thing you can't take away from us, however. When those TV cameras  turn on our sons, they always say, "Hi, Mom."  </P> <P> SAUNDRA SCHMIDT  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Vernikov report: "Kremlin and Smolensk Square </F> Keep a Secret Known to Spanish Journalists and Doctors"]    [Text] Madrid -- If we are to believe the Russian  president's press spokesman, as reported by the newspaper EL  PAIS, Boris Yeltsin is not going to undergo a medical  examination at the Barcelona clinic where he had a spinal  operation in 1990 following a bad plane landing.    Although, in the same newspaper's words, a brief stay in  Barcelona is envisaged by the program for the president's  upcoming official visit to Spain. But what visit are we talking  about, since there has been no official announcement in the  Russian press? And so naturally he cannot be going to  Barcelona, where, according to the Western press, our president  is to be examined for pain in the area of the disk he had  operated on.    So why is it that the Spanish newspapers are not only citing  the dates of the visit -- 11-13 April -- and the list of  documents to be signed in Madrid but are also discussing them,  whereas the Russian Foreign Ministry and the presidential press  service are keeping silent about the matter, confining  themselves to denials on detail while not acknowledging the  actual fact of the visit and its purposes? The information  about a Boris Yeltsin visit is not repudiated but rather  confirmed by official Spanish Government spokesmen, who are  preparing for the visit in earnest.    Surely Moscow has not reverted to the say-nothing tactics of  old, when people would learn of a visit by the latest general  secretary at the moment he was taking off or even the following  day?    The Russian Embassy in Spain has also been placed in a  stupid  and absurd position: Politicians and journalists are calling,  asking questions, and demanding interviews, but our diplomats,  being disciplined people, since they have not received orders  from Moscow, are "giving evasive answers" while inwardly feeling  uncomfortable at the need to lie to respected people.    In fact they all are perfectly well aware of both the  precise  date and the program of the visit -- they themselves agreed it  with the Spanish authorities, and the "advance party" called  upon to support the visit is already in Moscow.    But since there have been no orders from the chiefs, there  is  no visit and "I cannot tell anyone anything." Nowadays this  game of secrecy is ridiculous, there is barely any sense in it  and it provides plenty of opportunity for false rumors.    For instance, EL PAIS writes that one of the purposes of the  visit is the Russian president's desire to "make a deeper study  on the spot of the essence of the so-called Moncloa Pact," which  facilitated the peaceful transition from Francoism to democracy.  Or, for instance, it is reported, citing the Barcelona doctor  who operated on Boris Yeltsin, that he has now received a call  from Moscow and has been warned that he will soon be seeing his  former patient.    Especially as the doctor has already been brought to Moscow  in the president's aircraft for a consultation. Who then is to  be believed: the doctor or the president's press spokesman?</p>

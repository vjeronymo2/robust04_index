			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K'ung P'u (7895 0091): "Two Difficult Choices </F> the Mainland Faces Today"]    [Text] Merger of Renminbi Conversion Rates Is a Move  Toward Free Convertibility, But Free Convertibility Is Not  Realizable At the Present Time Because of Fears of Large Scale  Renminbi Devaluation. Tight Money Means Hardships For Business  Concerns, But Slight Loosening Causes Inflation. If an  Value-Added Tax Is Enacted for Land, Foreign Traders Will  Recoil; If It Is Not Enacted, Speculation Will Be Difficult to  Contain    Several major current problems in the Chinese mainland  economy provoke general discussion, and Chinese Communist policy  makers continue to waver between two difficult choices.  <H5>  1. Merger of Renminbi Exchange Rates, But No Renminbi </H5> Convertibility    The first problem concerns the merger of renminbi exchange  rates, which was done on New Year's day 1993.    This so-called merger means that the official rate and the  swap rate for the renminbi were merged into one. This  situation seemingly shows that whereas people could formerly  take renminbi or foreign currency to a swap center to exchange  it, now this function has been transferred to officially run  banking business centers. Some people feel that this was done in  order to link the mainland market to the international market,  enabling free convertibility of the renminbi in preparation for  the China mainland's GATT entry.    Actually, this is not the case at all. Since the first of  the  year, not only are people unable to exchange renminbi for  foreign currency at banks (the maximum degree of  convertibility), but they do not even have the minimum degree of  convertibility, i.e., enterprises that have obtained foreign  xchange from exports may not convert all of the foreign exchange  they have earned. Generally speaking, if such a firm makes $1  million from exports, once this foreign exchange is deposited in  their account, the official banks will convert only $500,000 of  it for the enterprise, i.e., they may convert only 50 percent of  their foreign exchange earnings.    This situation is even worse than before. Formerly, when a  firm needed foreign exchange, it could get it at a swap center.  Now, the swap centers' function has disappeared, but the  national banks will not convert the money making it even more  difficult for firms to use foreign exchange.    Simultaneous with the merger of the renminbi foreign  exchange  rates, the state tightened the conversion of foreign exchange,  The reason was that it feared that free convertibility would  lead to a great increase in demand for foreign exchange, thereby  causing a great devaluation of the renminbi.    Naturally, this has put a damper on the economy's high speed  growth. Because a high speed growth economic policy can lead to  vigorous demand for foreign raw and processed materials and  sophisticated equipment, when demand for foreign exchange is  held down, this demand is a long way from being satisfied making  it impossible for the economy to grow at high speed as well.  <H5>  2. Credit Still Tight Despite Desire To Loosen It </H5>   Following institution of macroeconomic control in July 1993,  money became tight in business concerns, forcing halts or  semi-halts in production. Many factories paid only half wages,  and the ten major iron and steel mills sank into a difficult  situation. Thus, during October and November, the banks loosened  credit by 300 billion yuan (renminbi, and the same applies  hereinafter), thereby somewhat easing business firms'  predicament. Nevertheless, Zhou Zhengqing [0719 2973 1987], a  deputy director of the Chinese People's Bank, figures that the  amount of added investment needed because of 1993's high speed  growth is 1 trillion yuan; hence, as soon as the 300 billion  yuan is released, it will vanish without trace. What caught  the Chinese Communist authorities even more unawares was that  even though the input of money only eased business concerns'  predicament somewhat, information about the early 1994 renminbi  exchange rate merger, tax reforms, etc. stimulated a rise in  grain and edible oil prices during late November 1993, causing  astonishing inflation. The Central Committee was very upset  about this. It immediately held a meeting that stressed the need  to "maintain stability." Once again, it proposed macroeconomic  regulation and control to hold down prices and control  investment in fixed assets.    The Chinese Communists currently face two difficult choices  on whether to loosen or tighten credit. If they loosen the  money supply, inflation will ensue causing social instability.  If they tighten the money supply, enterprises will be short of  funds, and workers will be paid only half their wages or no  wages and all, possibly making society even more unstable.    Another problem is that most of the money released at the  end  of 1993 went to factories to solve their predicament of being  unable to pay wages and bonuses. Business concerns feel that  this did not solve the problem. The present factory work halts  or semi-halts stem mostly from the tight money policy. Products  cannot be sold; thus inventories increase. Real solution to the  problem requires release of funds to the demand side, e.g.,  loosening credit for investment in real estate. When investment  in real estate increases, the demand for construction materials  will naturally increase as well. Then, worries about steel  reinforcing rod and cement sales will disappear. This is the  only real solution to factories' predicament.  <H5>  3. Refusal To Give In on the Value-Added Tax </H5>   Admittedly, tightening of credit for real estate investment  had an adverse effect on investment in real estate in China.  Then in December 1993, the State Council's promulgation of  provisional regulations on the collection of an value added tax  further discouraged foreign traders from investing in mainland  real estate.    By the so-called real estate value added tax is meant that  when a real estate developer sells property he has built or  after a property is purchased, after deducting the price of the  land, construction costs, and 17 percent for taxes, the  government levies a large tax on the profit realized. If the  value added tax on the property's sale price is below 50  percent, the value added tax is 30 percent of the value added,  and rises progressively until the value added is 60 percent.    Government's reason for prescribing an value added tax is  that large numbers of developers formerly obtained parcels of  land at cheap prices from local governments. These developers  could obtain fat profits by putting up buildings on the land.  Furthermore, this resulted in speculation by holders of land.  Therefore, it used an value added tax to decrease the profits of  real estate dealers.    Imposition of an value added tax will naturally make many  foreign traders apprehensive about the mainland real estate  market. For this reason, Guangzhou City and Hainan Province  intimated that the national government might propose, but local  jurisdictions would dispose of the value added tax. In early  February, Guangzhou mayor Li Ziliu [7812 1311 3177] said that  taxes and profits on land within the city would be according to  the former law, and that the value added tax on land would be  handled flexibly. Hainan Province made a similar statement.  However, several days later, Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli  [0491 0112 5668] emphasized that all jurisdictions must enforce  the value added tax in a uniform manner. Before central  government detailed regulations on the real estate value added  tax appeared, seemingly foreign traders could only hold off on  investments in mainland real estate.    Furthermore, the central bank has no intention of loosening  credit for mainland government agency investment in real estate.  As a result, ever since it cooled in 1993, real estate has not  heated up again. Without a warming of real estate, naturally, it  is impossible to have demand for building supplies; thus, the  mainland industrial structure, which is dominated by heavy  industry, may again face a hungry period.    Whether to institute an value added tax is another difficult  choice to make.</p>

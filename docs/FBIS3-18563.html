The group of ten Czech deputies, all members of the  parliamentary Foreign Committee, included Committee Chairman  Jiri Payne. Their visit took place at the invitation of the  German parliamentary Foreign Committee.    Germany urgently needs good relations with its neighbours,  Sussmuth said, adding that the German Parliament intends to  ratify the Czech association agreement with the European Union  before its summer recess.    Ratification of association agreements by large countries is  a sign for the smaller countries to follow suit, Payne said,  adding that Sussmuth was also taking steps to help ensure the  inclusion in the European Parliament of deputies from the  post-communist countries.    The Czechs met their German counterparts, other German  parliamentary representatives and high officials from the German  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defence and Ministry of  Economics. Towards the end of their visit they went to  Dusseldorf, where they met representatives of the Land of  Nordrhein-Westfallen.    German politicians repeatedly stressed the need for the  Czech  integration into the European structures, Payne and his German  counterpart Hans Stercken said, adding that both countries have  a common interest in the Central European political and economic  stability.    Wolfgang Schauble, chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary  group of deputies, said that the discussion of the Czech-German  historical relations should continue. The Czech deputies quoted  him as saying that the Sudeten German question had a German  dimension. He reportedly also showed interest in Czech Premier  Vaclav Klaus's idea of looking for individual rather than  collective solutions. Schauble also said primarily present and  future relations should be stressed.    Both sides said that German compensation of Czech victims of  Nazism had not been discussed, but that the Czech deputies had  made it clear that progress on the matter rested with the  Germans.</p>

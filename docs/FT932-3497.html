			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Letter: Serb leader fails to offer alternative Sir, Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, writes (Personal View, June 9) about the Moslems in Bosnia. He asserts that no Serb can deny that they need a secure home in Bosnia. Is it not strange, therefore, that the Bosnian Serbs, with their self-styled Serbian parliament, refused to allow Mr Karadzic to put his signature to the Vance-Owen plan, which allowed for the Moslems to have just such a secure home? At no time have the Bosnian Serbs come forward with a just alternative. The truth of the matter is that Slobodan Milosevic and Vojislav Seselj, who have between them almost total power in Serbia, are intent on carving out a greater Serbia and the Bosnian Serb regime under Karadzic is a willing accomplice to this. A greater Serbia in their eyes includes all of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the occupied portions of Croatia, Kosovo and Macedonia. Possibly the Moslems may be allowed living space within this but only under the boot of Serb domination. Karadzic describes the Bosnian Moslems as 'our Slav brothers'. Let him and the Serb leadership come forward with a humane and realistic plan for these brothers, which will enable them to live in peace and freedom. The world may then start believing that his words have some substance and are not another smoke screen behind which further ethnic conquests may be made.

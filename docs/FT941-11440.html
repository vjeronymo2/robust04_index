			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / DTI seeks to simplify arbitration law The Department of Trade and Industry has published a draft bill to simplify and streamline English arbitration law. The move is an attempt to stem the loss of lucrative international arbitration from London to the US and the Netherlands. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said when announcing the proposals that the move was part of the government's de-regulation initiative. He said the present arbitration law was difficult to follow because it was spread across three acts of parliament and various pieces of case law. The bill would pull the strands together and make English arbitration more acceptable internationally, he said. The bill is intended as a statement of the more important principles of English law and is designed to be largely uncontroversial by introducing reforms for which there is widespread support. The draft was drawn up in the private sector before being taken over by the Departmental Advisory Committee on Arbitration chaired by Lord Justice Steyn. The document follows the structure of the Model Law on Commercial Arbitration which was formulated by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (Uncitral). This has been adopted by 16 countries. It is hoped the bill will make English arbitration procedures both faster and cheaper by simplifying English law and doing away with the need to adopt many of the adversarial and oral procedures peculiar to common law jurisdictions but unknown in half the industrialised world. The bill contains a clause giving arbitrators freedom to determine their own procedures and to decide whether to follow the English courts' technical rules of evidence. The DTI is allowing five months' consultation on the draft to obtain views on a number of issues which remain controversial. The government specifically wants to know whether the legislation should provide that an arbitration clause is separable from the underlying contract and therefore survives an invalid contract. It is also seeking views on the immunity of arbitrators.</p>

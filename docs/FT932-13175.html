			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Russian crisis hits Moscow Narodny MOSCOW NARODNY, the London-based trade and project finance bank, suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 321m last year because of the Russian economic crisis, it emerged yesterday at the bank's annual meeting. The shareholders, led by the Central Bank of Russia, were told that it made provisions of Pounds 299m against doubtful loans in 1992, raising provisions to 75 per cent of the book value of its loans in the former Soviet Union. The loss is the largest declared by a UK bank for last year, outstripping Barclays' Pounds 242m pre-tax loss. Although Moscow Narodny is owned by Russian institutions, it is licensed and supervised by the Bank of England. The bank said it believed it was now adequately provided for its exposure in Russia, and believed that it would not need to raise the level this year. Some of the Pounds 541m total provisions on its balance sheet might be released. Russia's state-owned Bank for Economic Affairs last year spent Pounds 147m and Dollars 177m in hard currency on new preference shares to restore the bank's capital. Combined with the fall in asset values, this has maintained capital strength. The bank's capital to risk-weighted asset ratio - a measure of capital strength - fell from 46 per cent to 33 per cent but remains well above the minimum of 8 per cent required by the Bank for International Settlements guidelines. Mr Eddie Khamoo, head of financial accounting, said the bank was now well-capitalised and it was unlikely to have to raise provisions against assets in the former Soviet Union this year even if economies deteriorated further. Mr Khamoo said some provisions had already been released, because Bank of England guidelines on provisioning against Russian assets were strict. 'We were very prudent, and provisions are likely to go down this year,' he said. Mr AP Semikoz, the bank's chairman, said in the annual report that inflation of 1,700 per cent and the fiscal deficit in Russia had reduced the bank's assets net of prov-isioning in the former Soviet Union from Pounds 554m in 1991 to Pounds 279m. The bank reported a 15 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 12.3m. The loss before tax rose from Pounds 121m in 1991, while the post-tax loss increased from Pounds 119m to Pounds 316m. It did not pay a dividend.</p>

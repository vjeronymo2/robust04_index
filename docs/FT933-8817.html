			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Arts: Stravinsky and Szymanowski - Promenade concerts This 99th Proms season at the Albert Hall may display a more budget-conscious style of design than we have witnessed in recent years (with, for instance, fewer top-class foreign orchestras and 'name' soloists in the schedule). All the same, plenty of choice things have been collated in it - programmes put together with imagination and flair, devised to profit equally from the BBC's amplitude of resources and the Albert Hall's vastness of size. Two successive concerts earlier in the week made the point in a way to inspire both gratitude and the special pleasure that only a 'characteristic' Proms concert can provide. Both employed large choirs - which, in these penny-pinched days, is fast becoming a sign of wild profligacy - alongside large orchestras to create the sort of musical canvas ideally exhibited in this particular auditorium. Stravinsky's Persephone, given on Wednesday by the BBC Singers, Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, and the (excellent) New London Children's Choir under David Atherton, almost always affords a wonderful Proms experience: a work full of potential awkwardnesses in other contexts which in this one radiates an unstrained serenity and wholeness. The 1934 melodrame for speaker-dancer, tenor, choruses and orchestra is a hybrid about which in later years the composer himself came to express strong reservations - not just over the quality of Andre Gide's verse (which he variously described as 'eau distille' or 'vers de caramel') but over the basic feasibility of marrying spoken and musical material to each other at all, let alone to dance. (In this performance, because of the monochrome, shallow-toned delivery - uncomfortably amplified - of the speaker, Laurence Bouvard, the sense of Stravinsky's reservation was underlined rather more forcefully than it need be.) In the concert hall we lose any embodiment of the physical, graphic quality that was Stravinsky's peculiar musical gift. What we gain - or at least we do in a performance as authoritative, fluent and concentrated as Atherton's  -is an indelible impression of the score's unique beauty. This may be most French-accented of Stravinsky's neo-Classical masterpieces, with textures and phrases of a Gounod-esque limpidity and sweetness, with outpouring of arias and choral setpieces unlike anything else in the composer's oeuvre; but, spread across the Albert Hall spaces, and sustained upon distinct blending of timbres and precise rhythmic currents, its ceremonial aspects develop an almost Russian Orthodox ritualised grandeur - which shows Persephone to be at once a detour and a milestone on Stravinsky's epic journey. The previous evening, it had been the turn of the Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus, conducted by Claus Peter Flor, to make their single appearance at the Proms, and - with Jadwiga Gadulanka as soprano soloist - to come together for a rapturous account of Szymanowski's Third Symphony, 'Song of the Night' as concert-closer. The setting (in Polish translation) of poems by the 13th century Persian mystic Rumi is one of the intoxicating creations of 20th-century music - shimmering, swooning, sensuous in all its combinations - and it was here floated across to the audience in tones of ravishing lustre. Even this audience-member, who normally finds that a little of these particular ecstasies goes a long way, was kept spellbound. ***** In my review earlier this week of the Bath and Wessex Opera performances, I misnamed the producer of The Turn of the Screw. She is Olivia, not Paula, Fuchs. Apologies.</p>

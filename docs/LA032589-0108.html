			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> In his second robbery in a week, a man whom police have dubbed the  "Walk-to-the-Back Bandit" robbed a pet supply store Thursday night of about  $900, police said.  </P> <P> The bandit is believed to be involved in as many as 4 dozen holdups in San  Diego County since Dec. 11, police spokesman Bill Robinson said. He usually  selects a business in which a woman is working alone, he said.  </P> <P> As in past robberies, the bandit Thursday walked into the Petco Animal Supplies  store in the 9000 block of Mira Mesa Boulevard at about 7:30 p.m. He approached  a woman clerk, displayed a handgun in his waistband and demanded money,  Robinson said. Once he had the money, he told her to go to the back of the  store and fled on foot.  </P> <P> The bandit, who robbed the Lubey Beauty and Barber Supply store in San Diego on  March 17 for less than $100, has hit small businesses in East San Diego, La  Mesa, North City West and El Cajon, Robinson said.  </P> <P> The bandit was described as being in his mid-30s, 5-foot-7, with brown hair and  a tan complexion. He was wearing sunglasses, a blue baseball hat, a blue jacket  and blue jeans during Thursday's robbery, police said.  </P></p>

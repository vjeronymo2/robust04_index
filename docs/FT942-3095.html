			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Time to join campaign Sir, Liberal Democrats appear to have been robbed by look-alike Literal Democrats of their seat in Devon and Plymouth East. Having seen the damage that consumer confusion can inflict, they will perhaps now join the other political parties and support the British Producers and Brand Owners Group campaign against look-alike products.

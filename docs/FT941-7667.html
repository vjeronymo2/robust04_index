			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / EU tries to resolve Greece crisis Mr Hans van den Broek, EU foreign affairs commissioner, will today attempt to break the impasse in the dispute between Greece and Macedonia which has triggered a political crisis in the European Union. The Dutch commissioner will present a letter from President Kiro Gligorov of Macedonia to Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek socialist prime minister, offering to renew a dialogue with Athens over the disputed use of the name Macedonia. Last week, Greece, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, ordered a partial trade embargo against the former Yugoslav republic. The ban left Athens isolated and blew a hole in the common foreign policy foreseen in the Maastricht treaty. Belgium joined the US and six other EU member states yesterday in recognising Macedonia. Mr van den Broek's mission offers a slender hope of defusing the diplomatic dispute which centres on Greek claims that Macedonia's name, flag and constitution amount to a territorial claim on its own province of the same name. Mr van den Broek said yesterday that two hours of talks with President Gligorov had been 'very intense and productive'. He declined to reveal contents of the letter, but Macedonian officials said it offered to renew a dialogue under the aegis of the EU and the UN. In Brussels, there is some concern that Mr van den Broek's political mission could conflict with the Commission's legal role as guardian of the Treaty of Rome. Officials are irritated by Greece's delay in offering a written legal defence of last week's trade embargo, especially as it holds the rotating EU presidency. On Tuesday, Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, set in motion steps to take Greece to the European Court on the grounds that the embargo violates the treaty's requirements for the free circulation of goods and for a common external trade policy.</p>

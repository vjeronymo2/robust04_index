Reliable reports at  Westminster indicated that six pay review bodies, dealing with  groups ranging from doctors to teachers, are preparing to defy  the Chancellor's public sector pay freeze.    It is understood that the review bodies are taking as their  base line the 2.7 percent pay rise which MPs voted for  themselves from the beginning of this year.    They are expected to recommend rises that at least match the  MPs' award and may be closer to the average increase of 3  percent in the private sector.    The Government has frozen public sector pay bills at current  levels, which means that any wage increases will have to be paid  for through "efficiency savings" -- improved productivity or the  loss of jobs.    Mr Clarke has already said he will not dip into the  Government's contingency reserve as in previous years to fund  higher pay.    Inflation-beating increases of 2 to 3 percent recommended by  the review bodies will embarrass the Government. Ministers will  face the difficult decision of trying to scale back the awards  or letting them go ahead, stressing that they must be paid for  by more redundancies among public sector workers. This could  result in the closure of schools and hospital wards.    Downing Street confirmed last night that Mr Major had  received the annual reports from the independent review body for  doctors and dentists and that for nurses and midwives.    Reports from the other review bodies covering professions  allied to medicine; teachers; top civil servants, judges and  senior officers in the armed forces are to be published with the  Government's conclusions next month.    Unions representing public sector workers have given a  warning of a "spring offensive" if the Government seeks to  impose a pay freeze and block the awards from the review bodies.    Curbing public sector pay is central to the Chancellor's  efforts to hold down public spending and reduce the 50 billion  [U.S. trillion] pound borrowing requirement. Any significant  increase in pay levels would push up Government spending and  lead to even higher tax levels.    Labour's allegation yesterday that official Treasury figures  showing the tax burden would continue rising over the next five  years overshadowed an optimistic report on the strength of  economic recovery.    According to the CBI's [Confederation of British Industry]  quarterly industrial trends survey, for the first time since  1989 more firms are expecting to increase rather than decrease  investment in plant and machinery over the next 12 months.    But the CBI voiced its concern that the 8 billion pounds of  tax increases due in April could check the recovery. "The  fiscal tightening introduced in the 1993 budgets has yet to  impact fully on the economy," it said. "It will remove a  significant proportion of purchasing power from the economy and  hold back growth in demand."    At Westminster Tory MPs returned shaken by the disclosure  that the average family's tax burden is about to become greater  than it was under Labour in 1979. They are concerned that the  Tories are losing their reputation as the party of low taxation.    Senior Tories are also worried that the Government appears  to  be lurching from one crisis to the next with no clear direction.    With New Year not yet a month old, the Government has become  embroiled by allegations of "sleaze," by confusion over Back to  Basics and now Labour claims that the Tories have misled the  voters over taxes.    There was some relief for the embattled party managers last  night when a threatened backbench Conservative revolt on VAT  [value-added tax] on domestic fuel appeared to have fizzled out.    Tory rebels have decided not to join Labour in voting  against  VAT on fuel at the end of tonight's vote on the second reading  of the Finance Bill implementing the November Budget.    The rebels were told that a Government defeat would have  forced the withdrawal of the Bill, triggering a financial crisis.    The Government's nervousness over the accusation that it was  taxing more than Labour resulted in a round of television  interviews by the Chancellor to defend the tax rises.    Mr Clarke stressed that the increases, which include VAT on  household fuel, were necessary to ensure Britain's recovery from  recession could be sustained.    Both he and Downing Street described comparisons of tax  levels with those in 1978-79, the last year of the Labour  government, as bogus. They argued that people were better off  now than they were in 1979.    Labour kept up the pressure, with Mr Gordon Brown, the  shadow  chancellor, saying voters would never again trust the  Conservatives, who had "lied" on income tax, VAT on fuel and  National Insurance contributions.    "John Major actually promised that he would have tax cuts --  as he put it -- year on year when it is tax rises year on year,"  said Mr Brown .    He released an analysis of Treasury figures which he said  was  a five-year Treasury plan of increased direct and indirect  taxes, showing taxes rising to 35.5 percent of national income  this year to 37.5 percent 1996-97 and 38.5 percent in 1998-99.    An analysis of the figures also showed that at the time when  the new tax increases begin to bite, council tax is expected to  rise 5-10 percent.    Sir Rhodes Boyson, Conservative MP for Brent North, told BBC  Radio 4's "The World At One" program, "We shall have to get back  to low taxes before the next general election, otherwise we will  pay a heavy penalty.    "The electorate may exact their revenge on us."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A workforce of 106,000 employees, 11.58 trillion  lire in investments, 24.896 trillion lire in revenues from  sales: With this identity card the companies involved in the  reorganization of telephone services in Italy have faced 1993,  the year that has seen them lead separate lives for the last  time. In fact, at the end of December, the formal acts required  by the Italian civil code for the constitution of the sole  telecommunications operator, which will have its new  organizational structure by 1994, will be completed.    Even if the new company, Telecom Italia, does not formally  exist, the general lines for its development have already been  traced out at STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company]. The plan  for the next three years is not, as plans in former years have  been, a "company" plan. It has been prepared as a "business"  plan in view of the current situation. It is a group plan that  will identify itself with the new operator plan. It is not the  sum of various company plans, but a plan for a new integrated  organization. It contains the basic directives and the stages  of realization up to 1996.    Italian telecommunications have started to move in two  directions in recent months. The first is the legal definition  of the form of Telecom Italia, starting 1 January under the  convention, and should in any case be finalized by next  September. The second will establish the operational structure  of the company, with the first three-year plan being constructed  "in the laboratory." Though the companies are still separate,  STET is busy preparing a plan which is based on the logic of a  single organization and not on the simple coordination of  autonomous programs.    This first attempt is the premise that will make the single  plan operational for the next period: the three years  1995-1997. This will be the real organizational plan for  Telecom Italia and will be created using this new logic from the  beginning. The strategies are being prepared. Successively  they will be verified by the units dealing with the individual  products, and then nationally. The feedback will be put  together to initiate the process of adaptation to actual market  requirements.    To get an idea of the task awaiting the new single operator  we should consider the fact that the number of telephone  subscribers in our country will increase from 22.35 million in  1990 (with a density of 39.78 percent), to 25.19 million in  1995, and 29.83 million in 2000 with a density of 52.1 percent.  According to forecasts, the percentage increase of subscribers  over the decade 1991-2000 will touch 33.5 percent. In market  terms, a total of ECU92.562 billion is forecast for the decade  1991-2000.    Telecom Italia is being set up to be the sole operator of  all  the services that are subject to controls at the present time.  It is easy to see that when we get to 1998, with the complete  liberalization planned by the EEC, the operational structures  will have to adapt to the new situation. In fact, the operators  for the services to be liberalized will either have structures  that are based on existing divisions, or distinct entities will  be formed.    The operator could have a structure based on operational  divisions for controlled services, and perhaps have independent  structures for the services that are not controlled. Telecom  Italia will come under the STET holding company, so it will be  alongside other companies (software companies, manufacturers,  etc.). Relationships with the outside world, the general policy,  and coordination will be defined at a holding level to make the  maximum use of existing synergies.    The telecommunications world is complex so it is difficult  to  outline a definitive policy at this moment. For example, mobile  radio services, that is small mobile telephones that are  available today using structures of superimposed networks  interconnected with the fixed network, still remain an open  issue. It is necessary to define regulations for  interconnection by evaluating both the technical problems and  the economic problems (access charges and others).    In any case, with the liberalization planned for the coming  years, the operator will be able to offer customers a "package"  of services using a single system that is the result of very  close integration.  <H5>  Internationalization </H5>   Telecommunications is moving toward a world that has no  frontiers. The most recent forecasts indicate that in 1995 more  than half a billion of the 5.1 billion inhabitants of the world  will be telephone subscribers, with a density of 11.68 percent.  At the start of the new century there will be 5.4 billion  inhabitants and the subscribers will increase to 723.4 million,  this being a density of 13.32 percent. A percentage increase of  44.7 percent is forecast for telephone subscribers during the  decade 1991-2000. Furthermore, processes are under way to open  up markets for telecommunications services that will provide  interesting prospects for the operators. These facts alone show  that operators must undertake a process of internationalization  aimed at reinforcing overseas markets. There are two roads that  can be followed.    The first is tendering for licenses in countries where the  system is being privatized. This type of participation would  also provide the other members of the group with opportunities.  For example, in Argentina, STET, having acquired the  telecommunications license for the north of the country, is  providing new openings for both manufacturers and for plant  installation.    The second road is that of the problem of alliances with  foreign organizations. This affects all the group, which  operates in all areas of the information technology sector, and  has areas of convergence between the operators of services,  constructors of equipment, and producers of software. In the  United States, a colossus like AT&amp;T allies itself with  various  local partners to offer its own services/products on a world  basis. In this context the goal of the operator must be to  "serve" business clients, and in particular the multinationals,  with a new supply capability. That is to say the operator must  be capable of satisfying the communications requirements of its  clients with technical commercial structures, and with a  portfolio of products/services that can satisfy a demand that is  becoming more and more personalized, and that as far as  geographical dimension is concerned, often goes outside national  boundaries. It is a process that will become more and more  important in the world of the future and that will cause a major  ferment in the new markets. For this reason the sole Italian  operator has launched its own policy of internationalization, as  the major operators throughout the world are trying to do. It  is an obligatory choice in order to face the opening up of the  markets, in which the competition tends to acquire the richest  parts, given that the market cannot be defended by staying at  home.    Telecom Italia, like the other operators, must rapidly  insert  itself in international alliances where the goal is to protect  the world market that will no longer be regional but global at  the end of this decade following liberalization.    The choices are:    1) To have local distribution agreements for the services of  third parties;    2) To be one of those operating at a global level,  constructing services together with other administrations.    The Italian telecommunications system is classified sixth in  the world for volume of business. Because of its size and what  it can offer, it cannot remain limited to its own country. The  Italian operator cannot just be a distributor at a local level.  It must enter into alliances with partners who will contribute  to increased competitivity at a world level in order to protect  its clients at home, to acquire shares in international markets,  and to carry out the role of a global operator with an  infrastructure, commercial network, and portfolio of  products/services that enable it to acquire competitiveness  worldwide.    The policy of alliances has been pursued for some time by  other countries, and from now on it will be a point of  fundamental importance for modern operators. We cannot wait  until Telecom Italia is ready with all its structures: for this  reason work is already being done so that the new operator can  start off with a precise direction for its actions in the  international market. The network of alliances should therefore  be operative when the new sole operator is officially formed.    An essential point is the choice of partners. It is  necessary to choose partners that have common objectives, in  order to combine capacities and resources, and to be able to  increase presence on the market. The characteristics of  individual operators should be taken into consideration when  seeking partners to bring complementary activities together,  thereby attaining greater competitive strength.    If Italy is to retain its place within the "group of the  seven most industrialized countries" the Italian  telecommunications system but must be an active, not a  subordinate, partner in the new initiatives. It must play a  role of equal dignity in the game of alliances that is being  defined and must build up relationships with the goal of  offering global services: This will start in the first instance  with an agreement between operators. Then it will be possible  to think about successive agreements with other bodies (for  example in the software sector, etc.), to extend the  competitivity of the group, utilizing the synergies of an  integrated system like STET.    The STET group is looking at the future as a challenge that  is presenting itself at a moment that is rich both in  opportunities and in threats. The opening up of world markets,  and their complete liberalization, are fundamental elements  characterizing the new scene in which the operators have to  move. The STET group, understanding the size of the problem  that has to be faced from an organizational point of view, and  the strategic choices that are necessary, has already started to  introduce greater efficiency and productivity on the operational  structures side and to also acquire greater competitivity for  the entire range of its products/services through alliances that  can ensure suitable complementarity.</p>

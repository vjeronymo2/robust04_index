			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Reorganisation at Peat Marwick KPMG PEAT MARWICK, the UK's second largest accountancy firm, is reorganising its consulting arm into a national practice in the first step away from its regional structure. Mr Bob Simm, former head of consulting for the south-east region, has become national head of consulting and will assume partial control over the regional heads of consulting. The firm plans to create a growing number of specialist national centres and encourage greater co-operation between the regional practices. The move runs contrary to KPMG's traditional structure, which operates through six autonomous partnerships - south-east, west, Midlands, north-east, north-west and Scotland. Only 'general partners' share the profits of the practice from across the country. Their identities - let alone their remuneration - are not known by all their colleagues. The remaining partners - about 570 - receive a share of the profits purely from the region in which they are based. Under the new scheme the regional heads of consulting will report jointly to the head partners of their region and to the national head of consulting. Their profit share will still be determined by the performance of the region, but will include a contribution from the national consulting practice. Mr Simm said he hoped to move to a national profit share for the consulting division within two years. He plans several national centres to add to those for manufacturing, the environment and health systems. The reorganisation comes when the firm is going through a wider programme of change called 20/20 Vision, designed to make it more responsive to the needs of its clients.</p>

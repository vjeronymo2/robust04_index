			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yoshio Terasawa, director general of the </F> Economic Planning Agency, by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN; date and  place not given]    [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you want to achieve  while in office?    [Terasawa] I want to see an administration that takes  markets into account. I have the experience of having worked  for private companies. I think I can make myself unique by  putting the experience of having been in a market economy to  good use. I would like to take timely action to deal with the  problem of commodity price gaps existing between Japan and other  countries, deregulation, and improvement of market access.  Besides, I would like to be a mediator within the government  who works from the viewpoint of making the lives of consumers  more abundant. Doing deskwork is not good enough. It is  necessary to absorb voices from wide areas of the private sector  all the time.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you view the current state of  the economy?    [Terasawa] I consider the high yen problem as serious. The  auto and high-tech industries which are supposed to be  competitive are having a hard time because of the high yen  value. Meanwhile, restructuring of companies will proceed. As  far as we can see from the perspective of gains in business  income and investments in plants and equipment, the poor state  of economy will continue.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is your view of the recent yen  moves on the market?    [Terasawa] The exchange market being violently pushed around  by speculators is not desirable. I would like to see a market  that reflects economic fundamentals.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There is strong criticism that the  Economic Planning Agency [EPA] judgment on the economy is wrong.  Do you think the government prediction (of 2.4 percent in  growth) is achievable?    [Terasawa] Certainly, past judgments have been wrong. The  EPA takes the criticism solemnly, and will make maximum possible  efforts to help economic predictions prove correct.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you intend to revise the economic  plan (five-year economic plan to become a lifestyle superpower)  adopted during the Miyazawa government?    [Terasawa] Three years have passed since the plan was  adopted. The Economic Council (prime minister's advisory body)  is checking on the progress being made on the plan. I am not  thinking about revising it as yet.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The EPA is often cited as an  "unnecessary government office."    [Terasawa] The EPA has competent economists working for it,  and I think it is an important office which has the duty of  defending individual consumers and the public. We will be able  to defend the EPA's raison d'etre as long as we perform the jobs  expected of us.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You have long worked in the  securities industry. Using your experience, could you tell me  whether the current average stock of price of about 20,000 yen  is appropriate?    [Terasawa] Six years have passed since I left Kabuto-cho. I  have since worked in international organizations and later as a  Diet member. I have lost a sense of it as I have been away from  the industry for so long; I know nothing about stocks now.</p>

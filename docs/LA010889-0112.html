			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIBYA PLANT 'TOUR' ONLY FUELS DOUBT;  </P> <P> SHULTZ WARNS OF POISON GAS IN TERRORIST HANDS  </P> <P> Diplomatically avoiding use of the word Libya, Secretary of State George P.  Shultz called on the world Saturday to prevent the "nightmare" of chemical and  biological weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.  </P> <P> "I urge you to join me in committing our governments not only to prevent the  use of chemical weapons in armed conflict but also to prevent the spread of  chemical weapons to terrorist groups," Shultz said in the keynote speech to an  international conference on gas warfare.  </P> <P> Shultz did not repeat U.S. charges that Libya -- a nation Washington has long  accused of supporting international terrorism -- is building a massive poison  gas plant in the desert near Tripoli. But there was no doubt that his words  were directed at Col. Moammar Kadafi's regime.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Washington-Bonn Tension  </P> <P> Shortly before his speech, Shultz met with West German Foreign Minister  Hans-Dietrich Genscher in an effort to defuse a growing Washington-Bonn dispute  over American charges that a West German industrial firm, Imhausen-Chemie,  provided technical assistance to the Libyan project.  </P> <P> Standing side by side after their talks, Shultz and Genscher announced that  technical experts from the two countries will meet in Washington next week for  a thorough review of U.S. intelligence concerning the Libyan project.  </P> <P> "We will be trying to provide as much information as we can," a senior U.S.  official said later. "If it's new information, we will (supply it); if it's  more detailed reports of things we have already provided, we will do that."  </P> <P> Genscher said that the United States and West Germany are both determined "to  prevent this further proliferation of chemical weapons."  </P> <P> Shultz said: "I have a total confidence that my colleague, Foreign Minister  Genscher, and Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl and others in the German government take  this issue with great seriousness. They have absolutely no time for any  involvement by Germany, by Germans, by German firms in chemical weapons."  </P> <P> The West German firm denies any association with the Libyan project, and Kohl's  government has protested U.S. handling of the allegations against the company.  Kadafi insists that the plant at Rabta, about 40 miles southwest of Tripoli, is  intended to produce pharmaceuticals.  </P> <P> In his speech to the conference, which attracted 145 nations, well over the 130  originally expected, Shultz said that the world must act at once to stop the  production and spread of poison gas because "ever more lethal and insidious  chemical weapons are being developed -- weapons which defeat defenses and are  devastating in their effects."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shultz Treads Carefully  </P> <P> Shultz's speech was crafted to avoid giving offense. He decried the use of  chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq War without naming either country. The United  Nations has accused Iraq of extensive use of chemical weapons in that conflict.  Iran has been accused of far more limited use of poison gas.  </P> <P> Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, who followed Shultz to the podium,  was far more blunt. He accused the international community of ignoring Iraqi  use of chemical weapons, suggesting that there was little outrage because the  victims were not Europeans.  </P> <P> He demanded to know "why did not anybody think of holding such a conference"  seven years ago when, he said, Iraq first used gas weapons.  </P> <P> He asserted that the conference would have been held much sooner if the victims  had been French, Belgians, British or other Europeans. The present Paris  meeting was called to reaffirm a ban on the use of chemical weapons that was  drafted at a conference in 1925, seven years after the end of World War I, when  the victims were mostly from Europe. That war is the conflict in which the use  of gas was the most extensive and the most deadly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Neither Iraq Nor Libya  </P> <P> Neither Iraq nor Libya was among the first day's speakers. They will get their  chance later in the conference, which runs through Wednesday.  </P> <P> About 80 foreign ministers attended the opening of the conference although  some, like Shultz, plan to leave before it ends. Shultz is scheduled to return  to Washington today after a private meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard  A. Shevardnadze, who has been sharply critical of the United States for its  confrontation with Libya.  </P> <P> In his speech, Shultz said the 1925 protocol against the use of chemical  weapons "had effect for six decades. . . . Yet in recent years, the  international norms against chemical weapons use have begun to erode in  practice -- first in the Middle East and, most recently, in regional conflicts  from Southeast Asia, to Afghanistan, to the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> "A nightmare for all, of course, would be the combination of ballistic  missiles, chemical warheads and biological weapons in the hands of governments  with histories of the conduct of terrorist violence," he said. "There are no  insurmountable technical obstacles that would prevent terrorist groups from  using chemical weapons."  </P> <P> He called for increased power for the U.N. secretary general to investigate  charges of the use of chemical weapons and suggested that the United Nations  could vote economic and other sanctions against violators.  </P></p>

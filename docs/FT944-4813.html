			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Alarm bells ring for China investors: Concern is growing over accumulating problems It was a familiar litany from Chinese leaders at their Central Economic Work Conference in Beijing last week. They agreed to quicken the pace of enterprise reform, improve macro-economic measures and further develop the market system and economic legislation. These worthy aims, which included a call on government at all levels to achieve a 'correct balance' between reform, progress and stability, are unlikely to have lessened the growing concern of international creditors over an accumulation of nagging problems. Companies planning to invest in China are also being caught up in a mood swing that began surfacing last month. 'People are very uneasy,' said an American banker in Beijing. 'Sometime in November the fear factor really kicked in.' It was inevitable that a more sober view of the risks and rewards of doing business with China would materialise sooner or later, but the intensity of present disquiet says a lot about overheated expectations of the past year or so. 'Nothing has changed that much from six months ago,' the banker added. 'But what has changed is that people have ceased suspending disbelief.' Problems that raised the alarm and prompted a rash of inquiries from anxious head offices to their representatives in China and Hong Kong do not in themselves portend disaster but, taken together, create a somewhat disturbing picture. They include news that Lehman Brothers is suing leading Chinese enterprises over non-payment of Dollars 100m (Pounds 62.5m) in losses incurred in currency trading; publicity given to the old issue of long-overdue payments on leasing debts; an argument between the China International Trust and Investment Corporation and the London Metals Exchange over alleged unpaid obligations on commodities trading by Citic's Shanghai branch; and attempts by the Beijing Municipality to remove a McDonalds from a prime site to make way for a Hong Kong-funded development; this despite the fast-food chain having a 20-year lease. For those with a stake in China or contemplating one, these episodes raise the question of whether they are part of a much wider problem, and mark the beginning of a trend. Compounding the nervousness are concerns about China's high inflation rate (consumer prices in the main cities up 27 per cent in the 12 months to October), indications the reform effort may be faltering, a continuing credit squeeze, and jitteriness about a transition to a younger generation of leaders. Western bankers in Beijing are loth to speak on the record about difficulties with overdue payments, mainly from state enterprises, but they confirm the problem is widespread. 'You are going around swapping names these days of who you don't want to deal with,' the representative of a large European bank, which has its share of troublesome clients, said. Representatives of international lending institutions take a fairly sanguine longer-term view of the latest developments, but believe that in the short term, lenders and borrowers are in for a 'sobering-up' period, as one put it. 'There are going to be some hard knocks,' one representative declared. 'Some institutions have been excessively gung-ho about lending to China.' China's international advisers are urging it to clarify what constitutes sovereign risk to calm concerns among investors. Western bankers estimate that about two-thirds of China's external obligations are sovereign or government debt, but the proportion of sovereign debt has been diminishing in light of a rash of borrowing outside the state's borrowing plan. Debt service on China's estimated Dollars 83.5bn external debt at the end of last year stood at about 12 per cent, according to Mr Tan Jian, a finance ministry official, who indicated Beijing wanted to keep the ratio below 15 per cent. A recent World Bank analysis concluded that China's external debt and debt-service position was 'sound' at the end of 1993, but also warned that as state-owned enterprises became more autonomous, the authorities would need to guard against too rapid build-up of their external debt obligations. Of China's various arguments with foreign creditors, the leasing issue is perhaps most revealing of the difficulties of operating in an environment which, in the words of one banker, still resembles the 'wild east'. Banks, including several of the larger Japanese and European institutions, blundered into China in the mid-1980s, lending to state enterprises through newly-established leasing companies in which the foreign banks were minority shareholders. Much of this lending went towards purchases of machinery for textile factories, some of which have never repaid a cent. But the ability of the leasing companies to retrieve the funds is limited by the fact that because they are majority Chinese-owned concerns they are classified as local operations. This means they are obliged to take their place in a lengthening queue of creditors among state enterprises caught up in China's huge triangular debt problem: the inability of enterprises to pay each other for goods and services. Mr Gernot Kluss, chairman of the Friendship Association of Foreign Joint Venture Leasing Companies, is not optimistic that the 31 leasing companies affected will retrieve the Dollars 500m-Dollars 600m arrears owed despite a recent appeal to Mr Zhu Rongji, the governor of the central bank and vice-premier in charge of the economy. But Mr Kluss also warned that if the funds are not forthcoming, it will 'affect China's creditworthiness'. Heavily-borrowed enterprises considered vulnerable to a downturn in the Chinese economy and rising interest rates include speculative real-estate ventures such as hotels, fancy restaurants, condominiums, and golf courses. Funds have poured into these areas in the past two years. Bankers expect the authorities to crack down soon on borrowing outside the state credit plan. 'It's only a matter of time before they begin restricting borrowing,' one Hong Kong-based analyst says. For all the gloomy talk, the fact remains that foreign direct investment is continuing to pour into the country. At the end of October, Dollars 25.2bn of funds had been utilised, up 44 per cent over the same period last year. China's economy is continuing to grow strongly, with growth expected this year of 11.5 per cent against more than 13 per cent last. In most developing countries these statistics would indicate an embarrassment of riches. But in China's case such is the task facing its rulers that international confidence is likely to become more fickle, now that the honeymoon with Western business appears to be coming to an end.</p>

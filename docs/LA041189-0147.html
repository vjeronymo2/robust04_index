Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> AIDE ABSENT FROM QUEEN'S PARTY  </P> <P> Royal aide Timothy Laurence, whose "hot" personal letters to Princess Anne have  renewed speculation that her marriage is in trouble, was dropped from Queen  Elizabeth II's entourage at the public premiere of a new London musical.  </P> <P> But Buckingham Palace stressed in a statement that Laurence had remained on  duty back at Windsor Castle Monday night.  </P> <P> The 34-year-old bachelor, a Royal Navy commander, had been scheduled to  accompany the queen to a performance of composer Andrew Lloyd Webber's new  show, "Aspects of Love," in London's West End.  </P> <P> As Scotland Yard investigated the theft of four of Laurence's letters to Anne  from the palace, speculation about her 15-year marriage to Mark Phillips made  front-page news again today in London's royalty-mad tabloids.  </P></p>

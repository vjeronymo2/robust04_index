			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone message from the Secretariat of the Committee for </F> the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, CPRF, addressed to  the South Korean National Unification Board on 25 May -- read by  announcer]    [Text] We send this message as authorized by a  consultative meeting of representatives of the government,  parties, and public organizations of the DPRK held on 25 May.    As your side knows, at the 11 April joint meeting of the  government, parties, and public organizations of the DPRK, our  side proposed convening a national meeting -- in which  representatives of the authorities, parties, and organizations  and individuals in the North and South will attend -- on the  occasion of the upcoming 15 August [anniversary of liberation  from Japan], a year before the 50th anniversary of national  liberation. As an immediate measure to successfully hold this  meeting, our side proposed forming a national meeting  preparatory committee composed of five representatives each from  the North and South and overseas and holding the first  [preparatory committee] meeting in Pyongyang or Seoul sometime  in May.    Our side has sent the letter containing this proposal to  your  authorities and persons concerned in South Korea via  international mail because we could not send the letter  containing this proposal through Panmunjom.    Our historic proposal for convening a national meeting was  advanced out of a single patriotic desire to resolve prevailing  difficulties, ensure peace in the country, and hasten  reunification in the nineties on the united strength of the  nation.    Our proposal for convening a national meeting wins greater  support and sympathy from people from all walks of life in the  North and South and abroad as time goes by because it is  reasonable and realistic.    We acknowledge that your authorities have no reason not to  accept the proposal for convening a national meeting, which all  fellow countrymen hope for.    If the historic national meeting is convened, its convening  itself will open a new stage of reconciliation and unity. We  will be able to seek a joint way to realize the country's peace  and reunification while opening each other's mind and achieving  the grand national unity through candid [kitanopnun]  consultations.    One should now throw away the idea of confrontation, with  which one has shown unconditional opposition to a proposal,  because it has been put forth by the other side. It is time  that one should open the way out for the nation through joint  efforts while sincerely accepting a proposal--if it is conducive  to the country's peace and reunification--even if it is not  one's own proposal.    We expect that your authorities will keep in step with us by  selecting at an early date the South side's delegates to the  preparatory committee for the national meeting as well as  showing a positive response to the proposal for convening the  national meeting.    Also, availing ourselves of this opportunity, we are  informing you that the consultative meeting of representatives  of the DPRK Government, parties, and social organizations, which  has been held now, selected as the North side's delegates to the  preparatory committee for the national meeting Chong Mun-san,  director of the Secretariat of the DPRK State Administration  Council; Kim Yong-ho, vice chairman of the Central Committee of  the Korean Social Democratic Party; Paek Nam-chun, director of  the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification  of Fatherland; Kim Yong- nam, vice chairman of the Central  Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea;  and Kang Yong-sop, vice chairman of the Korean Religionists  Council and chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean  Christians Federation.</p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Lax EC states may lose rights, says Waigel EUROPEAN Community countries which do not meet the strict economic standards necessary for membership of the planned European Monetary Union (Emu) should not be allowed the same rights in decision making as those which do, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said yesterday. It was unlikely, he added, that all 12 existing community members would be able to take part in Emu by 'the end of this century.' In that case, the European Parliament should have a limited say until all had joined. 'We must develop new authorities,' he added. Managing Emu and the European central bank would be 'impossible if countries with inflation of 15 or 20 per cent had the same rights of co-determination as those which fulfilled the stability criteria, such as inflation rates of perhaps 2 or 3 per cent'. EC leaders agreed at the Maastricht summit in December to press on to full economic and monetary union, including a single currency, by 1999 at the latest. Mr Waigel's proposals - likely to stir resentment in the council of ministers as well as the European Assembly, which was promised increased powers at Maastricht - were made in response to persistent and growing scepticism in Germany about the chances of achieving the degree of economic convergence needed for full-blown European union. There were also protests recently at Commission requests for increased contributions to the Community budget when the stagnating German economy is also having to prop up reconstruction in the former East Germany. 'We are clearly not in a position to provide such resources,' Mr Waigel said yesterday. The Bundesbank has complained regularly that the summit agreed on Emu without the necessary commitment to simultaneous movement towards political union. The minister, however, said he was confident of more progress in developing common foreign and security policy and issues such as a community policy towards asylum seekers and refugees. Popular German concerns have focused on the sacrifice of the D-Mark to what has been called 'Esperanto money', and the country's difficulties with floods of asylum seekers from eastern and south east Europe.</p>

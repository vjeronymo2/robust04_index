			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / BR chairman says rail needs long-term subsidies The government will have to make a long-term commitment to subsidise the railways if the planned privatisation of Railtrack is to succeed, Sir Bob Reid, chairman of British Rail, said yesterday. 'The Treasury need to commit themselves to the franchisees (train operating companies) who will then commit themselves to Railtrack,' Sir Bob told BBC Radio. 'It is the certainty of the revenues that will make Railtrack saleable.' He said the government would have to guarantee a full seven years of funding to a company that took a seven-year franchise to operate a particular train service. The key to successful privatisation was to remove uncertainty about future levels of subsidy. The government announced last month that it planned to sell at least 51 per cent of Railtrack in the lifetime of the present parliament. Railtrack owns and maintains the infrastructure of Britain's railways, including 11,000 miles of track and signalling and 2,500 stations. Its main income will come from access charges paid by the train operators. Mr Henry McLeish, a transport spokesman for the Labour party, said Sir Bob's comments confirmed the party's 'worst fears about Railtrack'. 'The company will be an artificial creation in a synthetic market,' Mr McLeish said. 'It will not be able to survive without long-term financial agreements with the Treasury.' Although the government has not specified the timing of the privatisation, its target is believed to be a flotation in the first half of 1996. City sources believe the company could be worth about Pounds 4bn.</p>

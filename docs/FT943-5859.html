			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (6): Feeling the price-squeeze - Osaka's small businesses are under pressure The hidden strength of Osaka's economy, its army of subcontractors, is coming under unprecedented pressure. The presence of some of Japan's largest manufacturing companies in the prefecture, like Matsushita and Sharp, has supported an enormous network of suppliers, so that small businesses make up a larger than average share of Osaka's economy. More than 90 per cent of the local workforce is employed in companies of less than 300 staff. They produce 65.5 per cent of the region's industrial turnover, well above the 54.2 per cent for small businesses in the Tokyo region, according to the Osaka prefectural institute for advanced industry development. As in the rest of Japan, the leading manufacturers have squeezed their suppliers' prices hard during the recession, as part of their cost-cutting strategies. This has been intense enough to drive some of the weaker suppliers out of business. At the start of Japan's recession in 1991, bankruptcies in Osaka grew faster than the number of new businesses for the first time. The sad trend has continued, says Mr Moriyuki Tsuda, director of industrial research at Osaka prefecture. A tour of local subcontractors suggests that prices are still under pressure, despite signs of an economic upturn, as the latest rise in the yen's value intensifies the pressure on export-dependent businesses to trim their costs. Suppliers of the big electronics companies are an example, says Mr Tsuda. The big manufacturers are understandably reluctant to push too many of their suppliers too hard, partly because of traditional loyalties, but also because Osaka, like the rest of Japan, faces a labour shortage over the long term. A classic example of pressures on Osaka's subcontractors is Takizawa Precision Gear, a tiny producer of machine gears, which has determinedly kept on its 14 staff throughout the recession. Mr Kiyoshi Takizawa, its president, whose father founded the business in 1950, devotes 40 per cent of annual sales to his top three customers. The exposure is big enough to make it impossible for the company to resist their demands for price cuts of between 5 per cent and 15 per cent every year for the past four years. Sales have shrunk from Y300m to Y200m over the same period, perilously close to Takizawa's Y180m break-even point. Instead of sacking his tiny workforce, Mr Takizawa has increased spending on training, borrowed Y50m to re-equip with Swiss machine tools and carried out an engineering cost analysis. He took on two new employees last April, because he says the business will lose its edge if he does not rejuvenate the workforce. Mr Takizawa's strategy of investing through a recession was typical of Japanese industry in the 1980s, but has been widely abandoned by most of its largest customers in the recent downturn. He justifies sticking to the old invest-or-die approach on the grounds that Takizawa has few foreign competitors, operating with the advantage of cheaper local currencies. This allows him to market more on quality than on price. But Mr Takizawa admits that 'there is nothing we can do' if the Japanese market continues to shrink.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ljubodrag Stojadinovic: "The Fourteenth </F> Threat"]    [Text] If our count is correct, this is the fourteenth  threat to the Serbs that bombs will finally start falling on  them. The situation is much too serious to allow for the  counting to continue as a type of inventory of modern military  senselessness. At the same time, it is hard to believe that the  operation will really commence, even if complete agreement were  reached among those who carry the entire risk of deciding to go  ahead with an operation that could be a prelude to a great  catastrophe.    It is precisely in the mechanisms of decisionmaking and  communicating decisions, in the ways of understanding authority,  superiority, and operational finalization, that confusion and  systemic indecision reign supreme. All this could lead to more  confusion and great dangers. The mechanism has certainly been  constructed with the intention of being full of dangerous  "loopholes," in which procedural steps get lost, and big  decisions are made contrary to the norms of behavior. So it has  happened that NATO has slowly, but quite convincingly, become  superior to the United Nations and has managed to impose on Mr.  Butrus-Ghali the insulting and somewhat rusty institution of the  ultimatum to the Serbs.    The time allotted for fulfilling the conditions is ticking  away. If nothing changes, if there is no drama in the hour glass  of the great crisis and NATO's dangerous experiment, time will  run out on 21 February. For whom? What will happen then? What  will happen afterwards?    These are the questions asked most often, both by serious  analysts and the worried world at large, and they all fail to  get an answer because it really does not exist. The ones who  are most passionate about dropping bombs are the most  shortsighted ones. If it were not so, they would soon get over  this desire.    Even NATO operatives, and the headquarters of Italian  General  Boorda [as published], cannot envision what to do after the  first decisive step. For example, a "small" series of air  strikes are carried out against the positions and [artillery]  pieces that for some reason were not moved in time. And then  what? Chasing gunners around the mountains is a painstaking  job, which -- based on the customary habits of the group that  delights in the easy job of hitting large targets -- means that  the planes would then turn toward Serbian cities.    An attack on the cities cannot be hidden, but in France and  Germany there is a firm conviction that it can be justified.  Paris and Bonn are already talking about the "destruction of  the Serbian economy," which, of course, significantly surpasses  the primary idea about "lifting the siege" of Sarajevo and other  cities. It is almost certain that it is not the Serbian  positions, but rather the Serbs themselves, that are the main  issue, as Mr. Clinton himself said, either indiscreetly or on  purpose. The Serbs, and not their guns, are the obsession of  the Western air force that, for its part, has been called on to  finish a job that it does not entirely understand. At least it  does not seem to understand the time and the results that need  to be accomplished before the job can be proclaimed finished.  At this point, there is no longer any need to talk about  injustice, lack of evidence, and marketplace necrophilia. All  those who, for some reason, believe that they are experts on the  matter because they have monitored its development from the  beginning -- providing, of course, that the beginning can be  established -- are persistently searching for an answer to the  following question: What will the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia do? Actually, perhaps the question could be  rephrased: What are they planning to do with Yugoslavia? Has  not a part of the question been answered by the public spreading  of euphoric hate primarily in Belgium, Germany, and France,  where the borders of the bombing raid are expanding endlessly,  both in terms of space and intensity.    Perhaps the Alliance does have its internal answer to the  question of what it would like to accomplish, but it does not  have a solution as to how to do it. For the time being, there  is no talk about the openly announced, but currently frozen  variant of "destroying the bridges on the Drina River," which,  of course, would constitute open aggression against the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia. The drawers with top secret  compartments that contain documents elaborating the variants of  the operation for the complex national punishment of the Serbs,  also contain the outline of the Serbian mother territory  [maticni teritorij], as an excessively desired, but as the same  time dangerous, prize. It represents the unit of measure for  the Alliance's degree of disintegration and the extreme fear of  its suicidal catharsis. For the time being, the Drina River  represents a rather firm border, which they [NATO] would like to  cross, but do not dare, because this would almost certainly  ignite a big fire, the means to extinguish which have still not  been found.    Maybe in this way only a part of the answer has been  revealed: How far do we go? If, of course, all this depended  only on those who believe that they have a monopoly on the first  and last steps. However, things do not usually work in this way,  because it is only possible to control a war while it is still  on paper. Once it begins, its course and fate are dictated by  irrational turnabouts, regardless of whether they are natural or  construed. Just like the series of media suicides at the  Sarajevo markets, the irrationality of which was used as  evidence, which, after all, is completely logical for the  concept of modern warfare.    Today, it is still not possible to say with any degree of  certainty what could happen in the part of the Balkans as yet  untouched by war, and what could cause it to spread. Every  attempt at air strikes carries a risk of this kind, and every  NATO advance toward the Drina River could be an intentional  risk, a walk on the high wire of the precarious stability of the  eastern Balkans. Precisely this is evidence that NATO does not  understand the full implications of the ultimatum, nor the  ethical symbolism of setting it. Time has started to tick to  the tempo set by force, and the question "are they going to bomb  us?" has again become the everyday urban uncertainty. Because  the people (justifiably) believe that bombing the Serbs in  Bosnia would be an unambiguous message to all Serbs, and that  there is no longer any reason for fear, because the uncertainty  is far worse than all the threats.    What is being awaited, what will they do, and what will we  do? There are no answers, at least not of the kind that would  make more sense than looking out of the window into the dark  night.</p>

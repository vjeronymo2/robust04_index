			<p>BFN     [Text] Cyprus has great expectations of Russia for efforts  to promote the next step of the Cyprus issue following the  failure of the talks on the confidence-building measures.  Within this framework, and with Russia's active support, the  Cyprus Government will work toward holding an international  conference.    Yesterday afternoon, Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis  went to Moscow at the invitation of his Russian counterpart,  Andrey Kozyrev, to discuss the issue of an international  conference. In a statement about the prospects of such a  conference, Mikhailidhis said it is a serious proposal  considering that the initiatives so far have failed.    In a statement to reporters at Larnaca Airport, Mikhailidhis  said his talks in Moscow will focus on the Cyprus issue, the UN  secretary general's latest report, and the fact that the report  includes some specific Russian proposals on the future course  and developments following the failure of the  confidence-building measures initiative.    The foreign minister mentioned that apart from the Cyprus  issue, he will also discuss a series of bilateral issues and  expects to sign interstate agreements on various issues that are  already being studied and that will be finalized and signed  during the visit.    The minister said our side considers the talks in Moscow as  very significant for two main reasons: There is serious and  worthwhile Russian activity in the international political scene  and a strong Russian interest in Cyprus. Mikhailidhis stressed  that these facts are very significant at a time when the  Security Council, particularly the permanent members, will deal  with the next step after the deadlock of the confidence-building  measures and will evaluate the various options. He said: We  believe that Russia can play an important role since Cyprus has  maintained friendship and cooperative relations with Russia for  many years.    Mikhailidhis then responded to questions from journalists:    [Unidentified correspondent] Apart from the international  conference, Russia also proposed visits by the representatives  of the five UN Security Council permanent members to the  Nicosia-Athens-Ankara triangle. Do you believe that this idea  can gain ground today?    [Mikhailidhis] I believe the idea of negotiations between  the  UN Security Council permanent members and the sides that are  involved in the Cyprus issue is a very serious proposal that has  prospects. In any case it is a beginning toward the final goal,  which must be the international conference. Our position was  made clear through statements and meetings I had with the  ambassadors of the five UN Security Council permanent members.  We believe that the UN secretary general's report has a very  significant conclusion: That the Turkish side has no political  will to resolve the Cyprus issue or to reach an agreement on any  initiative. Therefore, the next step must be decided through  negotiations. We see these negotiations happening through the  permanent members, which is the proposal that you have mentioned.    [Correspondent] The U.S. and British proposals are obviously  in favor of continuing the confidence-building measures  procedure, and the Russian interest is a counterproposal to this  effort. Do you believe things will finally move toward an  international conference? Is this possible?    [Mikhailidhis] Maybe it is natural for countries that have  invested many efforts on promoting the confidence-building  measures initiative to feel that they must exhaust all efforts,  but our side has made its position crystal clear: We believe  the issue ended with the submission of the final 21 March UN  document. It was later seen that our position was correct.  Further discussions aiming to clarify or explain points or any  other procedure that took place since then has been fruitless.  They were delayed by the submission of the report, and gave  Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas the opportunity to further  delay the procedure and the UN secretary general's initiative.  In his report, the UN secretary general himself says there is  no prospect for the confidence-building measures. So, we  believe it is useless and damaging to continue with meetings or  discussions on the confidence-building measures.    Currently, we must deal with only one issue: the lack of  political will by the Turkish side. We must also answer these  questions: How will the Turkish side's negative stance change,  how will the lack of political will change? We must not take  any steps before clarifying these issues because it could be a  step that would complicate the problem and reduce the  persuasiveness of the procedure itself.    [Correspondent] Can you comment on Denktas' latest  provocative statements about "disarmament" and a "Nonaggression  Pact" between the Republic of Cyprus and the pseudostate?    [Mikhailidhis] Denktas said something that he has repeated  many times. He has only one goal: The recognition of separate  sovereign rights for both communities, which is an indirect but  clear recognition of the pseudostate. He also made similar  efforts during the talks on the confidence-building measures. He  believed the two communities should finally agree on the  measures based on their sovereign rights. We find this  unacceptable. Separate sovereign rights do not exist for us.  We believe in what the UN resolutions say: a single sovereignty.    Therefore, his reference to the disarmament issue once again  stems from his position of recognition for the pseudostate and  two states that will search for some form of a pact either of  cooperation or nonaggression. Our side will not discuss issues  of separate sovereignty. There is only one sovereignty. Now,  on the safety issue. If the Turkish Cypriot leadership feels  there is a safety issue then there is certainly a safety issue  for our side--the presence of the 35,000 Turkish troops. Let us  discuss the safety issue but not the separate sovereignty issue.    [Correspondent] We also heard the option of an appeal to the  UN General Assembly. How do you handle this?    [Mikhailidhis] The National Council studied the options  listed in the UN secretary general's report and made various  suggestions. The Council will continue and conclude its meeting  on Wednesday. I do not want to comment on any option before the  National Council concludes its meeting. All options are open to  evaluation.    [Correspondent] Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias  visited Moscow and you recently met with him. Has an  international conference on Cyprus been prepared in any way and  what do you believe are the chances for such a conference?    [Mikhailidhis] Naturally, the Greek foreign minister and I  exchanged views on Russia's role in this stage and on issues  related to the Cyprus problem that would be raised during  Papoulias' visit in Moscow. It was very important that  Papoulias' visit preceded mine and I believe that now we will be  able to have a complete picture on Russia's intentions and  interest as well as its evaluations.    About the prospect of an international conference, I believe  it is a serious proposal considering that the initiatives so far  have failed. Currently, there is no prospect for new  initiatives, new texts, or new documents. We have tried all of  these over the past 20 years. Now we must approach the  substance of the matter, the presence of occupation troops, the  presence of settlers to Cyprus. That is, we must deal with  those facts that support the lack of political will by the  Turkish side. In time, we will find out if some countries agree  or disagree, but we will work in this direction.    Answering a question on the latest resolution of the  Nonaligned Movement [NAM], Mikhailidhis described it as a  tremendous step forward because it includes all the elements  that we wanted to include. It refers to President Glavkos  Kliridhis' demilitarization proposal, the issue of an  international conference, and the withdrawal of Turkish troops  and settlers. The NAM gave a strong message at a critical time  when we needed it.</p>

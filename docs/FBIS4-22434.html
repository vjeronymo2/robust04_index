			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Bekker and Lyudmila Moskalenko, </F> Novosibirsk: "The President's Edict on Energy Does Not Satisfy  Siberia: Members of MASS Intend To Demand a Review of Prices and  Tariffs". The article is under the rubric "Regions."]    [Text] Approximately 40 heads of administration and  directors of enterprises in 14 krays and oblasts, all members of  the "Siberian Agreement" Interregional Association (MASS), met  in Novosibirsk to review and dicuss Boris Yeltsyn's draft Edict  "On How Relationships in Ownership of Electrical Energy Should  be Regulated Between Federal and Territorial Agencies" and the  mechanism for formulating tariffs on electrical and thermal  energy. According to participants, the discussion in which  "opposing points of view were expressed," was very heated. In  the end, the draft of the presidential edict, prepared by the  Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation [RF], was  declared to be "premature," since it was "put together in  isolation" from the well-thought-out concept for managing a  unified electrical energy system "under new economic conditions"  and "it does not fully consider the problem of relationships  with regard to ownership, rights, and responsibilities" between  the Center and the regions. The Coordinating Council decided  that within two months it would formulate and present to the  government a proposal from MASS "on reforming the managerial  system for electrical energy from the viewpoint of protecting  the interests of the territories."    Representatives of MASS called the mechanism for formulating  tariffs on electrical and thermal energy "incomplete and  unacceptable." Participants of the Novosibirsk get-together  believe that "the intensifying crisis caused by nonpayments" is  but one result of this formulation. For February, 19 percent of  electrical energy and 8 percent of delivered gas were paid for.  The overall level of payments has decreased from 63 percent at  the end of last year to 47 percent in February 1994. Even though  the main victim of nonpayments was the Thermal and Electrical  Power Commission (TEK), as the absolute net creditor, the heads  of Siberian oblasts considered it necessary to fight the crisis  by decreasing or freezing tariffs on electrical energy, which  are, on the average, five times lower than worldwide tariffs.  For this reason it was decided to ask the Council of Ministers  to review the "Statute on State Regulation of Tariffs for  Electrical and Thermal Energy in the RF for 1994." The crux of  the MASS proposals, which are intended to be prepared within a  month, is that the Inter-Regional "Siberian Agreement" Energy  Commission--formed on a voluntary basis--will present Moscow  with "correct" tariffs for industrial and agrarian consumers of  energy, as well as with regular amounts for "light and heat" to  be paid by private individual customers.    Notwithstanding the seeming unity of the meeting  participants, to come up with agreed-upon positions in a month  or two, and even more so, to gain the government's  understanding, apparently will not be so simple. First, a  definitive reworking of tariffs on electrical/thermal energy  will impact on the financial interests of RAO [All-Russia  Joint-Stock Society], the Russian Unified Electrical Power  System, and will threaten the summer cycle of repair work on  stations and electric power lines [LEP]. Mr. Kuzmin, who  participated in the RAO discussions, stated that freezing  tariffs on electrical energy is allowable only if "the  government freezes prices on energy resources and railroad  tariffs." However, prices of oil and coal were liberated by law,  and to push prices back, even through the administrative efforts  of Oleg Soskovets, would not be so simple. At this point it is  worthwhile to note the position of the Ministry of Fuel and  Energy, which was publicized in Novosibirsk by Deputy Minister  Vitaliy Bushuyev: "Either we take the market route and try to  get prices on energy carriers and agro-industrial production to  correspond with world prices or we impose central regulation on  everything. The second alternative spells catastrophe."    Of course, there is an intermediate version of cartel  agreements by industrial branches and enterprises for component  parts, which brings together regional authorities and a number  of high officials from the Cabinet of Ministers and,  specifically, the same Mr. Soskovets. However, the true  intentions and hopes of representatives of the processing  industry, we think, boils down to strictly fixing "energy"  prices, but not paying much attention to the prices charged by  tens of thousands of suppliers to the TEK. It was not by  coincidence that at the meeting of the MASS Coordinating  Council, for all practical purposes no one hardly raised any  questions about converting debts to promissory notes. On the  other hand, there was active discussion on the subject of "cheap  energy resources that are going out of Siberia."    Two more conflicts come to light. As is well known, Moscow  was aiming for the inclusion of a series of hydroelectric  stations on the Yenisey and Angara Rivers in the RAO, the  Russian Unified Electrical Power System, while authorities in  Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk tried to keep them as property owned by  the oblast. At one time, this matter was investigated by the  Constitutional Court, but a final decision was never rendered.  On the other hand, there is no unanimity within the "Siberian  Agreement" on this matter either. As a whole, MASS is in favor  of having a "state within a state" by creating within the  framework of the Russian unified energy system a Siberian  wholesale market for power capacity and energy. At the same  time, however, authorities in Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk are firm  in their intentions to supply cheap electrical energy to the  power-consuming giants of the aluminum industry, while the  leadership of, say, Novosibirsk would like to take that same  energy and divert it to plants of the military-industrial  complex.    The scope of the "state system" discussed in Novosibirsk can  be judged from a phrase spoken by one of the participants: "What  we need now are not structural or organizational perestroykas,  but painstaking work to undo the non-payment crisis."</p>

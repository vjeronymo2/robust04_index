			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> CITY PROMISES TO CUT BUDGET IF TAX FAILS  </P> <P> Unless Oxnard voters approve a 5% utility tax increase, the city must make some  drastic budget cuts to avoid a $2.7-million deficit next year, City Manager  David Mora told the City Council Tuesday.  </P> <P> Mora issued the warning during the first of several discussions on the 1990-91  budget, which is scheduled for final adoption at the end of June.  </P> <P> "The success of that utility tax is crucial to the survival of the city," Mora  said.  </P> <P> The tax, which voters will consider on June 5, would add about $5 million  annually to Oxnard's coffers. However, Mora said, the city is going to proceed  with the budget adoption process under the assumption that the tax will not be  adopted.  </P> <P> Without the extra revenue from the tax, the council must consider major budget  cuts, which could include eliminating jobs and closing several city facilities  such as a youth boxing center, a day camp, an art museum and a library.  </P> <P> Mora and the city department heads drafted a list of budget cut options, which  total $3,649,539 in reductions and include the elimination of 80 full-time  jobs.  </P> <P> During the meeting, two citizens urged the council to spare La Colonia Youth  Boxing Center from the budget chopping block. The center, which annually costs  the city $43,450 to operate, serves about 400 youths, mostly from Latino  working-class families, according to city officials.  </P> <P> Oxnard resident John Hart said he and other supporters of the center have  collected signatures from more than 500 residents, urging the council to keep  the center open.

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: GUS The sleeping giant of the stores sector seemed finally to have woken up last year when it enfranchised its shareholders and hinted it might return some of its cash mountain to investors. But judging by yesterday's annual figures, at least, GUS has turned over, yawned and nodded off again. Expectations that the company would launch a buy-back programme or special dividend were dashed and GUS's shares fell 4 per cent on the disappointment. Such a response seems myopic given the strength of GUS's trading performance. All divisions made good progress, with the mail order arm again shining through. But shareholders have been salivating at what could be done with GUS's underutilised balance sheet, which boasts Pounds 1.5bn of cash and Pounds 1bn of freehold and long-leasehold properties. How the likes of Hanson would gear up from such a base scarcely bears contemplation. GUS, though, seems committed to some more dull plodding which will frustrate its more avaricious shareholders. Lower interest receipts are already dampening GUS's figures. Buying more gilts hardly constitutes the most attractive use for surplus cash. That said, GUS's conservatism has its merits, as is demonstrated by 46 years of increased pre-tax profits with no calls on shareholders during that time. There seems little reason why the company cannot continue in the same vein making it the most reliable of investments. Indeed, investors wondering whether to put their money into cash, gilts, property or equities should look no further. In GUS, they get all four in one.</p>

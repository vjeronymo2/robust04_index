			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Motor industry alarmed as private sales decline A further sharp fall last month in the number of new cars purchased has caused increasing alarm in the UK motor trade that private buyers are deserting the market in growing numbers. Industry officials yesterday described last month's 13.5 per cent fall in the number of new cars bought privately, compared with November 1993, as another indication of the UK's faltering economic recovery and lack of consumer confidence. However, a further strong rise in commercial vehicle registrations last month - of 17.13 per cent year-on-year - and a 15.7 per cent rise in fleet car registrations, is seen by some analysts as a sign that the industry may have to look elsewhere to explain the steep fall-off in private buyers during recent months. They suggest that prices higher than private buyers consider justified, followed by rapid depreciation - caused in part by manufacturers giving priority to the fleet market - are leading private customers to opt for low-mileage used cars. Mr Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, has criticised manufacturers' pricing policies and the fact that cars are mainly designed for the business car market. Overall, he says, the price of a medium-sized family car is about Pounds 2,000 higher than it would be otherwise, and values on the used market have been undermined by deeply discounted sales to fleets. Prof Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School, has warned that many private buyers may not return to the new car market until prices fall nearer to North American levels, which are as much as 40 per cent lower than in the UK. Statistics from HPI, the vehicle finance monitoring organisation, also show credit purchases of used cars rising by 11. l per cent in the first nine months of this year - almost twice the new car level. Manufacturers have expressed concern privately about the trend, but publicly insist that the problem is one of confidence. Mr Ernie Thompson, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said yesterday: 'The continuing decline in the retail market in November continues to demonstrate how fragile consumer confidence remains.' Ford continues to dominate the list of best-selling cars, with the Escort, Mondeo and Fiesta occupying the top three places, in spite of production cuts at the Dagenham and Ellesmere Port plants. New car registration statistics published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders yesterday show Ford was market leader last month, with a 21.83 per cent share, slightly up from the same period last year. Its share for the first 11 months of the year has also improved marginally, opening a gap of nearly 6 percentage points over second-place Vauxhall, whose share fell by nearly one point.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- UK NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS -

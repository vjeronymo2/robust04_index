			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (17): A secretary in miniature - Roy Terry tries out gadgets designed to ease the traveller's life MODERN business travellers who need a secretary to organise their lives can opt instead for a personal digital assistant no bigger than a box of cigars. This product of the electronic age comes in a variety of forms, and can do most things expected of a secretary. It can wake you up in the morning with an alarm call, tune you in to the BBC world service, prompt you to keep appointments, allow you to consult information stored in your desktop computer, supply you with dialling codes and telephone numbers, take dictation, answer almost any query, correct your spelling, and even talk to you in five languages. What it cannot yet do is type your letters automatically, but engineers are working on it. PDAs have all the functions one would expect in a pocket-sized personal computer (PC) - a database, word processor, 'agenda' or diary, and a calculator. But the engineering wizards in the companies manufacturing these marvels of miniaturisation, have come up with distinctive extras which they hope will catch the imagination of executives. Take the Psion Series 3 palmtop, described by the makers as 'the most powerful pocket-sized computer in the world'. Tell it where you are, and it will supply the dialling code for more than 400 cities at the touch of a button. Match that with a list of telephone numbers stored in its memory, and you can keep in touch with contacts around the globe. Apart from that it has features which can keep the bored executive amused for hours on end - if you have time to read and understand the lengthy instruction books which come with most PDAs. Hewlett-Packard, on the other hand, describes its HP 95LX as a 'true companion to the desktop PC'. What this means is that anything the desktop can do, the HP 95LX does on a smaller scale. Worksheets, documents, letters and other files needed on your travels can be transferred from your desktop to your pocket computer. It can also print out any document on an equally portable printer. The Sharp IQ-8400 is an electronic organiser that enables you to have on hand a wealth of reference material, such as a thesaurus, incorporating a spell-check facility, bilingual dictionaries for English/French and English/German, and an eight-language translator of common phrases, which includes Japanese. It also has a to-do function, which acts as a reminder of essential tasks for the day. The Olivetti Quaderno is one step along the way towards the voice activator  -the ultimate aim of all designers. Olivetti calls it a voice management facility. A microphone enables you to record spoken notes and messages, and these voice files can be integrated on to text files where they are played back on cue, enabling you to update your information. A variation on PCs and organisers is the Sony Data Discman, which can best be described as a hand-held electronic library. No bigger than a blockbuster-sized paperback, you can access a variety of discs, among them the Concise Oxford Dictionary, Hutchinson's Encyclopaedic Dictionary, a Golf Guide to Europe, a Time Out Guide to four cities and, soon, the Financial Times Guide to European companies. All these PDAs have one disadvantage, especially for touch-typists. As one user said: 'To use the keyboards, you need a pencil-sharpener for your fingers.' This is where the Amstrad Notepad comes into its own. The keyboard is 11 3/4 inches wide and comfortable to use. Although it cannot fit into your pocket, it will easily slot into your briefcase. The Amstrad's main selling point is: 'If you can't use this computer in five minutes, you'll get your money back.' Only the worst cases of colour blindness are likely to be asking for the return of Pounds 199.99. What these portable PCs cannot yet do is keep you up to date with world events. The Philips World Receiver radio is small enough to fit into a pocket, yet sophisticated enough to tune into stations worldwide. It has a world map on a liquid crystal display, 13 shortwave bands and direct frequency key-in with 18 presets. Competing against it is the Sony ICF SW55, with a 25-station name memory. Most PDAs have built-in alarm calls, but none can boast the accuracy of a new clock from Junghans. An internal antenna picks up a radio time-signal from the National Physical Laboratory, and the clock resets itself automatically. It even adjusts for British Summer time and, across the Channel, it will reset itself to local time. A regular little chatterbox is the Interpreter, which speaks fluent English, French, German, Italian and Spanish. Enter a key word, such as 'car', and it displays 'Can I hire a car?' instantly. Press a button for German, and it will speak: 'Darf ich ein Auto mieten bitte?' Its memory includes 700 commonly-used phrases across 14 categories, and, in practice, it could talk for 20 hours without repeating itself. Battery shavers have been available for some time, but none has been as light as the latest models. The Braun Pocket Battery Traveller weighs only 224 grammes with the batteries, and includes a pop-up long-hair trimmer. The Philishave also includes a trimmer, and has a battery which lasts for two weeks after an eight-hour charge. The Philips Ladyshave can be used in and out of water, and its two batteries last for 35 minutes. A real boon for women who need hair rollers is the latest Carmen Curl. Instead of electricity or gas, it relies on activated carbon sachets which are first shaken and then inserted into the rollers heating them automatically. The latest dictation machines are lighter than ever before. Sony claims that its M-909 is the 'world's smallest tape recorder'. It is 67.6mm wide, 64.6mm long and 18.5mm deep, or about 2 1/2 inches square by less than an inch thick. Philips relies on its more conventional Pocket Memo range, which weigh from 145 grammes to 185 grammes. After the day's work, what better than a round of golf on a famous American course? It might be thought of as a toy, but the Pro Golf II offers wind and weather variations, and even your swing can be adjusted. You can hook, slice, land up in a bunker or produce the perfect putt from the edge of the green. With a little practice, you can play like Nick Faldo - theoretically, of course. The business traveller, equipped with all the gadgets available these days, is bound to need something special in the way of luggage. What better than a Piggyback trolley case which converts into a luggage cart? Simply raise the pull handle, fasten other cases with the retractable strap, and you are laughing while everybody else scrambles for a trolley. Bon voyage. . .

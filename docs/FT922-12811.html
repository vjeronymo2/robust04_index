			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Ashdown urges PR inquiry MR PADDY Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday called on the next Labour leader to join his party in initiating a commission on electoral reform. A joint inquiry should be an early priority for the incoming Labour leader, because as the next general election approaches, 'political competition will inevitably come between us, disappointing many millions who want to see an end to Conservative hegemony', Mr Ashdown said. He proposed a National Electoral Reform Commission open to politicians, churches, trade unionists and other organisations. It would resolve how a system of proportional representation could be introduced.</p>

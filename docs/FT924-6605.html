			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Pressure on British Gas pay-out Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, reiterated yesterday the company's policy to increase the pay-out but warned it was under pressure. 'Clearly with the threat to the gas business and the more cyclical nature of exploration and production earnings, we may have to assess it.' Analysts believe, however, it may be forced to revise its policy of increasing its dividend in line with inflation if it continues to confront rising competition and lower prices for domestic gas sales. They forecast that the dividend will remain flat for the next five years as it the company witnesses the erosion of its UK gas business. Mr Steve Turner, energy analyst at Smith New Court, believes dividend growth will be below earnings in the medium term, which he expects to be 'pedestrian.' Turnover improved to Pounds 1.41bn (Pounds 1.34bn) for the third quarter; UK gas supply contributed Pounds 1.04bn (Pounds 966m) with a reduced operating loss of Pounds 214m (Pounds 260m). Exploration and production turnover fell slightly to Pounds 122m (Pounds 129m) with operating losses down from Pounds 29m to Pounds 18m. Turnover for nine months amounted to Pounds 6.92bn (Pounds 7.22bn). Losses for the third quarter worked through at 4.4p (4.9p) per share; earnings per share for the nine months were 10.4p (16p). COMMENT British Gas is asking shareholders to be patient while the company undergoes a wide-ranging review by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which is unlikely to be completed before next summer. Until it knows the results of the inquiry, the company says it is difficult to plan ahead or institute any sizeable cost-cutting. The shares are offering a yield premium of about 40 per cent over the rest of the market and shareholders may expect to realise value if the MMC forces the company to break itself up. But dividend growth could be threatened by the continuing pressure on the company's UK business. Although profit forecasts range widely, there is a common feeling among analysts that British Gas will lag the market once the economy starts to come out of recession.</p>

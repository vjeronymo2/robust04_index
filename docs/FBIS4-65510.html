			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- In spite of the tight budget situation,  Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of  Germany) wants to reduce further the rates of the income and  corporate tax. However, before that, the 7.5-percent solidarity  surcharge that is to be reintroduced in 1995 "must be abolished  at the earliest possible date," Rexrodt announced at the meeting  of medium-seized enterprises in Bonn today. In fact, the  location safeguarding law has reduced the tax rates to the  lowest point since the war, "but we must proceed on this path  because the taxation of our enterprises is still unfavorable."    In front of representatives of 22 associations of  medium-sized enterprises, the economics minister confirmed his  intention to abolish the property tax on enterprises and the  trade capital tax by 1 Janaury 1966. Rexrodt stressed:  "Lowering the corporate tax is the best program for the  medium-sized enterprises." Tax privileges for risk capital for  innovative small and medium-sized enterprises in the new laender  might also be useful.    As far as the implementation of the 1-billion-mark scheme,  promised by the banks for the eastern German economy, is  concerned, the majority of the sum should be granted to  medium-sized industrial enterprises. Rexrodt stressed:  "However, we should jointly think about how more private  foreign equity capital can generally be attracted -- preferably  in the form of active shares to combine the transfer of capital  and know-how." To improve vocational training, he wants to  "ensure that the promotion of trade will be maintained at the  current level, and that sufficient apprenticeships are available  in the new laender."    Referring to a reduction of the corporate tax, the minister  pointed out that the tax quota in Germany is among the highest  in industrialized nations, Rexrodt emphasized. Particularly the  taxes that do not depend on the profit represent a clear  disadvantage in international competition. Moreover, the trade  income tax should be reduced. In return, the communes should  participate in the turnover tax. As a result of the reduction  of the trade income tax, "the cause for the split top rate of  the income tax would also disappear," Rexrodt explained. Since  the beginning of the year, it has been 53 percent for private  income and 47 percent for business income. The corporate tax is  currently 45 percent. According to Rexrodt, this split should  temporarily compensate for the special burden on the trade tax  until its reform.</p>

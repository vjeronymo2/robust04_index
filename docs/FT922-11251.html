			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / UK Company News: WMC warns of strike impact at nickel mine WESTERN Mining Corporation (WMC), the Australian resources group, said production at its Kambalda nickel operations in Western Australia had been seriously affected by industrial action in the three quarters to the end of March. Mr Hugh Morgan, managing director, said overall production was satisfactory, but nickel and gold output had been affected by the company's long-running dispute with the miners' union. WMC's third-quarter production report showed that ore treated at Kambalda fell to 763,000 tonnes over the first nine months, compared with 910,024 tonnes in the comparable period of the previous year. The company has been in dispute with the unions at Kambalda since last year. A 19-day strike ended earlier this month when workers were ordered to return by the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission. WMC says negotiations are continuing, but claims that Kambalda can only remain open if workers agree to replace five-day mining in shifts with continuous mining over seven days. The group announced in November that it intended to abandon plans for a ADollars 105m (USDollars 80.7m) expansion of nickel production at Kambalda because of opposition from the union, which it said had 'reneged' on an earlier deal. The proposed expansion would have increased deep mining at several mines in the Kambalda area, where WMC produces around 35,000 tonnes of nickel a year. The project was part of a ADollars 400m programme intended to increase the group's nickel output to 65,000 tonnes a year from 53,000.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    NRI TOKYO BOND INDEX  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    PERFORMANCE INDEX                                      Average December 1983 = 100                  yield   Last   12 wks   26 wks                           23/4/92     (%)    week     ago      ago Overall                    172.07   5.52   172.20   170.98   164.48 Government Bonds           170.37   5.43   170.71   169.92   162.73 Municipal Bonds            173.39   5.99   173.00   172.60   166.71 Govt.- guaranteed Bonds     176.15   5.97   175.78   174.90   169.15 Bank Debentures            168.33   5.23   168.50   166.69   160.68 Corporate Bonds            174.88   6.28   174.68   172.68   166.85 Yen-denom.

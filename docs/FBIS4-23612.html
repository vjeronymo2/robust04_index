			<p>BFN     [Text] Negotiations between representatives of the two  Rwandan fighting armies continue. The talks started at the UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda headquarters at the Amahoro Hotel  at 0900 and ended its proceedings at 1630. The talks will  resume on 13 June at 1000 in the morning.    The talks are within the framework of efforts aimed at  achieving a cease-fire. The Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA]  delegation was led by Colonel Frank Mugambage while Col. Marcel  Gatsinzi led the Government Army delegation.    The talks focused on the cease-fire document. But so far,  the conditions set by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] have not  been met by the other party to the negotiations. An example  among the many others is that up to now the killings carried out  by the government forces in collaboration with the Interahamwe  [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development]  continue to intensify instead of being brought to a halt which  is what the RPF has demanded. There are also the propaganda  programs of Radio Rwanda and Radio-Television Libre des Mille  Collines which continue to incite the people to kill one another  and to send them to the killing battlefields.    Col. Gatsinzi, the leader of the government Army delegation,  denied spreading lies on foreign radios during the meeting, an  allegation made against him by the RPA delegation. He also  denied disclosing the contents of the negotiations, which is  also not allowed.    The meeting will resume on Monday, 13 June 1994.</p>

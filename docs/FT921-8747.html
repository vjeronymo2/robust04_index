			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Books: Hemingway sans teeth LESS THAN A TREASON: HEMINGWAY IN PARIS by Peter Griffin Oxford Pounds 14.95, 206 pages THE FIRST part of Peter Griffin's threatened multi-volume biography of Ernest Hemingway, Along with Youth, published in 1985 to critical plaudits from the likes of Raymond Carver and Mario Vargas Losa, dragged us from birth to the year of Hemingway's marriage to Hadley Richardson in 1921. It encompassed such matters as his war-time exploits in Italy and the writing of his first short story. This second volume is the tale of the Paris years, 1922-26, in which the author begins to take his art seriously, becomes fanatically addicted to Spain and bullfighting, and falls out of love with the hapless Hadley. Hemingway's prose style has been mimicked by many lesser writers, and the results are almost always the same: naivety and artlessness. Unfortunately, Peter Griffin has decided that the best way of making his own mark as a biographer of Hemingway - and it is a difficult field to enter given the plethora of biographies that are already in print - is to do as Hemingway did. He even declares as much in his epilogue, where he speaks of A Moveable Feast (Hemingway's fictionalised memoir of the same period, published in 1964) as offering 'the biographer a chance to give his story of Ernest's life the texture of Ernest's fiction'. What we are therefore offered is a brief, fictionalised reconstruction of the man and his milieu; an unadorned narrative with the minimum of fuss. Unfortunately, the minimum of fuss does not necessarily make for the maximum of impact. In January 1926 Hemingway set sail on the Mauretania for New York, prepared to do battle with two enemies: the publisher of his first collection of stories and the man responsible for depleting his wife's capital. The first paragraph of the opening chapter contains the following sentence: 'When the ship started to move, Ernest did not look out the window of the sitting room.' This, in a the failure of Griffin's biographical method for three reasons. The statement overwhelms by its dullness; it cannot possibly be proved one way or the other; it fails to animate the narrative. This trick of presentation - to treat Hemingway and his circle as if they were hand puppets to be manipulated in such a way as to suggest that they are characters in a work of fiction - is the height of absurdity. The tableaux prove lifeless, the details wooden. Each one remains a ghostly, impalpable presence - and Hemingway is the most impalpable of all. We recognise this fact when Peter Griffin quotes Hemingway's actual words. This gritty, pugnacious statement jumps out at us from amidst all the bland fictionalising on page 122, for example: 'the diseased oyster shits the finest pearl, as the palmist says'. That is the true spirit of Hemingway. Instead, we have to make do with such statements as this: 'the cathedral looks a sheer cliff, with spires domed like churches in the pagan East'. The speaker is standing in the Place Ste. Sulpice when he makes this statement, staring at - what? The sentence would suggest that it might be the Cathedral of Notre Dame - but the cathedral is not visible from that square. A second possibility might be the Eglise Sainte Sulpice, the great 18th-century church which dominates the square. But a church, no matter how pompous, is not a cathedral; and this one has twin towers, not spires. And as for doming anything with a spire . . . At the end of this stream of seemingly endless, tasteless hors d'oeuvre, we long to chew on the meat of Carlos Baker. When Griffin has learnt to write biography, I would suggest he spends a month or two in Paris in order to establish whether, amongst other things, Montmartre is on the left or on the right bank of the Seine.</p>

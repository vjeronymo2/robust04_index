			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Letter: Actuarial feasibility Sir, With reference to Peter Somner's letter on insurance protection for software (October 8), could I suggest that he undertakes a course of study in actuarial science before commenting on what is or is not feasible using modern-day actuarial techniques. Actuarial judgment is of value wherever a combination of both mathematical reasoning and common sense is required.

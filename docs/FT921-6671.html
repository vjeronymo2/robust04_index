			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Strong exports help lift EdF ELECTRICITE de France (EdF), the power utility which is western Europe's largest energy exporter, yesterday reported a steep rise in profits, writes William Dawkins. Net earnings at EdF rose from FFr100m (Dollars 17.8m) in 1990 to FFr1.9bn last year, before a FFr500m levy collected by its government owner, on turnover up by 9.6 per cent from FFr156.5bn to FFr171.4bn. Mr Pierre Delaporte, president, attributed the improvement to a strong rise in demand for EdF electricity from Britain and Germany, with a steady rise in French domestic sales. He expected FFr2bn of profits this year. Export sales rose 18 per cent to FFr12bn, representing 53.4bn kilowatt hours (kWh) out of total output of 406.5 kWh.</p>

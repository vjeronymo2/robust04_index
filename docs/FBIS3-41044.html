Among the possible variants for utilizing the  highly-enriched uranium removed from nuclear warheads, the  proposal by the American "General Atomics" company was the most  acceptable. The contract provided for creating in Ukraine a  joint enterprise to process highly-enriched uranium and  transform it into nuclear fuel for atomic electric power plants  [AES's].    The following are the advantages of this variant:    -- no expenditure associated with the transportation of  highly-enriched uranium;    -- with the help of contemporary ecologically safe  technologies, highly-enriched uranium may be effectively  transformed into fuel;    -- conditions are created for Ukraine to earn hard currency  rapidly;    -- Ukraine's long-term technological cooperation with the  world's advanced companies in the sphere of nuclear power  engineering.    An enterprise, more specifically a small production unit,  may  be built within one or two years. The cost of the construction  is $30 million. After the fulfillment of the program for  processing the highly-enriched uranium, the production may be  reprofiled for the needs of Ukraine's nuclear-fuel cycle.    2. The transfer of nuclear warheads to Russia is stipulated  by interstate documents "The Main Principles of the Utilization  of Nuclear Charges of the Strategic Nuclear Forces Deployed in  Ukraine" and "The Agreement Between the Ukrainian Government and  the Government of the Russian Federation on the Utilization of  Nuclear Warheads," which were signed on 3 September 1993 in  Massandra [in the Crimea] during the meetings of presidents L.M.  Kravchuk and B.N. Yeltsin. In accordance with the clauses of  the aforementioned agreements, Ukraine committed itself to  transferring to Russia all types of nuclear warheads of  intercontinental nuclear missiles and air-launched cruise  missiles for them to be dismantled and utilized.    No other possible variants of dismantling nuclear warheads  were considered.    3. On the world market, the price of nuclear fuel, which is  supplied in accordance with long-term contracts, amounts to  between $1,000 and $1,400 per kilogram. One-time agreements on  fuel supply are somewhat cheaper -- between $600 and $700 per  kilogram.    Ukraine receives all its fuel for atomic plants from Russian  enterprises at prices close to world prices. However, practice  shows that the majority of world countries with nuclear power  engineering have their own enterprises that manufacture fuel  cartridges because it is economically rational. Ukraine has  large deposits of uranium ore and some functioning enterprises  of the nuclear-fuel cycle -- the enrichment of crude uranium,  production of zirconium for heat-generating elements, absorbing  materials, and so on. That is why it would be much more  profitable for Ukraine to manufacture our own fuel cartridges  than to purchase them from Russia. The cost of constructing  such an enterprise is about $500 million; it could be built  within two or three years; in the conditions prevailing in  Ukraine, the period of recoupment would be three years.    4. If we proceed from the assumption that capacities for the  production of nuclear fuel are created in Ukraine, something  upon which Ukrainian nuclear specialists and scientists insist,  then it is most expedient to use nuclear materials from the  warheads for the needs of our own power engineering.    If nuclear warheads are transferred to Russia, it is much  more profitable for Ukraine to receive compensation for the  nuclear materials, and not compensation in the form of nuclear  fuel. For example, in accordance with some estimates, the cost  of highly-enriched uranium is 100 times that of the price of  low-grade uranium contained in the fuel cartridge, and  weapons-grade plutonium costs between five and 10 times that of  the highly-enriched uranium. That is why Ukraine is entitled to  compensation of $10 billion for the nuclear materials from  tactical weapons alone. The cost of all those fuel cartridges,  which Russia promises to supply in exchange for Ukraine's  nuclear weapons will only constitute between $1 billion and $2  billion.    5. The problem here lies not so much in the inability of  scientific collectives as in the absence of desire on the part  of our leadership to do something.    6. In accordance with Ukraine's Supreme Council decree "On  Additional Measures for Ensuring Ukraine's Nonnuclear Status,"  which was adopted in April 1992, the government had to take  urgent measures to establish effective technological control  over the nonuse of the nuclear weapons located on the territory  of Ukraine. It was planned to have this work fulfilled by one of  the Kharkiv Institutes which developed practically all systems  of control over the former USSR's strategic offensive weapons.    The Supreme Council's decisions have not been fulfilled to  this day and, for that reason, it is, probably, appropriate to  speak about seven to 10 years, in order not to do anything at  all.    Partnership for Peace is the attempt, on the part of the  United States, without entering into a conflict with Russia, to  fill in that vacuum of security that resulted from the  disintegration of the Warsaw Pact and the USSR. However, in  conditions of political instability and expansion of the  revanchist moods in Russia, the West's indecisiveness in  creating effective security systems in Europe may lead to yet  another redivision of the spheres of influence and to a  restoration of Russian hegemony within the CIS or Eastern Europe.</p>

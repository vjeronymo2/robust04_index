			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cutting down on the credits Zapping - switching between different television channels by viewers - is the TV advertiser's nightmare, particularly when it happens during or just before a commercial break. Anything which induces a viewer to opt out of expensively purchased airtime is therefore of interest to those who have the job of deciding where advertisements should be placed. The latest viewer research, conducted by the ITV Network Centre for the independent television companies in the UK, shows that surprisingly few viewers switch over during the break itself; the main culprit seems to be the credits at the end of programmes. The study indicates that by the time the credits reach best boy or chief gaffer, viewers are highly likely to have reached for the remote control, zapped and then missed the ensuing ads. Only too aware of the increasing competition from cable and satellite and the need to keep advertisers sweet, the ITV companies have immediately responded to the research by announcing a reduction in the length of credits. The aim now will be to cut credits to 20 seconds at the end of a programme which lasts an hour or less - ITV companies say that many programmes exceed the current unofficial guideline of 30 seconds. The research also reveals that breaks of five minutes or more lose viewers. The study concludes: 'The findings are unequivocal - if ITV is to maximise the audience to commercial breaks, as many breaks as possible should be less than five minutes in duration.' More frequent, but shorter breaks, therefore, seem on the cards. Longer term, the threat for advertisers is that viewers decide not only to zap, but to edit out the breaks altogether by using the video-recorder technology that already exists to eliminate the breaks. In this way they order what they want to watch, rather than waiting for it to be served up.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By our diplomatic editor] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, March 2:- The talks here later this  month between U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia  Robin Raphel and Indian officials on Indo-American relations are  expected to pave the way for the Prime Minister's trip to  Washington towards the middle of the year.    Ms. Raphel, who has become controversial due to her  statements questioning the validity and finality of Kashmir's  accession to India, and who insists on visiting India shall be  extended due courtesies. She will be able to meet officials as  well as political leaders during her five-day stay from March  22. She has even sought a meeting with the Prime Minister, which  could not be arranged earlier when she left India to take up her  new assignment in the State Department.    The U.S. Government is currently engaged in a damage  limitation exercise following Ms. Raphel's unwelcome  pronouncements and has assured the Indian Government that no  anti-lndia bias or pro-Pakistan tilt has overtaken the Clinton  Administration and that relations with India remain strong and  are bound to grow. Some of President Clinton's remarks  regarding Kashmir and human rights must be viewed in the context  of U.S. domestic policy compulsions and not in that of  Indo-American relations, which continue to expand.    As regards Kashmir, the U.S. always believed that the issue  should be resolved bilaterally by India and Pakistan under the  Simla Agreement and Washington is not projecting itself as a  mediator. It has no strategic interests in the State but  desires that the problem be resolved in the interest of peace  and stability of the subcontinent.    The External Affairs Ministry was initially lukewarm to Ms.  Raphel's visit and did not agree to any of the dates suggested  by her. President Clinton's as well as Ms. Raphel's remarks  were appropriately responded to and their criticism rebutted.  However, the new Foreign Secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, as well  as the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, took the  view that points of difference should not spoil the otherwise  sound relations between the world's two largest democracies and  that there are areas where India and the U.S. should work  jointly and effectively. Discussions could be held to find  common ground and they could even agree to disagree on some  points. A discussion could help articulate each other's  concerns and remove misconceptions which were often at the root  of mispronouncements.    It is thus clear that the Indian officials shall be willing  to listen to what Ms. Raphel has to say in the hope that she too  will be in a mood to hear patiently what they have to say. The  Clinton Administration's South Asia policy has been articulated  repeatedly by Ms. Raphel and other officials and hence its  reiteration is not necessary. Any impression that the present  Administration has a closed mind on subjects such as Kashmir,  human rights, and nuclear non-proliferation will not further the  Indo-U.S. dialogue. Both sides must be prepared to listen to  each other's point of view and appreciate mutual concerns.    The Indian Government is appreciative of U.S. support for  its  economic liberalisation policies and feels that there ought to  be no reasons for relations between the two countries to be  strained on the economic level as these continue to be strong  and friendly. U.S. is India's largest trading partner and  overseas investor. Therefore, the relations between the two  countries should not be determined only on the political level  where differences of opinion exist. For a balanced view these  should be judged both on economic and political levels. The  economic relations could become more friendly and deep and  sincere effort made to remove irritants on the political front.    Notice has also been taken of Ms. Raphel's recent  observation  that it is not correct to say that Indo-U.S. relations have  soured because of public disagreement over issues, such as  Kashmir. "The reality is much beyond disagreements we may have.  It also includes close cooperation in education, culture,  science and technology and our rapidly growing commercial  relations."    At the same time the Indian side makes it clear that any arm  twisting on Kashmir shall not be entertained. If the U.S. had  any doubts about the unanimity of public opinion on this issue  those must have been removed by the Parliamentary resolution  asserting that Kashmir is an inalienable part of India and  Pakistan must vacate the area under its illegal occupation since  1947. No Government can side-step the resolution and negotiate  Kashmir's status and still hope to survive. However, agreements  are possible on such issues as demilitarisation of the Siachen  area and Sir Creek, Tulbul Barrage, nuclear confidence building  measures and the like, on which concrete proposals have been  sent by India to Pakistan.    As regards nuclear and missile non-proliferation in South  Asia, notice has been taken of President Clinton's own  observation that the U.S. and others "take into account both  Indian and Pakistani domestic political concerns and regional  security threat perceptions, including those extending beyond  the two countries themselves."</p>

			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART / CATHY CURTIS;  </P> <P> 'AMERICAN LANDSCAPE': VIVID LOOK AT POWERS AND FANCIES OF VIDEO  </P> <P> In case we were becoming complacent, 15 terrible seconds last week gave us all  the proof we needed of nature's freakish and terrible willfulness. With TV  images of the San Francisco earthquake burned into our minds by constant  replay, a new exhibit at Newport Harbor Art Museum seems particularly timely.  </P> <P> Organized by the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Pa., "American Landscape  Video: The Electronic Grove" (through Dec. 31) presents six large-scale video  installations produced during the past decade by Bill Viola, Rita Myers, Dara  Birnbaum, Frank Gillette, Doug Hall and Steina Vasulka.  </P> <P> Their landscape imagery ranges from the grandiloquent turbulence and shock  effects of Hall's "The Terrible Uncertainty of the Thing Described" to the  cerebral calm of Gillette's "Aransas."  </P> <P> Hall offers large-screen images of raging fire, billowing smoke and torrential  floods -- and a real jolt of lightning that leaps between two tall metal chairs  screened off by a wire fence in the gallery. Gillette surrounds the viewer with  monitors displaying peaceful distant and close-up views of the woods and  marshes of Aransas County, Tex., in a slow, rhythmic sequence.  </P> <P> For some viewers, the idea of a video "portrait" of landscape may be hard to  reconcile with the familiar, handcrafted qualities of landscape painting, or  even with a stationary photographic image.  </P> <P> But the landscape tradition in American art already has undergone great changes  during the past century. Think of the distance that separates the vast,  detailed 19th-Century paintings of sprawling, untamed nature from the abstract  color fields of Richard Diebenkorn's "Ocean Park" series -- or from the Earth  Art of Robert Smithson, who worked directly on remote tracts of land.  </P> <P> By turning to video, artists gained a number of advantages lost to cutting-edge  art since the 19th Century, as well as others perhaps undreamed of by earlier  generations. Video can transmit instantly recognizable moving pictures of real  objects. It also offers the intimacy and the user-friendly, non-elitist quality  of TV viewing.  </P> <P> The artists, of course, are not in thrall to Nielsen ratings and other  manifestations of consumer culture. They are free to use the special features  of the video medium (including the ability to fragment, rearrange and instantly  replay footage) to present unusual, unsettling and difficult ideas.  </P> <P> Video installations typically consist of one or more video monitors that either  create an "environment" all by themselves -- by virtue of the way they are  arranged in the gallery -- or function as elements within a larger sculptural  or architectural setting. This three-dimensional context may either  counterpoint or reinforce the image on the video screen, giving the viewer  another layer of visual (and sometimes aural) experience.  </P> <P> Viola's "Room for St. John of the Cross," from 1983, is a particularly  evocative blending of video with other media -- and a superb example of the  power of video to convey serious, humanistic ideas as well as flashy,  nihilistic ones.  </P> <P> St. John of the Cross was a 16th-Century Spanish monk, a poet and mystic  imprisoned by the religious establishment after introducing a new austerity  into the Carmelite order.  </P> <P> In a darkened gallery, Viola places an imagined replica of St. John's tiny cell  with its thick walls and earthen floor. A small table inside holds a glass and  pitcher of water -- and a miniature portable TV displaying the image of a  snow-capped mountain peak.  </P> <P> In Spanish, a recorded male voice softly recites St. John's intensely spiritual  poetry, which speaks of flying over city walls and mountains to join with God.  On a huge video screen outside the cell, the same mountain peak lurches and  trembles in black-and-white, as if laboriously photographed, bit by bit, with a  hand-held camera.  </P> <P> In this work, the small, unchanging view of the mountain is symbolic of St.  John's contemplative state, a serene and focused view of the true purpose of  life. The jerky large view of the mountain seems to represent the confused,  distracted, partial understanding we have of life as we rush through it,  oblivious to higher things.  </P> <P> Due to scheduling conflicts, Mary Lucier, one of the video artists in the  original exhibition, is not represented at Newport Harbor, and Myers' video,  "RiftRise" from 1986 replaces her "Allure of the Concentric" (which, however,  will be seen at the Art Gallery, Cal State Fullerton, from Nov. 18 through Dec.  17).  </P> <P> In "RiftRise," images of destruction (fire, charred tree branches) and renewal  (rushing water, green leaves) shift from one side to the other of two opposing  banks of monitors, one made of sharp-edged black slabs, the other covered with  live birch trees. At once very simple and very grand in scope, the installation  offers a rhythmic, five-minute meditation on the cycle of life.  </P> <P> Vasulka's "The West" from 1983 is the most visually complex piece in the show,  though ultimately it seems to have less meaning than the others. Images of  man-made and natural sights from the New Mexican desert play over 22  double-stacked monitors for 30 minutes, unrolling and twisting and undergoing  all sorts of coloristic and light manipulations. The whole thing seems to be  more about technical wizardry, however, than the intrinsic qualities of nature.  </P> <P> Dara Birnbaum's "Will-o'-the-Wisp" (part of her "Damnation of Faust" series,  begun in 1983) is the most elusive of the six works. Three color monitors are  mounted on a 36-foot-wide photographic enlargement that can just barely be read  as a woman's face. The same face appears in the video imagery, surrounded by  green foliage.  </P> <P> Eventually, the foliage turns red (Memories of other times? A look into the  future?) and there are quick glimpses of children gathered at a doorway.  Meanwhile, the woman's voice murmurs inaudibly on the sound track (she is  supposedly the fictional Marguerite of the Faust legend, recounting her  abandonment by her lover).  </P> <P> The piece -- which, to be fair, was partly malfunctioning when I saw it --  might be about the way the environment colors memory and affects mood. But the  clues were vague and the image of the woman's face banal. (It looks like  something from a toilet tissue commercial.)  </P> <P> Still, the installations as a group are enormously captivating, offering a  meaty introduction to the powers and fancies of video. It would have been a  good idea to post the duration of each piece, however, so viewers could  determine if they've seen the whole thing or are simply wallowing in an endless  loop of imagery.  </P> <P>  "American Landscape Video: The Electronic Grove" remains through Dec. 31 at  Newport Harbor Art Museum, 850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach. The museum is  open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays. Admission is $3 for  adults, $2 for students and seniors, and $1 for children 6 to 17. Tuesdays are  free to all, courtesy of Beacon Bay Enterprises Inc. Docent-guided tours are  available. Information: (714) 759-1122.  </P> <P> </P></p>

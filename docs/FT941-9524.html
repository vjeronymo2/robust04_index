			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Governor named for central bank Mr Yaman Toruner, a 45-year-old former bank official and currently the chairman of the Istanbul stock exchange, has been appointed as Turkey's new central bank governor following the resignation of Mr Bulent Gultekin last month, writes John Murray Brown in Istanbul. Mr Toruner is the third governor to serve under Turkey's prime minister Tansu Ciller since she took office last June. Both previous incumbents resigned over policy differences with the prime minister. Mr Toruner's main task will be to restore confidence in the lira after last month's 12 per cent devaluation. His chief tool will be interest rates. However with rates on government securities already at 125 per cent for one-year paper, the government is trying to restrain further increases as a way to reduce its budget costs.</p>

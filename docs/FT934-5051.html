			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Their Budget - The retired person Leslie Thomson, 76 Former Lloyd's underwriter: has resigned as a Lloyd's name but is still liable for losses in one syndicate which is hit by US asbestosis and pollution claims. He has a stop-loss policy which meets his liabilities at present, but the policy will expire in several years' time. 'This overshadows our whole financial life. Our day-to-day living is pretty comfortable, in a modes way, but I can't plan for anything.' Politics: last election voted Labour 'out of intellectual convictions, rather than practical.' Said yesterday: Gave the chancellor eight marks out of 10. 'Budgets tend to be damp squibs, but on this occasion it was a lot more interesting and a lot better than I expected.' He calculate the measures would reduce his overall income by pounds 6 a week. Was 'very pleased' there had been no general increase in VAT and thought it sensible to continue to reduce tax relief on mortgage interest payments.</p>

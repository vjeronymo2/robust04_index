			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>   [Text] Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating managed to  minimize the changes to his ministry in a reshuffle forced by  the shock resignation of his industry minister last weekend.  Assuming the industry mantle is Senator Peter Cook, trade  minister for almost a year who has steered the country's trade  interests through a tough 12 months while heading the Cairns  Group of free trading agricultural nations. But the real winner  is the quiet but highly respected and capable Senator Bob  McMullan, who has been elevated to the trade portfolio.  Australian Affairs Correspondent Linda Mottram reports on the  changes:    [Begin Mottram recording] When former Industry Minister Alan  Griffiths fell on his sword of alleged financial impropriety in  his electorate office, he created a headache for the prime  minister, forcing the second ministerial reshuffle since  December when then-treasurer John Dawkins unexpectedly stepped  down under somewhat different circumstances. The fact of that  earlier reshuffle made these changes more difficult with the  number of ministers who were potential candidates for industry  only just settling into their new portfolios. But after a week  turning over the option, Paul Keating has found a formula with a  minimum of change but that rewards good service. Peter Cook  will take on the industry portfolio with his first big job, the  delivery of a new industry policy statement due in April.  Senator Cook is known to have impressed the prime minister with  his 10-month stewardship of the trade portfolio, a period  featuring difficult talks with the United States over the use of  farm export subsidy that also saw the ushering in of the North  American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, and continuing evolution  of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, APEC, and the  long-awaited successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the  GATT trade liberalization talks. And that service, plus Peter  Cook's earlier ministries, including resources and industrial  relations, position him well for his new job of industry,  technology, and regional development.    The biggest elevation, though, is for Senator Bob McMullan,  long overlooked for ministries during the years of Bob Hawke's  leadership largely because of his non-aligned status amidst the  Labor Party's rigid factional system. A highly capable  performer in parliament since the late 1980's, his first full  ministry came after the March election last year -- the arts and  administrative services portfolio with cabinet status. Now,  Senator McMullan shifts up to trade, giving his beloved arts  portfolio to the existing communications minister, Michael Lee.  But Senator McMullan will be able to deliver his culture  statement -- a pet project -- due in weeks.    The changes end a week of uncertainty in the Keating  Government and give the prime minister a full complement of  ministers to handle the resumption of parliamentary sittings  next week. But in overall numbers, the ministry is one down,  that is, the prime minister has left a vacancy -- should Alan  Griffiths be cleared of impropriety as he insists he will be --  and should he be returned to the front bench. If that happens,  the ambitious Mr. Griffiths will be picking up his career at a  level junior to the status he just voluntarily abandoned. He  would likely take on the administrative services portfolio. His  future, though, is in the hands of two inquiries and then in the  hands of his colleagues who must decide who they want as their  ministers. [end recording]</p>

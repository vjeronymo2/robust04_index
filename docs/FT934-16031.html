			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Satellite antenna in the briefcase The high-tech antennae used in Israel's most sophisticated smart bombs has now been converted for civilian use, stuffed into the lid of a briefcase. The antenna forms part of the Bipsat portable satellite communications system, which can be used to send phone, fax or data messages via Inmarsat satellites. The system incorporates a notebook PC, hard disc, printer and communications software. Although several other satellite transmitters and receivers are already available, their antennae usually have to be carefully aligned with the satellite - to within 2` - for messages to be sent and received. Rafael, of Haifa, manufacturers of Bipsat, say the flat antenna gives a wider tolerance, making the equipment easier to use. Rafael: Israel, 4 795435.</p>

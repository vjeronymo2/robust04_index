Abu-al-'Izz added that upon receiving the two guests in his  private office at the municipality, he was surprised to discover  that the woman with the Belgian consul was the wife of Elat's  mayor who holds a Swiss passport. For her part, she presented a  letter from the mayor of Elat and an invitation to visit Elat.    Mayor Abu-al-'Izz rejected the letter and the invitation and  immediately informed the official quarters. He stressed that he  will never send a letter or an invitation to the mayor of Elat.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Aerospace head named TAIWAN Aerospace has announced the appointment of Mr Earle Ho, 53, as chairman, following the resignation of Mr David Huang, 72. Mr Ho, known as the 'Ship-breaking King' during the 1980s, is also chairman of the private Tungho Steel and heads the Taiwan Steel and Iron Industries Association. His appointment is seen as a means for the Taiwanese government to distance itself from the company's proposed Dollars 2bn deal to buy up to 40 per cent of the commercial operations of McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace group. His predecessor, Mr Huang, had close ties with the government and the military. The deal has come under fire in the island's parliament, and the government is considering taking as little as a 25 per cent stake in the deal. 'It could be 30 or 25 per cent,' acknowledged Mr Denny Ko, president of Taiwan Aerospace. It is hoped that Mr Ho's influence in the business community and lack of official ties will help to re-establish Taiwan Aerospace's image as a private enterprise, although observers say the government will still make the final decision and find the money to finance the deal.</p>

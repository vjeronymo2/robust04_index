			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Brazilians look abroad for roads THE Brazilian government is hoping to attract foreign capital to carry out a massive roadbuilding and repair programme - the first time the country has allowed private sector participation in the provision of public services. The programme, which envisages private sector investment of Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 974m) in the next three years, will be launched on Monday with bidding for the maintenance and operation of the Rio-Niteroi bridge, the 14km suspension bridge which links the two sides of Rio de Janeiro, and the Via Dutra, the 429km road between Rio and Sao Paulo, Brazil's two largest cities. Explaining the decision Mr Alberto Goldman, transport minister, said: 'Lack of investment over the last decade has completely destroyed our road and rail system, making freight very expensive and affecting our exports. . . The government has no money so the only answer is through concession.' Brazil depends unusually heavily on roads, which carry 70 per cent of cargo. However, less than half of the 50,000km of federal highways are in reasonable condition. Mr Goldman says Brazil needs to repair 2,000km-3,000km a year just to prevent the situation worsening, but last year only 1,000km were repaired. In his recent economic plan, President Itamar Franco made roads a priority, doubling investment to 0.6-0.7 per cent of GDP, to repair 6,000km this year in a project that will create 110,000 jobs. The extra money will come from a new tax on fuel imports, expected to raise Dollars 600m, with Dollars 300m from the World Bank. Mr Goldman says this is 'nowhere near sufficient' and plans to open to concession 7,500km of roads for repair and maintenance this year.</p>

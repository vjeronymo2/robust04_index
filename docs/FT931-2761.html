			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Observer: Glitch doctor Yet another rumpus has been stirred up by France's maverick minister of health and humanitarian affairs Bernard Kouchner. The controversy that has surrounded him ever since he entered politics is still clouding his plans to depart after this month's elections. The latest gaffe by the doctor who founded the dashing Medecins Sans Frontieres team of flying medics in the 1970s comes on top of his affront to the politically correct in publicly remarking that he'd occupy himself by 'thinking, writing and looking at women'. To fill the rest of his time he intended not only to set up a new humanitarian foundation, but to take an academic post. Alas, the one he'd found - the honorary professorship of humanitarian medicine at the Cochin university hospital in Paris - has hit trouble. The glitch is that it would have been specially created for him, which has so outraged conservatives in medical quarters that even the intrepid Kouchner has bowed by renouncing the post.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of Bahrain (3): New decade ushered in with a spring clean - Investment THE Gulf crisis blew a chilling gust through the offices of Bahrain's economic decision makers, but it appears to have had a galvanising effect. In the 16 months since Kuwait's liberation, and a war which temporarily rocked financial and economic confidence in Bahrain, the government has launched a slew of initiatives to sell itself as never before to foreign investors; created a body dedicated to strategic thinking; started applying a scalpel to off-putting bureaucracy, and has bound its new marketing effort in glossy covers to mail to the world. There is nothing new in Bahrain's strategy; since the late 1960s this has been to encourage any new industries on the island which will wean it from dependency on oil reserves that are set to run out early in the next decade. Nor is there anything new in what Bahrain is advertising: its role as a trade and industry 'hub' for the Gulf and Middle East. What is new is the hardness of the sell. 'After the Gulf war it was like a spring clean,' says Mr Ahmed Hubail, assistant undersecretary for commerce. 'We decided to enter the 1990s on a commercial basis.' The Gulf war shock was not the sole catalyst for Bahrain's sudden promotional drive, though many locals suggest that the war's sharp blow to the banking sector helped to persuade the government that, to generate growth, it cannot forever rely on Bahrain's regional pre-eminence as a financial centre. Another factor was the disappointing part Bahrain played in the post-war reconstruction of Kuwait, and the subsequent realisation that the eventual rebuilding of Iran, and perhaps also Iraq, both of which have also been touted as potential prosperity for Bahrain, might in fact lie forever over the horizon. But a third spur to Bahrain's decision makers has also been the success of Dubai, its richer and, to date, more energetically self-promoting rival down the Gulf, in selling itself as the region's natural hub for trade and industry. 'What's got them going is jealousy of Dubai,' says one diplomat. 'They've seen Dubai getting everything.' Dubai, which is also hell-bent on diversifying its economy from oil, set up the Jebel Ali free trade zone and port in 1985 which, thanks to a heavily-financed marketing drive and a crack at cutting traditional Gulf-style bureaucracy, has attracted 410 new companies and has room for about 7,600 more. The main draw to Jebel Ali was its unique offer (in the Gulf) of allowing foreign companies 100 per cent ownership of their interests in the zone. Unique, at least, until Bahrain picked up the gauntlet earlier this year and decreed that 100 per cent foreign ownership would be permitted on the island too - subject to these companies undertaking to 'use Bahraini resources and be in the country's best economic interests.' This single step, which abandoned normal Gulf practice of limiting foreign investors to a 49 per cent share of any local company, is the focal point of its new investor-friendliness. Next, the government set up the Bahrain Marketing and Promotions Office (BMPO) - itself closely modelled on Dubai's Commerce and Tourism Promotions Board - to put in one office the responsibilities for company registration which could previously have taken a prospective investor around two, three or even four separate ministries. The BMPO also offers seven-day registration for big-name companies, hand-holding through the early stages of an investment and a collection point for all Bahrain's previously scattergun promotional efforts. Furthermore - and this measure is more softly spoken by officials - the government also appears to be taking a more relaxed approach to Bahrainisation - the desire for companies to hire as high a proportion of Bahrainis as possible. Although the greatest aim of attracting foreign investors to the island is to assure employment for young Bahrainis, a big percentage of whom (unadmittedly) are presently jobless, the government appears to have decided that it should not allow Bahrainisation to be an obstacle to attracting companies in the first place. 'Bahrainisation is not meant to be penal,' explains one official. It is early to assess the success of these new measures; the BMPO, for instance, is only 9 months old, and presently has a staff of just three. Nevertheless, the moves have already attracted Ericcsson, the Swedish multinational, to set up a regional headquarters in Bahrain, while Digital, the US electronics group, has also decided to establish its regional base on the island, complete with a bonded warehouse and distribution centre. Mr Tony O'Riordan, adviser to the BMPO, says a 'good dozen other companies' are set to follow. On a smaller scale, the government has also established the Bahrain Development Bank, with initial capital of BD10m, to foster small local businesses by offering loans, venture equity stakes and management consultancy. Last month the bank approved its first four loans, worth a total of BD500,000, and is processing applications from a further 90 businesses and individuals. The bank is not only Bahrain's first development institution - something all other Gulf states possess. It hopes also to become a semi-independent repository of economic and financial advice on the island. Most other sectors of the economy have also geared up behind Bahrain's new drive. The airport, for instance, last year added nine new carriers to the 29 previously using the island in what its officials describe as a new 'open skies policy with a touch of common sense.' Multinational aluminium companies are being courted, with some success, to develop the island's industry downstream of Alba, its large smelter. Travel writers are being flown in to help crank up Bahrain's embryonic international tourism industry. In fact, the government is candid about being open to almost any offers. 'We are trying to develop any angle of anything that can be developed,' says Sheikh Khalifa bin Sulman al-Khalifa, the prime minister, straightforwardly. The trouble is, as Bahraini officials will grimly concede, so too is Dubai. Although Bahrain is promoting its location as a hub, its congenial and liberal atmosphere, its good communications systems, so is its rival emirate to the south - with some justice. Bahrain certainly has some edges over Dubai, particularly in its better developed legal system, more developed financial services industry, and higher standards of financial regulation. Against that, though, Dubai has more money and more free land. These latter advantages make it the galling fact that Bahrain's best ideas can be, and often are, snaffled and duplicated by Dubai - or indeed by other Gulf states. Dubai, for instance, has followed Bahrain in building an aluminium smelter; Iran is now building another, and Qatar and Saudi Arabia are also bearing the idea in mind. 'I believe we have good ideas, we have a good basis for development,' says Sheikh Khalifa. 'But business goes mostly to where there is more liquidity.' The difficult truth for Bahrain (a truth the government well knows) is that the poorest of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) states (the members are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain) is always the one to suffer most from the six countries' predilection for duplicating each other. 'There is simply no recognition here of the division of labour,' reflects Mr Hubail. Until the GCC puts more emphasis on its middle initial, therefore, the success of Bahrain's new marketing drive will depend largely on factors outside its control.</p>

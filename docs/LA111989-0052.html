			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERESTROIKA TO THE PEOPLE  </P> <P> Contrary to Marshall Goldman's reading, I found Abel Aganbegyan's "Inside  Perestroika: The Future of the Soviet Economy" (Book Review, Nov.5) full of  hope and enthusiasm.  </P> <P> It is a concise and illuminating picture of the process of restructuring the  Soviet economy, placing perestroika in historical context and explaining how it  differs from past economic reforms. It provides valuable quantitative data  about the Soviet economy and explains the connections between perestroika and  glasnost.  </P> <P> Aganbegyan's discussion of managerial decision making is sociologically  informed and of interest to any student of organizational behavior. For the  socialist scholar, the book contributes to long-argued debates in political  economy, such as the nature of the market under socialism.  </P> <P> I found nothing sad about this book; it is unapologetic, honest, and  astonishingly readable.  </P> <P> What makes Goldman so sour about this book is perhaps a realization that his  vintage brand of xenophobic "Soviet expertise" -- that, with a blind eye to any  positive aspect of Soviet society, served only to obfuscate Soviet life,  mystify Soviet politics and perpetuate the cold war -- is, at last, obsolete.  </P> <P> With books like this one available in the United States, the American people no  longer need to depend upon the Goldmans of Harvard for their information about  the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> ANITA M.

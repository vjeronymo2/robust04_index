			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] All the national dailies today report the warning  handed to the newly formed National Democratic Coalition,  NADECO, by the inspector general of police, Alhaji Ibrahim  Commassie.    The papers say Alhaji Ibrahim yesterday declared NADECO an  illegal political body, warning its members to desist from  confronting the government. According to the papers, the police  boss warned NADECO of the consequences of its activities which  the police was not ready to tolerate. They say Alhaji Commassie  ordered the group to wind up its activities or face the wrath of  the law. The papers say the inspector general's warning came  amid public anxiety over the expiration today of NADECO's  ultimatum to the military government to relinquish power.    And the dailies also report that NADECO has unfolded the  agenda aimed at restoring democracy in Nigeria. They quote a  member of the group as saying that the struggle to restore  democratic rule in the country will not necessarily be a  confrontation with the military but will involve the  participation of all patriotic Nigerians. The papers quote a  statement by NADECO urging Nigerians to remain resolute in their  demand for democracy.    THE PUNCH and THE VANGUARD report that the group also  demanded the resignation of democrats and progressives in  government who, according to it, have been lending credibility  to the military administration. The group's ultimatum to the  Abacha administration to hand over power to a democratic  national government expired last night.    "Federal Government Keeps M.K.O. Under Close Watch" -- the  TRIBUNE: The paper reports that a secret security network has  been woven around Chief M.K.O. Abiola, apparently to prevent him  from making any move that might undermine the authority of the  government. The TRIBUNE notes that though there have been no  overt moves to restrict his movement, Chief Abiola is believed  to be tailed by security agents who also monitor his interaction  with people. The paper reports that the fresh security measures  might have been adopted in a move widely interpreted as  government's reaction to threats by prodemocracy groups to wrest  power from it.    THE VANGUARD reports that the Nigerian Government has given  the National Constitutional Conference the green light to  discuss the annulled 12 June election when it convenes this  month. The issue, according to the report, will be discussed  under a broad topic: Sanctity of Democracy and the Democratic  Process. According to THE VANGUARD, the issue has been placed  under Item 28 in the conference agenda.</p>

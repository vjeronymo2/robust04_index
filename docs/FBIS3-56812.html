			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Following a massive artillery barrage at 0600 this  morning, Azerbaijani troops launched an offensive all along the  Karabakh battle front: from Omar pass in the north to Goradiz  near the Iranian border in the south. Comparatively large  forces have been put into action near Mardakert. There, the  Azerbaijanis are using all types of artillery, almost 20 tanks,  and other armored cars.    According to reports from the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic  Defense Army headquarters, by noon the Karabakh subunits managed  to contain the enemy's pressure in all directions.    The Karabakh fighters witnessed an hour-long clash between  two Azerbaijani battalions at the southeastern sector of the  front this morning. The Karabakh side still has no information  on the reason for the internal armed clash.    As to the situation on Armenia's borders, the relative calm  there for the last two days was disrupted last night. Fire was  opened on the defensive positions around Yeraskhavan and  Sevakavan in Araratskiy Rayon from Nakhichevan at 2125 for half  an hour. The Armenian Defense Ministry press service reported  that there were no casualties. Our border guards refrained from  retaliating.    No serious incidents were recorded today in the border  regions of the Republic.</p>

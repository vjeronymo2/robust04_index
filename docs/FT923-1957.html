			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Arts: Drawn to the age of Bruegel - Patricia Morison visits the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam PRINTS AND drawings were Frits Lugt's greatest love, which explains why his name is not widely known beyond the circle of collectors. And yet it deserves to be, because Lugt (1884-1970), a self-taught Dutch art-historian, art-dealer, and connoisseur, created one of this century's major collections of Western art. Although Lugt's interests were wide he is associated above all with his scholarly labours on Netherlandish artists between the 15th and 17th centuries. He built up an enormous collection of drawings and prints which in the Second World War was kept out of German hands by the simple expedient of mailing it in 60 registered envelopes to Switzerland. In 1947, Lugt installed his growing collection in the Fondation Custodia in Paris. One hundred drawings have been lent to Amsterdam for Drawings From the Age of Bruegel in the Rijksmuseum Print Room until November 8. It marks the publication of Netherlandish and German Drawings of the XVth and XVIth Centuries of the Frits Lugt Collection (Dfl. 600), an exceedingly handsome catalogue by Karel G. Boon, former director of the Rijksmuseum. In 1884 the Print Room was the scene of Lugt's triumph when, aged ten, he overcame the disapproval of 'ageist' curators and was admitted to the study room. One wonders how he might have reacted to the redecorated Print Room, snazzy cherry-red display cases reminiscent of Dutch modernist interiors of the 1920s. Drawings From the Age of Bruegel is like a rapid tour of Netherlandish workshops between 1520 and 1620, with a diversion via Lichtenstein to south Germany and Bohemia. We find masters producing drawings for a striking diversity of purposes. Drawings for stained glass, tapestries and engravings, take their place beside careful studies of nature (a particular treasure is an album of coloured miniatures by Jacques de Gheyn II), very early life-studies of the nude, and landscapes - with and without happy peasants. Two outstanding portraits are a reminder that the Habsburg presence meant fat pickings for artists. After being driven out of Denmark Christian II went to live in style with his wife's Habsburg in-laws in Brussels where he sat to Jan Gossaert. Perhaps Gossaert's florid pen drawing was intended to provoke a commission for a painting? None survives although we can be grateful for Gossaert's Hampton Court portrait of the king's three enchantingly grave children Lucas van Leyden's drawing of the Maximilian I was an opportunist move to profit from the market for commemorative prints of the late emperor. He based it closely on Durer's woodcut but made it more opulent and Italianate. But in so doing the great master's proportions went seriously wrong so that Maximilian, represented as if showing himself from a palace window, looks positively deformed. In 1520 Durer himself was in Antwerp, where he was impressed by the high standard of living achieved by van Leyden and other successful colleagues. He also cast admiring eyes on Dutch womanhood. A large, freely-drawn portrait shows a young Antwerp widow of 38 who the artist had first glimpsed in a religious procession, dressed in the white robes of a beguine. Durer shows her with eyes downcast demurely enough but smiling ripely. It makes one wonder whether he did really intend her as model for the Virgin Mary reading. As religion's crueller face showed itself in the Netherlands, there were pressing reasons why many artists left their divided homeland. Among the travellers were Roeland Savary and Pieter Stevens. Forest scenes in Bohemia by the former, views of Prague from across the Danube by the latter, are striking examples of Dutch artists exporting their famed landscape speciality. Goltzius's view of the country near Haarlem and Joos de Momper's winter scene, point the way to Dutch achievement in the next century. Italy, of course, was the prime attraction for Netherlandish artists. Some never went home, like the Bril brothers and Jan Van der Straet. Stradanus, as erudite humanists renamed him, did well for himself. For Duke Cosimo I he designed 20 different hunting scenarios, many quite absurd. A typically unsporting scene in the Lugt collection shows a dozen would-be Papagenos catching starlings with string. While Protestant propaganda may not make particularly attractive art, it is a striking feature of the exhibition. Old Testament imagery appealed to Calvinist patrons and alike to artists who saw themselves as committed, like the preachers and fighters, to leading the people of Israel from under the heel of the oppressor. Scenes like Goltzius's Idolatry of Solomon and Swanenbergh 's Josiah Stamping out idolatry, in which huge fragments of falling statuary tumble onto the priests of Baal, were the counterpart to the real-life desecration of churches and their images. The she-bear devouring the children who mocked Elisha could be read as an image of God's coming vengeance on Catholics. The artist in question, Hans Bol, twice fled from the sack of his home by Spanish armies: his troubles were by no means untypical. Some artists even tried a novel Calvinist iconography. Christus Vera Lux by the Leyden artist Lucas Cornelisz, shows a huge congregation kneeling in front of Christ while the pope and his cardinals exit to hell. Van Mander records that in Henry VIII's reign Cornelisz found a good market for his paintings in England where he went to work as a cook. A Leyden contemporary, Aert Claesz, may even have used sex to sell the message. His scene of a picnic a trois, in which a bewildered lady is flanked by two nobleman pawing at her breasts, could conceivably symbolise the bewilderment of the Netherlands, torn between two faiths.</p>

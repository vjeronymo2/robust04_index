			<p>BFN     [Text] President Zhelyu Zhelev expressed satisfaction with  the resumption of contacts with the Greek New Democracy party  [ND] during his meeting with this party leader, Miltiadhis  Evert, which took place today. Presidential Spokesman Valentin  Stoyanov had this to say about the meeting, which ended one hour  ago:    [Begin Stoyanov recording] Relations between the two  countries were assessed as very good. These are traditional  relations that recently suffered a certain cooling off, which  must be overcome.    From the Greek side it was pointed out that the parliament  will soon ratify our country's provisional agreement with the  European Union. The delay is not a premeditated act, but a  result of the Greek elections. Evert proposed an interesting  idea on preparing a treaty on the inviolability of borders that  should be signed by all Balkan states. President Zhelev  assessed the proposal as an interesting idea that merits serious  attention. However, he pointed out that it could only be useful  if all Balkan states without exception participate in the  proposed treaty. Bulgaria and Greece could work actively in  this respect, because they are two countries that have proved  that they have no territorial claims vis-a-vis their neighbors,  and conduct their policy in accordance with the Helsinki Act.  Such a Balkan treaty could conform to Balladur's plan on  European security. [end recording]    Evert came to Bulgaria to conduct consultations with  Bulgarian politicians regarding his proposal. This became clear  after his meeting with Aleksandur Tomov, leader of the Civic  Alliance for the Republic, which took place early this  afternoon. Evert also had a meeting with Filip Dimitrov, leader  of the Union of Democratic Forces. Meetings with Bulgarian  Socialist Party leader Zhan Videnov and Prime Minister Berov are  also planned.</p>

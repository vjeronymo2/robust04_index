			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bavaria nets DM2.3bn from sale The Bavarian government is to pocket DM2.3bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in cash - about double the figure expected - from the sale of its stake in the Bayernwerk electricity utility to Viag, the energy-based conglomerate. The cash settlement, announced yesterday, is in addition to a previously-agreed 25.1 per cent stake in the enlarged Viag group, which will become one of Germany's top 10 companies in terms of sales. Combined turnover of the two businesses is about DM40bn. The deal, billed as the biggest German privatisation project to date, was unveiled yesterday in a flurry of electioneering propaganda and upbeat forecasts from the buyer. Mr Edmund Stoiber, a prominent member of the Christian Social Union party, one of the three coalition partners in Bonn, pledged the cash proceeds would be used to build universities and fund research and not 'to fill gaps in the budget'. The Bavarian government's 25.1 per cent stake in the new-look Viag would be sold within the next five years, so no-one could accuse him of re-nationalisation, he said. The group needed a stable shareholder structure while it went about its restructuring programme, Mr Stoiber added. Viag predicted respectable profits for 1993 and an unchanged dividend of DM9. It promised a shake-out of the group's industrial holdings, and an increase in earnings per share of at least 10 per cent by 1995. According to Mr Georg Obermeier, finance director, the company could have raised the dividend for 1993, but had decided an increase was not appropriate at a time of rising unemployment and depression. The group had neither 'a shopping list nor a selling list', according to Mr Alfred Pfeiffer, chairman. But executives said future core industrial businesses - apart from energy, accounting for 20 per cent of sales in the enlarged group and 55 per cent of profits - would be packaging, chemicals, logistics and corporate telecommunications. Five firms of independent auditors had valued Bayernwerk at DM8.9bn and Viag at DM10.2bn, he said. These figures justified a financial consideration of DM1.85bn in return for the government's 58.3 per cent stake in the utility, but the quality of Bayernwerk was deemed to be worth another DM450m. Under present arrangements Viag owns 38.8 per cent in Bayernwerk, which in turn has 24.9 per cent of Viag.</p>

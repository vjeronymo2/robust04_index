			<p>BFN     [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen, we now broadcast an emergency  report that we have just received. A new Turkish provocation  took place in Nicosia today at 1430 GMT this afternoon.  According to information obtained by CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting  Corporation], near Famagusta Gate a Turkish soldier left his  guardpost, entered a prohibited area of the buffer zone, and  headed toward a National Guard guardpost. A national guardsman  called on the Turkish soldier to leave the area immediately.  The Turkish soldier did not obey and the national guardsman was  forced to fire warning shots into the air. The Turkish soldier  then withdrew.    Defense Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis told CyBC just a  short  while ago that the republic's authorities strongly protested to  UNFICYP [UN Force in Cyprus] on the new Turkish provocation. An  UNFICYP spokesman told CyBC that the incident is under  investigation. It is not serious, he said.    The illegal Turkish Cypriot radio station [Bayrak] concealed  the Turkish side's attempt to cause tension and reported that a  Greek Cypriot national guardsman provoked a Turkish soldier by  firing shots against his guardpost.    It is now calm in the area but the National Guard is  following the situation closely.</p>

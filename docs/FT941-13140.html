			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / Call to reform capital gains tax The government should substantially reform capital gains tax, the Bow Group says in a pamphlet published yesterday. The tax is damaging to investment and enterprise, complicated and expensive to administer and inefficient in raising funds, the Conservative pressure group says. The pamphlet was written by Mr Anthony Coombs, MP for Wyre Forest and secretary of the Conservative parliamentary finance committee. He says the decision in 1988 of Mr Nigel Lawson, the then chancellor, to equalise capital gains tax and higher income tax rates left British capital taxes at among the highest in the industrialised world.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Barclays names headhunters - Professionals called in to advise on investor and public relations BARCLAYS, the UK's biggest bank, has appointed Spencer Stuart, the international firm of headhunters, to advise it in its search for a new chief executive. It has also appointed Makinson Cowell, the investor relations consultants, for advice on its relations with institutional shareholders, and Brunswick, the public relations firm, on its public image. Barclays' image has been battered over the past year by its poor financial performance - it made a post-tax loss in 1992 of Pounds 343m  - and by last year's controversial decision that Mr Andrew Buxton should combine the roles of chairman and chief executive. It has never in the past employed specialist investor relations consultants, nor has it hitherto sought advice on its corporate image from a specialist financial public relations firm. Both Brunswick and Makinson Cowell are leaders in their fields. Their combined fees for a full year's work for Barclays are likely to exceed Pounds 200,000, according to a banker. Mr Buxton is hopeful that the chief executive search should not take much more than three months. Spencer Stuart will make its recommendation of the best candidates to a board sub-committee, headed by Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI, the chemicals group. A banker said he thought many of the leading candidates were likely to come from outside the UK. After pressure from shareholders, which believe that big companies should not combine the chairman and chief executive positions, Mr Buxton decided in March to relinquish the role of chief executive. However, the bank has not wanted to disclose the name of the headhunting firm, which was appointed within the past few weeks. 'It is highly confidential', Mr Andrew Buxton said in a recent interview. Spencer Stuart refused to comment on the appointment.</p>

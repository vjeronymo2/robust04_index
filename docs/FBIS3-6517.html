This process would help gradually eliminate the system of  governing ministries, governing administrative levels and the  distinction between centrally and locally controlled enterprises.    VIETNAM NEWS today quotes a prime minister decision as  saying  that group of enterprises will be established on a trial basis  in Ho Chi Minh City and some ministries relevant to economic and  technology management. The creation of group must assure  restriction of monopolies on one hand, and uncontrolled  competition on the other.    The decision emphasized that the chosen enterprises should  include corporations or big companies which have played  important roles in the national economy.    These groups are legal economic entities established by the  state and each of them consists of at least seven member  enterprises having a minimum legal capital of 1,000 billion dong.    The group' management board will be comprised of  seventy-nine  members appointed by the prime minister.    The State Planning Commission is expected to submit  incorporation proposals to the prime minister for approval by  June.</p>

The five-article document ratifies the two  parties' desire to fight trafficking and to prevent the  eradication of plantations. It confirms that the government will  continue to look for and destroy laboratories but without  destroying coca plantations.    Article 4 is the most controversial: It specifies that the  government and coca-growers leaders will implement Articles 10,  14 and 24 of Law 1008. The government is committed to implement  alternative development programs.    It has also been agreed that mixed commissions will be  created to deal with issues related to coca-leaf production.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Are you happy with  the agreement?    [Unidentified coca growers leader] We believe there is an  agreement, but we will only be happy when the terms of the  agreement are complied with. [end recording]    The coca growers believe this agreement represents victory  for them because the government has promised not to forcefully  eradicate the sacred leaf.    [Begin unidentified coca growers leader recording] Forceful  eradication without an alternative crop cannot flourish. [end  recording]    The government believes the agreement will ensure peace and  the implementation of alternative development in the  coca-producing regions.</p>

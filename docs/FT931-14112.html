			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Henderson to cut TR staff HENDERSON Administration, the fund management company, has said it would make redundant nearly half the staff of Touche Remnant, the investment trust manager it recently acquired for Pounds 42.4m, writes Norma Cohen. Of 165 Touche Remnant employees, 76 will lose their jobs. As a result of the redundancies, Henderson will incur a Pounds 1.4m charge to cover the cost of compensation, including pension commitments which will be taken in the accounting period ending March 31. The company is considering capitalising the charge instead of reflecting its impact in the profit and loss statement. Meanwhile, Henderson said the cost savings would be considerably in excess of the charge, but would flow through in subsequent years. The redundancies include back office staff, sales and marketing. No senior fund managers will be affected.</p>

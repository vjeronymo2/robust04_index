			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Franchise plan for BBC proposed The BBC should franchise future commercial activities to a private-sector operator, the Independent Television Commission, the television watchdog, said yesterday in its response to the government's white paper on the BBC's future, Diane Summers writes. The ITC said it believed that the BBC, as a publicly-funded broadcaster, was 'not in a position to balance successfully the mixed cultures of public service broadcasting and commercial business enterprise'. The BBC should concentrate on providing public service radio and television, financed by the licence fee, to UK audiences. Licence fee income should not be risked on new business ventures, for 'licence payers are not shareholders, nor would they enjoy the rights of shareholders'.</p>

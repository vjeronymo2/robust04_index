Our correspondent Moti Amir reports from Taba:    Over the last hour there were several developments here in  Taba. At present there is a break in the discussions of the  Security Affairs Committee. The Israeli representatives are  holding consultations with Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of  the Israeli delegation, and perhaps with Jerusalem as well, over  a new proposal submitted by Dr. Nabil Sha'th a short time ago.    The Palestinian representatives in the committee were also  summoned for consultations by Dr. Sha'th a short time ago. The  only issue under discussion at the present time is the border  crossings issue, which has been defined here as the key to all  the security related issues under negotiations in Taba.    A senior source in the Palestinian delegation noted the new  proposal on the border crossings issue submitted to Israel  includes all the understandings attained in Oslo and Cairo, and  is also based on the joint working paper formulated by  representatives of the two delegations on the agreements and  disagreements on this issue. According to the source the new  proposal provides answers to all the security problems on the  border crossings. In his opinion the Israeli representatives  are delaying their answer to the proposal due to internal  debates within the delegation, or due to other reasons which  have to do with their desire to prevent the continuation of the  discussions in the Security Affairs Committee.    According to the source, the Palestinian representatives in  the committee have a full mandate from Yasir 'Arafat to attain  an agreement on the border crossings issue. He added: This is  precisely how we acted when we submitted the proposal and we do  not need to ask Tunis anything.    Altogether it appears that the negotiations over the border  crossings are stuck. Dr. Nabil Sha'th a short time ago  confirmed he will travel to Cairo for a meeting with 'Arafat  tomorrow morning. Later he will travel with 'Arafat to Oslo,  where they are slated to meet Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres on  Friday [21 January]. Sha'th said that as far as he is concerned  the committees can continue their work tomorrow without the  attendance of the delegation heads. Incidentally, Maj. Gen.  Shahaq will apparently also travel to the Oslo meeting.</p>

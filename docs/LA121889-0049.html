			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Big Screen Scene: San Francisco mayor Art Agnos got rave reviews for his  performance after the big quake, but it will be months before critics review  his big-screen debut. Agnos played himself last week in a scene from "Class  Action," with Gene Hackman as a civil rights attorney.  </P> <P> Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays the lawyer daughter of Hackman's character.  Agnos sounded like an actor when he said, "I'm a little dissatisfied. My part's  not big enough. I'm not talking, just walking."  </P> <P> Dallas, Live: The Jingle Bell Run, a zany Dallas event that mixes racing and  costume competitions, this year featured 45 people in spotted suits  masquerading as "101 Dalmatians" and barking a Christmas carol while jogging.  </P> <P> Another group was dressed as a Nintendo game set, complete with video screen.  Other zanies acted as rap-singing and dancing reindeer and as "Christmas  seals," wearing brown trash bags and whiskers.  </P> <P> Tough Talk: The Rev. Jesse Jackson has warned students that drugs are more of a  threat to black Americans than the Ku Klux Klan ever was. "What difference does  it make if the doors are wide open and you are too drunk to stagger through the  door?" Jackson asked students at Westport High School in Kansas City, Mo. "No  one should have to beg you, no one should have to bribe you . . . to make you  save yourself," he said. "Opportunity just gets you on the court; it doesn't  make you win."  </P> <P> Gown Goes: A sequined dress worn by Marilyn Monroe brought $14,300 at an  auction of Hollywood memorabilia last weekend at Sotheby's auction house in New  York. The siren-red gown, from the 1953 classic "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," was  sold by an unidentified seller to an unidentified buyer. It had a presale  estimate of $8,000 to $12,000. The long-sleeve dress sports a thigh-high slit  and a flesh-tone chiffon panel over a neckline that plunges to the waist.  </P></p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Allianz premium income likely to see 14 per cent rise this year Premium income at Allianz is likely to rise by 14 per cent this year to DM62bn (Dollars 36.5bn), Mr Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, the group's chief executive told Wednesday's shareholders' meeting, writes David Waller. At the same time, the level of losses on the group's mainstream insurance activities - the so-called technical result - was set to fall from the 1992 level, he said. Total profits, which include earnings in interest income as well as the technical result, would increase in 1993. Last year net profits dropped by 18 per cent to DM857.9bn while the technical result was DM1.68bn, fractionally lower than in the previous year. Barring unforeseen catastrophes in the final months of the year, this would probably enable Allianz to pay the same level of dividend as last year, Mr Schulte-Noelle said. The 1992 dividend was DM13.50 per share.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Docks bid raises eyebrows and ire - The furore over Medway Ports' Pounds 104m sale ONE question arising from Mersey Docks and Harbours' Pounds 103.7m agreed bid for Medway Ports has raised not only eyebrows but ire. That is: why are shares which were valued in February and traded in June at a price of Pounds 2.50 now worth Pounds 37.25? The huge difference in value has brought threats of legal action against KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants which valued the shares, from those who - they feel - were forced to sell them at Pounds 2.50. So far, neither KPMG nor Medway Ports have received writs, and many believe the protestors do not have a claim. KPMG will only say: 'At the time the valuation was carried out by KPMG there was great uncertainty involving the labour force at the Medway Ports; there was certainly no potential purchaser on the horizon at that time.' One other adviser to Medway Ports said yesterday: 'Hindsight is a wonderful thing. You have to remember why the valuation was done and what has changed since. KPMG did a thorough job.' He said that the valuation was done for internal share transfers in a private company, where buyers and sellers had to be matched. Such values are generally lower than an equivalent public company would expect. At the time of the Medway Ports valuation there was uncertainty over the long term profitability of the group and there was no prospect of an early exit for investors. When the government privatised Medway Ports, which owns the Sheerness and Chatham docks, in March 1992 there was only one bidder, a management and employee buy out which offered Pounds 29.7m. The employees bought shares at Pounds 1 each. By the end of last year the company was embroiled in a bitter dispute with some of its workforce. The company wanted to cut wages and increase working hours, doing away with working practices which it considered hampered its chances of retaining customers and increasing profits. One adviser said yesterday: 'The company's financial state was parlous, it was right up against its bank covenants. It could have gone under.' The dispute ended in the redundancy of 269 dockers, who were then obliged to sell their shares because they ceased to be employees. The bitter irony for them is that their departure in large part transformed the group's fortunes, and made it attractive. By the summer, the group was looking at an early flotation and a number of trade buyers appeared enabling Medway to extract the offer from Mersey Docks.</p>

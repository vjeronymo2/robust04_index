			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Revitalizing Wages and Other Forms of Material </F> Incentives"]    [Text] What motivates a person to work in socialism? What  balance should be established between material and moral  incentives? Does a material incentive inevitably create  uncontrollable trends toward mercantilism and individualism?    This may be the best possible moment to answer these key  questions that we Cuban workers have asked ourselves repeatedly  throughout our revolutionary history.    Now is the best moment, and, as never before, it is  essential  to establish the greatest rational and realistic cooperation  among the economy, politics, and ideology. This does not mean  embracing a vulgar practice that rejects essential features of  revolutionary humanism or leads us to confuse what is necessary  with what is desirable. It is the best moment because the  present situation strengthens our will to correct errors we had  found earlier in the organization of labor and salaries and in  our interpretation of the conditions influencing labor behavior.    It seems that if one current economic issue needs special  analysis because of its enormous, direct, and daily influence on  the workers' standard of living and social education, it is the  organization of labor and salaries.    So it is not surprising that Cuban society is now focusing  on  this crucial issue.    It is clearly a vital goal, and not just economic, but  ideological as well, to develop formulas and practices seeking  the best combination between material and moral incentives.    The unions, representing the workers' vital interests, are  absolutely committed to seeking and expanding formulas that by  promoting the nation's economic reorganization, will safeguard  the ideal of a collectivist and just society with solidarity.    We support without reservation the view that a well-founded  material incentive, which is actually a fair share for the  performance of a social duty, is in fact a moral incentive of  the greatest importance.    The social evaluation shown by providing a material  incentive  to the individual corresponding to his contribution does not in  any way create contradictions detrimental to the worker's  morale, just as it cannot be alleged that an exclusively moral  incentive can satisfy needs and aspirations of other sorts.  There has always been talk of a combination of both types of  incentives. Now is the time to interpret fully the meaning of  the word "combination" that, in chemistry, for example, means an  "intimate union of the molecules of two substances." Just as  water is a combination of hydrogen and oxygen, for us the  motivation for labor indissolubly combines both material and  moral factors. As we have already said, we Cuban workers must  promote a process of revitalization of the role of salaries and  other forms of material incentives so that we can differentiate  to a greater degree the levels of individual consumption in  relation to each person's contribution.    It is important to understand the evolving, gradual, and  very  complex character of this process, so that we do not create  false expectations or unjustified demands, and so this will not  be identified with former experiments that were rightly  criticized. The dynamics of this process will be shaped by the  restoration of internal financial order and equilibrium and by  the economic recovery steps that Cuba takes in its strategy of  reentering the world economy.    Moreover, the policy of renewed emphasis on material  incentives would be inappropriate if it were initially extended  without discrimination, with the same weight given both to  productive sectors and to those that do not directly create  material value.    Among productive activities we need to distinguish those  which are capable of definitely generating high foreign currency  earnings, decreasing convertible currency costs, or which have a  special significance in the current strategy of resistance and  development. These activities, called multipliers because of  their ability to help revitalize the economy in general, are the  first to which the motivating force of greater material  incentives should come, with the necessary criterion of maximum  efficiency and stringent discipline.    It is no waste of time to reiterate that the unions have the  duty to demand that in any case, material incentives must also  be contingent upon a substantial increase in labor productivity.  All that is done to boost productivity and efficiency in these  vanguard activities, along with steps for financial improvement,  will have repercussions on the dissemination of these incentives  toward more and more sectors of the economy and toward  nonproductive services.    What is done to revitalize the national economy will in one  way or another reach the entire working population, starting by  increasing the purchasing power of present salaries.    It can be seen with enormous optimism that wherever the  experiment of stimulating more vigorously effort and excellence  in work has been tried, the immediate results have more than  compensated the investment made.    Still, increases in material incentives should not be  conceived solely in terms of raising salaries and giving workers  in these centers special access to the consumption of specific  goods and services. This simplistic view would lead to failure.    Wherever unquestionable economic gains promoted in large  part  by greater incentives exist, there are also present satisfaction  in work well done, pride in doing one's duty, conscious  acceptance of discipline that is desirable and appropriate for  each member of the work unit, a precise definition of every  person's objectives, functions, and tasks, understanding of the  social usefulness of the work done, and the enjoyment of better  environmental and working conditions. These experiences show  that when the workers are fully and effectively motivated, it  contributes to their ideological formation that, as we know, is  expressed in the execution of their responsibilities, in their  actions.    Beyond words, the essential and most direct way for the  worker to take part in the construction of socialist society is  by doing his job. Everything done to promote the value of labor  forms a part of the sacred struggle for human dignity.    It may be worthwhile to say that, though we are speaking of  the role of material incentives, we do not underestimate the  importance of moral incentives. Doing that would once again  polarize the focus on this issue, by denying that both form an  inseparable whole.    What we want to do is call attention to the necessary view  that a material incentive linked organically to decisive  political, ideological, and moral aspects, and associated more  and more with collective effort, with the cooperation and  socialization of labor, far from damaging revolutionary  awareness, must and can help to strengthen it.    This is the deeply held conviction of the Cuban union  movement.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (7): Spread to the four winds - Whither data processing? READING this FT survey on the train might make good use of your commuting time. If, that is, you are not already busy with your laptop and portable modem. Even better, you could cut out commuting altogether by becoming a teleworker (see the case studies on page eight of this survey). The suggestion regarding teleworking is now promoted with fervour by British Telecom, which cites productivity improvements of up to 40 per cent for home workers. A job in data processing of any sort used to presume a fairly sedentary sort of life, probably spent in a data centre somewhere, and all too often in a basement. A pretty view, and flexible working hours were low on the list of probabilities. But increasingly, the pressures in the computer industry and such movements as downsizing, enterprise-wide networking and client-server computing have forced organisations to look at de-centralisation. While this has been seen as the death-knell of the traditional 'dp' centre, (a rumour much exaggerated) it actually creates a number of new opportunities for people in the IT industry and beyond. As computers become 'distributed', so do people, and work opportunities. Networking used to concentrate on the sharing of scarce and expensive hardware resources, such as printers. Now the emphasis is on saving labour costs, and companies are looking at contracting out centralised computer facilities. This can bring a saving on office-space, and also on employment costs including workspace, national insurance, and pension contributions. The network has become a notional as well as a technical vehicle, and employees are being enabled and encouraged to work at home. Flexible working in a wider sense offers further savings, and the idea of teleworking, particularly contracting out to freelancers, is not far behind. In any work involving computers, there has to be a distinction between those who do it all day, every day, like software developers, and those for whom using a computer is only a part of the job. So far, only a fifth of the UK working population use computers, as compared to around half in Sweden. The computer industry was among the first to capitalise on home-working for software developers. But it is increasingly likely that any job - clerical, publishing, selling, banking - will depend on being able to use a computer. The technology is readily available, and a number of recent launches such as Apple's Newton, and Tricom's Pearl portable fax/modem have recognised that computing on the move is no gimmick, but part of many people's working pattern. BT is beginning to put ISDN in place for high-speed data transmission and services such as voice and videophones. Some areas, such as the Highlands of Scotland, have have been quick to put it to stake a claim in the remote service market. (See case study, page eight). The Henley Centre for Forecasting has calculated that over a sixth of the hours worked in the UK would be worked at home by the mid-90s; more than 3.3m people by 1995. British Telecom, admittedly with a vested interest in teleworking, claims that a central London employer can save Pounds 2m a year by teleworking 100 senior people. MAKING A VIRTUE OUT OF A NECESSITY Sales organisations have been quick to make a virtue out of necessity. Out of several 'business process re-engineering' projects has come the single message: to save costs, re-organise, consolidate separate activities under one local area manager, and send people home, armed with laptops. Unipart, in the automative industry, and Sun Alliance, in the insurance business, have been among the large organisations taking this seriously. But if there is to be a large 'connectable' workforce, there are several issues to address, each illustrated by the very different stories here. One is remote training, which will become more a of a necessity as large organisations refuse to bear the costs of training in old-style 'dp' centres. There has to be a way of delivering education by computer. Bulletin boards, for group-wide communication, have kept students at the Wolsey Hall Open Learning Centre in touch with one another and with tutors. Ace-High, the Highlands consortium, has taken an innovative approach to remote training, just as successful and more suited to the workflow now shared between its first proteges. For the Hollister Group, the problem was completely different. The work had to go to where the skilled people were already settled, and teleworking was the only option. Finding equipment easy to use was the main priority, and the Macintosh offered just that. Apple Computer, developer of the Macintosh and the Newton, is one of the main contributors to the Teleworking movement, both in the Telecottage Association, and in the high-tech community in Kington, Herefordshire. This is a pilot scheme, known as 'Connected Community,' to see what potential benefits can be provided for the social fabric of small towns. The aim is to generate n ew business and employment opportunities, especially for disabled people and women returners. BT and the Rural Development Commission are supporting the experiment, which is to be monitored by the Henley Centre. There are also some moral and personal issues which arise from teleworking, not shirked by British Telecom in its comprehensive information pack, the Teleworking Programme, (call 0700 800 854 for free copies). BT points out that teleworking can be disruptive to other people in the home, and that it does not suit gregarious people whose main pleasure in work is the social life. Computer manufacturer and service company Hewlett-Packard has already addressed another issue of personal safety, by its co-operation with the Susie Lamplugh Trust, the personal safety awareness organisation set up in memory of the estate agent who disappeared whilst keeping a professional appointment in a house. Another active body in the area is MSF, the white-collar union, whose concerns include employment rights. Health and safety - particularly in terms of ergonomics and a suitable working environment - is a responsibility which gets passed down to remote teleworkers, who may not be aware of the importance of vdu regulations and guidelines, the correct adjustment of chair height, and precautions to be taken in using a computer. More information on teleworking is available in the most recent issue of the FT review, 'Software At Work,' published on September 8. THE NEXT ISSUE OF SOFTWARE AT WORK The Winter Issue is due for publication on Monday, November 29. It will include two user-based reports, on office automation and geographical information systems (GIS). The hot topic in this issue will be is Object Oriented Programming. Questionnaires for those wishing to participate in the user-research are available from the Surveys Department, Financial Times, Number 1, Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL. In particular, the section on Office Automation (Part 1) will focus on: Integration: Users no longer find any novelty in mere word processing. They are looking for better and more effective ways of integrating other applications with the routine paperwork. Word processing is no longer standalone, but has become linked with database, communications, and spreadsheets. Users are less likely to be confronted with a choice between one package or another on the basis of pure functions. Nowadays they are more likely to be concerned with exchanging documents and formats, regulating in-house standards and usages, and keeping in-house training up to date with new versions. The management of software - and human - resources is likely to play an important part in the office automation stories we tell. GIS - Geographical Information Systems: these systems for mapping geographical information used to be be a niche market, relevant only to specialist users. Programs such as the route-mapping program AutoRoute have now found their way into people's homes, and helped awareness of the larger potential of GIS. Commercial applications are now becoming appealing for corporations in such areas as research and marketing, especially as the availability of CD-ROM has made demographic and other high-volume detailed information readily available. The hot topic - Object Oriented Programming: the latest buzzword for the programming community leaves most non-technical people bewildered. Software At Work will explain what it means, what it will enable users to do, and why most people don't really need to know more than that.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus: </F> "Revolutionary Dogmatism and the Nontriviality of Practical  Politics"]    [Text] Recently some members of the cabinet and I myself  have been reproached for assuaging our rhetoric and even a  certain withdrawal from our originally defined positions. I  have the feeling that the people who argue this way base their  criticism on a misunderstanding of the first post-November  period and a somewhat superficial observation of the present  stage of the historical regeneration of our country, and since  this is a serious matter, it merits a few words of explanation.    If we take as the first example the economic basis of our  transformation program, the intensity with which I fought in the  spring of 1990 for the price liberalization, balanced budget,  macroeconomic stability, and particularly privatization is being  compared with my present alleged leniency in the matter of the  rent and transport tariffs regulation, in the disputes over  supplementing the state budget from the National Property Fund  or the postponement of the beginning of the second wave of  coupon privatization. These critics here note a contradiction  that is beyond my comprehension.    My original fight for freedom of enterprise and the  abolition  of all forms of state interventionism is being compared with my  present endeavors to regulate the super-fast development in  wages. Another sin!    Today, the fundamentally negative stand I assumed against  the  gradualist project of the economic reform (represented  particularly by V. Komarek, M. Zeman, and F. Vlasak) is  contrasted with my own gradualism in the matters of the state  administration reform, for instance, or the education reform.  Again, an alleged inconsistency!    While in the past I have been often described as the chief  engineer of the "shock therapy," a Friedmanite, and an  ultra-right character, I am being attacked today, from the side  of the so-called authentic right wing, for my -- according to  them -- unwarranted social regards and hesitance in adopting  more severe and risky economic and social solutions. Almost a  state paternalism!    My merciless criticism of the so-called third way is  presently being compared with my endeavors to explain to the  Western governments where their real mistake lies. My  consistently negative stand towards the communist past is being  contrasted with my willingness to cooperate with the widest  possible circle of able people who are ready to act. My calls  for freedom of the press and speech are being contrasted with my  alleged efforts to place the radio and television under the  direct control of the government. I could go on like this for  quite a while longer.    First of all, I must point out that I listen to these  criticisms very carefully, and that from each of them I am  trying to reach some conclusions for myself. Nevertheless, I  believe that they are based on false assumptions, which are the  idea of the inconsistency of my present and former views, on the  one hand, and the idea of the equivalence of the tasks of  January 1990 and those of January 1994, on the other hand!    The ensuing misunderstanding (I cannot rid myself of this so  frequently reminded and caricatured word of mine) troubles me  nonetheless, and therefore I keep trying to explain the reasons  for it in the press, at political talks, or at meetings with  citizens. Even in this brief text, I would like to make at least  two general comments on this.    The first problem that causes complications is the  communication between a politician and the public by means of  the deceptive transmission mechanism of media. Politics is --  among other things -- the art of the correct usage of the words,  which are ordinarily at the politician's disposal only in the  degenerate form of slogans, signs, certain cliches, and  especially dangerous simplifications. A politician  unfortunately does not have the opportunity to express his ideas  and views in extensive essays or even novels, or rather, if he  does, he does not do so as a politician. The situation forces  him to express himself in a condensed manner, therefore  necessarily imprecisely, and -- let us not be afraid to admit it  -- often dogmatically and schematically. I will give a small  example. If the Czech, or more correctly "Prague" economic  school (which is a daring exaggeration) had at least a small  comparative advantage in anything at all in the present economy,  it would be, for instance, in its understanding that the term  "central planning" represents only a hypothetic model concept,  and that nothing like that has actually existed in the real  socialism of the past decades. Although -- as opposed to  standard economics -- I am well aware of this, in the every-day  political abbreviation, I defend the free market against central  planning because I cannot do anything else. (Nevertheless, it  could have been noticed that I avoid the cheap condemnation of  various institutions and mechanisms of the past, and instead  always try for a positive program).    I would like to emphasize that I feel awkward using such  and similar thought abridgements and slogans and, in particular,  I am concerned that I could discombobulate someone and elicit  false expectations of a similar brevity of the practical  solutions. I am afraid that some of our somewhat tardy  revolutionaries of the turn of the years 1993/1994 would, still  today, like to see changes that would be just as fast in actual  life as they are in the words used. Some of these people  perceive our temporarily lower rate of unemployment as a  betrayal of the ideas of Milton Friedman, others compare the  present "oppression" of businessmen with the period of the  government of Klement Gottwald, yet others interpret the search  for a complex transformation of the budget-funded and subsidized  organizations into non-profit organizations and the optimum  relations between sponsors and the tax system as a denial of the  foundations of the civic society and Michael Novak's concept of  "mediating structures." Of course, this is completely false,  but all that remains is to be careful with the condensed  slogans, and keep explaining patiently what is concealed behind  them.    The other important element is that our society and the  economy -- without us realizing this sufficiently well because  of the tremendous speed of the changes -- are no longer  reminiscent of almost anything of the political and economic  structures of the period immediately after the November. The  problems that we are dealing with today are miles from the  problems of spring 1990, i.e. from the period immediately after  the fall of communism.    Some of us insist on underestimating this factor. They  forget the difference between demolishing and building, the  difference between the spectacular pivotal measures (there are  several of them) and the assiduous every-day work, and the  disparity of the fast system-forming steps and the slow  post-transformation tasks, they forget the one-dimensional  character of the political, social, and economic reality then,  and the vigor and wealth of life today, they forget the greater  possibilities for adopting rapid measures then, and the complex  system of our political life now. Moreover, our oversensitivity  to the excesses of the past very logically puts our government  in a much weaker position than that of an ordinary Western  European government. All this fundamentally affects, and to a  great degree complicates, our life today, but we have to take it  as a given circumstance. This also applies to our critics.    It is my deepest conviction that the practical politics of  the present are completely consistent with the stands we have  proclaimed incessantly since November 1989. The dissatisfaction  and impatience of some of us is not a result of the errors of  the present, but rather stem from a misunderstanding of the  essence of the present system and, for that matter, also of the  past one.</p>

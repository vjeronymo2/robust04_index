			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: GIB falls to BFr605m in first six months FALLING food prices and depressed consumer spending combined with rising labour costs to cut net profits at GIB Group, the Belgian retailer, to BFr605m (Dollars 16.8m) in the six months to July 31, from BFr1.68bn in the corresponding period last year. GIB, which is Belgium's biggest private-sector employer, announced 10 days ago that 4,600 of the 17,000 full-time and part-time employees in its Belgian supermarket chain would lose their jobs over the next three years. The group said that provisions linked to this recovery plan would appear in the second-half results, but it made no comment on the outlook for the full year. Profits were hit by extraordinary costs of BFr530m related to restructuring of its Sarma stores. In the first half of last year, GIB recorded an extraordinary profit of BFr365m, following property sales. GIB recorded sales of BFr113bn in the first half, against BFr111bn in the equivalent period. Supermarkets and hypermarkets increased sales by 1.4 per cent, while do-it-yourself stores pushed up turnover by 5.8 per cent.</p>

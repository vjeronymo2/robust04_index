			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed item from roundup of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, </F> ITAR-TASS reports under the "Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow" rubric:  "Rains Help"]    [Text] Grain farmers in Altay Kray have sown the first 1  million hectares of grain. The rains in Altay Kray proved  highly opportune: The ground became saturated with moisture,  which has been lacking since the winter.    Sugar beet farmers have also brought sowing equipment into  the fields. Around another 2,000 hectares have already been  sown to this crop. Over one-half the allocated area has been  sown to sunflowers. Specialists estimate that the current pace  of the sowing campaign in Altay Kray is no worse than last year.</p>

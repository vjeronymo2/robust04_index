			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Redwood to shake up rural Welsh quango A Welsh quango which was attacked by MPs is to be revamped, with some of its functions transferred to local authorities. Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, told the Commons yesterday that the Development Board for Rural Wales, which the Commons public accounts committee censured in May, would retain its core functions. But it would have to liaise more closely with the Welsh Development Agency, and Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, chairman of the WDA, would take over as chairman of both agencies. The development board, based in Newtown, Powys, was set up nearly 20 years ago to stem depopulation of rural Wales by promoting economic and social development. It has a staff of 120 and a budget of Pounds 26.8m, including a Welsh Office grant of nearly Pounds 17m. Mr Redwood said in March that he was reviewing its future. This led to speculation it would be subsumed into the WDA, which in turn triggered a campaign by business and political leaders in Wales for its retention. The Welsh secretary acknowledged yesterday that there was 'considerable support' for the development board's work in property development and business services. These functions would remain with it. To increase local accountability, two additional councillors would be appointed to the board. Councils will take over the development board's responsibility for a variety of grant schemes from next year, Mr Redwood said. Its tourism activities would transfer to the Wales Tourist Board and the WDA would take 'a strong lead' in promoting inward investment. Mr Rowe-Beddoe said last night: 'There will certainly be no takeover of the DBRW by the WDA.' The Commons public accounts committee heavily criticised the development board in May and Mr Glyn Davies, its chairman for the seven years, resigned. The committee's report said it had failed to comply with housing acts by operating two sets of rules for housing allocation - one set of which was unpublished. Under the undisclosed rules, the housing officer and his ex-wife were given homes they were not qualified for under the public rules. There was also criticism of a car-leasing scheme. Ivor Owen writes: Mr Redwood said he had no plans for primary legislation to deal with what Mr Rhodri Morgan, a Labour spokesman on Wales, described as the 'legal difficulties' faced by the development board. The minister said he had decided to review the board's future long before any doubts arose because he wished to develop policy in a new direction.</p>

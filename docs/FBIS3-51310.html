			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Permanent Commission of the Episcopate yesterday  urged those responsible for constitutional reform to make their  intentions and procedures transparent so that the future  constitution will be the product of a social pact. The bishops  criticized the conditions being imposed on some branches of  government and asserted that this pressure is also undermining  the legitimacy of the future constitution. The Church's  pronouncement topped a tension-filled day on which one Supreme  Court justice repelled an attack by President Menem, who in  Tokyo had called for his resignation, and the retirement of  another justice of the court was postponed indefinitely. The  Supreme Court handed down a judgment declaring that a  Constituent Assembly cannot have unlimited powers.    The Catholic Church affirmed yesterday that the efforts made  so far to bring about constitutional reform are characterized by  "conditions imposed on the constituent branches of government  that compromise their actions," which "threatens the legitimacy  and permanence of a future constitution." The Church's position  was publicized in a document released yesterday at the  conclusion of deliberations by the Permanent Commission of the  Episcopate.    The bishops exhorted those responsible for the  constitutional  reform process "to make their intentions, motives, and  procedures transparent so that the constitution that emerges  will be the expression of a true social pact."    Without mentioning the protagonists, but alluding to the  pressures the executive branch has exerted on Congress and the  judiciary, among other issues, the bishops' communique mentioned  the political coercion that took place on Tuesday with the  removal of the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Antonio  Boggiano, and on Wednesday with the resignation of Justice  Rodolfo Barra.    Yesterday's is the first official document issued by the  Catholic Church regarding the constitutional reform, and it  comes more than three months before the opinion of the Church is  expected to be made public. The first draft of that document is  being prepared by a committee chaired by Cardinal Raul  Primatesta.    In just 35 lines, the Episcopate sums up ecclesiastical  displeasure with the current negotiations on the reform. After  mentioning the conditions imposed on the branches of government,  the document points out that they also compromise "the  responsibility of the legislators, the stability of the judges,  and even the legitimacy and permanence of the future  constitution."    The bishops briefly praised the political dialogue, and then  focused on the formal aspect of the reform negotiations  undertaken by the Justicialist Party (PJ) and the Radical Civic  Union (UCR). The Permanent Commission is an entity chaired by  Cardinal Quarracino that makes decisions in representation of  the plenary assembly.    The statement shows signs of the internal debate that is  going on in the Church. This controversy was not apparent at the  October assembly, when the bishops merely described the basic  dogmatic themes without alluding to any current issues.    The statement of 27 October noted that "the Constitution  itself governs the procedures for its eventual reform" at a time  when the political cauldron was boiling because the government  was trying to move forward with the amendment of the  Constitution with just two-thirds of the members present in  Congress.    The Olivos accord between President Carlos Menem and Radical  leader Raul Alfonsin forced the committee headed by Primatesta  to rethink its position. The committee, also made up of Bishops  Emilio Bianchi Di Carcano (Azul), Jose Maria Arancedo (Mar del  Plata), and Juan Carlos Maccarone (Lomas de Zamora), decided to  release part of the draft early.    Signals also came from other prelates, such as Edgardo  Storni, archbishop of Santa Fe, who termed the agreement between  Menem and Alfonsin on constitutional reform "unethical." "The  only goal is reelection, and to achieve it, they throw out  crumbs of power to maintain themselves as the political class,"  said Storni in a harsh tone not usually heard in Church  officials.    Yesterday's statement from the bishops recalled that "any  agreement should be a step forward, and should in and of itself  mean the creation of a propitious environment for a fruitful  debate on the issues involved in the common good and the  requirements for true democracy."    This first official opinion on the reform from the episcopal  leadership contends that "the Argentine people are not very  familiar with the reform proposals or their motivations," and  that, on the other hand, "they desire a decent future in a  united society." The document also states that the desire for  reform "should not distract government officials or the governed  from daily attention to the tasks that ensure life and the  quality of life for all inhabitants."    Another thrust, this one aimed at emphasizing that "the  leaders' political skill must be supported by exemplary ethical  standards, which become more and more necessary as the  consequences of their decisions become more serious for the  country."</p>

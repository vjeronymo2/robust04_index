			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> We contemplate disclosing information under this routine use only when SSA enters into a contractual or similar agreement with a third party to help SSA maintain the proposed systems or to carry out the PEBES mailing program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In administering our program, we often find that it is more efficient to use an outside contractor to carry out some of our functions. This proposed routine use would allow us to disclose information from the system under these circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Information may be disclosed to a congressional office in response to an inquiry from the congressional office made at the request of the subject of the record. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wage and other information which is subject to the disclosure provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC, 26 6103) will not be disclosed under this routine use unless disclosure is expressly permitted by the IRC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We contemplate disclosing information under this routine use only in situations in which the individual asks his/her Member of Congress to intercede in an SSA matter on his/her behalf. Information will be disclosed from the proposed systems only when the Member of Congress inquires and presents evidence that he/she is acting on behalf of the individual whose record is requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Information may be disclosed to the Department of Justice (DOJ), a court, or other tribunal, or another party before such tribunal, when: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) SSA, or any component thereof; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) any SSA employee in his/her official capacity; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) any SSA employee in his/her individual capacity when DOJ (or SSA, when it is authorized to do so) has agreed to represent the employee; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) the United States or any agency thereof when SSA determines that the litigation is likely to affect the operations of SSA or any of its components, Is a party to litigation or has an interest in such litigation, and SSA determines that the use of such records by DOJ, the court or other tribunal, or other party before the tribunal is relevant and necessary to the litigation, provided, however, that in each case SSA determines that such disclosure is compatible with the purposes for which the records were collected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wage and other information which is subject to the disclosure provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC, 26 U.S.C. 6103) will not be disclosed under this routine use unless disclosure is expressly permitted by the IRC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed routine use would permit us to disclose information from the proposed systems when an SSA component and/or employee is involved in litigation involving information in the proposed system. The routine use would also permit disclosure when SSA brings suit or when another party bring suit and SSA has an interest in the litigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Information may be disclosed to the Office of the President for responding to an individual pursuant to an inquiry received from that individual or from a third party on his or her behalf. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wage and other information which is subject to the disclosure provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC, 26 U.S.C. 6103) will not be disclosed under this routine use unless disclosure is expressly permitted by the IRC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We contemplate disclosing information under this routine use in situations in which that individual or someone else on the individual's behalf asks the President to intercede in an SSA matter pertaining to the individual. Information may be disclosed from the proposed systems when the Office of the President inquires and presents evidence that it is acting on behalf of the individual whose record is requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Nontax return information, the disclosure of which is not expressly restricted by Federal law, may be disclosed to the General Services Administration and the National Archives and Records Administration under 44 U.S.C. 2904 and 2906, as amended by the National Archives and Records Administration Act of 1984, for the use of those agencies in conducting records management studies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wage and other information which is subject to the disclosure provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC, 26 U.S.C. 6103) will not be disclosed under this routine use unless disclosure is expressly permitted by the IRC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Archivist of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) are charged by 44 U.S.C. 2904 with promulgating safeguards, procedures, and guidelines regarding records management and conducting records management studies. Section 2906 of that law, also amended by the NARA Act of 1984, provides that GSA and NARA are to have access to Federal agencies' records and that agencies are to cooperate with GSA and NARA. In carrying out these responsibilities, it may be necessary for GSA and NARA to have access to these two proposed systems of records. In such instances, the routine use will facilitate disclosure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Information may be disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for auditing SSA's compliance with the safeguard provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This routine use applied only to the History File which maintains some information obtained from the IRS. As necessary, the routine use will allow disclosure to IRS to ensure that SSA is in compliance with safeguard standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> IV. Compatibility of the Proposed Routine Uses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Both the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(7) and (b)(3)) and our disclosure regulations (20 CFR part 401) permit us to disclose information under a routine use for a purpose which is compatible with the purposes for which we collected the information. Paragraph 401.310(c) of the regulations permits us to disclose information under a routine use to administer our programs. Section 401.205 of the regulations requires us to disclose information when a law specifically requires the disclosure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed routine uses numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, described above, will facilitate SSA's administration of its programs. Routine use number 5 will allow GSA or NARA to inspect our records, as required by 44 U.S.C. 2904 and 2906, when those agencies conduct records management studies. Thus, all the routine uses are appropriate and meet the criteria in the Privacy Act and SSA's regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> V. Safeguards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> We will employ a number of security measures to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal data in the two proposed systems. These measures include the use of passwords and access codes to enter the computer system which will maintain the data, and storage of the computerized records in secured areas which are accessible only to employees who require the information in performing their official duties. SSA employees who have access to the data will be informed of the criminal penalties of the Privacy Act for unauthorized access to or disclosure of information maintained in the system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, any contract which SSA may sign with a third party in order to carry out the required mailings will stipulate that (a) the contractor must establish safeguards to protect the personal information temporarily in its custody, in accordance with Privacy Act requirements; (b) the contractor may use the information only as necessary in fulfilling the contract; and (c) the contractor is subject to criminal penalties for violations of the Privacy Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

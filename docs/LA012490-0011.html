			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAST OF 'CHEERS' LEADS WESTWOOD PROTEST AGAINST MEDFLY SPRAYING  </P> <P> Barflies met Medflies on Tuesday, as the cast of the long-running television  series "Cheers" led a Westwood protest against continued aerial spraying of the  controversial pesticide malathion.  </P> <P> "I have three children and I'm very careful about what I feed them, yet I have  absolutely no control over this stuff being dropped on our heads," said Rhea  Perlman, who plays a wise-cracking waitress on the NBC situation comedy, which  takes place in a mythical Boston tavern. "I feel like it's something the  citizens of Los Angeles should have a say in."  </P> <P> In all, some 80 protesters, many wearing breathing masks or carrying signs  reading "Honk If You Hate Malathion," participated in the noontime rally  outside the Federal Building.  </P> <P> It was the latest in a mushrooming series of protests against the state-ordered  government spraying program that began late last year to eradicate the most  recent Mediterranean fruit fly infestation that affects 372 square miles in  Southern California.  </P> <P> It was also the most star-studded anti-pesticide rally this year, as the six  cast members made a 45-minute appearance before hustling off in a van to  Hollywood -- as fellow protesters applauded -- in order to film a new episode  of "Cheers."  </P> <P> "We only had them for about half an hour," explained Doretta Zemp, whose  Coalition Against Malathion organized the protest. "They have a 12 o'clock  shoot today."  </P> <P> Zemp then led the remaining demonstrators in a sing-along protest to the tune  of "Frere Jacques":  </P> <P>  "Malathion. Malathion.  </P> <P>  "Fills the air. Fills the air.  </P> <P>  "Babies sick and crying.  </P> <P>  "Governor is lying.  </P> <P>  "Say you care. Save the air."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The protesters, most garbed in red to "signify danger," proceeded to march into  Westwood Village to be filmed themselves for the evening news.  </P> <P> Unlike some demonstrations attended by Hollywood celebrities in which the  issues may have little impact on their lives, pesticide spraying has a direct  bearing on members of the environmentally conscious "Cheers" cast, the actors  said.  </P> <P> "I've got two babies at home and when I'm told I should cover the playground  equipment and the sandbox . . . I've got to start thinking -- why?" said John  Ratzenberger, who portrays Cliff the mailman. "This (demonstration) helps me to  vent my spleen, certainly. And I'll do whatever it takes for my voice to be  heard.  </P> <P> "If I was a steamfitter I'd still be here."  </P> <P> The show's star, Ted Danson, founder of the American Oceans Campaign  environmental organization, said common sense tells him that "every time you  use a pesticide, it ends up getting in the water system."  </P> <P> Danson acknowledged, however, that he still is trying to learn more about  malathion.  </P> <P> "I'm not really here to make a huge statement here today. I'm here to educate  myself," he said. "(But) something does not feel right. You have to admit it's  a little strange that you have to run out and cover your pools and your  sandboxes and tape your windows.  </P> <P> " . . . Unless we jump up and down and say, 'wait, wait, toxics are not the  answer,' then no one is going to look for a safer answer," Danson continued.  "They're going to look for the most expedient, cheapest way for them to  accomplish their goals.  </P> <P> "It's kind of human nature."  </P></p>

On its part, the government has charged that the former  soldiers are being "manipulated" by those who want to create  problems for the election process. Pedro Martinez, of the  Association of Demobilized Armed Forces Members [Asociacion de  Desmovilizados de la Fuerza Armada -- Adefaes], said "we could  obstruct the elections. We have demobilized personnel in all  the departments and we could easily block streets and prevent  access to polling stations."    The demobilized soldiers yesterday gathered in front of the  offices of the Armed Forces Social Welfare Institute (IPSFA),  located at No. 6a-10a, Poniente Street, near the National  Gymnasium. "We are told to present ourselves, but when we do so,  they write in our documents that we were discharged because we  are guilty of some irregularity in our service or we went AWOL  and they refuse to grant us our rights," the former soldiers  said. "We have warned the government and the Armed Forces that  we will not permit being denied compensation." "We will go to  Guazapa Hill [site of fighting during the armed conflict]." "We  are going to take reprisals against all those who oppose our  compensation process. We are going to take reprisals against  the colonels and the officers who are declaring themselves our  enemies," the former soldiers warned.    Presidency Minister Oscar Santamaria yesterday warned that  if  the former soldiers carry out their threats, the law will be  enforced against them.</p>

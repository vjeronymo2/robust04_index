			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / More women graduates find work than men THE NUMBER of female graduates finding work within six months of graduation exceeded the number of males for the first time last year. Figures compiled by the Central Services Unit for Graduate Employment and the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services show that although women made up less than half the 135,000 graduates in the study, 31,359 women had found permanent or short-term work in the UK or overseas by December last year compared with 31,273 men. A 5.5 per cent increase in the total of graduates combined with a depressed labour market left 11.5 per cent of graduates still unoccupied after six months, up from 8.1 per cent in 1990. The jobless rate for women graduates was 9.4 per cent and 13.4 per cent for men. Teacher training rose in popularity, with more than 5,000 graduates, 4.5 per cent of the total, choosing it last year compared with 3.7 per cent in 1990. Women continue to outnumber men in teacher training by more than two to one. The figures were drawn from surveys carried out by universities, polytechnics and colleges.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / World Trade News: EU to back Ruggiero to head the WTO - Veteran Italian diplomat emerges as front-runner The European Union is set to back Mr Renato Ruggiero, a veteran Italian diplomat and former foreign trade minister, to become head of the World Trade Organisation, which is due to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year. Mr Ruggiero, who is 64 and has been a director of Fiat, the Italian motor manufacturer, since 1991, is the first candidate to win official support for the post from any Gatt member. Though the EU has yet formally to declare his nomination, Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner - who this week ruled himself out of the running - plans to canvass backing for Mr Ruggiero from the US and Japan. Sir Leon is expected to discuss the issue with Mr Mickey Kantor, President Bill Clinton's trade representative, and Mr Koji Kakizawa, the Japanese foreign minister, at next week's ministerial meeting in Paris of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Commission threw its weight behind Mr Ruggiero after the Italian government notified it yesterday that it would support his nomination. When the matter was discussed by officials from the 12 EU governments, none indicated that it intended to field a rival candidate. Mr Ruggiero was Italy's trade minister between 1987 and 1991, critical years for the Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation talks. He was one of the first to espouse the idea of a powerful world trade organisation to replace the Gatt, a proposal later supported by the EU. Mr Ruggiero spent much of his 30 years with the Italian foreign service on European policy issues. He served successively as the European Commission's director-general of regional affairs, its official spokesman, and as Italy's permanent representative in Brussels. He also represented his government in preparations for several world economic summits before becoming foreign trade minister and then co-ordinator of Fiat's international activities. All the directors-general of the Gatt to date have been Europeans. Mr Peter Sutherland, the present incumbent, was previously Ireland's commissioner, in charge of European competition policy. However, a growing number of Gatt members believe the time has come to break with tradition. Developing countries, who account for most of the membership, believe they have a strong case for providing the first WTO head, though they have yet to rally behind a candidate. Latin American candidates put up a respectable showing last year against Mr Sutherland, and the name of Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's finance minister and a former Gatt ambassador, is being canvassed. There are also suggestions that the job should go to a nominee from the Asia-Pacific region. Two New Zealanders have been mentioned - Mr Philip Burdon, the trade minister, and Mr Mike Moore, an ex-prime minister.</p>

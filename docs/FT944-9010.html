			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Generation X goes to the anti-mall - Victoria Griffith finds designer graffiti and a lack of marble fountains at The Lab, dedicated to young Californian shoppers Graffiti on the crumbling wall declares 'Lost in a sense'. Weeds creep up through cracks in the pavement. Teenagers in cut-off shorts and hiking boots lounge on thrift-shop furniture. The scene may be evocative of city slums, but there is nothing undesirable about this picture in the eyes of its creators. The place is The Lab, a shopping complex in southern California that bills itself as the first mall in the US to be conceived for a single generation. In fact, say its developers, The Lab is not really a mall at all; it is more of an anti-mall. A hotch-potch of broken signs, scaffolding, and a fountain made of oil drums, the anti-mall's target audience is the so-called Generation X: 18-30-year-olds. 'If anyone blindfolded you and dropped you in a typical mall across the country, you would not have any idea where you are,' says The Lab's developer Shaheen Sadeghi. 'Here, we tried for something different, not the old fountain-and-marble formula. We tried to put some excitement in retailing.' Usual mall mainstays such as Neiman Marcus, The Banana Republic and Waldenbooks are conspicuously absent. Instead, The Lab offers a comic book shop called Collectors Library and a florist called Weeds. So far, The Lab's strategy seems to work. The complex rented out all available spaces before its opening in March, and retailers say they are pleased. 'It allows us to reach our target market,' says Rodney Metoyer, manager of Tower Alternative, a subsidiary of the music store Tower Records. Tower Alternative, created specifically for The Lab, stocks recordings of trendy bands such as The Cranberries, Green Day and Nirvana, as well as unsigned local bands from the area. The retail store Urban Outfitters forms the anchor for the shopping complex, and the chain's architect, Pompei AD, designed The Lab. It is Urban Outfitters' first time in a mall - part of the chain's strategy has been to locate only in urban areas. The Lab's architects say the store is meant to mimic dense urban environments. 'We were looking for the same sort of excitement and energy you get from being in a hip neighbourhood of a big city,' said Ron Pompei, principal of Pompei AD 'Imperfections are OK here.' As a base for the old and crumbling look, The Lab was built in and around the most ancient structure in the town of Costa Mesa, near Los Angeles - a military barracks from the 1950s. Instead of building the complex in a real downtown area, Pompei imported urban decay for the simple reason that there are very few old downtown areas in southern California. 'There's no sense of centre here, and we are trying to fill that void.' Apart from Urban Outfitters and Tower Alternative, The Lab has no large chain stores, because Sadeghi believes Generation X opposes the homogenisation of American culture. Instead of 'food courts', the clusters of fast food restaurants found in most malls, The Lab dishes up health food in a coffee house furnished with lumpy sofas. The Lab also capitalises on Generation X's penchant for good causes. Instead of car expos and fashion shows, The Lab sponsors special charity events. One initiative earlier this year, for instance, invited shoppers to buy broken tiles to decorate walls. Proceeds went to a charity for the homeless. Sadeghi says the town was sceptical when The Lab first laid out its plans. 'They thought we were going to attract unemployed kids with tattoos,' he explains. 'But the people who come here are mostly students and young professionals.' Although The Lab is unabashedly aimed at the young, it has also attracted older customers. Sadeghi says half its customers are over 30. The formula may work in southern California, but it is questionable whether it will be as big a success in other areas of the country, such as the north-east and north-west of the US, where young trend-setters have authentic crumbling downtown areas to frequent. But Sadeghi says he is planning new anti-malls. He is currently eyeing a deteriorating downtown section of Seattle, Washington, and a suburban area on the edge of San Diego, south of LA. Once again, Pompei will provide a pseudo-urban design. The details have not yet been finalised, but one thing is certain. There won't be a marble fountain in sight.</p>

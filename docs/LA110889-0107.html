			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> ABANDONED: Forty to 50 children are abandoned each year in Orange County, but  just one or two are newborns. . . . The infant found this week (B1) probably  won't find a permanent adoptive home for several months because of the  legalities involved in trying to find his natural parents or relatives. . . .  Had a parent relinquished the baby instead of abandoning him, adoption  proceedings could begin almost immediately. . . . A happy footnote: The baby  last abandoned in Orange County has been adopted. Steve Emmons and Dana Parsons  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHEVARDNADZE'S RESIGNATION  </P> <P> Your front-page article "Bold Rightists Press Cause in Uneasy Moscow" (Dec. 22)  is confusing in its terminology. Why is it that forces in the Soviet Union  intent on retaining Communism are referred to as "rightists," "reactionaries,"  "right-wing" and "conservatives"? In the next sentence, these same people are  referred to as "Communist militants," and we are told that "The right . . . 'is  now composed of a very big part of the (Communist) party apparatus. . . .' " On  the other hand, we find that people in the Soviet Union who wish to move toward  democracy and the free market are called "liberals," "progressives" and "the  left."  </P> <P> People who are in favor of socialism, Communism, Marxism, etc., have always  been, and should always be, identified as members of the "left." Extremists on  the "right," however, have always been linked with fascism. This is not the  time to switch references at will, depending on which country is being  described.  </P> <P> PAUL J. CHRISTMAN, Los Angeles  </P></p>

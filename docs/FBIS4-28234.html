			<p>BFN     [Text] There are further signs that Australia's economy is  continuing to improve. National accounts figures just released  show annual economic growth now stands at 5 percent -- up from 4  percent previously. Belinda Trump reports that the figures are  likely to increase fear the economy cannot keep up the pace.    [Begin Trump recording] Gross Domestic Products rose by 1.9  percent in the March quarter -- double some market expectations.  The main contributions to growth were strong household and  government spending, while business investment remained weak.    The March quarter was the eleventh consecutive quarter of  growth, but where the economy goes from here is a major issue.  Financial markets see the fast growth as a pointer to rising  inflation down the track and fear the government may have to  bring forward an increase in interest rates to control economic  growth.    For the moment, though, the government has the best of both  world -- fast growth with further signs in today's figures that  inflation during the March quarter remained low. [end recording]    Meanwhile, the federal treasurer, Ralph Willis, says the big  jump in economic growth confirms the Australian economy is on  track for a sustained recovery. Mr. Willis says the strong  growth marginally reflects the influence of a number of one-off  factors, such as a big increase in public spending.    Treasurer says however, the complementary jump in private  consumption, combined with rising profits, provides a highly  favorable environment for increases in business investment.    The prime minister, Paul Keating says it is 30 years since  the country has the economic conditions as good as this.</p>

The purpose of the Notice was to request comments on environmental issues. On May 31, 1994, PGT filed an amendment to its original application. In a June 8, 1994 response to an FERC staff data request, PGT confirmed that no expansion of its mainline facilities is required to provide service to the Tuscarora Pipeline Project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to this amendment, the Tuscarora Pipeline and the PGT Expansion II Projects were being processed concurrently because of the inclusion in Docket No. CP93&hyph;618&hyph;000 of additional system compression and three meter runs at Malin needed to deliver gas to the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. However, PGT's proposed amendment to eliminate the compression and their proposal to build the meter runs under separate authority make the Tuscarora Pipeline Project a stand-alone proposal which can be considered separately from the PGT Expansion II Project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above changes, we are proceeding with the joint EIR/EIS with the SLC for the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. The three meter runs at Malin will still be addressed as a related facility in the joint EIR/EIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Participation and Scoping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''. The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EIR/EIS on the important environmental issues, and to separate these from issues that are insignificant and do not require detailed study. Since scoping of the original project has already been completed, and no new facilities are being proposed, we are not seeking additional comments. Local scoping meetings have already been conducted for the original project. Additional scoping meetings are not anticipated. The purpose of this notice is to inform you that the PGT compression facilities are no longer within the scope of the joint EIR/EIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional information about the proposed project is available from Ms. Alisa Lykens, EIR/EIS Project Manager, at (202) 208&hyph;0766.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

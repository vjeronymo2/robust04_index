			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Letter: Privatisation endangers data confidentiality Sir, The Data Protection Registrar's call for new laws to protect the confidentiality of personal information is to be welcomed ('New laws urged to counter black market in secret data', July 15). It follows in the wake of last year's revelations about the former chancellor Norman Lamont's credit card details, and public awareness of a growing black market trade in personal financial and credit data. But what about the protection of personal data held on the state's computer systems? And what about data on companies as well as individuals? At the moment this information is highly secure due to civil service standards and traditions. But all that is about to change and we will see a much greater threat to personal confidentiality if privatised computer files on tax, social security, police and other records are put onto the data 'black market'. These are not groundless concerns. In little more than two months the Inland Revenue will award a contract for its computer operations to one of two American bidders. The contract will mean the transfer of 40m computer records on UK companies, partnerships and individual taxpayers into the private sector. There will be no guarantee that the the files or data processing work on them will stay in the UK. And all this is happening without public debate and without any real acknowledgment by ministers of the seriousness of the threat. In the light of revelations about the black market for credit data, assurances that the privatised tax computer records will be 'as confidential as information held by a bank' is no comfort at all. The government must change its mind about the privatisation of computer information held by the state.

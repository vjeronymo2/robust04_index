			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> PATCHES WINS, DOUBLES STEVENS' PLEASURE  </P> <P> Gary Stevens was on a double high going into Sunday's $163,600 Hollywood Oaks.  </P> <P> The 27-year-old jockey, trying to win the national money title that eluded him  by less than $30,000 in 1986, found out that trainer Wayne Lukas had named him  to ride Criminal Type in the $1-million Arlington Challenge Cup on Aug. 4.  </P> <P> Jose Santos won't be able to ride Criminal Type that day because he will be  required to serve a five-day New York suspension that has been in abeyance  since last year. Criminal Type's opposition is expected to include Sunday  Silence and Easy Goer.  </P> <P> And Stevens had the ride on Patches, another Lukas runner, in the Oaks. Stevens  had ridden Patches as well as Jefforee and A Wild Ride, whom Lukas was also  running in the 1 1/8-mile stake.  </P> <P> Patches sped past Golden Reef to take the lead approaching the far turn, got a  breather on the turn itself and then had barely enough left to beat Jefforee by  a head. Patches earned $96,100 for her owner and breeder, William T. Young of  Lexington, Ky.  </P> <P> Jefforee, running for the sixth time in less than two months, finished four  lengths ahead of Pampered Star in the field of eight, and it was 3 1/2 lengths  farther back to Let Fly, a 51-1 shot.  </P> <P> The other Lukas entrant, A Wild Ride, finished fifth, and the John Mabee-owned  entry of Annual Reunion and Fields of Gold, sent off as the 2-1 favorite by the  crowd of 22,105, ran sixth and seventh, respectively. Golden Reef finished  last.  </P> <P> Because she had a different owner than the Calumet Farm duo of Jefforee and A  Wild Ride, Patches was separated in the betting and paid $7.60 to win as the  second choice. Her winning time was 1:49 4/5.  </P> <P> Stevens has liked Patches since he won a couple of allowance races with the  Majestic Light-Miss Betty filly during an eight-day stretch at Santa Anita  early this year.  </P> <P> Patches was sent to Churchill Downs after that for a small stake a couple of  days before the Kentucky Derby. Patches was 1-9 when she dumped Stevens in the  post parade, ran off and had to be scratched by the stewards.  </P> <P> "That would have been one of the easiest races I ever had to win," Stevens  said. "What happened was that the pony boy dropped his reins, and the strap hit  my filly in the head."  </P> <P> Startled, Patches dropped Stevens, banged into the fence and took off. "I had a  couple of sore legs, and it could have been worse than that," Stevens said.  </P> <P> "When she stepped on me, she just missed my face by a couple of inches, and  there's no telling how serious it could have been if she had hit me.  </P> <P> "Craig Perret, who was on another horse right behind us, saw it all and told me  how close she'd come."  </P> <P> Patches ran at Churchill Downs about a week later, with Keith Allen, a local  rider, and won a minor stake, but when she returned to Hollywood Park, the  filly was ridden by Pat Valenzuela twice and finished second in the Railbird  June 9 and third in the Princess June 24.  </P> <P> Lukas said that Stevens didn't have any choice when he rode Hail Atlantis,  another of the trainer's top fillies, in the Princess.  </P> <P> "I had won the Santa Anita Oaks with Hail Atlantis, so I owed it to the owners  to ride her," Stevens said of the filly's far-back finish in the Princess.  </P> <P> Lukas says that Stevens and Patches make a good team. "He really seems to fit  her, and he was really anxious to get back on her," the trainer said.  </P> <P> "He came up to me right after that last race and requested to get on her."  </P> <P> Eddie Delahoussaye, who won the Oaks last year with Gorgeous, sent Golden Reef,  the second-place finisher in the Princess behind A Wild Ride, to the lead  Sunday, but she ran a slow opening half-mile in 47 seconds.  </P> <P> Stevens had Patches on the fence, in second place. "Eddie's filly was lugging  out all the way down the backside, so I decided to go on with mine," Stevens  said.  </P> <P> "That was a winning move, because then she got some rest coming around the  turn. She needed that, because I don't think she could have run any farther,  she was (tiring) at the end. With about 100 yards to go, I could hear Jefforee  coming, and we had just enough left to hold her off."  </P> <P> Lukas, whose strength through the years has been fillies, had come close but  never won the Oaks, one of the few major filly races to escape him. Since  running last about a year ago at Hollywood Park in her first race, Patches has  five victories, one second and two thirds in eight starts.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Bayakoa, who carries more weight than the country's top male horses, has been  assigned 128 pounds, the heaviest impost of her career, for next Sunday's  $200,000 Vanity Handicap at Hollywood Park. Next on the list is Gorgeous at 124  pounds, and then there's a drop to Beautiful Melody at 116 and Fantastic Look  at 112. . . . Trainer Bill Shoemaker saddled his second winner in as many days,  and third overall, when Profit System, a filly making her first start, won the  third race.  </P> <P> In another race Sunday, Stone God, a $60,000 auction buy, beat 2-year-old colts  as Warfield, a $700,000 purchase, ran last. . . . Elusive Road, winner of the  seventh race, was claimed for the fourth time in his last eight races. . . . On  Saturday, Gin Rummy Judy won the seventh race from the seventh post position on  the seventh day of the seventh month. The 4-year-old filly is owned by the  Seven Star Stable.  </P> <P> Gary Stevens has reached the $7-million mark in purses and leads Jose Santos by  about $900,000. . . . Don Alexander, who started the season as the track  announcer at Hollywood Park, is now calling the races at a small track near San  Antonio, Tex. . . . A total of $48,960 was raised for the Don MacBeth Memorial  Jockey Fund Saturday at Hollywood, where many jockeys gave up their mount fees.  The fund is used to aid disabled riders.  </P></p>

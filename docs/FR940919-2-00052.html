			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The groundwater reporting requirements for the parameters: TOC, pH,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Total Recoverable Metals which include Mercury, Cadmium, Copper,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lead, Zinc, Chromium (Hexavalent), Benzene and Naphthalene, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine if contamination exists from other sources are based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 308(a) of the Clean Water Act. The screening values for TOC,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Benzene, and Naphthalene are based on the final August 29, 1991,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification (56 FR 42739) and the standards for total recoverable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metals are based on the most current Florida Water Quality Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for total recoverable metals at FAC Section 17&hyph;302.530 [4&hyph;25&hyph;93].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with any petroleum fuel, other aromatic compounds will be present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> once testing has occurred. Other volatiles will be present in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> untreated groundwater in greater concentrations than benzene. Past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience in treatment design has shown that these organics can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively treated before discharging to surface waters. According  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the ``Toxicant Profile for the ALKYL BENZENES,'' (Ethylbenzene,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Isopropylbenzene, Toluene, Xylene) prepared for Florida's DEP by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Center of Biomedical and Toxicological Research at Florida State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> University, levels for these ALKYL BENZENES of 100&hyph;200  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/l were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended for the protection of aquatic organisms and human health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These recommendations are below EPA's ``Ambient Water Quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Criteria'' documents recommendation for human health which suggest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels of 1400  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/l to 14300  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/l for Ethylbenzene and Toluene.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The recommended treatment technology of air stripping and, when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary, carbon adsorption, will reduce the benzene concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to below 1.0  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/l. Therefore, EPA will not impose specific limits on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the other pollutants which may occur since meeting the limits set in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this permit should reduce the other pollutants well below those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels allowable based on Florida's water quality standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, the effluent shall not be lethal to more than 50% of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate fish or invertebrate test organism in a 96-hour static  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> renewal test. Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) monitoring tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed by six (6) facilities between May 8, 1991 thru March, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that these effluents were toxic and, therefore, have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable potential to violate Florida's water quality standards at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAC Section 17&hyph;4.244(3)(a). Because previous 48-hour static WET  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring tests have revealed that these effluents have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential of being toxic, toxicity testing requirements as authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and required by 40 CFR Section 122.44(d)(1)(iv), and contained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part I, A.1 and A.2 and in Part V have been included to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effluent from these facilities conforms with the FAC. An LC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100% or less in a test of 96 hours duration or less will constitute a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation of FAC (February 2, 1994) Section 17&hyph;4.244(3)(a) and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms of this permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the recovery wells in most instances are placed in areas of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highest contamination, it is reasonable to conclude that the greatest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential for toxicity should occur during the initial startup stages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of operation. Therefore, an initial frequency of once every month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for three (3) months is included in these requirements to indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity and determine treatment performance of these facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately after commencement of discharge. If no toxicity is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confirmed, the frequency is then reduced to yearly since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permittee will be required to meet effluent limitations and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential for toxicity is at a minimum. Failure to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the acute toxicity requirement will constitute a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation of the terms of the permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sample type for all biomonitoring is ``Grab'' in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part V of this general permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The permittee is required to develop and implement a Best Management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Practices (BMPs) plan in conjunction with development of the Remedial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Action Plan required by FDEP. BMPs are actions or procedures to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent or minimize the potential for the release of toxic pollutants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or hazardous substances in significant amounts to surface waters. Additionally, for long term cleanups, the permittee shall develop a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pollution Prevention Plan which considers alternatives for preventing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reducing impacts to surface waters in accordance with Part IV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.2 of this permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Treatment Technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to EPA's publication entitled ``Treatment of Volatile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organic Compounds in Drinking Water,'' a drinking water research  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experiment was conducted on spiked water using one organic volatile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and then by combining two volatiles. The experiment used aeration as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the treatment process. It was discovered that no difference was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observed in treatment efficiency when applying aeration to one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic chemical or a combination of volatiles. In this particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experiment an overall efficiency of 92% was obtained. Most petroleum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuels consist of a combination of volatiles and aromatics, each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different, based on additives included during refining of the fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In case studies revealed in the Environmental Science and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Engineering's document ESE No. 84&hyph;912&hyph;0300, packed tower aeration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilizing different packing materials, varying flow paths and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air-to-water ratios have been proven effective in removing over 99%  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the volatiles. Some particular compounds are not as easily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air-stripped as others which would necessitate the need for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination treatment design used in conjunction with aeration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Carbon adsorption has been proven effective in removing organics from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water until the influent concentration is in equilibrium with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effluent and the organics no longer adhere to the carbon surface.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adsorption has been used successfully in removing less volatile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds of higher molecular weight. Other remediation techniques  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently being deployed include vapor recovery systems and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bioremediation which enhances biological activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to (EPA 570/9&hyph;84&hyph;005) entitled ``Adsorption Techniques in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Drinking Water Treatment'' the efficiency of carbon adsorption was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proven effective during a case study in Hialeah, Florida at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preston water treatment plant. In this study, groundwater from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drinking water aquifer was spiked with higher molecular weight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extractables before treating the water with granular activated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbon. It was found that more than 90% removal of the spiked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds was obtained. The combination of air-stripping with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adsorption usually extends the adsorptive life of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activated carbon and leads to more efficient treatment, but is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> always required or recommended in every situation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Other Legal Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12291  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review requirements of Executive Order 12291 pursuant to Section 8[b]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of that order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

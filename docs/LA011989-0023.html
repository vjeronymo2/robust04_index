			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> A previously unknown piano concerto by Franz Liszt is due to have its premiere  next season by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, after being discovered and  pieced together over the last nine months by Jay Rosenblatt, a Chicago  musicologist. Rosenblatt found the work (tentatively dated from 1839) last  April in Budapest, Hungary, while gathering materials for a doctoral  dissertation on Liszt. An archivist in Weimar, East Germany, had catalogued the  manuscript as belonging to an early version of a familiar E-flat Liszt  concerto. However examination proved that it had no material in common with  that work. The newly discovered manuscript, Rosenblatt said, was "shuffled like  a deck of cards" among the known E-flat concerto.

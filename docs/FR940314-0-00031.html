Record the torque values in accordance with paragraph (d) of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Visually inspect and investigate all external propeller oil leakage at the next line check, or within 70 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first. If the leakage is found to be caused by other than a leak in the blade seal, the pressure relief valve, or actuator assembly, the propeller must be removed from service and replaced with a serviceable propeller prior to further flight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Thereafter, visually inspect and investigate all external propeller oil leakage at intervals not to exceed 70 hours TIS since the last inspection, or at the next line check, whichever occurs first. If the leakage is found to be caused by other than a leak in the blade seal, the pressure relief valve, or actuator assembly, the propeller must be removed from service and replaced with a serviceable propeller prior to further flight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Boston Aircraft Certification Office. The request should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Boston Aircraft Certification Office. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this airworthiness directive, if any, may be obtained from the Boston Aircraft Certification Office. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (j) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the aircraft to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

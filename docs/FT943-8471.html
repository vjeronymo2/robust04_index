			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Arts: The case for controversial views - Television The British, it is said, are masters of compromise. Look at their parliamentary system: they set up one lot of people to run the government and another lot to oppose them. The legal system provides for adversaries, insisting that the state not only prosecute the accused but argue his defence with equal rigour. Underlying such systems is the belief that, where matters of ethics and fine judgment are concerned, you may come close to the truth by listening to different opinions. There is a similar value in the diversity of opinion within journalism. Yet whereas we are fairly comfortable with the notion of all sorts of extreme attitudes in print, there is still widespread anxiety when such attitudes are expressed on television. Journalists whose work causes little more than minor controversy in print - John Pilger, say, or Auberon Waugh - can cause an outcry when they offer the same thoughts on television. Assertions that the carpet bombing of German cities in the second world war was a pretty nasty and not very cost effective policy, that Bomber Harris was aggressive and not the most compassionate of men, or that victory in the Pacific might have been achieved by showing evidence of the power of the A-bomb to the Japanese rather than dropping it on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, are not new. They have appeared frequently in print without causing untoward outrage. Repeat them on television, however, and a lot of people get very upset. Perhaps this is partly because more people watch television than read serious journalism, but I suspect it is also because television is not seen as a medium of opinion in the same way as print. A viewer may not himself be persuaded by the programme that Harris was a brutal, uncaring man, yet may worry because he believes others will be swayed by television; by the perception that this is historical fact rather than nuance or even eccentric theorising of the sort you find so often in print. Such was the hostility to Channel 4's screening of a programme about Bomber Command in the Canadian series The Valour And The Horror that Right To Reply was recalled from its summer recess to mount a special edition devoted exclusively to the topic. Defenders of Bomber Command made a number of telling points (all your research is thrown into question if you claim a man's nickname was 'Butcher' when it was actually 'Butch') but in the end Right To Reply's greatest success was in revealing the virtue on both sides. The older men, with memories of so many dead comrades, were surely right to be furious at seeing their own side pilloried when they had done what had to be done - in the heat of war - to overcome the vileness of Nazism. The younger men were surely right to question the ethics of fighting vileness if it involves becoming vile. Hoping that the veterans will welcome critical reinterpretations of the war, on the grounds that it was precisely this sort of freedom they were supposed to have fought for, is a bit much perhaps. However, there is no great virtue in championing 'free speech' if that merely means the freedom to say things with which you agree. If it is not to be an empty boast, then free speech must mean the right of someone such as Kenneth Griffith to present a programme such as Hang Up Your Brightest Colours, his celebration of the life of IRA leader Michael Collins which waited 21 years for a network screening. BBC2 showed it on Saturday as part of their '25 Bloody Years' series on the Irish troubles. In 1973 Lew Grade, then head of ATV, suppressed the programme because he felt it sympathised too openly with Irish republicanism. But this programme, surely, is the equivalent of the argument from the opposition, the case for the defence, the component which the formal system of adversary attitudes insists we should understand so that we can come to a proper appreciation of the broader picture. Yet the powers that be - whether Grade or the BBC governors who so cravenly suppressed Real Lives: At The Edge Of The Union, or the government - repeatedly insult our intelligence by imposing bans on programme material which they think will bamboozle us even though it fails to sway them. (Had Griffith's film converted Grade he would presumably have wanted to screen it.) It is perfectly possible to admire Griffith's extraordinary talent, even to share some of his admiration for Collins, and yet to go on loathing and despising the methods of the IRA. The awful thing is that, whatever the subject, television does so pitifully little in this business of portraying all sides. Richard Dawkins had half an hour on Channel 4 on Monday in The Vision Thing to explain not just why he is not religious but why he believes religion is an undesirable phenomenon. Given the scarcity of religious belief among most of the broadcasting people I have ever met, it is odd that such programmes should be astoundingly unusual compared with the countless series packed with stained glass, choirboys and hymns. Heretic on BBC2, about men who have been ostracised by the scientific community because of their unfashionable ideas, has made a nice change from the usual two schools of science on television, 'Gee whiz]' and 'Oh dear'. But series such as Heretic are rare indeed. Television news programmes offer a sequence of remarkably similar versions of events. The topics covered in the Daily Telegraph and The Guardian are also similar, but the perception of the world communicated to the reader differs greatly because of the different ways in which items are approached and the different weight given to constituents. Swap round the presenters in the television news programmes and most viewers would not be able to tell the difference between the programmes. Possibly the most depressing is television's arts coverage. Apart from occasional items in Channel 4's Without Walls practically all the material in this area is coated uniformly in the varnish of 1960s modernism. Seen in newspaper terms, virtually all television arts programmes take a Guardian/Observer approach. There may be occasional panellists from The Modern Review or The Spectator but the programmes are still made under Guardian/Observer assumptions. Moreover, the new technologies - satellite, cable, cassette, whatever - show few signs of increasing the array in such matters as the arts and history, even if we do now have Sky News. What television needs is not fewer but more passionate extremists - from all extremes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MPN/GGD (RAY): "Briquemont Calls For </F> Coherent Strategy on Bosnia"; as released by Brussels BELGA  Database]    [Text] Brussels, 28 Jan (BELGA) -- Lieutenant General  Francis Briquemont, the former commander of the blue helmets in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, stated on Friday [28 January] that he would  not have hesitated to request air support from NATO planes in  the event of a massive attack on his men or on Sarajevo airport.    "Since my arrival in Bosnia, we have developed a system of  air cover (by the NATO fighter-bombers participating in the  `deny flight' operation). If there had been a massive attack  against the major UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] bases, I would  not have hesitated to call for these planes to intervene as they  would have been acting in legitimate defense," he said at a news  conference in Evere, three days after his return from Bosnia.    "If the lives of dozens of blue helmets had been in danger,  General Cot (commander of the UN forces in the former  Yugoslavia) and I would have requested permission from the UN  headquarters in New York to reply with air power," he added.    He confirmed, however, his opposition to massive air strikes  against the positions of the fighters.    General Briquemont also indicated that a withdrawal of the  blue helmets from Bosnia in the spring -- as is often mentioned  -- would be a "terrible failure" for the United Nations.    "Certain troops would also be very difficult to retrieve. I  am not sure that the population of Sarajevo would allow the  UNPROFOR to leave, as it represents their sole guarantee of  survival," he warned.    Finally, the former commander of the blue helmets in Bosnia  called on the international community to adopt a coherent  strategy on Bosnia, while stressing that he did not believe that  any of the parties in the field were in a position to win the  war.</p>

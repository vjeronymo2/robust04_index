			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Extraordinary restructuring loophole exploited by ICI THE TREATMENT of substantial reorganisation costs in the 1991 accounts of Imperial Chemical Industries, the pharmaceuticals group, and Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consortium, has exposed loopholes in the existing system of accounting regulation. ICI has not restated Pounds 300m of net extraordinary costs - related to a series of business closures and restructurings announced in 1990 - in spite of a pronouncement from the Accounting Standards Board's urgent issues task force late last year that such costs should generally be treated above the line as exceptional items. Meanwhile, Unilever said yesterday that its 1991 annual report - due to be published in mid-April - would also not restate a Pounds 195m extraordinary charge described in the 1990 accounts as reorganisation expenses 'in the light of legislation leading to the single European market'. ICI did restate a net Pounds 39m share in Tioxide Group for fundamental restructuring classified as extraordinary in the 1990 accounts and now presented as exceptional. This has reduced 1990 pre-tax profits to Pounds 936m. If the other reorganisation costs had been included, pre-tax profits would have been Pounds 636m, instead of the originally stated Pounds 977m. The extraordinary item, unchanged at Pounds 300m, was for divestments, closures and other restructuring measures. It is believed that publication of the ICI and Unilever extraordinary items in the 1990 accounts were two of the incidents that spurred the urgent issues task force to produce its abstract, which came into force in mid-November. The abstract states that restructuring costs should be treated as exceptionals. Any remaining extraordinaries will require full description in the company's financial statements of both the event itself and the nature of the related restructuring costs. There is no such additional explanation in the ICI accounts. However Mr Michael Hughes, the partner at KPMG Peat Marwick responsible for the ICI audit and a member of the 16-strong urgent issues task force, says ICI's treatment falls outside the task force guidelines and was discussed with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales before the 1990 accounts came out. Mr Hughes says that SSAP 6, the relevant accounting standard, permits the inclusion of the closure of business segments as extraordinary items. Given that the Pounds 300m charge applies to a previous year, he argues that there is no need for ICI to include any justification of why it is extraordinary. Other accountants suggest that the company should, at the very least, have provided more explanation. But Mr Hughes says: 'There may be important commercial considerations which restrict disclosure of certain kinds of information.' Guidance from the task force is not always clear, partly because its pronouncements are not allowed to contradict the wording of existing accounting standards. One accountant described the abstract on restructuring costs as 'trying to put a plaster on a leg that should be amputated'. However, the uncertainty over extraordinary items is likely to be eradicated this summer with the launch of a new financial reporting standard. In its draft form as Fred 1, it orders the virtual elimination of extraordinaries. As Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, says: 'SSAP 6 is fundamentally flawed. That's why we launched Fred 1.'</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Brave faces, guarded pessimism - The mood in Tokyo MR MICKEY Kantor, the US trade representative, put a brave face on it: 'I have never been in a negotiation that ended before it had to,' he said yesterday as trade ministers from the 'quad' countries of Japan, the European Community, Canada and Japan faltered in their efforts to agree an ambitious tariff-cutting package before the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo next month. 'Until you get to the final day, it will not end. It's neither surprising nor disturbing that we did not reach a conclusion today.' Mr Kantor was commenting on two difficult days in Tokyo where disappointment over US proposals for cutting tariffs protecting American textile companies, coupled with EC and Japanese refusal to slash tariffs on spirits, wood products, non-ferrous metals and computer parts, crushed hopes of any substantial trade liberalising package being finalised then for the G7 summit next month. Their failure puts in jeopardy the ability of leaders of the industrial world to present at the G7 summit a package of reforms to revive the global economy from its current dogged recession. What is more serious, the failure raises fresh doubts over whether the long-delayed Uruguay Round of international trade liberalisation can be wrapped up by mid-December. Other trade ministers euphemistically referred to the vexations of the past week as the 'most intensive' negotiations so far held by the ministers. The mood contrasted sharply with optimism when they last met in Paris two weeks ago. There, Mr Kantor talked of being 'at last in striking distance of the largest market access package in history'. A Japanese negotiator talked yesterday of discussions becoming 'rather more realistic'. 'It was unfortunate that we could not come to a full agreement - which was our target. But we have two weeks to find a package and report,' he said. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, said: 'Everyone will go back to their capitals, take stock, and see whether the progress so far is adequate for the relaunch of the Uruguay Round, or whether they need to put more into the pot.' Negotiators in Tokyo yesterday remained convinced that a 'big package' of tariff cuts among the quad countries (which account for about two-thirds of world trade) was essential if other industrial countries, and those in the developing world, were to be persuaded to commit themselves to an ambitious Uruguay Round package of trade liberalisation. They decided to hold a further week of official-level talks and a ministerial meeting in Tokyo on July 6 - the eve of the G7 summit - in a last effort to reach a deal that could be presented to G7 heads of state. The hope is that negotiations could then be transferred to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva for their bilateral commitments to be 'multilateralised' by the other 111 contracting parties. But they could point to little headway in Tokyo, nor convey any optimism that their so-far intractable disagreements could be resolved by the G7 meeting. Most conspicuously, US proposals to cut peak duties protecting American textile companies have been dismissed as 'unsellable'. The EC appears unable to meet demands for tariff cuts for computer parts and aluminium, while Japan has drawn criticism for its truculence over liberalisation of the markets in distilled spirits and wood products. Details of differences were kept secret yesterday: 'The closer you get to the end, the more damaging it is to go into detail,' said Sir Leon. On a positive note, Japan offered to deregulate its welfare pension fund market to allow foreign fund managers greater access. This is expected to raise the foreign share of the welfare pension funds market significantly from the current 0.1 per cent. Although Sir Leon remains optimistic that further progress can be made before the G7, he was careful not to raise unrealistic hopes. 'We have got what we have in the kitty now and if that's all there is, that's all there is.' Others close to the talks were even more cautious. 'Areas where the ministers could not agree, officials will not either,' said one. Even if they did, the task of winning wider international approval and a Uruguay Round settlement is far from simple: Mr Peter Sutherland, who succeeds Mr Arthur Dunkel as director general of Gatt on July 1, will find himself in the thick of complex negotiations among more than 100 nations just days after coming into office. Long-festering conflicts would have to be settled between July and December. They includereform of farm trade, Japanese and Korean refusal to open markets to rice imports, procurement rules, procedures for settling trade disputes, and a new, stronger international trade watchdog to be called the Multilateral Trade Organisation.</p>

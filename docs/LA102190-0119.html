			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLAP CASTS DOUBT ON AFRICAN FESTIVAL  </P> <P> We are distraught, angered and unable to begin planning for the 1991 African  Marketplace and Cultural Faire as a result of the controversy created by  Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's criticism of the sale of two anti-Semitic books at  this year's event (Times, Oct. 14).  </P> <P> The uproar threatens an event that has been heralded as a love-in not only by  Southern California residents and tourists, but by would-be imitators all over  this country.  </P> <P> The African Marketplace is the most successful of all city-sponsored festivals.  This is not because of city funds, but because the community makes it happen.  Over 150,000 multiethnic Southern Californians attend this event and there has  never been a gang incident, shooting or other major crime or disturbance.  </P> <P> The two books in question were among more than 500 books in the booth of Eso  Won Bookstore. With over 150 vendors participating at the festival, how could  the staff know of this inciteful literature? To our knowledge, none of the  staff had ever heard of the books until Yaroslavsky's allegations surfaced in  The Times.  </P> <P> Correspondence sent to all prospective vendors informed them that no political,  controversial or inflammatory objects, artifacts, literature or artwork would  be permitted. We were way ahead of the game.  </P> <P> The African Marketplace can hardly be considered an anti-Semitic venue. Not  when vendors of Jewish ancestry are participants and selling beautiful African  clothes and authentic artifacts from that great continent. Not when food  vendors specializing in Middle Eastern cuisine participated. The dismantling of  the African Marketplace, for whatever reasons, will not come about without the  one-voice outrage of the community. To let such a positive event go down in  defeat without a fight is unthinkable.  </P> <P> JEANNE A.

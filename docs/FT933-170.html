			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Corporate backing vital for ENO Sir, In your management page feature, 'Time to sing a new song' (September 23) on ENO's new team, you say the company 'recognises that it will never get much out of the corporate entertainment market'. May I elaborate on this point. Although the Coliseum is not a corporate house in the sense that all the best seats are monopolised by business people, ENO enjoys the support of 100 companies and trusts which contribute more than Pounds 1m a year to the company while taking advantage of the theatre's many private entertaining rooms. Sponsorship also plays a vital role - more than half of our productions have been sponsored in 1993-94 so far. Indeed, a recent Arts Council appraisal says ENO's performance far exceeds the average growth in arts sponsorship during the past five years. Lucy Kellaway rightly says that our success in attracting audiences will be determined by the operas we produce and, citing the critics, questions whether ENO's new production of La Boheme (sponsored by the IIR Group) can be the equivalent of a Jurassic Park. The public has answered resoundingly with attendances averaging more than 90 per cent.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "tom/APA": "Harsh Criticism of Haider by </F> Busek: `A Minor in Terms of Democracy'"]    [Text] Vienna -- On Monday [6 June] Austrian People's Party  [OeVP] Chairman and Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek reacted with  extremely harsh words to the latest statements by Freedom Party  of Austria [FPOe] Chairman Joerg Haider against Austria's  membership in the European Union [EU]. Busek accused Haider of  fanning fears among the population "against his better judgment."    The FPOe chairman is making claims that are "highly  irresponsible" and, in the end, are "no longer justifiable" if  one assumes a minimum standard of politics.    The OeVP chairman was referring to answers that the FPOe  chairman gave to the KURIER readers' service. Among other  things, Haider confirmed "incorrect" rumors that Austrian  drinking water will be passed on to Brussels. He claimed that  Chancellor Vranitzky is following orders "from outside Austria"  issued by the Free Masons or, for instance, that in northern  Germany several people have already died as a result of "mad-cow  disease," the main source of which is England and which also  threatens Austria, "because then there will not be any import  restrictions anymore."    Busek said that in saying this Haider not only "confirmed  that he is still a an adolescent in terms of democracy" but he  had also made an "essential contribution" to "reducing  credibility in politics as a whole."    The OeVP chairman was optimistic that the EU referendum will  result in a positive vote. A result over 53 percent would be "a  good result." The point is "a decision for the young  generation." During the discussion over the past weeks, too much  "pea counting" had been done. He would like the citizens to  feel "a bit of the breath of history," Busek said.    On Monday the conference of provincial governors unanimously  adopted an EU declaration, in which the citizens are called upon  to vote "yes" on EU membership. It cites the following four  main arguments: peace and security, the development of Austria  as a business location, the development of a varied but  integrated Europe, an Austrian voice in Europe.    EU State Secretary Brigitte Ederer said in an APA interview  that she does not believe that the mood has changed toward  rejection. However, the referendum is "certainly not yet over.  The result will be narrow, but it will be narrowly positive,"  Ederer said. She appealed to those in favor of EU membership to  "go to" the referendum. If the result should be "no," we will  suffer from a "hangover" relatively quickly. Among other  things, one has to expect investment to decline.</p>

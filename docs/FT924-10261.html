			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average falls 2% on the week JAPANESE equities fell on arbitrage-related unwinding, as corporate interim earnings announcements and uncertainty in the currency market ahead of the US presidential election depressed activity, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 170.31 to 16,767.40, down 2 per cent on the week. The index moved between a high of 16,926.48 in the morning and a low of 16,675.23 just before the close. Small-lot buying of speculative theme stocks supported the index in the morning, but arbitrage-related selling and profit-taking by dealers later pushed the index to its low. Volume remained low at 190m shares against 169m, as arbitrageurs and dealers were the only notable participants. Losers outnumbered gainers by 719 to 217 with 157 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first sections stocks retreated 8.22 to 1,278.91 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.75 to 1,027.79. Investors remained absent from the market while share prices were manipulated by technical factors. The announcement that banks had established a new land buying organisation, to purchase land collateral of non-performing bank loans, was ignored by investors. Traders noted mounting scepticism about the effectiveness of the new corporation. Fears that the opposition may delay the approval of the supplementary budget unless leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party testified in parliament weighed on sentiment. However, a ministry of finance official said that a lengthy delay was unlikely as the opposition parties recognised the negative effects on the faltering economy if the measures were held up. Dealers took profits on speculative theme stocks. Green Cross, the most active issue of the day, fell Y60 to Y1,430 and Aisin Seiki lost Y50 to Y1,140. Bank stocks were mixed. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y10 to Y2,440, but Sakura Bank rose Y20 to Y1,130. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 240.66 to 18,401.33 in volume of 11.3m shares . Roundup THE region's markets were in a positive mood yesterday. HONG KONG bounced back after a drop of over 100 points in the previous two days, and the Hang Seng index jumped 73.19 or 1.2 per cent to 6,190.69. But the index was 1.1 per cent lower on the week. Turnover, swollen by Bank of East Asia's HKDollars 1.9bn placement, rose to HKDollars 4.2bn against HKDollars 2.1bn. Hutchison fell 30 cents to HKDollars 16.60 while Swire Pacific and Jardine Matheson gained HKDollars 1 each to HKDollars 37.50 and HKDollars 59. SEOUL rose for its fifth consecutive session, as foreign buying interest in financial shares outpaced profit-taking following the recent sharp rises. The composite index rose 4.31 to 610.09, up 6.8 per cent on the week. All of the Daewoo Group's listed shares hit their daily upper limits. Daewoo Corp and Daewoo Heavy Industries gained Won400 to Won9,500 and Won9,800 respectively. KUALA LUMPUR closed at another record high as the budget proposals were greeted warmly by investors. The composite index advanced 4.18 to 641.31, a 1.7 per cent rise on the week. Turnover surged to MDollars 606m from Thursday's MDollars 351m. Finance and property stocks showed the strongest gains. AUSTRALIA rose on good economic data and a good performance by News Corp. The All Ordinaries index advanced 8 to 1,425, up 2 per cent on the week. Turnover was ADollars 425.7m. News Corp rose ADollars 1.10 to ADollars 25.90 on expectations of good third-quarter results which are due in the next two weeks. BHP was another heavily traded stock, rising 10 cents to ADollars 11.08. Among mining stocks, CRA put on 20 cents to ADollars 11.96 after its production report showed increased output at its mine in western Australia.</p>

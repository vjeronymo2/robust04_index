			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GUIDE TO CHINESE HERBAL ELIXIRS  </P> <P> A tonic of deer antlers is a powerful rejuvenator while a tea of lobster eyes,  Ganoderma mushroom, licorice root will relieve physical pain. And the man who  tells you so is Ron Teeguarden, who explains that he learned his craft from a  Chinese Taoist master and seems so intent on demystifying herbal healing that  he even wrote a book about it, "Chinese Tonic Herbs" (Japan Publications Inc.).  </P> <P> Other liquid refreshments on Teeguarden's exotic list consist of lycium  berries, a tension reliever, or longan mixed with walnuts, to generate energy.  Customers who want to clear their complexion ask for Schizandra tea, made from  round, red berries the ancient Chinese royalty relied on to moisten and firm  their skin. It works, in part, by stimulating sexual fluids, Teeguarden notes.  </P> <P> He serves Chinese Orchid, Ho Shou Wu and Poria to aid longevity. Tienchi, known  as the miracle root for the preservation of life, as a blood cleanser. Cinnamon  to relive muscle strain and dried orange peel to aid digestion.  </P> <P> Of the several thousand herbs in the Chinese system, only about 30 are  considered Imperial, or superior, tonic herbs, he explains. These must be  totally natural, promote longevity, elevate the spirit, enhance wisdom,  inducing relaxation and, not coincidentally, taste good. BARBARA FOLEY  </P></p>

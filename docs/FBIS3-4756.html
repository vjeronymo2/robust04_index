He was accompanied by Choe Yong-hae, chairman of the Central  Committee of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea, and  officials concerned.    Situated on a scenic bank of the River Taedong, the Gold  Lane  with a floor space of 14,300 square metres is a gymnasium of  mass sports and cultural amusement. It has 40 modern bowling  alleys, amusement rooms, sauna bathrooms, a restaurant, a shop  and other service facilities. It is available for international  games.    The gymnasium is associated with ardent patriotic devotion  of  traders and industrialists under the General Association of  Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon).    Going round it, President Kim Il-song expressed deep  satisfaction over the fact that builders constructed the modern  bowling gymnasium splendidly in a short time.    Noting that Kwon Yong-suk, a trader-manufacturer under  Chongnyon, and her family did a good thing for the prosperity  and development of the socialist homeland with a noble patriotic  spirit, he highly appraised their patriotism and loyalty.    He gave instructions to manage and operate the gymnasium  well, saying that it would greatly contribute to the cultural  and emotional life of the Korean people, youth and students and  promotion of their health.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / S Africa aluminium to be cut Alusaf, South Africa's only primary aluminium producer, yesterday backed industry moves worldwide to reduce aluminium stocks and improve depressed market conditions for the metal. The company announced production cuts equivalent to nearly 10 per cent of its planned future capacity. Alusaf has in hand a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) expansion project to add 466,000 tonnes a year to its current 140,000 capacity, turning the company into one of the biggest producers with about 4 per cent of global output. Mr Rob Barbour, managing director, said that, while construction of the new smelter was going ahead, Alusaf would reduce export tonnage from its old smelter by 20,000 tonnes in 1994 and again in 1995. Alusaf was shelving plans to increase the old smelter's capacity by 40,000 tonnes a year until market conditions had improved.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 25 (AFP) -- Russian Defence Minister  Pavel Grachev on Wednesday [25 May] proposed regular  consultations on European and global security issues as part of  Moscow's decision to join NATO's Partnership for Peace (PFP)  programme.    In a speech to defence ministers from both the NATO  countries  and the former Soviet bloc, Pavel suggested the consultations be  held regularly between political leaders, experts or military  chiefs, as well as to look at emergency situations.    Grachev the previous day announced Moscow was no longer  setting conditions to join the PFP, drawing warm praise from  U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry earlier on Wednesday.    Perry said Grachev had given "an excellent presentation" to  the NATO ministers on Tuesday on Russia's new military doctrine  to replace the security blueprint of the defunct Soviet Union.    "It was a truly historic event," he said, adding that it was  his fifth meeting with Grachev. "We've become really close  colleagues in resolving security issues of our two countries,"  Perry said.    Grachev said Russia was not insisting on special political  links with NATO as the price for signing the PFP, which has  already been joined by 16 countries of the old Soviet bloc.    But he said Russia still had a list detailing its  requirements for PFP participation, and still wanted links with  NATO outside the Partnership.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HILLSIDE HOUSE SIZES REMAIN UNRESOLVED  </P> <P> Los Angeles city planners squared off this week against a citizens advisory  committee chosen 19 months ago to map out a plan to control growth for the  steep hillsides and scenic ridges of Mt. Washington and Glassell Park.  </P> <P> Left unresolved by the two sides after three hours of haggling was the most  significant question that has arisen during development of the growth-control  plan: How big can a house be before it dwarfs those around it, blocks panoramic  views and undermines a community's rustic flavor.  </P> <P> Some of that flavor is being whittled away, said Bob Wolfe, a Mt. Washington  resident, while the city and the citizens committee debate how to preserve the  area's character.  </P> <P> "We have seen incredible changes in Mt. Washington just since this committee  was formed," Wolfe said at Monday's meeting, citing a number of large houses  built on small lots during the past two years, as real estate values have  risen. "What we feared would happen in five years has happened in one year."  </P> <P> City planners and members of the citizens committee agree that restrictions  should be placed on the size of new homes or homes undergoing major remodeling.  But the planners and the citizens committee have devised two completely  different formulas to limit the scale of new development.  </P> <P> The citizens committee favors a formula based on the ratio of proposed floor  space to the area of each lot that can be used for construction. The numbers in  the formula would change depending on lot size, to allow for "reasonable"  development on small lots without permitting oversized houses on larger lots.  </P> <P> The Planning Department, seeking a simpler standard, prefers one that would  permit a house's footprint -- the outline it would make on the land -- to take  up 30% of any lot that slopes up from a road, or 35% of any lot that slopes  down from a road. The permitted height of new homes would depend on the slope  of the lot.  </P> <P> The Planning Department's formula is figured on the entire size of a lot, not  just its space that can be used for construction. Committee members said such a  formula would allow developers to plunge extra stories down steep hillsides.  </P> <P> The citizens committee also objects to the city formula because it wouldn't  take into account the total "bulk" of a house as it sits on its lot, said  committee Chairman Donald Bloss.  </P> <P> The Planning Department, on the other hand, considers the committee plan to be  so complex as to be incomprehensible to city staff members who review the  blueprints that must be submitted to the city for approval.  </P> <P> "What good is a plan if it won't be implemented properly?" asked Sutton. "We  come up with all these nice plans that nobody understands, and when developers  come in for sign-off, I can't even tell you how many mistakes there are."  </P> <P> Bloss, a Mt. Washington resident, said the Planning Department was trying to  override the will of the citizens committee.  </P> <P> Committee member Laurie Weir charged that the Planning Department's formula  would have the effect of encouraging development on the steepest hillsides,  since more floor space would be permitted on sharply sloped lots.  </P> <P> "On this hill, we can't assume dumb developers," she said . "We . . . were  hoping the really steep lots would be left as almost vertical green plains."  </P> <P> Weir said that the committee originally was told to come up with a plan based  on the unique needs and characteristics of Mt. Washington. Suddenly, a year  later, the Planning Department decided it wanted all hillside communities to  conform to one simple plan, she said.  </P> <P> "This committee was not told when we set out that we needed to fit in," Weir  said. "We were told we were this special little community."  </P> <P> Some compromises between the citizens and planners were achieved during  Monday's meeting at the Carlin G. Smith Recreation Center atop the historic  mountain community.  </P> <P> The planners agreed to toughen the department's recommendations to the city  Planning Commission for new off-street parking requirements in the area. The  committee-backed proposal, which the planners agreed to accept, would require  any new Mt. Washington house of more than 2,600 square feet to include at least  one additional off-street parking space.  </P> <P> The planners, led by principal neighborhood planner Robert H. Sutton, said they  would recommend at the committee's request that the owners of recreational  vehicles -- dubbed "monsters" by the committee -- be required to screen them  from public view.  </P> <P> They also agreed to delete language that would have obligated new homeowners to  paint their homes in "subdued" colors, in response to a plea from the Mt.  Washington-Glassell Park Specific Plan Citizens Advisory Committee for a  development plan that would allow more diversity.  </P> <P> In addition, the citizens and planners said Mt. Washington's rural character  should be protected by preserving walking trails and promoting shopping and  child care within the neighborhood.  </P> <P> They also agreed to create so-called "scenic corridors" along Mt. Washington  Drive and San Rafael Avenue, where development would be required to be low  enough to not block scenic views.  </P> <P> Architectural diversity would be encouraged, native plants would be protected,  and walls and fences would have to be limited in height.  </P> <P> The committee decided to meet with planners again at 7 p.m. on May 7 at the  Recreation Center to try to work out compromises on the issues left unresolved.  Then, a public hearing will on the neighborhood specific plan will be  scheduled.  </P> <P> Once public input has been heard, the Planning Department staff will present  its recommendations, along with those from the committee, to the Los Angeles  City Planning Commission for a vote.  </P></p>

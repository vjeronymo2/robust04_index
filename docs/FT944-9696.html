			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Economic Watch: Norway's trade surplus rises Norway's trade surplus in October rose to NKr6.143bn (Pounds 600m) compared with NKr5.523bn in the same month a year earlier, said Statistics Norway, the official statistical agency. The increase was largely due to a surge in exports of goods such as fish, fish products and metals, said the agency. Total exports, which include Norway's substantial oil and gas exports, rose by 16 per cent in October to NKr22.888bn compared with NKr19.757bn for the month a year earlier. Total imports in October rose 18 per cent from a year earlier, with the largest increases seen in cars, metals, timber and machinery, said the agency. Portuguese consumer prices rose 0.4 per cent in October after a 0.2 per cent increase in September, to put year-on-year inflation at 4.5 per cent, down from 4.7 per cent previously, the National Statistics Institute said. Average annual inflation was 5.6 per cent in October compared with a 5.8 per cent average recorded in September. The Bank of Spain has forecast growth in gross domestic product of more than 2.0 per cent in the third quarter of 1994 compared with the same period a year earlier. The bank said in its quarterly economic report that growth was fuelled by a recovery in domestic demand.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: TINY COMMUNITIES TREASURE ALL THE NEWS THAT'S FIT  </P> <P> Nothing gives a traveler the flavor and tempo of a strange land like the local  newspapers.  </P> <P> When we were in Brawley overnight, I picked up copies of the Imperial Valley  Weekly and the Holtville Tribune. Imperial and Holtville are cities of 4,000 to  5,000 in the valley south of Brawley.  </P> <P> The legend under the Imperial Valley Weekly logo reads: "The power of the  freedom of the press is a flaming sword . . . hold it high, use it wisely and  guard it well."  </P> <P> I was glad to see that freedom of the press was treasured even in those tiny  farm centers.  </P> <P> Even more reassuring were the headlines on Page 1 of the Holtville Tribune: The  banner, in red ink, was "It's Carrot Festival Time." This annual event had  preempted any news of a more sordid nature.  </P> <P> Under it, three separate stories were headlined: "Dip Lunch on Saturday";  "Livestock Show Sunday"; "Recipe Contest Monday."  </P> <P> On Page 4, though, the paper reported the nitty-gritty underside of life in  Holtville. Under "Police Briefs," calls to the Police Department on various  days were listed as follows:  </P> <P> 12:57 a.m. -- Mike Molina reported that he heard his dog barking, went outside  and discovered his bike was gone.  </P> <P> 12:58 a.m. -- Caller reported that a suspicious vehicle just parked in front of  her residence.  </P> <P> 10:40 a.m. -- Connie Hoyt requested that someone come pick up a sick cat that  is in her front yard.  </P> <P> 5:30 p.m. -- Mike Angelo reported that he lost his golden retriever. It was  wearing a red collar.  </P> <P> 7:39 p.m. -- Anonymous caller reported that a fellow is playing his stereo so  loud that he can hear it from 100 yards away.  </P> <P> There were also reports of violence from the police blotter:  </P> <P> 10:44 a.m. -- Finley school employee reported that there was a fight between  two first-graders and one stabbed the other one with a pencil.  </P> <P> And wife abuse:  </P> <P> 7 a.m. -- Domestic disturbance was reported in which a man allegedly hit his  wife, who is three months pregnant. The woman was taken to the hospital. The  man, 24, was arrested on battery charges.  </P> <P> And sexual harassment:  </P> <P> 1:41 p.m. -- Caller reported that there are two fellows harassing a woman on  5th Street by Valley Auto.  </P> <P> And one crime of a sinister nature:  </P> <P> 1:30 a.m. -- CHP reported that they got a call reporting a kidnaping at Ninah's  Truck Scales. Mr. Wheeler reported that his wife Linda D. Wheeler was kidnaped  by two subjects in a white newer model semi-truck with black lettering on the  side. Linda Wheeler is 25 years old, 5'1", with brown curly hair and a scar  under her eye.  </P> <P> There was also a section called Snowbird Gazette, with social notes about the  Snowbirds, those semi-residents from colder climes who come south in the fall  to park their trailers on the outskirts of various Imperial Valley towns for  the winter.  </P> <P> The Snowbird report began: "Well Hi Snowbirds and Holtville, Calif. We have had  a fast week at the Springs (the BLM Hot Springs Campground) -- Snowbirds going  to the Big Pancake Breakfast in El Centro, and now some folks are off to the  Quartzite Pow-Wow. Meanwhile, we're looking forward to the opening of the  Carrot Festival at the weekend. Now some news about our friends."  </P> <P> A real estate ad pictured a three-bedroom, two-bath home with family room and  pool for $85,000; a "spacious" three-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath home for $55,000, and  a two-bedroom home on a large corner lot for $39,000.  </P> <P> Looking for a job? A help-wanted ad said a weighmaster is needed at Ninah's  Truck Stop (where Mrs. Wheeler allegedly was kidnaped.)  </P> <P> A reassuring headline topped Page 11: "Holtville Girl Scouts Start Annual  Cookie Sale."  </P> <P> In the Imperial Valley Weekly the headline over Helen Murphy's "On the Local  Scene" column was: "Three New Babies to Welcome This Week."  </P> <P> And even that kidnaping had a happy ending. A story in the next day's paper  explained: "A woman who was reportedly kidnaped in Holtville last week by a  couple of truck drivers actually went with them of her own free will, according  to the Police Department." (She was going east to visit relatives.)  </P> <P> I don't think they're even worried down there about the ozone layer.  </P></p>

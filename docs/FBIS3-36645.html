			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Zheglov report: "Russia-France: New Level of </F> Military Cooperation"]    [Text] Analysis of the Yugoslav crisis, the concept of the  architecture of European security, Russia's attitude to the  "Partnership for Peace" program, and the state of and prospects  for Franco-Russian military cooperation were the main topics of  the conversation between Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian  defense minister, and Francois Leotard, head of France's  military department, 4 February at the Russian Defense Ministry.    Our military contacts are regular and go back a long way,  Pavel Grachev stressed. Franco-Russian combat fellowship  developed during World Wars I and II.    The signing of two intergovernmental agreements -- on  defense  cooperation and military-technical cooperation -- came as fresh  confirmation of the further strengthening of Franco-Russian  friendship. They make provision not only for collaboration  between our states' military departments and armed forces, but  also exchanges of experience in the field of defense enterprise  conversion, for instance, and the development of certain arms.  The agreement on military-technical cooperation envisages the  implementation of 20 specific projects in total.    For Russia the signing of these agreements is all the more  important in that they have been concluded with a NATO state.  And it was underlined during the conversation that this is  evidence of the new level of relations between Russia and the  North Atlantic alliance and represents our country's concrete  contribution to the implementation of the "Partnership for  Peace" program.    A considerable part of the conversation was devoted to  Russia's peacekeeping activity. I must be blunt and say, Pavel  Grachev stated here, that the world is still not sufficiently  objective in its perception of the Russian Armed Forces'  peacekeeping efforts. People there often forget that the former  Soviet republics are autonomous states. That is why the armed  conflicts on their territories and the Russian Army's  peacekeeping operations go unnoticed. Furthermore, our country  is accused of not displaying activity in the republics of the  former Yugoslavia, acting under the UN flag, and that its troop  contingent there is very small.    However, Pavel Grachev said, our Army is carrying out  peacekeeping operations in Moldova, the Transcaucasus, and  Tajikistan. Over 16,000 Russian servicemen have been deployed  to carry out these tasks alone and that is more than any of the  national contingents involved in UN peacekeeping operations. At  present the question of the preparation and introduction of  peacekeeping subunits of the Russian Armed Forces into the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone with the participation of UN  observers is being studied.    Touching on the settlement of the Bosnian crisis, the head  of  the Russian military department pointed, in particular, to  Russia's commitment to finding a most speedy political solution  to this problem.    In the opinion of the Russian side, combat use of aviation  would cause hostilities in the region to escalate. Therefore  aircraft can only be used if UN troops are directly attacked.  What is more, the possibility of using force in Bosnia should  be decided by the UN Security Council, and not other  organizations. Russia's defense minister also opposed lifting  the embargo on arms shipments to the conflict zone.    Francois Leotard and Pavel Grachev visited the Taman Guards  Motorized Rifle Division 4 February, where they inspected arms  and combat hardware and were briefed on personnel's life and  living conditions.</p>

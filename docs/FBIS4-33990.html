			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 9 Jun (NA) -- Speaking in Switzerland,  Antonio Cassia, the General Confederation of Labor (CGT)  secretary general, noted today: "Social unrest may grow in our  country if we do not provide solutions" to the unemployment  problem. He said unemployment in the federal capital and in  Buenos Aires Province "has increased to about 12 percent."    Cassia said: "Social unrest will grow daily if quick  solutions are not found," adding: "Prevention is always better  than cure."    The trade union leader said the unemployment rate growth "is  worrisome," adding: "If we compare our unemployment rate with  other parts of the world, maybe it has not grown that much, but  it is very indicative for Argentina."    In remarks to a Buenos Aires radio station from Geneva,  where  he is participating in the International Labor Organization  (ILO) Annual Assembly, Cassia stressed this morning that "there  are unfair wages" in Argentina.    Cassia pointed out: "We have provinces whose budgets are  poorly allocated and whose three branches of government are  paying fair salaries. But the workers are not asking for better  wages; they just want to get paid."    Cassia added: "Provinces like Chaco, Salta, and Catamarca  have not paid their workers for four to six months."    The oil workers union leader said: "The world's unemployment  problem causes poverty, neglect, and specially social outcasts."    He added: "This problem involves all liberal economies." He  said that, since listening to UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali's speech this morning, "this issue is being taken  very seriously."    During his speech to the ILO General Assembly yesterday,  Cassia said the CGT rejects any attempt "to regulate the free  collective bargaining system in our country."    He indicated: "We are willing to agree and not to dissent,  but this does not include undue acceptances or complicity with  interests contrary to our interests."    Cassia added that economic changes in Argentina "must be  implemented based on the existence of investment policies, with  real participation of the workers in transformation processes,  employment policies, and environmental protection."    The trade union leader stressed: "We accept changes that  will  improve the Argentine economy, taking into account the social  and labor situation through everyone's effort and equally shared  burdens. We reject changes that seek to reduce the trade union  presence as an balancing factor or seek to cause arbitrary and  unfair deterioration of work standards."</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Algeria throws gas export sales policy into reverse SONATRACH, the Algerian state oil and gas monopoly, has decided that all future natural gas export deals, over and above volumes already contracted, will be channelled through joint ventures with foreign partners. That reverses the previous policy of going it alone on gas sales. Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine, the Algerian Minister of Hydrocarbons told a recent seminar in Washington that the joint ventures would cover not simply gas production but the whole chain, from well head to burner tip. As many of the foreign partners would be based in Europe, they would be able to assist Sonatrach's gas sales in Algeria's natural market, he said. Algeria has sold all the gas its present production and export capacity can cope with until well beyond the turn of the century. A gas-hungry Europe wants more. To meet any expansion of demand, Algeria's oil and gas monopoly must invest in new capacity: in gas production, pipelines, liquefied natural gas ships and perhaps new plants. According to Mr James Ball, director of the Gasmatters newsletter, the European Community's other principal suppliers - the Netherlands, Norway and the Commonwealth of Independent States - have sold all the gas they are able to produce by 1995. The Algerian action, he says, 'steals a march on the other exporters by positioning Algerian gas at the front of its competitors'. Sonatrach has been holding discussions with Ruhrgas, which is apparently seeking to buy 3-5bn cubic metres of gas a year from 1995. Discussions are also proceeding, according to the weekly Petrostrategies newsletter, with British gas and Enron, the US gas and power company. The latter is building, with ICI, the world's largest combined heat and power gas plant on Teeside and has plans to build more such plants in Europe.</p>

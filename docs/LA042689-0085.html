			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> One of four Polish secret police agents convicted in the 1984 kidnaping,  torture and murder of pro-Solidarity priest Jerzy Popieluszko has been freed  from prison, government spokesman Zbyslaw Rykowski said. He had said earlier  that Waldemar Chmielewski would be released. The priest had drawn thousands to  monthly sermons in Warsaw in which he urged that the banned union be  re-legalized. After Popieluszko's death, Solidarity declared him patron of the  union, which was restored to legal status this month. Chmielewski had been  sentenced to 14 years in jail; the others received 15- or 25-year terms. The  sentences have been reduced twice in three years.  </P></p>

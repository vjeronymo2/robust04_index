			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Scotland (1): Nearly a trouble-free zone - Scotland's economy has done better in recession than many other parts of the UK. Demand for constitutional change has gone quiet since the 1992 general election and the main political controversy now is over the proposed reform of local government When John Major, the UK prime minister, looks through his cabinet papers it is unlikely that he needs to linger very long on those concerning Scotland. After the turbulence in Scottish affairs which lasted from the late 1980s up to the 1992 general election, Scotland is today one of the few areas under the government's care that are almost trouble free. Its citizens are no longer in sullen revolt over the now defunct poll tax or other unpopular government measures. Nor are they engaged in hectic debate about Scotland obtaining its own devolved parliament - or seceding from the UK altogether. Instead they are concerned with the more mundane issues of making a living during the economy's slow emergence from a recession which in Scotland was relatively mild, but which still made people who kept their jobs feel they were lucky. The 1992 election was a watershed for Scotland. The Conservatives had made Scotland's constitutional future their main issue north of the border, campaigning against both devolution or independence proposed by their opponents. Because the party won the election nationally and was the only party in Scotland to increase both its number of seats and its share of the vote (marginally, but against all predictions), the movement for constitutional change was halted. Yet Scotland is still governed by a party which won little more than a quarter of the Scottish vote at the general election. The response of Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary whom Mr John Major appointed when he became prime minister in 1990, was to call for a change of tone and a note of reconciliation in Scottish politics. He added then, however, that 'the policies will remain the same but the pace and flavour of them will be tempered." The government has become less confrontational and more deft in its handling of Scotland. It has slowed the pace of reforms to the Scottish education system, reached a truce with the schoolteachers and does not seem too concerned that only one secondary school has opted out of local authority control. After putting out to public consultation the option of privatising the Scottish water industry, it backed off in the face of almost universal opposition. Yet most health service hospitals in Scotland are administered by trusts or soon will be, and opposition to them long since became little more than ritual. The government, far from sheltering ScotRail, the Scottish arm of British Rail, from the full force of railway privatisation, intends it to be one of the first parts of the network to be franchised - but preferably to a franchisee with Scottish credentials. The government no longer insists on appointing Conservative party supporters to every vacancy on its many quangos. Recently Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of Scottish TUC, joined the board of a hospital trust. The government's response to agitation for constitutional change was to produce a document which acknowledged that Scotland was a nation, and outlined ways in which the union of the United Kingdom could work better for Scotland. More administration is being devolved from Whitehall to the Scottish Office, and the grand committee of 72 Scottish MPs is to consider uncontentious Scottish legislation and will be able to question ministers. But the necessary changes to standing orders are waiting for the Labour opposition 'to start behaving,' in the words of Mr Lang, before they are debated and implemented. It is a sign of the government's confidence that devolution is off the agenda that it wishes to dispose of the Royal High School, the building in Edinburgh which contains the chamber built in 1978 for a Scottish assembly. One of Mr Lang's strongest arguments against a devolved parliament is that it would imperil Scotland's access to resources and decision-making in London. Yet the fact that the Treasury and the Foreign Office have been able to override the Scottish Office on the question of supporting Scottish salmon farmers in their dispute with Norway over alleged dumping shows that Scottish influence has its limits. Many people are surprised that Scotland accepts, albeit grudgingly, policies which the majority of Scots oppose. Arnold Kemp, the editor of The Herald (formerly the Glasgow Herald) newspaper, gives this explanation in his recent book The Hollow Drum - Scotland since the War*: 'Scotland is a nation so divided by regional jealousies and tortured by self-doubt, in which radical or socialist politics have never been able to form an enduring alliance with bourgeois or romantic nationalism, that it is easy for the UK ruling party to govern it without a majority of Scottish seats." A good example of the way the government exploits those divisions shows in the lack of united opposition to the plan to reform Scottish local government, replacing the existing two tier system with a large number of unitary councils. Mr Lang has not convinced many people that the new system will necessarily be more effective or more economical than the present one, but by offering many local communities their own single tier council he has set the representatives of the districts against those of the regions. But Tory successes over policy have not translated into voting support. Two opinion polls published this month show support for the Conservatives in Scotland at only 13 per cent and 14 per cent, the lowest levels ever. For the first time, the Conservatives were in fourth place after Labour (49 per cent according to System Three), the SNP (25 per cent) and the Liberal Democrats (14 per cent). It was a rotten augury for the regional council elections in May and the European elections in June. Mr Lang told the Financial Times that difficulties in popularity in Scotland related to the UK political situation and that the Tories no longer faced 'hostility of the deep-rooted and very focused kind that we experienced at the last election.' The Tories are unlikely to benefit from the upturn in the economy because although Scotland did not go deeply into recession, there is little confidence that things are decisively better. 'A lot of companies had unrealistic expectations of what recovery would look like,' according to Mr Hamish Morrison, chief executive of the Scottish Council Development and Industry, which lobbies for economic development. 'Their managers are keeping their heads down and are reluctant to spend or invest. That could defeat the vigorous recovery we would like to see." It is a sign of how much the Scottish economy has changed in the past few years that the sector spearheading the recovery in output is the (largely foreign-owned) computer industry. Financial services are also doing quite well. The Ravenscraig steel plant (closed in 1992) and almost all Scottish heavy industry are only memories. That perturbs many Scots - but does not matter, provided Scotland can break the cycle by which it has consistently failed to generate enough new businesses and jobs, thus forcing people to emigrate to England or elsewhere and causing the Scottish population (now 5.1m) to decline gently. The chairman of Scottish Enterprise, Professor Donald MacKay, said recently that if, since 1955, Scotland had matched the rest of the UK in generating new businesses, it would have created 140,000 extra jobs. That is why an initiative launched last year by Scottish Enterprise to help more Scots develop an entrepreneurial culture is so important. Aa a member of Edinburgh's professional classes said recently: 'For me the acid test of whether Scotland is really improving is whether my son, who is now 15, gets a satisfactory job in Scotland when he leaves university, or whether he has to board the train to London.' * Mainstream Publishing.

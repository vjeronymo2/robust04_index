This figure has  been reported in the Latvian media for the first time.    Judging from officials' reports, the debt has built up  steadily. Having turned into a chronic defaulter, the "Latviyas  Gaze" ("Latvian Gas") state enterprise is also committed to pay  considerable sums in fines to its Russian suppliers. Last year  the money owing to Russia for its natural gas supplies was paid  off with the help of international loans. Since then the  situation has not changed for the better.    The leaders of "Latviyas Gaze" reported that this year an  agreement with Russia on gas deliveries had been concluded on  "terms advantageous to the Latvian side." Nonetheless, it has  not proved possible to pay the sum required. It is as if Latvia  is receiving gas on credit. The DIENA newspaper has reported  that Russia issued an official warning in mid-January to the  "Latviyas Gaze" state enterprise, demanding that it change its  payment policy for the gas it has used. It is proposed that  this demand be met by 1 February, otherwise gas supplies will be  cut by 50 percent.    But Latvian consumers are not threatened with any particular  unpleasantness as a result of this reduction in the supply of  Russian natural gas. The fact is that Europe's largest  underground gas storage facility, into which Russian gas has  constantly been pumped, is located in the republic at Incukalns.    Russia has agreed to forgive the debts in return for part of  the Incukalns gas storage facility and the network of gas  pipelines running across Latvian territory.</p>

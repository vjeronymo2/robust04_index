			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, March 10--The presidium of the national  board of the Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD) on Thursday  voiced "its deep indignation at the position taken by the Polish  Foreign Ministry on the resolution of the U.N. Human Rights  Commission condemning the violation of human and civic rights in  China."    During Wednesday's vote in Geneva on the Chinese motion to  give up voting on the resolution demanding that human rights be  observed in China, the polish delegate abstained.    "We demand a decisive change in the Foreign Ministry's stand  on that issue as well as a policy that would prevent similarly  discrediting actions from taking place in the future," a  statement issued by the KLD said.</p>

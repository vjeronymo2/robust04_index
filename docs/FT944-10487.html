Carlos Menem has filed a libel action against one of the country's sparkiest daily newspapers, the leftist Pagina 12, after its editors cast doubt on his claim to have been tortured under the former military dictatorship. On October 30 the paper quoted former prisoners as saying that Menem - who was arrested after a 1976 military coup ousted president Isabel Peron - was never tortured and that he had cried upon being arrested. Pagina 12 seems undaunted. 'What we have here is somebody who is sick in the head.

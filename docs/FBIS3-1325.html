			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Military Command of the Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola [FALA] in Lunda Norte Province has urged  the relevant South African authorities to withdraw without delay  all South African Defense Force [SADF] soldiers whether they  belong to the Buffalo Battalion or not.    The Military Command says if the South African Government  does not immediately extradite the mercenaries fighting  alongside People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola  [FAPLA] units, it will be accused of destabilizing southern  Africa because the presence of foreigners in the Lunda region is  a violation of the spirit of Lusaka. The Military Command added  that Pretoria, which has a diplomatic mission in Luanda, and  South Africa, in its capacity as a sovereign state, cannot  afford the luxury of saying it does not know what is going on.  Members of the South African army have been deployed in Angola.  Our source added that the South African mercenaries should  appear before a court of law in their country for betraying  South African laws, as stated by General Kotze.    The Military Command noted its disappointed, saying that  mercenaries wounded in action in Soyo in 1993 were welcomed as  heroes at Jan Smuts Airport. One should see concrete action  before one can believe in Gen. Kotze.    Independent sources yesterday confirmed information given to  the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel in early March by  Army General Abilio Kamalata Numa. The information spoke of  renewed military operations in northern Angola. The  international media says in its offensive, Luanda earmarked more  than 3,000 men and dozens of tanks, as well as heavy artillery  pieces, but encountered strong UNITA resistance in  Dange-ia-Menha near Cuanza Norte Province. The MPLA [Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola] suffered heavy losses.  Katangese mercenaries were among the victims.    UNITA forces will not give up any area under its control  until a general peace accord is signed in Lusaka.</p>

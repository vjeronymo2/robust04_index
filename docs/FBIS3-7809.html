			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee </F> Chairman Jiri Payne by Jaroslav Fiala; place and date not given:  "There Are Plenty of Opportunities for Our Exports to the United  States"]    [Text] We interviewed Deputy Payne on his recent visit to  the United States.    [Fiala] Many people associate your visit to the United  States with your remarks about the lists of State Security  agents. What, in fact, was the aim of your visit to the United  States?    [Payne] I was invited on behalf of U.S. President Clinton  and his wife to a traditional prayer breakfast to which people  who try to assert certain Christian values are invited. Some  are politicians, others are involved in charity work, and so on.  Within the framework of this invitation, I tried to use my  visit to the United States to hold further meetings in the U.S.  Congress and the [State] Department. This is, in essence, in  compliance with the idea that we should try to provide more  information about the Czech Republic abroad. Each contact of  this kind creates a special platform for us. For example, one  day it will be necessary to vote on certain issues of  fundamental interest to the Czech Republic, so this creates a  better setting for us.    [Fiala] Who did you meet in the United States?    [Payne] Within the program arranged for the extra days of my  visit, I visited the Security Committee, where a debate was  taking place on expanding NATO in the presence of the U.S.  ambassador in NATO from Brussels; I met the chairman of the  Congress Foreign Affairs Committee, Lee Hamilton; I met the  distinguished Senator Lugar, who is known for being very well  informed about Central Europe because he deals with this region;  and I also met with other members of Congress. I would describe  Partnership for Peace and our reaction to it as the main topic  we discussed. It was the same at the State Department.    [Fiala] Did you discuss economic issues with anyone?    [Payne] I tried to make use of a few more days on the basis  of urgent appeals from our honorary consul in Florida, Alan  Becker, to visit this area and meet with business circles who  are already doing business in the Czech Republic or are  interested in doing business there. I have to say that these  meetings were very useful and that, during my talks with our  honorary consul and while going over certain data, we came  across extensive areas where our business activity could be  expanded. It is significant that hundreds of thousands of  tonnes of Czech goods pass through the port of Miami, and so it  seems that this is really a contact, a place, that is very  important for us because of its trade links to Latin America,  the United States, and Mexico, and, from this point of view, I  think that we should look into the fact that we can single out  new opportunities for our exports in this area.    [Fiala] What did you discuss at the meeting with  compatriots?    [Payne] We briefed them on the situation in the Czech  Republic. Minister Lux briefed them on agriculture, Mr. Kasal  on the general work in parliament, and I gave them a rough  outline of the basic priorities of our foreign policy, which was  the main theme of that evening. Then, we answered a whole  series of questions, which were asked quickly one after the  other; the atmosphere here was very relaxed.    [Fiala] You mentioned that making contacts and holding talks  abroad forms part of your specific idea about foreign policy.  Could you be more explicit?    [Payne] I have discussed this with a number of colleagues,  and we even view it as one of the priorities of the work of the  Chamber of Deputies because at times the situation arises that  members of other parliaments have insufficient information about  the Czech Republic or they are given somewhat imprecise  information. Therefore, we consider this activity to be very  important. In this context, I would like to cite the following  example: We worked for about a year on formulating the  conditions for the approval of the European Agreement in the  European Parliament. I had many meetings with European  Parliament deputies within the framework of this activity, and  the upshot was that the approval was given in just under three  weeks, which is quite unique in European history. I have to  emphasize that this was due especially to the endeavor of the  rapporteur on the European Agreement, Mr. Sakallariou, and  others. Apart from this, our Association or European Agreement  was approved by such a percentage of votes that everyone voted  in favor except, I think, three deputies who abstained and one  who was against. In my opinion, this is the reward of such  lobbying. Of course, if the economic, political, and other  prerequisites had not been created, we would never have achieved  such a result. On the other hand, if they have been created, it  is necessary to make the maximum possible use of them.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Round Part of Whole"] </F>   [Text) Jordan's decision to press ahead with negotiations  on the Jordanian-Israeli peace track reflects, basically, two  important considerations that our country as a whole has to take  into account.    The first is our sense of great disappointment that Arab  coordination has not really ever materialised or bore fruit.    Right from the start of the Madrid talks in October 1991 it  was clear, following the Gulf war and the damage that the war  inflicted on the Arab body politic, that the minimum level of  Arab consensus had been lost. All those so-called Arab  coordination sessions since then have been more of a public  relations stunt than real team work. What has exacerbated the  problem is Israel's explicit determination to strike separate  deals on each of the peace tracks. Israel's first breakthrough  was with the Palestinians, which drove a big wedge between the  Palestine Liberation Organisation, PLO, on the one hand, and the  other parties--Jordan, Syria, Lebanon--on the other.    The second important consideration is, now that the  negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track are only awaiting a  final push, inevitably carrying with them the Lebanese, Jordan  cannot afford to be left behind without any real bargaining  chips in its hands. That situation, so many sensible Jordanians  have argued, is not in the best interests of the country. Hence  the necessity of the latest step to resume the talks in  Washington today and perhaps to move them later to the region  for practical purposes.    Needless to say, there is nothing that should stop Jordan  and  Israel from settling the issue of their common border in  accordance to International law as embodied in the 1992 League  of Nations terms of the British mandate over Palestine and  Jordan. A settlement of this issue can then be turned into a  crucial precedent, for Syria and Lebanon, and also the  Palestinians, to follow. Nothing is more important here than  for Israel to confine itself to internationally acknowledged  boundaries, leaving in the process the occupied Arab territories  to their rightful owners. The war issue is of course more  complex. Israel has so far insisted that since water was scarce  the two countries should embark on joint projects to generate  new sources of water. That Jordan welcomes but only after it  gets its rightful share of the joint resources.    What we hope will result from the Washington talks is  concrete movement towards lasting and comprehensive peace in the  region. If Jordan can get the Israelis to concede on Jordanian  rights on borders and water, if it can get the Israelis to  accept the principle of withdrawal from the occupied Arab  territories, then those talks that are to be held in Washington  tomorrow will be a major step towards achieving that peace.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ascension Reyes R.] </F>   [Text] General (ret) Alberto Muller Rojas [currently a  Senator] has denounced the existence of a plot to overthrow the  government by reactionary sectors led by former Defense Minister  Radames Munoz Leon.    The senator said his Radical Cause Party has come into  possession of information regarding the plot and the involvement  of several active and retired officers, generals, and admirals.    Muller Rojas underscored that the coupists have held several  meetings abroad, particularly in Aruba.    "During a meeting with Interior Minister Ramon Escovar  Salom,  I gave him this information and told him it might be worth his  while to examine the flight plans maintained at the control  towers of La Carlota and other airports for information  concerning active officers' trips to Aruba on private flights."    Muller Rojas said that his disclosures are intended as a  warning to Venezuelan society to reject the coup and especially  to career officers, who should adopt measures to prevent another  coup, which would be harmful to the Armed Forces and the country.    Muller reiterated that the government should intensify its  investigation and reveal the plot, which poses a serious threat  to public peace considering the country's current situation.    Muller Rojas said that approximately eight days ago he saw  Vice Admiral Munoz Leon at the Tamanaco hotel, where the  plotters had held a meeting. He said that although he has no  proof, there is well-founded evidence that implicates the  conspirators.</p>

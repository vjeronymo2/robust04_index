			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Great and good control Tory asset vehicle LORDS, KNIGHTS and senior military officials are among those who nominally control the vehicle which owns the principal assets of the Conservative party. Documents obtained from Companies House show that Bourne Association, a private limited company, is the most important of a number of companies intimately linked to the Conservative party. Mr Lewis Fialko, the accountant who audits Bourne, is a shareholder despite possible breaches of guidelines on independence. Bourne was formally identified as a 'quasi-subsidiary' when disclosed as part of an initiative to provide greater financial information in the 1993 Conservative party accounts. The company owns the leasehold on Conservative Central Office, which was valued in the Bourne accounts for the year to March 31 1992 at Pounds 7.25m, down from Pounds 12.5m in the previous year. The Conservative accounts, for the year to March 31 1993, show the property has again been revalued downwards to Pounds 5.25m. The Bourne documents also show that the Royal Bank of Scotland, with which the Conservative party had a Pounds 15.3m overdraft in the 1993 accounts, has a charge over the office. It shows the building as a leasehold dated in 1958 between London County Council and Limes Property Investments. There are 26 issued shares in Bourne, held by individuals which in 1991 included Lords Beaverbrook and Chelmer, Major-General Sir Brian Wyldbore-Smith, former director of the Conservative party's board of finance, and Major-General H. Ramsay, who gives his address as Conservative Central Office. Bourne Association is one of five 'quasi-subsidiaries' from which the party draws financial benefit, although there is no direct shareholding by the Conservatives. There are two other so-called river companies: Colne Association and Arun Association. Their articles of association are broadly the same as Bourne, showing that they exist to 'promote the welfare of the British peoples . . . free enterprise and individual freedom and liberty . . . and further the objects of the Conservative and Unionist Party'. They say they accept gifts which they will maintain as long as they think fit, and give away all or any of their property or assets necessary to promote their objectives.

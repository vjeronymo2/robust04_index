			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / World Trade News: France tones down strident farm threats THE French government is temporarily toning down the stridency of its campaign against the Blair House agreement in the interest of enabling the European Commission's chief negotiator, Sir Leon Brittan, to conduct his 'discreet' bid to revise farm trade terms with the US. 'We are now trying to cool things down,' said a senior government official yesterday. Referring to recent French veto threats over agriculture and broadcasting, he said: 'You won't hear any more declarations of this kind', at least not until Sir Leon makes a progress report to European Community ministers on October 4. A sign of this calmer tone came yesterday in reaction to the complaint by Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, that France was pursuing an 'egotistical' trade policy. Mr Jean Puech, France's agriculture minister, replied that such 'trumpeting would not advance the Gatt negotiations'. Having himself deliberately raised the temperature of the Gatt farm negotiations - in order to push his EC partners into their September 20 decision to reopen farm trade discussions with Washington - Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has now decreed a return in Paris to calmer diplomacy. This is partly tactical, in deference to Sir Leon Brittan's prediction, stated in yesterday's Les Echos, that only 'very discreet' pressure on the transatlantic farm trade issue will work with a US administration which is pre-occupied with getting the North American Free Trade Area (Nafta) deal through Congress. But Mr Balladur is also, at last, trying to prepare his farmers for concessions. 'If others make concessions to us, we will make concessions ourselves. One cannot win 100 per cent, but I have no intention of losing 100 per cent,' he said. Even that anodyne statement brought complaints from worried MPs of his Gaullist party. 'We are trying to calm down the farm organisations, who only a few weeks or months ago would erupt at the mention of Gatt,' an official said yesterday. 'Now with a reasonable position (on re-discussing the Blair House deal on farm trade), and with EC solidarity, we are now able to discuss with them what could go into a good agreement on Gatt.' FNSEA, the biggest farm union, said yesterday it had no intention of relaxing pressure. It called for another commissioner to go to to Washington with Sir Leon, who it said was 'not trustworthy'.</p>

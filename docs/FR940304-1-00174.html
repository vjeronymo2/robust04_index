			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The small firms that sell niche products such as heat pump water heaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> usually find that these markets have higher margins. As a result, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible that small firms would have an easier time passing through increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variable costs that result from standards, and thus may be more positively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected than large firms by standards. However, this prediction should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tempered by the observation that if standards are technologically difficult to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet, they may hurt selected smaller firms the most since, as noted above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smaller firms typically have less sophisticated research and development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thirdly, the direct heating equipment industry must be considered. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry, too, is characterized by economies of scale in production, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> larger firms having average costs that are lower than those of smaller firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Here, too, there has been continuing consolidation over the past several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decades.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same points raised above about the implications of consolidation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitiveness among water heater firms pertain to manufacturers of direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heating equipment as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Next, the mobile home furnace industry will be addressed. In this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry, two firms supply all the gas-fired mobile home furnaces. Since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussions with industry sources revealed that the market shares of the two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firms are approximately 50 percent each, the Department believes that neither  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a small firm on which standards could have a significant adverse impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The characterization of the kitchen ranges and oven industry (including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microwave ovens) is similar to those industries previously discussed. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry, too, displays economies of scale in production and increasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consolidation as the larger firms have been acquiring smaller ones for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> past few decades.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since many, if not most, of the energy conservation standards can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved without significant retooling of plant and equipment, it is probable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that such standards will not have significant adverse impacts on the small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pool heater industry, too, is characterized by economies of scale in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production, with the consequent price advantage that large firms have over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smaller ones. This industry, though, is already highly concentrated, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apparently never had a large number of firms. Most of the firms manufacture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas-fired pool heaters as an adjunct to other larger lines of business, e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boilers, pool and swimming equipment, etc. It appears that there are no real  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> niche markets. Nevertheless, since the proposed standards are generally not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to be technologically difficult to meet, and since the forecasts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are that all standard levels are profitable, the Department does not expect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant adverse impacts on small firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another industry that shares the characterization of larger firms having  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost advantages over smaller ones, i.e., that displays economies of scale, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fluorescent lamp ballast industry. Here, too, there has been continuing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consolidation over time, and presently, three firms produce 90 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many (if not most) of the standard levels considered do not require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant retooling of plant and equipment. In fact, much of the industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is currently retooling in anticipation of future growth, which is due in part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to demand motivated by demand-side management programs of electric utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> companies. These factors, combined with the estimates that profitability will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be higher at all standard levels, imply that there will probably not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant adverse impacts on small firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lastly, the impact of energy conservation standards on the television  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set industry is discussed. This industry also has undergone significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consolidation over the past few decades. Presently, as with most of the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industries discussed above, the larger firms have cost advantages over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smaller ones.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zenith is the only domestic television set manufacturer located in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S., and it has 13 percent of the market. Therefore, there really cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any adverse small firm impacts since, domestically, there is only one firm,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and it is not small.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of the foregoing, the Department has determined and hereby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifies pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's action will not have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of small entities.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conclusion, for each of these eight industries, the Department finds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the standard levels proposed in today's Proposed Rule will not ``have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not necessary to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Public Comment Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  a. Participation in Rulemaking <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department encourages the maximum level of public participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible in this rulemaking. Individual consumers, representatives of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer groups, manufacturers, associations, States or other governmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities, utilities, retailers, distributors, manufacturers, and others are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urged to submit written statements on the proposal. The Department also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourages interested persons to participate in the public hearing to be held  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Washington, DC, at the time and place indicated at the beginning of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

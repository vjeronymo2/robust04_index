			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Pay settlements outstrip inflation PAY awards across the whole economy were running at 2.3 per cent in the three months to August 1993, with private-sector awards at 2.5 per cent, the pay analysts Industrial Relations Services said. Private-sector rises averaged 4 per cent at the same time last year. About two thirds of all awards in the past three months have been above August's 1.7 per cent rate of inflation, with one in four worth 3 per cent or more. Separately, the Reward management salary survey for September shows management pay awards averaging only 2.9 per cent in the past 12 months  - the lowest it has ever recorded.</p>

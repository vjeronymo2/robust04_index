			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Viodelda Barrias] </F>   [Text] Free trade agreements are not new to Panama's  commercial relations. The country has been maintaining such  agreements with Central America since the 1970's. Panama has  bilateral preferential commercial agreements with Costa Rica, El  Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. This kind of  contract, however, is not limited to the region. Panama has also  signed treaties with members of the Latin American Integration  Association (Aladi), specifically Mexico and Colombia. In  addition, the government is forwarding talks in that direction  with Ecuador and Venezuela.    Carlos Castaneda, director of the Panamanian Foreign Trade  Institute (IPCE), has told EL PANAMA AMERICA "all these  agreements are directed at increasing and strengthening  commercial relations between contracting parties." The official  said that "with such agreements, Panama has achieved a sustained  increase in its trade relations with Central America."  Statistics indicate a total of approximately $100 million in  overall commercial activities between Panama and Central  America. The official said this result benefits the business  sector and, consequently, the country's economic policy. The  figures show 62 percent of that amount represents imports from  Central America into Panama, which suggests a trade balance  deficit for the country.    The IPCE director argued Panama is an importing country,  given its service-oriented economy. He added overall trade  figures for Panama and the rest of the world total $2 billion,  1.5 billion of which are imports. Costa Rica is Panama's major  economic partner with 56.3 percent of the total. Guatemala (21  percent), El Salvador (13.8 percent), Honduras (5.8 percent),  and Nicaragua (2.3 percent) follow in order of importance.    Under these commercial contracts, Panama has exported  $37.4-million worth of goods, of which $21.7 million are the  product of negotiations with Costa Rica. According to official  figures, Costa Rica sold Panama more than $47 million last year,  while it purchased $35 million.    The main products Panama exports via these preferential and  free trade agreements are medicines, condensed milk, spices and  condiments, tomato-based products, mayonnaise, cheese,  cosmetics, packaged tea, shrimp, and aluminum containers. Panama  receives mostly chemicals, fertilizers, and batteries from  Central America.    Regarding trade relations with Mexico and Colombia,  Castaneda  said Panama has signed several partial preference agreements.  Concerning Mexico, import tax preferences are unilateral and  nonreciprocal in Panama's favor, meaning 110 products entering  Mexico under the agreement receive partial tax exemptions, but  Panama is not obligated to grant these same privileges.    Trade with Colombia, based on a recent agreement signed in  July 1993 and pending approval at the National Assembly,  includes 10 products yet to be negotiated. It is expected the  agreement will lead to higher levels than with Central America,  due to the development and size of the Colombian market, with  its more than 40 million inhabitants.</p>

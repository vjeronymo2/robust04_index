			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKERS DON'T WANT TO BE BEHIND EIGHT BALL AGAINST PISTONS  </P> <P> The Lakers have abandoned all pretense of nonchalance this time. No longer do  they consider their twice-seasonal meetings with the Detroit Pistons as being  of moderate importance in the whole scheme of things.  </P> <P> No, today's nationally televised game means much to the Lakers on at least two  levels. Redemption from the Pistons' sweep in last spring's NBA finals, for  one. And, more important to Coach Pat Riley, a Laker victory would land a blow  in any psychological warfare the teams will wage should they meet for a third  consecutive time in the finals this June.  </P> <P> As it stands now, the Lakers have not beaten the Pistons in seven consecutive  games. They lost both regular-season games last season, were swept by the  Pistons in the finals and lost, 108-97, in overtime Dec. 1 at the Forum.  </P> <P> "That's seven straight losses," Riley said. "They do have the psychological  advantage in that way. We have to plant our feet, stand firm and make a  statement. I know I've said that before, but it's time for us to do it again."  </P> <P> Some might want to put a qualifier on the Pistons' seven-game winning streak  over the Lakers. The Lakers lost guard Byron Scott to a hamstring injury for  all four games of the finals, Magic Johnson for the last 2 1/2. Johnson also  missed one of the two regular-season games with Detroit last season. And, this  season, the Lakers were without Orlando Woolridge, now the club's fifth-leading  scorer.  </P> <P> "You can throw all that out," Riley said. "It doesn't matter. What we have to  do is learn how to play a whole game against them."  </P> <P> In the Dec. 1 loss, the Lakers had a lead late in the fourth quarter before  going the final eight minutes without scoring a field goal. In fact, the Lakers  were held without a point in overtime.  </P> <P> Laker players find it pointless to dwell on that particular loss, but they are  motivated for today's game.  </P> <P> "We've got to do things against them we haven't done in the past, like play  hard to the end," Johnson said. "We're looking forward to it. You always circle  this game on your calendar."  </P> <P> Center Mychal Thompson said his teammates are aware that the Lakers are 0-7  against the Pistons.  </P> <P> "That's as much incentive as we need," Thompson said. "We're tired of losing to  them."  </P> <P> In order for the Lakers to break the Pistons' domination, Riley said they have  to play strong the entire game instead of fading in the fourth quarter under  the Pistons' relentless defensive pressure.  </P> <P> "Their guards, we always have trouble matching up with them," Riley said. "And  (Dennis) Rodman always does a good job either on (James) Worthy or Earvin. But  we've got to play a full game. Their style of play never allows them to get out  of a game. If (the defense) gets them to the fourth period, they find a way to  win."  </P> <P> On the road, lately, the Lakers have found ways to lose leads. They carry a  three-game road losing streak into today's game. They dropped a two-point  decision at Golden State on Jan. 6; a three-point decision at Phoenix on Jan. 9  and fell behind by 24 points Friday night at Milwaukee before losing by one  point when Thompson missed a last-second shot.  </P> <P> The Lakers, however, say they have expunged those losses from memory. But they  have not forgotten what the Pistons have done to them.  </P> <P> "It's almost like it was with Boston for a while, where people said we could  not beat them," Riley said. "We need a win to break through that."  </P></p>

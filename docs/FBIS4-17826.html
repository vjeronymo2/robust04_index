			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- As a high-ranking  representative of the Ukrainian president's administration, who  wished to remain unidentified, told a UNIAN correspondent today,  the comment by the Russian side, which took part in the Black  Sea Fleet negotiations with the Ukrainian military in  Sevastopol, to the effect that the delegation from Kiev was  responsible for the breakdown of the negotiations, is totally  absurd. According to him, Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev has not explained, as yet, the reasons behind his  unexpected disappearance from Sevastopol and refusal to put his  signature under the mutually acceptable and coordinated -- by  the expert commissions of both countries -- document on the  division of the sea-going force of the Black Sea Fleet.    "Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, who headed  the  Ukrainian delegation, offered compromise variants to solve the  issues under consideration, however, the Russian side exercised  the tactics of the `elder brother,' applying various methods of  pressure, including diplomatic ones. It seems that the problem  cannot be solved without the participation of a third party, if  they raise the question in this manner and insist that the naval  forces of Ukraine must be based outside Crimea, although it  would be unadvisable to resort to the variant that occurred  during the solution of the nuclear arms issue," pointed out the  high-ranking representative.    In his opinion, no matter what conditions they set in  Moscow,  the reality is such that both the naval forces of Ukraine and  the Russian Navy must be stationed in Sevastopol. What is more,  both the naval base in Donuzlav and the Sevastopol base could be  granted to Russia on lease. The rest of the bases on the  peninsula, including those in Kerch and Feodosiya, are the  property of Ukraine, and the Russian ships can stay there by  agreement only.    The representative of the Ukrainian president's  administration also believes that Black Sea Fleet Commander  Eduard Baltin is, undoubtedly, the initiator of the  anti-Ukrainian actions at the Black Sea Fleet. The statement on  the results of the Black Sea Fleet negotiations, which he signed  jointly with Yuriy Meshkov and Viktor Semenov, the chairman of  the Sevastopol City Council, is an evidence "of the desire to  openly manifest the revanchist, great power stand of the Russian  Federation."    As an UNIAN correspondent learned from the circles close to  the Russian military department, after the negotiations in  Sevastopol Defense Minister Pavel Grachev issued an instruction  to revise the cadre of the Russian Army, removing officers of  Ukrainian descent from high posts.</p>

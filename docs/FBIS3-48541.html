			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Jan 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysian  International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz has urged  ASEAN countries not to give in to pressures by big countries to  change the forum of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation  (APEC) into a formal institution.    Malaysia will not give in to pressures and we hope other  ASEAN countries will do the same, she said during a dialogue  session to expose Indonesian businessmen on trade and investment  opportunities in Malaysia here Friday.    Responding to a question on Malaysia's stand towards APEC  which a dialogue participant said differed to that of other  ASEAN countries, she said Malaysia had no objection to  cooperation between Asia and Pacific as it was a loose forum and  programme and project orientated.    What we disagree is turning APEC into a structural and  formal  institution, holding summits for country leaders and, with its  secretariat expanding and no longer programme and project  orientated, she said.    Rafidah, who is leading a 25-member delegation for a two-day  visit to Indonesia, said ASEAN would lose out if APEC were to be  a formal institution.    Why we don't want it to be so because ASEAN, with its six  countries, has 320 million people. We have long promoted ASEAN.  We shouldn't be submerged in Asia-Pacific and losing our voice  in a formal APEC, she said.    It was for this reason, she said, that Malaysia proposed the  East Asia Economic Caucas (EAEC) with ASEAN as the backbone.    Rafidah also called on ASEAN businessmen to be more  aggresive  in establishing economic cooperation among them apart from  intensifying efforts to set up joint venture companies.    They should exploit the rapid economic growth in the region,  like their non-ASEAN counterparts were doing, she said.    She said such cooperation was vital in pooling together  their  experience, expertise, and financial resources in order to  compete with non-ASEAN entrepreneurs not only in the region but  also elsewhere.    Earlier, Rafidah held discussions with Trade Minister Satrio  Judono on bilateral trade as well as regional and global issues.    She also met Research and Technology Minister B.J. Habibie  where she discussed the possiblility of Malaysia participating  in Indonesia's aviation industry.</p>

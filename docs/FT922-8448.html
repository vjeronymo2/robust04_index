			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of West Norfolk (4): All change on the misery line - Fast trains will soon bring the area within 100 minutes of London TRAINS WILL leave King's Cross station in London this morning within three minutes of each other. One, the 08.45, boasts air conditioning, comfort and a full restaurant service. The other, the 08.48, has less style. It is cramped and spartan, and the heating is erratic. At 11.06 both trains should be pulling into stations. The first will have raced more than 230 miles north to Darlington; the second will have rattled less than 100 miles across the fens to King's Lynn. While distant parts of Britain are served by modern high-speed trains, west Norfolk is linked to London by an indirect and unreliable service. The rolling stock is vintage: Eden was prime minister when it was new; and railway enthusiasts regard the semaphore signals as memorabilia. There are few railway enthusiasts among the passengers who travel regularly across the dull flat landscape to King's Lynn. They have endured a shabby service for years on this dead-end line, one of British Rail's more neglected routes. But this is about to change. BR is spending Pounds 20m on electrifying the line and Pounds 12m on new signalling. In spite of several delays, the work should be completed by August and fast trains will bring west Norfolk within 100 minutes of London. Norfolk councillors claim that the credit for the improved rail link lies not with BR or the Department of Transport but with local government officials. They saw their chance for electrification in 1986 when the 40-mile spur from Cambridge to King's Lynn was included in Network SouthEast rather than the diesel-minded Regional Railways. Aware that Network SouthEast favoured electric services, council planners lobbied hard for King's Lynn to be plugged into the grid. Costs could be kept down, they argued, by using equipment left over from the electrification of the east coast mainline which was stored at Peterborough. BR was not convinced. They were persuaded to proceed only after King's Lynn and West Norfolk borough council agreed to make good any losses on the newly-electrified line. This revenue guarantee scheme could cost the council Pounds 650,000 over the next five years, but Adrian Parker, the borough planning officer, thinks it is a worthwhile investment. 'Electrification would not have happened without local authority intervention. BR was relatively willing but the Department of Transport was hostile, so we had to put together the revenue guarantee scheme,' he says. As part of the rail improvements, several stations will be upgraded and councillors hope there will be increasing use of the freight marshalling yard at King's Lynn. The yard could be developed to serve the town's docks, where freight traffic is carried on a twice-weekly service to Hamburg operated by the German Washbay Line. The port is dominated by coal shipments from Germany and Poland and exports of grain and scrap. But the docks are under-used compared with their heyday in the 1800s when they were run by 'old sixty-sixers' - dockers who worked from 6am to 6pm to load and unload cargo. Now councillors hope to stimulate a new boom by promoting services to Hamburg as the best route to reach markets in eastern Europe. Road hauliers, however, say the problem is not access to eastern Europe but access to East Anglia. Too many trunk roads are handicapped by single-lane traffic and routes where slow-moving farm machinery can cause long delays. The Freight Transport Association says: 'It is a difficult region in terms of roads. The east coast ports offer the best routes to the (European) single market, so we are anxious to see the principal routes improved.' The Department of Transport (DoT) denies trunk roads are being neglected. It is funding improvements to three routes which pass through west Norfolk: the A47 from Peterborough to Great Yarmouth; the A10 from King's Lynn to London; and the A17 King's Lynn to Newark. More than Pounds 236m is being spent on the A47; Pounds 32m on the A10 north of Cambridge; and Pounds 45m on the A17. Most of this expenditure involves widening single-lane roads or converting them to dual-carriageway. The borough council, which wants all three trunk roads converted to dual- carriageway, thinks the DoT has under-estimated traffic flows. 'The growth in heavy traffic has been so rapid it is in danger of exceeding the figures planned for the year 2000,' says Adrian Parker. 'We need dual-carriageways but (improvements) have been under-funded. East Anglia as a whole has been grossly under-funded.' Better trunk routes should make King's Lynn the gateway from the east Midlands to the coastal ports, but Mr Parker thinks the region needs 15 years of road improvements before the town can fully assume that status. In the meantime, he hopes faster rail services and improvements to secondary roads will attract developers and new residents. The town is looking southwards for its future. It sees itself as an overspill site for homebuyers and businesses which cannot be accommodated in Cambridge. More than 150 hectares of the town's Hardwick industrial park have been earmarked for expansion and electric rail services should make it an attractive option for commuters to the university city.</p>

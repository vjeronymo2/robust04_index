			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F> "Crucial Talks Between Chinese Foreign Minister and U.S.  Secretary of State in Middle of This Month"]    [Text]Sino-U.S Relations Enter a New Stage    The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced yesterday  that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher would visit  China from 11 to 14 March at the invitation of Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen. It is believed that this meeting of the foreign  ministers of China and the United States will produce results in  improving bilateral relations and alleviating some  contradictions between the two countries.    In Washington, talking about his visit to Asia, U.S.  Secretary of State Christopher said that in September last year,  President Bill Clinton had instructed him to develop relations  with China in a broader way. In November, while attending the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the Chinese President  Jiang Zemin met with Clinton in Seattle. Since then "Sino-U.S.  relations have entered a new stage." These remarks indicate  that the United States is paying great attention to Secretary of  State Christopher's visit to China.    Since the summer of 1989, relations between China and the  United States have been at a low ebb. It was not until November  last year, when the top leaders of the two countries met after  an absence of nearly five years, that relations between the two  countries began to develop toward a new direction. Although  there are still contradictions between China and the United  States, such as the U.S. deficit in bilateral trade, China's  human rights situation, and disputes over intellectual property  rights, as noted by the United States, with the exception of the  human rights issue, on which China maintains its own position  and all the more opposes U.S. linkage of human rights with  granting most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status to China, the  other two problems are easy to solve, and, moreover, are being  resolved.  <H5>  Both Sides at Odds With Each Other on Human Rights Issue </H5>   As such, the crux of the failure of Sino-U.S. relations to  further improve lies in the human rights issue. When leaving  Beijing for home on 2 March, Assistant Secretary of State John  Shattuck, who had finished a two-day visit to China, said that  China had made some progress in improving its human rights.  However, further progress on human rights was needed if it  wanted Clinton to extend its MFN status in June. Obviously,  this means continuing to bring pressure to bear on China. On  this issue, a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman  reiterated China's position yesterday: Opposing U.S. linkage of  the human rights issue with MFN status.    However, the purpose of Shattuck's visit to Beijing was to  make arrangements for Christopher's visit to China. At meetings  with many top-level Chinese officials, including Vice Foreign  Minister Liu Huaqiu, Shattuck stressed that the Clinton  administration hoped to strengthen Sino-U.S. relations.  However, on the MFN renewal issue, China must make  improvements. He clearly remarked: "This is the bottom line  for the U.S. Government."    It can thus be seen that whether or not this deadlock can be  broken or what form it assumes depends on the current Beijing  talks between the foreign ministers of the two countries.  <H5>  Seeking a Point of Compromise in the Deadlock </H5>   On the one hand, under pressure from Congress, the Clinton  administration has strongly demanded China to respond on the  human rights issue so that he can justify himself on the issue,  and, on the other hand, he also faces strong pressure from  American manufacturing, business, and economic circles, which  oppose the use of political means to compel China to submit. If  China and the United States fall out with each other, Chinese  retaliation against the United States will also be detrimental  to its economy.    It must be pointed out that the U.S. economy has entered a  new stage of stable growth from recovery. U.S. economic  strategy puts stress on Asia. The vast market of China is  precisely what the United States desires most. It is obvious  that since the Sino-U.S. summit in November last year, Clinton  has decided to develop economic relations with China and  Southeast Asia. In terms of the international political  situation, for the United States and China to maintain friendly  relations will benefit the economic and political stability of  the two countries, Asia, and the world at large.    In fact, China has been continuously improving its human  rights. This has been acknowledged by many officials from the  United States and Europe who have visited China. It must be  said that it would be conducive to both sides and feasible for  the foreign ministers of the two countries to seek a long-term  solution to the MFN issue in one move by proceeding on the basis  of their long-term and immediate interests.</p>

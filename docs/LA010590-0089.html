			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AZERBAIJANI DEMONSTRATORS SAID TO BE LEAVING BORDER  </P> <P> A protest organizer said Azerbaijani demonstrators began drawing back from the  Soviet-Iranian border Thursday after trying for four days to force open the  frontier crossing and reunite with their brethren in Iran.  </P> <P> The KGB reinforced its border troops in the area Wednesday to stop protesters  from smashing guard towers and security alarms.  </P> <P> The newspaper Rabochaya Tribuna, or Workers' Tribune, reported Thursday: "The  border posts themselves are under threat, and the rampaging ruffians have gone  so far as to promise retribution against the soldiers of the border patrol and  their family members."  </P> <P> But dissident writer Yusif Samedoglu reported by telephone Thursday from Baku,  capital of the republic of Azerbaijan: "The situation is stabilizing. People  are gradually going home."  </P> <P> Samedoglu leads the grass-roots political Azerbaijani People's Front, which  organized the protest.  </P> <P> Savili A. Perets, deputy director of the official news agency Azerinform, also  said in a telephone interview from Baku that the border area was calming down.  He said Azerbaijan party chief Abdul-Rakhman Vezirov and other officials  traveled Thursday from Baku to the border area to investigate.  </P> <P> The Azerbaijanis began demonstrating Sunday for unification of their Soviet  republic with Iran's northern Azerbaijan province, a region peopled by their  ethnic kin. They threatened to remove all barriers along the nearly 500-mile  border if authorities failed to do so themselves.  </P> <P> The disturbances were the latest flare-up in two years of ethnic unrest among  Azerbaijanis, Armenians, Georgians, Abkhazians and other ethnic groups in the  Soviet Caucasus region. More than 300 people died nationwide in ethnic unrest  in two years.  </P> <P> Iran has protested the unrest, but Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.  Gerasimov said Thursday, "It's not a big international issue."  </P> <P> Five young men from Soviet Azerbaijan cut barbed wire border fences on the Aras  River that forms the border with Iran and four managed to swim to the Iranian  side, Iran's TV network reported in a broadcast monitored in Cyprus. The fifth  drowned in the incident Wednesday, it said.  </P> <P> It marked the first time the unrest was reported in Iranian news media.  </P> <P> The Soviet Azerbaijanis, who are largely Shiite Muslims, want freedom to trade  with their ethnic kin in Iran and cross the frontier, practices that dictator  Josef Stalin suspended.  </P></p>

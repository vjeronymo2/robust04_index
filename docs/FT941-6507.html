			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Japanese companies downgrade forecasts More Japanese companies have warned that their profits for the current financial year may not match earlier forecasts. In the case of Mitsukoshi, Japan's most prestigious department store, which has links with Harrods of London, the pre-tax loss is expected to worsen due to poor sales to corporate customers. The retailer expects a non-consolidated pre-tax loss for the year to last month to widen to Y3.5bn (Dollars 33m) from a previously forecast Y2.3bn. Mitsukoshi expects to post its second consecutive pre-tax loss, highlighting the problems facing Japanese department stores amid the current downturn in the economy and the sharp fall in consumer confidence. Department stores have also faced declines in sales due to an increase in competition from discount retailers, especially in the clothing sector. The company said it would post an extraordinary loss of Y5.1bn due to the liquidation of three affiliates, Mitsukoshi Restaurant Service, a sports club, and a Paris-based designer brand retailer. However it will also post a special profit of Y5.8bn from assets sales, including a workshop in central Tokyo and condominiums, which have been sold to a real estate affiliate. All Nippon Airways warned that it would be unable to post earlier projected non-consolidated sales of Y782bn for the current year to March. Mr Seiji Fukatsu, ANA president, said that, although the pre-tax profit forecast of Y6bn would remain the same, annual sales could now total only Y750bn. In the telecommunications industry, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) foresees its unconsolidated, or parent only, pre-tax profit for the coming fiscal year beginning April 1 falling by 1.9 per cent to Y104bn from the Y106bn estimated earlier. The forecast came as part of NTT's business plan for the coming fiscal year. The company is Japan's largest carrier of telephone calls. NTT's president, Mr Masashi Kojima, said that, even with pre-tax profit of Y104bn for the coming fiscal year, the company would have to carry forward profit from the current fiscal year to pay its regular dividend of Y5,000 per share. Mr Kojima warned that the telecommunications giant wanted to raise basic monthly phone charges and charges on telephone directory assistance services. Kokusai Denshin Denwa, Japan's international telecommunications company, said it expected Y29bn in current profit in 1994-95, starting April 1, up Y1bn from this year. KDD said its estimate of current profits for 1993-94 has been cut to Y28bn from a Y30bn estimate made in October last year. KDD plans to invest Y60bn in plant and equipment in 1994-95, compared with an estimated Y55bn for the current business year. 'We expect the international communications market to remain firm in 1994-95,' it said.</p>

The review period is March 29, 1991 through June 30, 1992. The review covers four manufacturers/exporters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results.

The Department has now completed that administrative review in accordance with Section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of the Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The merchandise covered by this review is silicon metal containing at least 96.00 but less than 99.99 percent of silicon metal from Brazil. Silicon metal is currently provided for under subheadings 2804.69.10 and 2804.69.50 of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harmonized Tariff Schedule  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (HTS) as a chemical product, but is commonly referred to as a metal. Semiconductor grade silicon metal (silicon metal containing by weight not less than 99.99 percent of silicon and provided for in subheading 2804.61.00 of the HTS) is not subject to the order. HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 3, 1993 the Department determined, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.29 (1993), that silicon metal with a higher aluminum content containing between 89 and 96 percent of silicon metal is of the same class or kind of merchandise as silicon metal subject to the antidumping duty order. While this scope determination was undertaken in the context of the antidumping duty order governing silicon metal from the People's Republic of China, the silicon metal subject to that order is the same as the silicon metal covered by this order. Therefore, the Department will include such merchandise in future reviews of this order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This review covers four manufacturers/exporters of Brazilian silicon metal. The period covered by this review is March 29, 1991 through June 30, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Comments Received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results as provided by section 353.22(c) of the Department's regulations. We received comments from the petitioners (American Alloys, Inc., Elkham Metals Company, Globe Metallurgical Inc., SKW Metals &amp; Alloys, Inc. and SMI Group, Inc., Rock Island Silicon Division) and from four respondents (Companhia Brasileira Carbureto de Calcio (CBCC), Companhia Ferroligas Minas Gerais-Minasligas (Minasligas), Eletrosilex Belo Horizonte (Eletrosilex), and Rima Eletrometalurgia S.A. (Rima)). On January 14, 1994, we held a public hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners contend that CBCC refused to provide cost information necessary for the calculation of cost of production (COP) and constructed value (CV). Specifically, petitioners argue that CBCC did not properly report its interest expenses and charcoal replacement costs. Petitioners also contend that CBCC understated its electricity and quartz replacement costs. Petitioners conclude that the Department should utilize the highest, most adverse margin as best information available (BIA) since the deficiencies in CBCC's COP/CV response are so pervasive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree with petitioners. While during verification we did find areas where the costs were not appropriately quantified, we have not found these deficiencies to be so significant or pervasive as to call into question the accuracy of the entire response. It should be noted that some of the issues, as discussed in comments 2, 4, 6, and 11, are related to methodological questions, rather than areas of incorrect reporting of costs. In the instances where we found insufficient verification support ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> December 20, 1993 ``CBCC Cost Verification Report''), we relied on partial BIA. For the methodological issues, we recalculated the costs to correct a particular cost element. Although we have made certain adjustments to the information submitted by CBCC ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  our responses to comments 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9), we generally have used CBCC's data in reaching these final results of administrative review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Open Apology for Nuclear Development by S. Korean </F> Authorities Demanded" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- "The South Korean  rulers, if they truly want to turn the Korean peninsula into a  nuclear-free, peace zone, must acknowledge, though belatedly,  that their heavy water reactor, multipurpose research reactor  and fast breeder reactor are for developing nuclear weapons, and  apologize for this at home and abroad, and take a step to scrap  them," said Chang Chae- chol, chairman of the C.C. [Central  Committee], the Korean Roman Catholics Association, in a  statement on Tuesday.    Noting that Kim Yong-sam the traitor recently concluded an  agreement with Japan on a joint nuclear development and is  hastening the development of a fast breeder reactor, the  statement said:    "The development of nuclear weapons in South Korea has  assumed a full-fledged scale because the International Atomic  Energy Agency, applying a double standard, has connived at the  puppets' development of nuclear arms which has actually reached  a dangerous stage, not publishing even the inspection results,  while taking issue with the DPRK's nuclear facilities for a  peaceful purpose.    "Not contented with the introduction of over 1,000 pieces of  U.S. nuclear weapons, which have turned South Korea into the  largest nuclear depot in the Far East, the Kim Yong-sam group is  stepping up the development of nuclear weapons by itself. This  is an unpardonable heinous anti-national crime.    "I call upon all the Roman Catholics and Catholic  communities  and people of conscience of the world to pay due attention to  the nuclear development in South Korea and lift up voices of  justice denouncing it," the statement concluded.</p>

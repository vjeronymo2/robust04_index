			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH, ENERGY SECRETARIES WIN SENATE CONFIRMATION  </P> <P> The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly confirmed Louis W. Sullivan as health  and human services secretary and James D. Watkins as energy secretary. In  back-to-back ballots, senators voted 98 to 1 for Sullivan, a physician who was  the only black nominated for a Cabinet post, and 99 to 0 for Watkins, a retired  admiral who led former President Ronald Reagan's AIDS commission.  </P> <P> Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N. C.) cast the vote against Sullivan. He charged that the  head of Atlanta's Morehouse College medical school had ducked questions about  issues such as fetal research and AIDS confidentiality.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ECONOMY;  </P> <P> ECONOMY GROWS MORE SLOWLY THAN EXPECTED  </P> <P> The nation's economy grew at an annual rate of 4.3% during the first three  months of the year, well below the 5.5% estimated a month ago and far slower  than analysts had expected, the Commerce Department said Thursday.  </P> <P> And excluding the farm economy, which rebounded briskly from last year's  drought, economic expansion was only 1.8%, down from the 3% reported earlier.  By contrast, the non-farm economy grew 3.5% in the last quarter of 1988.  </P> <P> The slowdown in reported growth had little impact in financial markets  Thursday, as the Dow Jones industrial index fell by barely more than a point.  </P> <P> And it drew varying interpretations from economists. Some said a slowdown of  near-recession proportions might be imminent; others predicted a quick  turnaround and faster growth next year.  </P> <P> Hidden in the revised estimate was evidence, welcome to most economists, that a  previously reported slowdown in domestic consumption was offset by a stronger  trade performance than earlier reported, mainly because of greater exports.  </P> <P> Bigger sales overseas of American goods in turn permitted manufacturers to  reduce business inventories at a faster clip than earlier reported. Although  that retards economic output in the short term, it prepares the way for renewed  production later on.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in a separate report Thursday that likewise pointed to slower growth  so far this year than earlier had been expected, the Commerce Department said  corporate profits in the first quarter fell $21.6 billion, or 1.7%, to a  seasonally adjusted annual rate of $319.3 billion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Signs of Slowdown  </P> <P> This was the biggest decline in profits since a 2.5% drop in the fourth quarter  of 1987, when the stock market crashed. In the fourth quarter of 1988, profits  increased $10.9 billion, according to a revised report issued Thursday.  </P> <P> "With this revision, it looks even more like a slowdown has already set in this  year," said Giulio Martini of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., a New York  investment banking firm. "But with this drop in business inventories, the  question now becomes, how much further can the slowdown go? It now looks much  more likely that the economy will be primed to rebound in the fourth quarter,  rather than waiting for next year."  </P> <P> Bernstein's current estimate: two more quarters of limping growth at or near  the non-farm 1.8% annual growth now estimated for the first quarter, then a big  rebound to 4% in the last three months of the year.  </P> <P> Likewise, First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles sees an economic slowdown for  the rest of the year before a rebound next year.  </P> <P> "What this indicates was that the first quarter was much weaker than we had  thought, that March was weaker than February and that February was weaker than  January," said Kenneth Ackbarali, a First Interstate economist. "It supports  our case that we are close to the onset of a mild and brief recession."  </P> <P> But thanks to the strong growth in exports and the inventory slowdown,  Ackbarali predicted, there will be nothing like the collapse of jobs growth  that occurred in 1982, and thanks to expected vigorous reaction by the Federal  Reserve Board, a quick rebound can be anticipated early next year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Good News for Fed  </P> <P> Even economists like Ackbarali, who see a recession as imminent, generally  agree that the Fed has stopped squeezing the economy as inflation has moderated  and will act to head off a serious slowdown.  </P> <P> David Wyss of Data Resources, Inc., a forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass.,  said the Fed could not have asked for a more favorable report than Thursday's.  </P> <P> "Real growth was a lot slower than expected," he said, "but inventories  accounted for all the revision, so there's much less danger of an inventory  correction later in the year. If anything, this increases the chances of a soft  landing for the economy and reduces the chances of recession this year."  </P> <P> In the language of economists, a soft landing is a slowdown to growth rates  well within the Fed's declared inflation-moderating target of 2.5% a year, then  a gradual resumption of the expansion.  </P> <P> Final sales, to some economists a crucial tell-tale measure of productive  growth because they remove inventories from the accounting, were pegged by  Thursday's report at an annual rate of $4.039 trillion in 1982 dollars,  compared to $4.035 trillion in the earlier report. Final sales grew at a 3.5%  rate over the previous quarter, compared to 3% in the earlier report.  </P></p>

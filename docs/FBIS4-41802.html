			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian Central Election Commission tonight  announced a postponement of the news conference on the  preliminary results of the presidential elections earlier  scheduled for 1100 on 28 June.    The commission told INTERFAX-Ukraine that the large volume  of  information to be processed and the slow pace of its  transmission made the summing up of results in such a short  period of time impossible.    The commission said that general information on the results  of the Ukrainian presidential elections divulged by the media  had nothing to do with the official sources.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UN protests to Iraq over treatment of inspectors UN INSPECTORS investigating Iraq's chemical and biological weapons stocks were trapped in a bus by demonstrators outside the Sheraton hotel in Baghdad yesterday while police looked on and refused to intervene. The incident was reported to the Security Council and protests were addressed to the Iraqi government. According to an official UN account in New York last night, 40 male demonstrators confronted the 18 inspectors. Ms Karen Jansen, their deputy chief, was pinned against the hotel wall. Meanwhile, other team members were held in their bus as demonstrators jumped and pushed UN vehicles. Eventually, the inspectors forced their way through the crowd and into the hotel. A UN spokesman called the incident a clear Iraqi breach of UN resolutions. In a development which the spokesman said was unrelated to the incident, a special UN mission was due in Baghdad last night to discuss with the authorities Iraq's failure to disclose detailed information about its weapons of mass destruction and weapons research and industries. This failure was 'a serious obstacle to the implementation of the long-term monitoring and verification of Iraq's obligations' under Council resolutions, the UN said.</p>

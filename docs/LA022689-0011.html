			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROM POLITICAL THEATER TO POLITICAL FARCE;  </P> <P> PATTERNS OF ABUSE BY JOHN H. TAYLOR (WYNWOOD PRESS: $18.95; 383 PP.)  </P> <P> "No matter how many friends he may think he has in the press . . . the  President must recognize that his relationship with the media is inherently  adversarial."  </P> <P> These cautionary words from a recent issue of TV Guide were penned by no less  an experienced hand at adversarial press relationships than Richard Nixon. They  might well have been used as the basis for the debut novel by his chief aide,  John H. Taylor's, about a White House under siege by the Washington Post. Not  surprisingly, Taylor has stacked the deck rather heavily against the Fourth  Estate, but in spite of that (or even, I shudder to suggest, because of it),  the book is a very entertaining study of the abuse of press -- and political --  power.  </P> <P> Set in the very near future, Taylor's America is a little different from the  one we now know. Jack Kemp is governor of New York. Ben Bradlee has retired to  teach at the Columbia Journalism School; his desk at the Post has been filled  by a self-serving Machiavelli named George Stevens. And the country has just  seen a presidential shift from California Republican Ronald Reagan to Louisiana  Democrat Eugene Hoskins, a chief executive whose political philosophy seems  slightly to the right of Reagan's.  </P> <P> Hoskins has a big problem. An ambitious, obnoxious and unconscionable young  Post reporter plans on breaking the news of a top-secret mission to rescue  hostages from Lebanon, thereby threatening the success of the venture. What's a  right-thinking President to do? He orders the FBI to lock up the reporter until  the hostages are safely home. The raid is successful, but the incarceration  isn't. The reporter dies in a car crash and a cover-up is attempted. It doesn't  work, and the Post is in position to bring down another President.  </P> <P> Though its specifics are unique, the situation -- with the press nipping at  wounded politicians' scuffling heels like bush dogs coming off the eight-week  low-cholesterol diet -- is more than faintly familiar from both fiction and  nonfiction. Happily, Taylor presents it with neither pretentiousness nor  rancor. This is not a political morality tale. Nor is it a mirthless paranoid  thriller, though it includes some skulduggery in Paris and murder in  Washington. It is instead a well-crafted yarn in which we are taken on a  generally intriguing tour through the complex jungles of D.C. politics, with  rumor, fables and facts convincingly melded.  </P> <P> Along the way, we meet the President's security adviser, a nimble-witted man of  middle age who is the novel's protagonist; his paramour, a beautiful young  reporter (the only heroic journalist in evidence); the aforementioned evil and  manipulative Post editor; a rather dim Republican senator with presidential  ambitions; a trusted member of the National Security Council who leaks the  scandal to get her hated brother into hot water (his identity is a secret  Taylor rightly keeps as long as possible); a collection of reporters of varying  political persuasions who wittily bat the news about on a weekend TV show; and  an assortment of military men, pols and media mites blessed with the gift of  gritty gab.  </P> <P> Unlike some other novelists who deal with national and international politics,  Taylor is particularly straightforward in telling his story. We can actually  follow the plot. His characters are credible and their dialogue has an  authentic tone. And he convinces us that we are on the inside of a world that  is as chillingly authentic as it is shadowy.  </P> <P> The author's main failings are 1) that the ethics of the presidential act are  never really addressed and 2) that he indulges in such aggressive media-bashing  that one begins to feel sorry for even the likes of Geraldo Rivera. Those in  the news-gathering profession will probably be annoyed by this apparent bias.  </P> <P> But how angry can you be with an author who is able to so stylishly sum up  recent D.C. history? "Watergate was Shakespeare," he writes, "and the  Iran-Contra affair was Gilbert and Sullivan, complete with the very model of a  modern lieutenant colonel. In journalist argot, they were both 'great political  theater.' At curtain's fall -- as Nixon flew his living, breathing, bruised  family to their Orange County Elba and Reagan's shaky hand reached out for his  smiling new Russian friend and his newest prop, a pen for signing treaties --  many Washingtonians were strangely wistful as they filed back out into the  neon-bright real world."  </P></p>

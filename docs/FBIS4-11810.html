			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In his Friday prayer sermons, Ayatollah Mohammad  Yazdi referred to the Day of God, 12 Farvardin [1 April], the  anniversary of the establishment of the Islamic republic system,  and described it as the day of sovereignty of justice and Islam.  He stressed: The true gratefulness for such a great blessing  can be shown through support for the Islamic government and its  principles and inspirations.    He referred to the historic vote of the Muslim nation of  Iran  for the Islamic republic system and added: The participation of  the people in the general process of the Islamic system and  their determining its structure is a principle which has  prevailed since the victory of the Islamic revolution.    The head of the judiciary branch explained the  characteristics of the Islamic Republic system and said: Such  form of government is still unknown to the world and for that  reason the dimensions and philosophy of its structure should be  further introduced to the people of the world.    The head of the judiciary branch also called for a  principled  solution to the hajj problem. He said that the problem should  be solved in a mutual way. The Saudi Government should be made  aware and the problem explained to its officials in order to  find a fundamental solution to the problem of the hajj.    He referred to the possibility of a number of Iranian  volunteers going to hajj from other countries, and said: If a  person holds a passport and a valid visa, then there should be  no problem for going to hajj from other countries, and people  should not be limited for no reason.    Ayatollah Yazdi also called for a specific reply by the  government of Armenia on the downing of an Iranian C-130  aircraft over Karabakh. [passage omitted]</p>

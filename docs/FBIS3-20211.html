Imset: "Military Determined To </F> Crush Rebellion by Force"]    [Text] Ankara--Turkey's military commanders, or rather  those who are commanding all state policy out of the Southeast,  have finally clarified their position in public: a military  solution to the Kurdish problem.    Sabah's prominent columnist Hasan Cemal on Wednesday  reported  the highly interesting results of a meeting he had with the most  senior security officials in Diyarbakir.    Cemal identifies his hosts as members of "the entire state."  These are State of Emergency Regional Governor Unal Erkan,  Diyarbakir Governor Ibrahim Sahun, Turkish police chief Mehmet  Agar, Seventh Army Corps commander Gen. Metin Saglam,  Gendarmerie regional commander Gen. Hasan Kundakci, Second  Tactical Air Force Commander Gen. Ergin Celasun, prosecutors,  deputy provincial governors, high level security and  intelligence officers. Perhaps not truly aware of Western  suspicions on what is brewing up in their regions, the officers  tell Cemal what is going to happen and how far military policy  will go in dealing with the Kurdish problem. Obviously, no one  refers to it in these words. Despite what Ankara tells foreign  capitals regarding its recognition of "the Kurdish identity,"  views back at home are totally the opposite. As Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin recently told a Western journalist, "There  is no Kurdish problem. There is only a terrorism problem in  Turkey."    When the situation is such, even in the words of a  "social-democrat" member of the coalition, how can anyone expect  Turkey to seek any "political" or "democratic" outlet to the  "non-existing" Kurdish problem.    The full text of Cemal's observations are published today on  Page B2 of the special section of the TURKISH DAILY NEWS. The  highlight remarks, however, deserve to be debated extensively  for they represent not only the dominant view among "commanders"  in the region but also reflect what is being "reported" to  Ankara.    It is not clear which general made the remark, "I understood  he was a Turk... I told myself I could not read treason in his  eyes," but the implication is clear. If the mentality behind  Turkey's imminent crack down on terrorism is to "differentiate  between the innocent and the criminal" by looking into people's  eyes, and only "Turks" are not suspected of treason, much can be  guessed about the real "targets" of the operations... Cemal  reports that the most widely heard evaluation among the security  emperors of the region is that "the organization has been put  into a situation where it can no longer organize mass  incidents." This is what President Suleyman Demirel and Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller are being informed. A view which has been  strengthened by the fact that instead of appearing in the  streets in their thousands and rioting with Kurdish flags, the  people of the Southeast remained at home during the March 21  Kurdish new year of Newroz.    Somehow, the officials appear to have missed the hitch: the  Turkish service of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)  carried an exclusive interview with outlawed Kurdistan Workers'  Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan two days before in which he  called on the people to stay at home. Ocalan warned the people  that Turkey was preparing for a "massacre" and, in order to  avoid this, they stayed at home.    Indeed, although Erkan explained to us that everything was  "peaceful and quiet," and that even the people--"the true  people"-- in the PKK stronghold of Cizre were on the street  celebrating Newroz along with the security forces, the actual  truth was quite different.    First of all, he has failed to mention that thousands of  people from Cizre had been displaced over the past two months  and that there was a state-controlled "re-population" of this  town, strengthening the presence of village guards there. He  forgot to explain why and how whole districts had been forced to  move to other cities, and that several thousand people, just  because they lived in districts known to be supportive of the  PKK, had been forced to move to the province of Gaziantep. In  place of those remaining people who "listened to the PKK," and  waited inside their homes, village guards were bussed in with  their families and celebrated Newroz along with special crack  teams. Not even the loudspeakers, calling on the people to come  out, were enough to move them. Erkan, instead of going into  such "technicalities," only explained the following: "Do not  forget that until a few years ago, those village guards were  unable to go out on the street in Cizre. If they did, they were  liable to be hanged upside down from the trees.    Yes, its true. Because the PKK was "strong" in Cizre and  because it had expanded its "grassroots." A strength which was  won only after 1989 when a gendarmerie officer forced Kurdish  villagers to eat human excrement. A strength which, even  according to separatist leader Osman Ocalan, "was due mainly to  Turkish policies."    But looking at the cost of "moving village guards" into  Cizre, one can only be aware of the pain inflicted on all of the  civilians: forceful displacement of a whole population, raids on  major districts and repression.    It is difficult to legitimize what has been done to Cizre  in the past by no more than a celebration by a handful of  village guards and police officers, mainly "imported" from the  outside. And can this justify all of the "mystery murders" as  well? Certainly not.    But the fact that the PKK has called on the people to stay  at  home and that the people have done so, has served to "prove"  claims that the organization were unable to move the masses.  But it didn't. For even the PKK leader referred to this  "action" as a "passive resistance." In other words, it was the  very lack of activity that made the point.    Had the people gone on the streets and celebrated Newroz,  this really would have been the evidence for a lack of support  in the organization. And what one commander said with regard to  Sirnak is even more scary, as scary as the remark on "treason  read in the eyes."    "Remember the March 21, 1991 Newroz day in Sirnak. From  morning to evening it was impossible to remove the PKK colors  from the flagpole in the city square. And the things that were  done to the Ataturk statue there! Then came the 1992 Newroz.  Demirel's prime ministry. The PKK was taught a lesson in  Sirnak. The state displayed its might. Everybody saw that  there was a price to pay for messing around with the state.  Today, not the slightest sound was heard in Sirnak. Think of  the change brought about in three years."    Yes, everyone has to think of this. And everyone also has to  remember how this "success" was achieved. For instance, how  17,000 people living in this city were forced to migrate when it  was pulled to the ground in a massive security operation. How  the state supported, funded and armed the feudal Tatar tribe in  order to control the local people. How policemen burned cars  owned by journalists, how newsmen were beaten on the streets,  and how much confidence in the state has been lost through this  policy--boosting local support for the PKK.    But, it appears from what the decision-makers are saying  that  no one really cares about a thing about "methods" as long as the  expected "results" are achieved. And, Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller, who has "successfully" failed Turkey in every direction,  has "surrendered" all authority and policy as far as security is  concerned to the military.    Cemal has been told this clearly and made this point: "A  curious line is being drawn from Ozal to Demirel and now to  Ciller. It is being stressed that in the fight against the PKK,  Ciller is in complete harmony with the security forces and the  military. One of the officials says, 'Ciller has grasped the  situation. She saw how the security forces could be given the  boost to morale that they needed. And this has been  accomplished."    And an interesting remark: "You may recall that once it used  to be said that the Republican People's Party (CHP) plus the  army equals power. Now Ciller sees this and seizes the  opportunity."    Ozal had closed the doors to the military, believing a  political solution could be achieved in the Kurdish dispute. He  had also accepted that "a Kurdish problem" existed in Turkey.  Moreover, this policy had served to restore "civilian"  democracy in Turkey. With his death last April, Turkish  democracy itself was set back by about ten years, and finding  any kind of solution to the Kurdish issue is becoming more and  more impossible.    Demirel opened the door for the military in fear of losing  his own authority if he limited the authority of commanders.  Still he had control and influence on what was going on.  Ciller allowed the military to walk through the door opened by  Demirel and has given "full authority" to the military. In  other words, she is saying, "Stop this problem and stop it fast.  Do whatever is needed."    What is needed, then?    It is evident that the military actually believes there is  an  army-Ciller coalition in power. The increasing domination of  national issues by military commanders, their growing role in  daily policies and other significant developments imply they may  be right.    And they have their own solution to the Southeast dilemma  now. 1. They deny that a "Kurdish problem" exists. 2. They  believe the problem is only one of "terrorism." 3. They are  determined to "solve" this problem by summer at the latest and  4. They will "solve" it by force alone. The result of the  recent blows delivered to the PKK are categorized by officials  as: "Fewer recruits to the organization, more information about  the organization, a sharp decline in the logistic support for  the organization, greater demand to become village guards."    1. Recruitment to the PKK is continuing steadily and has  actually been boosted by the reaction to the "methods" used in  the latest security operations.    2. The decline in logistical support to the organization is  due mainly to the forcible displacement of villagers and the  burning down of 900 villages, in addition to massive crackdowns  on four major towns. This has cut direct logistical support to  the PKK but has also increased local sympathy, as well as the  number of "undecided" villagers moving "up to the mountains."    3. The "greater demand" to become village guards is a  reflection of the increase in the number of village guards that  has already taken place and that resulted from the security  forces telling civilians that if they do not agree to take  state-issued weapons and fight the PKK, they will be "seen and  treated as the PKK." Sort of a "die or join us" policy which is  also one of the major reasons behind the forceful evacuation of  villages and their being burned to the ground.    Officials have told Cemal that this will be a "hot" summer.  That, as of April, "the rural areas" and "the mountain cadres"  of the PKK will be the targets. That these will completely be  wiped out.    But how will the state differentiate between the terrorists  and the innocent? And how many people will die in this  campaign? Last year, both Chief of Staff commander Gen. Dogan  Cures and President Demirel said in separate speeches that  "anyone who supports the terrorists or sympathizes with them is  a traitor." Even sympathizers, be it out of fear or because for  70 troubled years they have not felt the state at their side,  are thus targets. But how many targets?    Could it be only a coincidence that several weeks after  Demirel and Gures' remarks, another senior military official  boldly told the press that "the PKK has 350,000 sympathizers."  Or is this a message?    The military viewpoint, which is controls [as published]  almost all state affairs but the economy (for which no one wants  to take responsibility), is clearly outlined to Cemal:    "Nothing can be done as long as the fight against the  terrorist organization continues. First you must make that  organization collapse. Then you can think of other things. If  you tried to do anything else at this stage, there would be no  end to it. Things would go on, as a chain. First the fight  against terrorism."    And what will be the second step? Does Ankara recognize the  Kurdish "identity?" Yes. Does anyone know what this  recognition means other than upgrading Turkey's image abroad?  No. Does Ankara recognize the Kurdish "problem?" No.    So what can be the second step? In the words of former  gendarmerie intelligence chief Maj. Ahmet Cem Ersever, with the  policy currently underway, even if the PKK is destroyed, "There  will be other PKKs under different names." No solution. But  Ersever will fortunately not be around to witness that crisis  because, after making such remarks following his retirement, he  was shot dead with hands tied behind his back. Later, three of  his "operatives" were also killed.    People related to the Kurdish issue in one way or the other  have died by the dozen from "natural" or "unnatural" causes over  the past year. Gendarmerie forces commander Esref Bitlis died  in a queer "plane crash." Turgut Ozal had a heart attack and  died only days before submitting a major proposal for "Kurdish  reforms" to the National Security Council. Ersever has died.  Ugur Mumcu was killed while investigating possible links  between the PKK and Turkish intelligence. Musa Anter, Vedat  Aydin, Mehmet Sincar are only several of those killed over the  past week.    As the war, which Turks are advised to refer to as  "conflict", continues in the troubled region for ten years, a  different and more hidden form of war is going on in larger  cities. "There is a certain, unexpressed, feeling that it would  be better if the media did not write or broadcast anything about  the region," Cemal says. How good it would be not to be  monitored in any way. How great it would be if everyone, like  Ciller, understood where the "authority" currently lies and what  ends this will serve. A total of 350,000 troops (an amendment  to earlier figures) are now based in the Southeast along with  police teams and village guards. Meanwhile local officials  prepare for the most massive crackdown that has ever been  launched in the region. Even more massive, perhaps, than the  "security operations" in the past 70 years aiming to crush 28  "Kurdish rebellions." According to Demirel, "the 29th  rebellion" is now taking place and it is obvious how such  uprisings should be treated. This is what is scary, coming with  remarks from officials who are to run the operation implying  that it is only Turks who will not have treason shining in their  eyes, the "targets" of any operation to be launched in that  region should interest everyone.</p>

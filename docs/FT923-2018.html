			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Lamont to quit IMF meeting early MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, plans to leave the Washington meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for London early on Monday to deal with any further developments affecting the UK economy and sterling. He was originally due to stay in Washington until Wednesday to deliver speeches to the IMF and World Bank annual meeting in his capacity as UK governor of the IMF and current president of the European Community's council of economics and finance ministers. The chancellor  - due in Washington last night  - will take part in today's meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries and Sunday's meeting of the IMF's policy-making interim committee. The results of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty are expected during the afternoon session of the interim committee meeting. The G7 meeting will bring Mr Lamont together with Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, for the first time since the two countries became embroiled in a bitter row over responsibility for the currency turmoil of the past week. It is likely that the chancellor will again express concern about the present state of German economic and monetary policy. In an interview on BBC radio yesterday Mr Lamont said he wanted 'to be satisfied that German policy, which has produced many of the tensions within the exchange rate mechanism, is actually going to have some changes and to be able to operate within a more stable environment'. UK Treasury officials say Mr Lamont remains especially concerned about Germany's policy mix, where large budget deficits are helping to keep interest rates at high levels. At the Bath meeting of EC economics and finance ministers two weeks ago the chancellor singled out the large-scale granting by Germany of subsidised credits to eastern Germany as an issue to be tackled by the Bonn government. He was also critical of the Bundesbank's policy of targeting M3, the broad money aggregate. Britain has argued that Germany's high interest rates are part of the difficulty of German M3 expanding at a rate far higher than the official target range of 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent. The British view, endorsed this week by the IMF in its World Economic Outlook report, is that Germany's high rates are contributing to M3's higher-than-targeted growth by causing investors to switch long-term funds into short-term bank deposits. The chancellor has also been concerned about the rapid growth of 'off budget' spending by the German public sector. The UK says that Germany's public-sector accounting practices give a flattering picture of the deficit because borrowing by bodies such as the Federal Post Office or the Treuhand agency in eastern Germany do not count as part of Germany's public-sector borrowing requirement. The Bath meeting saw the first serious outbreak of tension between Mr Lamont and Mr Schlesinger. It has been reported that Mr Waigel had to persuade Mr Schlesinger not to walk out after Mr Lamont demanded an immediate cut in German interest rates.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Tutorskaya, Izvestiya] </F>   [Text] A patient, Shabunov, without fixed place of abode  was brought to the resuscitation ward of Moscow's Third Clinical  Hospital in August. He was unconscious and virtually without  blood pressure. An examination revealed that he had El Tor  cholera.    Today, the patient is doing better. Out of the 20 people who  came in contact with him, only one nursing aide was infected.  One more person, a driver who is the subject of many rumors, is  healthy.    Altogether, there are 17 people infected with vibrio  comma carriers in Russia: in Dagestan, Nizhniy Novgorod,  Krasnodar, and Naberezhnyye Chelny. Among these, Dagestan and  Moscow have their ``own'' local infection. And the remaining  cases are related to infection being brought from India,  Pakistan, and Turkey.    One patient in Kaspiysk died because he sought medical help  too late. Vibrio comma was identified in a  four-month-old infant with the family name of Babatov--he is in  a republican hospital in Makhachkala.    Cholera is not a lethal illness if one seeks physician's  help  after first symptoms of intestinal disorder. Until the situation  normalizes fully (and August is the most dangerous month for  cholera), the physicians recommend that you do not drink  untreated water, especially from open reservoirs. The cholera  pathogen has been identified in open reservoir water even during  relatively safe years 1991-1992. Unwashed vegetable and fruit  are especially dangerous, and one should be mindful of personal  hygiene rules.    The State Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight took urgent  measures to ensure that all plague-fighting institutions are  brought into the state of readiness with respect to cholera.  Physicians do not expect that the disease will spread widely in  Russia. Foreign press agency reports about numerous cholera and  malaria patients in Russia (especially the latter--it is not  found) are erroneous.    Today, there are more than 100 patients in Tajikistan, and  several dozen people have died. A team of experts was dispatched  there.    There is yet another danger this summer--mushroom poisoning.  The causes of poisonings in Voronezh, Lipetsk, Tambov, and other  oblasts have been identified with absolute certainty. All fatal  outcomes are due to the fact that pale toadstools made their way  into food. This was determined with the help of the best  reagents and equipment, and there are no other causes. Starting  with July, 52 persons were poisoned in Voronezh oblast, and one  died. In Tambov oblast, it is 46 and 8, and in Lipetsk oblast,  23 and 4, respectively. In the mushroom samples studied from  these areas, pesticides and heavy metal salts were detected yet  these concentrations cannot cause acute poisoning.    Another factor is noteworthy: even a small piece of pale  toadstool in a common frying pan may result in poisoning several  people. Small children often put these mushrooms into a common  basket. The physicians have attempted to check the basket  contents of the mushroom hunters emerging from the forest. And  what did they find? A pale toadstool was found in one out of  eight baskets.    Recent studies here and abroad revealed that it is dangerous  to consume Paxillus involutus. It may lead to severe  allergies.</p>

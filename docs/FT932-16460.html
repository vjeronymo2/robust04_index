			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Consumer credit demand slips DEMAND FOR credit by consumers slackened in February, but remained above the depressed levels of last year, government figures released yesterday show. New borrowing through finance houses, building societies and certain bank credit cards rose a seasonally adjusted Pounds 49m in February, after a Pounds 151m rise in January. Extra borrowings - taking into account repayments and excluding mortgages and bank overdrafts - in the three months to the end of February totalled Pounds 305m, well above the Pounds 64m in the previous three months. The Central Statistical Office data reinforce recent indications of a muted recovery. This interpretation was supported by Bank of England figures on the M0 narrow measure of money supply and by the CSO's latest set of cyclical economic indicators. M0, which is mainly notes and coins in circulation, rose by a strong 4.9 per cent in the year to March, compared with a 4.5 per cent year-on-year rise in February. The longer-leading index compiled by the CSO, which is supposed to give advance warning of economic growth, registered 109.6 in February, after 108.9 in January. In February consumers showed less willingness to use bank credit cards to increase borrowings. They repaid a net Pounds 8m on cards which are part of the Visa or Mastercard systems, after borrowing Pounds 40m on these cards in January. In the three months to the end of February net repayments on cards came to Pounds 11m, after repayments of Pounds 63m in the previous three months. Total new consumer credit in February taken through cards, building societies and finance houses was Pounds 4.39bn, after Pounds 3.93bn in January. Between December and February new credit came to Pounds 12.95bn, up from Pounds 12.27bn in the previous three months. The CSO published revised estimates of the amount of credit borrowed in the last six months of last year that indicate demand for lending in the final quarter was higher than previously thought. Consumer loans through retailers, building societies, all types of credit cards and other credit agencies rose by Pounds 291m in the final quarter rather than the Pounds 153m initially estimated. The corresponding figure for the third quarter was Pounds 203m, after a Pounds 392m first estimate. Overseas institutions bought Pounds 1.031bn worth of gilts in February, the biggest monthly figure since June 1991, figures from the Bank of England show. Total gilt sales came to about Pounds 3.2bn in February.</p>

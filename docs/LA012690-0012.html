			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY'S NOT GUILTY VERDICT IN MCMARTIN PRE-SCHOOL CASE  </P> <P> Having observed the McMartin fiasco unfold firsthand and being familiar with  many of the parents, doctors and therapists in the case, I would like to add my  criticism to the retrospective you have been doing on the media's coverage of  the case.  </P> <P> In my opinion, one of the greatest problems with the media was their tunnel  vision after the case went to trial.  </P> <P> Lost in their myopia was the fact that hundreds of children who did not choose  to testify (many with definitive medical signs of sexual abuse) ultimately  disclosed/alleged they were abused at the preschool.  </P> <P> Because reporters focused almost entirely on the prosecution witnesses and the  therapists at the Children's Institute International (CII), the broader context  of the story was lost.  </P> <P> For example, it was not widely reported nor was it often reiterated that many  children who alleged abuse at the preschool did so to doctors and therapists  (some outside the state) with no connection whatsoever to CII. This, I would  think, was and is a very important part of a story where the "inexperienced and  poorly trained" therapists at CII are now being blamed for botching the case or  somehow conspiring to "program" the children they interviewed.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, in this and a number of other instances The Times and most other  media covering the story were "out chasing rabbits while the elephants got  away."  </P> <P> I wonder if you would be doing so much hand-wringing if they had been found  guilty?  </P> <P> BRAD SALES  </P> <P> Sierra Madre  </P></p>

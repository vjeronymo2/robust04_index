(``CBOE'' or ``Exchange``) submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  a proposal to amend paragraph (g)(1) of Exchange Rule 17.50, ``Imposition of Fines for Minor Rule Violations,'' to establish a separate fine schedule for position limit violations which occur in non-CBOE member customer accounts carried by CBOE member firms, including the accounts of non-member broker-dealers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 249.19b&hyph;4 (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33291 (December 6, 1993), 58 FR 65207. No comments were received on the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, paragraph (g)(1) of Exchange Rule 17.50 provides the following fine schedule for persons who violate the position limits established in CBOE Rule 4.11, ``Position Limits,'' and 24.4, ``Position Limits for Board-Based Index Options:'' (1) A letter of caution plus $1 per contract over 5% of the applicable limit for one to three position limit violations within one calendar year; (2) $1 per contract over the limit for four to six position limit violations within one calendar year; and (3) $5 per contract over the applicable limit for seven or more position limit violations within one calendar year. The CBOE proposes to amend paragraph (g)(1) to establish a separate fine schedule for position limit violations which occur in non-CBOE member customer accounts ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> accounts of customers who are not CBOE members) carried by CBOE member firms, including the accounts of non-member broker-dealers. The proposal will increase the number of cumulative infractions that may occur in non-member customer accounts before a fine is triggered. Specifically, under new subparagraph (a), the following fines, which will be imposed on CBOE member firms, will apply to position limit violations occurring in non-member customer accounts: (1) A letter of caution for position limit violations up to 5% in excess of the applicable limit plus $1 per contract above that level for one to six violations within one calendar year; (2) $1 per contract over the applicable limit for seven to 12 position limit violations within one calendar year; and (3) $5 per contract over the applicable limit for 13 or more position limit violations within one calendar year. In calculating the fine thresholds for each CBOE member, all non-member customer account position limit violations occurring within a single calendar year in all of the member's non-member customer accounts will be added together. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Exchange proposes to rephrase the current language of subparagraph (b) to indicate more clearly that a letter of caution is given for position limit violations of up to 5% of the applicable limit for one to three position limit violations occurring within a single calendar year, and that a fine of $1 per contract applies to violations exceeding that limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believes that the proposal accommodates key monitoring-related differences between non-member customer accounts and the accounts of members. The CBOE states that although CBOE members are well positioned generally to prevent, or to detect and promptly correct, position limit infractions in their own accounts or in accounts they carry for CBOE market makers, the CBOE and its member are positioned less effectively to monitor the aggregate trading commitments of non-CBOE broker-dealers or customers and to ensure the prompt correction of position limit violations by such persons. The CBOE states that factors such as customers trading through multiple firms, customers entering into Clearing Member Trade Assignment (``CMTA'') agreements, <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  firms having multiple registered representatives, and investment advisors managing several accounts make it more difficult as a practical matter for member firms to prevent, or to detect and correct, a position limit violation by a customer, including a broker-dealer ``customer,'' who is not a CBOE member. As a result, the CBOE believes that the fine tiers suitable with respect to CBOE members' own accounts can be inappropriately strict when applied to firms carrying a number of non-member customer accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The CMTA is a process offered by the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') which enables an OCC clearing member to have trades executed on its behalf on an exchange without holding exchange membership. In order to participate in this process, the OCC clearing member who has authorized an exchange member to execute trades on its behalf must file a CMTA agreement with the OCC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

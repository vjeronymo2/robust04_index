The source, however, did not give the reasons for the  shooting or the number of soldiers who took part in it. The  incident occurred in Ganta, 60 km east of Gbarnga, which in turn  lies 160 km northeast of Monrovia -- the headquarters for NPFL  leader Charles Taylor.    An informed source reported that the clashes were sparked by  a group of men who were demanding "allowances" in anticipation  of their future demobilization, as well as a "special bonus" for  Christmas. The same source further disclosed that Mr. Taylor  was planning on traveling to the scene but was dissuaded from  doing so by his close advisers.    Disarmament and demobilization of all armed Liberian  factions  could begin in mid-January.</p>

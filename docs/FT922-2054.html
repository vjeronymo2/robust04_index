			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copy-cat contract war breaks out in New York THE NEW York Commodity Exchange (Comex) has begun a copy-cat contract war with the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) in a drive to raise its trading volume. It has applied to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures industry regulator, to list platinum futures and options and palladium futures, products already traded at Nymex. 'These contracts will complement our existing metals products,' said Ms Donna Redel, Comex's new chairman. The exchange said that industry users had asked to have the contracts listed, in part because traders would benefit from being able to cross-margin platinum and palladium with its gold and silver contracts. It plans to launch the new products immediately after receiving CFTC approval. The move follows the news early this month that Comex intended to list a jet fuel futures contract that would compete with Nymex's heating oil futures, which are at present used to hedge jet fuel physical trading. Comex expects to make a formal application to the CFTC to list the contract before the end of 1992. Earlier this year, Comex won CFTC approval for a Dubai sour crude contract, although a sour crude contract began trading at Nymex in February. The contract for platinum - the more important of the two metals - to be listed at Comex will be for 50 ounces of 99.9 per cent purity, specifications that match the current Nymex contract. But Nymex, which has traded platinum since 1956, decided some 18 months ago that it would change its contract's specifications to correspond more closely to international standards, which now require 99.95 per cent purity. Nymex's October 1992 platinum contract, now holding 6,137 lots of 50 troy ounces in open interest, and those beyond that date are already for the new purity standard. Mr Lou Guttman, Nymex chairman, said: 'As an exchange, we have to do what international standards demand, or else our contract becomes antiquated'. He conceded that some in the industry might have been peeved at the change in contract specification, but he believed that his exchange's platinum contract would continue to enjoy deeper liquidity and that the trade would always go where the liquidity was. Mr Guttman predicted dismissively that Comex's new platinum futures 'will join the others on the shelf of failed contracts at Comex'. In recent years Comex has failed to extend its range of active contracts beyond copper, silver and gold. According to figures from the Futures Industry Association, trading on Comex fell 26 per cent between 1987 and 1991, from 17.9m lots to 12.6m, while trading at Nymex grew by 53 per cent, from 22.5m to 34.4m, over the same time period. Ms Redel, aggressively trying to achieve a turn-around in her exchange's fortunes, is casting a wide net for new products. She has even snagged a new financial future on the Eurotop 100, an equity index that trades at the European Options Exchange in Amsterdam. But in the process, Ms Redel seems to be willing to step deliberately on Nymex's toes. Ill-will permeates relations between the two exchanges. Their on-again-off-again merger talks failed once more last year and a decision early this year by Nymex to withdraw from a joint project with all of the New York exchanges, including Comex, to build a new trading floor embittered relations further.</p>

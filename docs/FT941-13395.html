			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Mirror trial delayed by settlement talks Trustees for the Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme were last night trying to agree an out-of-court deal with securities firms from which they are seeking Pounds 175m in allegedly misappropriated assets and damages. The funds are part of the more than Pounds 440m of pension assets which disappeared from schemes controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. The talks have delayed the start of a civil trial which was set to start in the High Court yesterday. Invesco MIM, Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management, Lehman Brothers International and Credit Suisse are named in the case. The individual position of each of the defendants was unclear last night. It is understood, however, that Lehman Brothers, which is separately the subject of a Pounds 77m writ from liquidators for Bishopsgate Investment Management, the Maxwell-owned fund management company, had been discussing a possible settlement in that case. Lehman Brothers, while insisting that it believes it has a strong case, has said it is only interested in a global settlement embracing all legal actions against it and involving all the financial institutions against whom the pension schemes have made claims. Sir Peter Walker, appointed by the government to mediate between the parties, is seeking a global settlement involving agreements between all the schemes and all the banks. Last night's talks were aimed at averting a trial expected to last six months and to cost several million pounds in legal fees. Both sides are anxious to avoid a trial because of the adverse publicity for the financial institutions and the fear of squandering scarce pension assets on legal fees. The trial is due to start today.</p>

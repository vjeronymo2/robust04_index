			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEBSTER STRIVES TO STAY COOL AS STANLEY CUP CHASE HEATS UP  </P> <P> Tom Webster and Terry Crisp, a study in contrast.  </P> <P> One is moving on in the Stanley Cup playoffs, while the other might be moving  out altogether.  </P> <P> Webster appears calm, almost studious on the bench, while Crisp is fiery,  emotional and loud.  </P> <P> Webster is the epitome of decorum in public; Crisp was embarrassed during the  series between the Kings and Calgary Flames by getting caught wiping his nose  with his necktie on television.  </P> <P> But don't be fooled. While Crisp may wear his emotions on his sleeve, Webster  feels as much pressure in this, his first Stanley Cup playoff as a coach.  </P> <P> Still recovering from inner-earsurgery, he has been advised to avoid stress,  but that's not possible this time of year.  </P> <P> Overtimes, double overtimes, games without Wayne Gretzky -- these are not  situations conducive to reducing stress.  </P> <P> So Webster sits on the bench and gulps down the antacid tablets stuffed into  his pocket by his wife, Carole.  </P> <P> But occasionally, the pressure boils over.  </P> <P> Such as last Friday.  </P> <P> The Kings were in their Culver City practice rink, finishing preparations for  Game 6 of the series against Calgary.  </P> <P> Webster was in a meeting with General Manager Rogie Vachon and assistant coach  Rick Wilson when he suddenly stormed out.  </P> <P> Vachon and Wilson later insisted they couldn't imagine what had precipitated  the incident.  </P> <P> Webster hurried past several club officials and reporters on his way to his  car, parked in an adjoining alley.  </P> <P> Two reporters approached the car, but Webster hit the gas and sped out onto  Sepulveda Boulevard and roared away.  </P> <P> Behind him, he left a number of shaking heads and dropped jaws.  </P> <P> When a reporter finally reached him that night, Webster was his usual calm  self.  </P> <P> "I just had a bad day," he explained. "I needed to let off a little steam. I  took a long walk and I'm fine."  </P> <P> These may be the best of times for the Kings, but not when you've got your  hands on the controls.  </P> <P> Webster's biggest source of stress all year has been the midseason trade that  brought Tony Granato and Tomas Sandstrom to the Kings from the New York Rangers  for Bernie Nicholls.  </P> <P> Nicholls has been on Webster ever since, blaming him for the trade and  questioning his knowledge of the game, his coaching techniques and his right to  make the move.  </P> <P> Webster has seethed, but refused to respond publicly.  </P> <P> Monday, after the Kings had eliminated the Flames in six games, Nicholls struck  again, telling The National newspaper, "What is surprising is that the Kings  could be coached into playing some defense."  </P> <P> When that remark was relayed to Webster, he replied, "They (Granato and  Sandstrom) certainly have added what we needed to beat Calgary, speed,  character and the willingness to do something for the team instead of worrying  about personal satisfaction."  </P> <P> While Webster must now worry about his future in the playoffs, Crisp must worry  about his future with the Flames.  </P> <P> Newspapers in Calgary were demanding his head even before the series ended.  </P> <P> He wasn't much more popular with some of his players, who felt he was a  martinet.  </P> <P> One, who asked that his name not be used, said before the series ended: "We  can't lose. We either win the Stanley Cup or we get rid of Crisp."  </P> <P> As he returned to Calgary, Crisp was still angry about the non-goal, the shot  by Doug Gilmour in the first overtime of Game 6 that appeared to edge its way  over the goal line before goalie Kelly Hrudey smothered it.  </P> <P> Referee Denis Morel disallowed the goal, the Kings finally winning in the  second overtime on Mike Krushelnyski's blind shot, fired as he lay on his  stomach in the slot.  </P> <P> Crisp, who almost knocked down the side boards as he yelled at Morel Saturday  night, was still fuming when he talked with a Calgary reporter on the flight  home.  </P> <P> "He's compounding a lie," Crisp said of Morel. "One lie leads to another. You  know the pattern. He told our guys, 'It didn't go over the line. There was no  whistle.' Now, he's backpedaling (claiming he did blow a whistle). I mean  that's a $700,000 call, at least.  </P> <P> "Mistakes I can accept. This isn't sour grapes. It's fact, point-blank,  obvious."  </P> <P> Crisp added that even Webster had backed him up.  </P> <P> "You know what Tommie Webster told me," Crisp said, "when we were shaking  hands. He said, 'Crispie, that goal was yours.' Looked me right in the eye and  said it."  </P> <P> When asked about the remark, Webster said he couldn't remember his exact words,  but wouldn't rule that out.  </P> <P> Said Crisp: "I could take this if, in my heart, I knew we'd lost. We won that  game. We should be heading back home, readying ourselves to play Game 7. He  (Morel) took it away from us."  </P> <P> Neither of the Kings' ailing defensemen, Tim Watters or Tom Laidlaw, are  expected to play in Wednesday's opener of the best-of-seven Smythe Division  finals.  </P> <P> Laidlaw, sidelined since March 17 because of an injured lower back, is listed  as very doubtful. Watters, sidelined since Game 4 of the series against Calgary  because of a severe ankle bruise, is doubtful.  </P> <P> Both John Tonelli (knee injury) and Dave Taylor (strained shoulder) are day to  day.  </P></p>

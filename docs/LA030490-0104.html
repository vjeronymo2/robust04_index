			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: STUDENTS PLANNING TO HEAD FOR EASTERN EUROPE  </P> <P> London's hot, China's not. And, like everyone else, young travelers are  expressing interest in exploring the newly opened countries of Eastern Europe.  Those are the major youth trends this summer, according to leading  international student travel bureaus.  </P> <P> Representatives of STA Travel (Student Travel Australia), which has 120 offices  worldwide, expect that attractive air fares will encourage student-style  travelers to use London as their gateway to Europe this summer.  </P> <P> Shop around and compare both prices and restrictions on air fares before  booking. It's often in your best interest to check directly with youth travel  bureaus. Because of high volume, the bureaus often are able to make especially  good arrangements to certain destinations. Sometimes these deals are not  advertised.  </P> <P> For those heading on to Eastern Europe, it may be hard to get up-to-date  information. To keep yourself informed, contact tourist information offices and  consulates (ask your travel agent for addresses), make inquiries at student  travel bureaus and network with other independent travelers. If you are  concerned about safety, inquire at your embassy for any travel advisories.  </P> <P> For example, the German National Tourist Office advises that "things are  changing daily." Travelers who want to make day-trips to East Berlin will find  that there are more crossing points than before and the visa process is faster.  The visas, which are issued at the border, cost 15 marks (about $9.50 U.S.).  </P> <P> It is no longer necessary to spend a minimum of 25 marks a day when you cross  to East Berlin.  </P> <P> Travel services affiliated with the International Youth Hostel Federation are  good sources of information. More than 3,000 internationally affiliated youth  hostels are in Eastern and Western Europe.  </P> <P> In mid-January the federation pulled together representatives of 15 European  associations for an urgent meeting to respond to developments. Their concern  was how to keep costs down for young Eastern Europeans traveling in the West,  and the further development of facilities -- plus the circulation of  information -- for travel in the East.  </P> <P> The federation produces a listing of all its hostel sites in Europe and the  Mediterranean, the "1990-91 Guide to Budget Accomodation Handbook" ($12.95),  which is sold at youth hostels worldwide.  </P> <P> For detailed background information, independent travelers may consider buying  a copy of the 667-page "Eastern Europe on a Shoestring" by David Stanley  ($14.95). Published for the first time last year, it's packed with information  and 195 maps.  </P> <P> Student-style travelers also will be able to find background information about  key centers in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland,  Romania, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, all of which are included in the 1990  edition of "Let's Go: Europe" (Harvard Student Agencies, $13.95).  </P> <P> Tour operators catering to the student and youth market also have been  introducing new Eastern European programs, or adding Eastern European stops to  established itineraries.  </P> <P> STI Travel, the Los Angeles-based company specializing in travel for 18- to  30-year-olds, has added stops in Prague, Berlin and Vienna to three of its  established tour routes.  </P> <P> The 16-day "Romantic" tour starts at $929 (air fare extra), and also visits  London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. The 21-day "Classic" tour starts at  $1,289, and adds stops in Salzburg, Venice, Florence and Rome. The 31-day  "Magic" tour starts at $1,963 and continues on to Sorrento, Capri and Athens,  the departure point for a four-night stay on Mykonos.  </P> <P> Details are covered in STI's 1990 "Europe Book."For copies, contact STI Inc.,  8619 Reseda Blvd., Suite 103, Northridge, Calif. 91324, toll-free (800)  525-0525.  </P></p>

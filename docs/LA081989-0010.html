			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WE'RE ONE BIG FAMILY IN THE CAMERA'S EYE  </P> <P> Almost from the day (150 years ago this week) Louis Daguerre introduced  photography to the world, our appetite for reproduced images has been fierce.  Today, our entire culture is dominated by the camera and its technological  offspring. The whole world reaches us in pictures -- color pictures in the  newspaper, moving pictures at the cinema, live ones on TV, insinuating ones on  billboards -- and we seem always to want more, more. Music itself, once content  to be lent an ear, now claims our eyes as well, as the pop music train is  pulled along by the locomotive of video.  </P> <P> One picture in particular seems to be enjoying not just a vogue these days but  an almost mystical popularity: the image of our planet seen clearly from space.  It's in the news, in our advertising and corporate logos, in our art and our  literature. Earth seen from space, the blue-green sphere neatly framed by the  screen, seems to capture our cares about ecology, our hopes for peace, our  pride in a planet that can send back pictures of itself from so far off.  </P> <P> There's almost a rhythm to the stages by which such imagery has overtaken our  culture, a 50-year beat of innovation. Photography began with the daguerreotype  150 years ago; moving pictures arrived 50 years later, TV broadcasting 50 years  after that. The global telecommunications network, the satellites and cables  that now form the planet's nervous system, bombards us nonstop with an  indigestible array of images, emotions, distant events.  </P> <P> The confluence of these anniversaries reminds us how much of what we call  culture is in fact the multiplication and miniaturization of images. We love to  multiply images of our world, and we love to miniaturize them; that's what our  photos do, that's what our novels, and our newspapers, our televisions and our  toys do.  </P> <P> Kids love little dolls and toy trains because they offer miniature worlds where  the child has control. We respond to the same charm, I think, in front of our  photo albums, our magazines, our ubiquitous screens. They all offer us  miniature reproductions, manageable re-creations, of the world around us that  lacks focus, lacks a frame.  </P> <P> To multiply our images of the world is almost a divine prerogative, when you  think about it. You create something new, so familiar (in your image!) and yet  so easily achieved, with each trip of the shutter. Perhaps, though, photography  and its continual reinventions are more reverent forms of behavior, as if, in  obedience to the Biblical injunction to Be fruitful and multiply, humanity had  responded not only biologically, but also with the printing press, the camera  and the screen.  </P> <P> One hundred and fifty years of being able to seize the world, yet leave it  alone; of being able to see the familiar afresh; of being able to see far off  in space and time. It's a mere century and a half that the images of loved ones  have gathered around us so abundantly, and that history -- current, living  history -- has been everyone's to witness. Surely the occasion, the smiling  anniversary of a French scenery- painter's inspiration, is worth a celebration,  worth remembering.  </P> <P> OK, now .. everybody say "Cheese!"  </P></p>

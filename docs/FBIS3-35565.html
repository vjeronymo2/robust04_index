Yesterday's dastardly attack by the Zionist  forces on the tomb of Abraham in the town of Hebron in occupied  Palestine, leading to the death or injury of around 400 fasting  worshipers, has grieved the world of Islam, awakened humanity's  conscience, and marginalized the world's other news and  developments.    We devote today's political commentary to analyzing the  various dimensions of that shocking and heart wrenching  incident. In our interviews with a number of specialists from  the News Research and Analysis Group, as well as Palestine's  Islamic Jihad representative in Tehran, we have reviewed  yesterday's heart rending incident.    To start with, we hear the details of the incident from  Brother Abu-Jihad, the representative of Palestine's Islamic  Jihad Movement in Tehran.    [Begin Abu-Jihad recording, in Arabic, with superimposed  Persian translation] The incident was one of the most heart  wrenching events in the entire history of Palestine and indeed  the history of mankind. In this heart wrenching atrocity, which  the Zionists committed with the cooperation and participation of  the Army of occupation, hundreds of worshipers were attacked in  the Abraham al-Khalil mosque, as they were staging the dawn  prayers. The large number of victims indicates that several  people were involved in the crime. While the Zionist regime has  blamed the crime on a mentally deranged medical doctor, remarks  made by the chairman of council of Zionist settlements in  defense of that criminal removed any doubt that may have existed  about the direct involvement of the Zionist regime in  yesterday's operations. Although the tomb of Abraham is  constantly controlled and guarded by 40 military personnel, only  three soldiers were present at the scene on the day of the  incident.    We are sorry that at a time when the blood of the Muslim  people of Palestine is being shed, some people claim that the  Zionist regime is pursuing peace. [end recording]    [Announcer] In order to exonerate itself from the  responsibility for this atrocity, the Zionist regime has claimed  that a mentally deranged person, or a few fanatical Zionists,  had perpetrated the atrocity.    In reference to this claim, Abu-Jihad says: We believe that  the Zionist regime is fully responsible for the crime. By  licensing the possession of arms and the reopening of military  barracks to train the Jews, the Zionist regime must shoulder the  blame for the hostile acts committed by its citizens.  Furthermore, the violent behavior of the Zionist regime toward  demonstrators, who had come out to condemn the incident, was yet  more proof of the Zionist regime's collusion with the criminals.    In its first reaction to the tragedy, the American  Government  announced that it hoped the incident would not effect the  process of compromise and negotiations between Israel and the  PLO. Ne'matzadeh, a specialist in the Middle East section of the  news research and analysis group, says:    [Begin Ne'matzadeh recording] In order to throw light on  Israel's objectives, one must analyze the political  circumstances at the time of the incident. Israel has so far  gained whatever it has been seeking to gain from the  Gaza-Jericho Accord, and has officially achieved whatever it  demanded from 'Arafat. It has gained political legitimacy,  international acceptance, transformation of its warmongering and  domineering image, influence over the Arab world, formal  domination over the occupied land of Palestine, control over  borders, roads, passes and Zionist settlements, and finally  domestic and international security. Israel, in other words, has  been able to make 'Arafat concede to all its demands.    It seems therefore, that the Zionist regime considered the  present juncture as an opportune time to show its real image to  the Palestinians in general, and the rejectionist camp in  particular. This violent image is in reality the true and  authentic face of the Zionist society; an image that in effect  serves to consolidate the foundations of the Zionist regime by  placing it in a position of strength vis-a-vis its opponents.    Moreover, Israel has specifically targeted the Islamists in  yesterday's attacks. This carries a message of serious threat;  a message that is backed by the West.

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): New game of horseshoes Lotus Engineering, the automotive consultancy division of Norfolk sports car maker Group Lotus, has been asked to apply its expertise in suspension development in a new field. Lotus engineers have been working with experts from the Animal Health Trust in Newmarket for the past two years to develop a new horseshoe to give racehorses a softer ride on firm ground. 'The drier summers and resulting harder racecourse surfaces are giving racehorses sore hooves, and trainers are unwilling to risk damaging their charges,' said Ken Sears, general manager of Research at Lotus Engineering. 'We've been asked to evaluate what can be done to put the spring back in their step by putting some controlled 'give' into racing shoes,' he says. Lotus: UK, 0953 608000.</p>

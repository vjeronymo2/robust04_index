He said "there is nothing new" in the proposals made by the  Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze in Washington. "The leaders  of Russia, Georgia and Abkhazia have already asked the UN to  send a peacekeeping force to the conflict zone. The question is  that Georgians would like to have them deployed along the Psou  River, while Abkhazians would like to have them along the Inguri  River. However, the UN is not hurrying to take a decision, he  said. "The opponents of giving the Russian troops the status of  a UN peacekeeping force insist that such a decision should be  preceded by certain progress in a political settlement of the  conflict," he noted.    The diplomat pointed out that Moscow continues to adhere to  another approach. "We think that the sooner the UN takes a  corresponding decision, the sooner the Georgian-Abkhazian  conflict is settled," he said.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICAL CENTER DOESN'T WANT TO SHARE NAME  </P> <P> San Gabriel Valley Medical Center has been in business for more than 30 years,  and officials at the 300-bed, private, nonprofit hospital in the city of San  Gabriel are not about to share its name.  </P> <P> So they were a little vexed last week when Los Angeles County officials  referred to a public hospital that has been proposed for Irwindale as . . . the  San Gabriel Valley Medical Center.  </P> <P> "Patients were confused when they read about it in the newspaper. They wanted  to know if we were moving," said Pamela Kouba, spokeswoman for the real San  Gabriel Valley Medical Center. She was referring to a report in The Times last  week about the county's hospital plans.  </P> <P> County officials apologized for the confusion -- saying they considered the  medical center name as merely "generic." And they promised, henceforward, to  call the public hospital proposed for Irwindale by another name.  </P> <P> East Valley Medical Center is one possibility.  </P> <P> "I don't think there is an East Valley Medical Center," said William Weitekamp,  project manager for the proposed county hospital. "I'll have to look it up."  </P> <P> Finding a name isn't the only tricky task in building a public hospital in the  San Gabriel Valley. Irwindale officials have expressed concern that the site  near the 605 Freeway that the county selected for the medical center is already  being developed as an industrial park.  </P> <P> Not to worry, county planners say: They are confident they can find a way to  acquire the industrial park, turn it into a hospital and give it a new name.  </P></p>

He says the agreement is not likely to be implemented given  further economic recession in Ukraine.    Derkach pointed to a lack of convincing arguments in  statements by the American and Russian leaders about security  guarantees and technical assistance to Ukraine. "The $175 Mn  aid to Ukraine the Americans promised a long time ago will be  used to pay U.S. experts," he said.    The dismantling and transfer of long-range missiles from  Ukraine to Russia will cost $3 Bn, according to the estimates  local experts made prior to the ratification of the Start I  agreement by Ukrainian deputies.</p>

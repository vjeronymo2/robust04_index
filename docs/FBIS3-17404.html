He called for political and economic support for the former  Soviet republic on the border of Afghanistan, where Russian  troops are engaged in regular battles against Tajik  fundamentalists who fled to Afghanistan after being forced from  power during a confused civil war.    "Tajikistan has always been a crossroads," Mr Samadov said.  "The West should follow closely what is happening, because all  the contradictions and challenges of Central Asia after  Communist rule are concentrated there. Unfortunately the world  no longer seems to care what is going on in Afghanistan.  Hundreds of thousands have been killed and the country ruined.  Doesn't it matter that this shouldn't spread to the whole  region?" Russian-backed secularists, including many former  Communists, are now in power in Dushanbe, but political  stability is not yet assured.    In May a referendum will decide whether the country opts for  a presidential system or gives greater power to parliament. Mr  Samadov said tension was rising as terrorists and extremists  were trying to destabilise the country before the election, with  the help of Afghan fighters. He defended the role of Russian  troops who, he said, had established firm control over the  border. "Russia is a force for stability in all Central Asia.  Tajik-Russian relations are good but they could be even better."    In January the country became the first former Soviet  republic to abandon its shaky currency, the Soviet rouble, and  switch to new Russian roubles. Its economy is now wholly under  the control of Russia's central bank, and Tajikistan, ruined by  three years of bloodshed and anarchy, is once again an outpost  of Russian influence.    Ironically, the pro-Moscow government now has the full  support of Washington and the West, although the authoritarian  regime and autocratic tendencies of President Rakhmonov are seen  as disturbing. The spread of Muslim fundamentalism, backed by  Afghan Mujahidin, is regarded as the greater danger. Baroness  Thatcher is among the Western politicians urging strong support  for the Dushanbe government backed by Western investment. "Her  political influence is big and her words are authoritative," Mr  Samadov said appreciatively.    Mr Samadov himself knows that only the West, rather than the  bankrupt Commonwealth of Independent States, can rescue his  economy. After four days in Britain and a quick trip to Germany,  he left for America yesterday. In each country he is assuring  businessmen that their investments would be protected and that  the government is committed to market reform.    The voting in May will be observed by delegations from  Russia  and the United Nations. Dushanbe is now trying to woo back  refugees from Afghanistan, having been warned by Washington that  the longer they stay in exile the more likely they are to return  as guerrillas. But fear still grips the valleys, where killings  during the civil war took up to 100,000 lives.</p>

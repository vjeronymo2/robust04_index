			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Brian Hansford in Phnom Penh] </F>   [Text] For Cambodian second prime minister Hun Sen, history  is everything.    He is optimistic about Cambodia's situation compared with  that in the 1980s when he was the communist state's prime  minister. But he is pessimistic about achieving a peaceful  agreement with the group he calls an "historical inheritance",  the Khmer Rouge, a group which begins another round of talks  with the government in Phnom Penh tomorrow.    "There is no hope. Not little hope but no hope," said Hun  Sen, referring to Wednesday's discussions.    "I'm almost fed up with talking to the Khmer Rouge. What I  am doing is in accordance with the king's wishes. At least we  would like to use the last chance for peace in Cambodia," he  said in an exclusive interview last week.    Hun Sen gave the same gloomy message before leaving for last  month's failed Cambodian peace talks in North Korea. The reason  for such pessimism is Khmer Rouge strategy.    "I have a document written by Pol Pot and received in late  March. The Khmer Rouge goal is to increase its armed forces to  25,000 in two years from May 1994 to May 1996 and step to the  stage of offensive," Hun Sen said.    Government information ministry spokesman Sieng La Presse  said the guerrillas were trying to recruit villagers in  Cambodia's north and west by offering money to volunteers and  their families.    Despite recent military setbacks by government troops,  particularly the rapid Khmer Rouge recapture of Pailin, Hun Sen  claims the guerrillas are very weak.    "After their non-participation in the (UNTAC) peace process  their strength has decreased equal to that of the 1970s," he  said, referring to the Khmer Rouge remnants who fled the  advancing Vietnamese army in 1979 after Hanoi's invasion toppled  Pol Pot.    Sources close to the Khmer Rouge acknowledge supply problems  but independent military analysts say the guerrillas can still  total 20,000 troops including militia, although regular troops  are estimated at 8,000.    But no matter its size, the Khmer Rouge remains active. The  way to beat it, according to Hun Sen, is with a mixture of  military stick and social progress.    "The powerful grenade which can destroy the guerrilla is  development of the economy and society.    "We will not stand on one foot. We will stand on both --  meaning we will not use the gun and abandon development or  develop our country and abandon the gun, but use both ways," he  said.    Using "both ways" has meant Cambodian leaders asking for  weapons. Foreign countries have responded cautiously to these  requests, fearing an escalating civil war as the arms are sold  to Khmer Rouge by corrupt, undisciplined Phnom Penh troops.    King Sihanouk described Cambodians as "champions of  corruption before he left Phnom Penh 1 month, but Hun Sen sees  corruption of government forces to a less extent.    "There is some corruption but not to the extent that all  military aid would be sold to the Khmer Rouge even though we  feel we have strengthen the discipline and efficiency of the  army," he said.    Foreign countries which refuse to supply weapons could help  in other ways, he said, hinting at military indiscipline  problems which King Sihanouk recently said were alienating  Cambodian villagers.    "Those countries who are concerned military aid will be sold  to the Khmer Rouge can help us set up military training schools  and also camps. The army does not have camps and stays in  people's house so it is very difficult to control it, Hun Sen  said.    He wants to throw the Khmer Rouge out of its Phnom Penh  compound which it maintains under Cambodia's 1991 peace  agreement. The government has already cut the guerrillas land  and mobile telephone lines and state officials have banned  guerrilla press conferences.    "I would like to outlaw them and force them to leave their  compound as long as they do not participate in society there is  no need to keep them as one political organisation," he said.    This will be debated by Cambodia's parliament at its next  sitting.    Reports of Hun Sen's wanting to formally outlaw the  guerrilla  group are not new in Phnom Penh. But somewhat surprising during  last week's interview was the Cambodian leader's conciliatory  remarks toward Thailand.    When the Khmer Rouge recaptured its Pailin base on April 18,  Cambodia's second prime minister accused Thailand of helping the  guerrillas and threatened to raise the issue at the United  Nations. Cambodia's First Prime Minister Prince Norodom  Ranariddh, and other Phnom Penh officials have repeatedly spoken  of Thai "interference". But last week Hun Sen was more  diplomatic.    "I suggest you should clearly quote my words. My concern is  that there might be a misunderstanding between Phnom Penh and  Bangkok. Thailand recognises only the royal government," the  premier said. "The border is long. There are bad men from  Thailand who hide themselves in Cambodia and there could be bad  men from Cambodia hiding in Thailand. The Khmer Rouge problem  is the aftermath of history," he said.    But for all Hun Sen's measured diplomacy the scale of the  illicit border trade in logs and gems between Thai companies and  the guerrillas remains a major worry.    The premier said country-to-country talks would always be  the  most effective way to solve Cambodia's border problems with all  its neighbours, not just Thailand.    But he does not object to America raising concerns, at the  ASEAN meeting in Bangkok in July, about alleged Thai support for  the Khmer Rouge.    "A bilateral solution is the basic solution. That does not  mean I oppose any talks by the foreign minister of America with  ASEAN. The 1991 peace agreement's third part mentions guarantees  of independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of  Cambodia," he said.    Hun Sen has changed his rhetoric of conflict with Thailand  into that of measured diplomacy. But there were no words of  conciliation for his former comrades, the Khmer Rouge, a group  he fled from in 1977 after almost 10 years in the revolution.    "I do not understand those who accuse me of being a  hardliner  toward the Khmer Rouge, I just raise the question of whether to  arrest the thief and imprison it or leave it to live with the  people," Hun Sen said.</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Hungarian funds suffer from Washington politics: A look at the background to congressional censure of an enterprise fund whose independence was seen to be excessive MR Jacques Attali can take comfort: he is not the only casualty of controversy surrounding assistance to eastern Europe. Accusations of excessive spending and wayward management have also dogged the Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund (HAEF), the Dollars 60m fund set up by the US government in 1989 to nourish Hungary's embryonic private sector. This week, after a long pursuit, the critics claimed the scalp of the HAEF's president, Mr Alexander Tomlinson, former chairman of US investment bank First Boston. Mr Tomlinson resigned on Monday citing 'political interference' and a freeze of allocations by the US Congress which had 'paralysed' the HAEF's operations. The resignation comes in the wake of a critical congressional review of the HAEF. The House Appropriations Committee declared in the June report it was 'outraged' at the activities of the HAEF and had 'lost confidence' in its leadership. The target of censure is the HAEF's investment of Dollars 4m in EurAmerica Capital Corporation and acquiescence in annual salaries of nearly Dollars 400,000 for the young executives heading up the Budapest-based merchant bank. Defenders of two funds say that their autonomy is the real issue and that EurAmerica has merely provided an excuse for Congressional overseers and the foreign aid bureaucracy to reassert their infringed authority. As the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development argued that marble hallways were standard for a bank headquarters, the HAEF holds that EurAmerica counts as a private business and must pay its managers the going rate for investment bankers. Mr Tomlinson maintained in his resignation letter that EurAmerica was moving into operating profit and that fees were covering the controversial salaries. But critics contend that compensation has been excessive and violates US government guidelines. Some also question the investment banking credentials of Mr Marc Holtzman, EurAmerica's president and managing director. Mr Holtzman's claim to fame is his earlier incarnation as self-styled 'mascot of the Reagan administration'. At 20, he ran Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign in his native Pennsylvania and ran as a Republican for the House of Representatives in 1986 as the youngest and best-funded congressional candidate. As the Reaganite tide ebbed, Mr Holtzman embarked on a business career in central-eastern Europe and last year he and two partners established EurAmerica. Mr Holtzman's talent for brokering connections, honed in US politics, has proved valuable in doing business in Hungary, where it is truer than usual that who you know counts as much as what you know. But the half-dozen US enterprise funds for eastern Europe are Bush administration creations and the top executives generally have a Republican background. This being the case with Mr Holtzman, the damaging if weakly founded suggestion has been prompted that political connections, rather than business expertise, helped him win the HAEF's backing. Whether or not the HAEF's investment in EurAmerica was good business, it is clear with hindsight that the decision invited political attack. 'EurAmerica really was a juicy target,' says one US diplomat, who says it provided a 'handle' for congressional attempts to limit the independence of the funds. The HAEF is no stranger to political accidents. Soon after its foundation it ran into flak for investing in businesses headed by prominent former communists. The HAEF's actions also contributed to the downfall last month of Mr Pal Teleki, the Hungarian-American chairman of Hungary's state holding company AV RT. Mr Teleki was weakened by revelations that he was receiving a hidden salary top-up of Dollars 130,000 from the HAEF. The HAEF and the Hungarian government justified the payments as the price of attracting Mr Teleki to head the AV RT when he would have been unable to meet commitments on his official salary. But the subsidy fuelled speculation that Mr Teleki might favour US investors and advisers in the privatisation of the AV RT's huge portfolio of state utilities, banks and industrial companies. It played to reviving public suspicion of a foreign takeover of the Hungarian economy. The HAEF's payments to Mr Teleki may have broken US rules on payments to officials of a foreign government. But above all, HAEF managers were said to have lacked 'political sensitivity'. The phrase runs like a thread through the affairs which have entangled the Hungarian fund. The supervisors of the two funds and the EBRD are trying to insure against a repetition of public relations errors. But the authorities have to be careful lest they inhibit risk-taking in investment decisions. 'There has to be a tolerance for mistakes,' says a US official. 'The funds ought to be innovative and ought to be making mistakes.'</p>

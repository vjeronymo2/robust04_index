			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian State Duma committee responsible for  relations with political groups and religious organizations  produced its bill on political parties at a news conference in  Moscow Friday.    Only those political parties would be regarded as national  whose membership exceeds 5000, which has local organizations  with memberships of at least 10 in at least one half of the  regions and republics incorporated into the Russian Federation  and which have gained at least 5 percent in parliamentary  elections.    Under the bill, parties would own land, buildings and  installations, houses, equipment and tools, printing houses, TV  and radio stations, money and other property.    The party's funds would be made up of entry and membership  fees, state subsidies, voluntary donations and proceeds of  publishing, educational and other activities. At the end of  every year the party would publish a financial report and a list  of its property items.    The political party would be able to pursue electoral  campaigns independently or in blocs with other parties. For the  duration of the campaign the blocs would have the rights and  duties of a political party. Should a party violate the  Constitution and legislation, it would be told by the  prosecutor's office to stop the illegal activities. A party  failing to comply would be suspended for a maximum of six months  by a court decision.    The parliamentary group in any legislative body made of  deputies of a political party that has ceased its activities  would be regarded as dissolved.</p>

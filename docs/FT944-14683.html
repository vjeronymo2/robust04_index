			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Krung Thai follows trend with 75% advance Krung Thai Bank, one of Thailand's largest banks, yesterday announced a 75 per cent rise in net profit to Bt2.36bn (Dollars 94.7m) in the third quarter from Bt1.35bn in the same period last year. For the first nine months, net profit was up 56 per cent to Bt6.16bn, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok. Thailand's banks, which have long enjoyed wide spreads between their lending and deposit rates, are in an exceptionally strong position because the central bank is attempting to curb inflation and is reluctant to allow lending rates to fall. Last week, Thai Farmers Bank said its third-quarter net profit rose 64 per cent to Bt2.74bn, up from Bt1.67bn a year earlier. Other banks are also expected to announce improved results. Stock market analysts believe the banking sector as a whole will increase net profit by more than 30 per cent this year. Krung Thai Bank also announced it would raise up to Bt3bn with an issue of long-term, unsecured debentures, and would raise its stakes in affiliated computer service and insurance companies.</p>

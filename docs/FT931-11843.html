			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Discreet force in fear of blue murder A consignment of blank certificates of deposit was stolen in 1990 while being delivered to a branch of the Banco di Spirito in Rome. Later this year, 20 people will be tried in Italy for their alleged parts in the theft and attempted fraudulent use of the 294 certificates which - had the crime succeeded - could have cost banks more than Pounds 200m. Between the theft and the arrests, detectives from the UK's smallest police force - the City of London - played a central role in bringing the 20 to trial. The accused are unlikely to learn the full story. Tracking down stolen negotiable securities and preventing fraud, as opposed to investigating it after it has taken place, involves police work of the most discreet nature. The 800-strong City force covers only the square mile and, while it has its share of routine duties, differs considerably from the rest of the police service. During 1991 it did not have a single murder, manslaughter or rape to investigate. By contrast, it handled nearly 600 fraud cases. One of the advantages for the City in having what amounts to a private police force is the ability it gives senior officers to allocate extensive resources to investigating and preventing financial irregularity. Members of the City Corporation see this as an important contribution to maintaining worldwide confidence in London as a financial centre, and fear it would be diluted in an amalgamation with the Metropolitan police force. Fraud, theft of securities and other attacks on the banking system occupy officers from the central detective unit and the company fraud department - which seconds staff to work with the Serious Fraud Office on the most complex cases. Because of London's size as a financial centre, securities stolen overseas are often presented in the City, drawing its police into a growing amount of international activity. Long fraud investigations are expensive as well as complicated. 'It is far more cost-effective if we can, as with the Italian case, recover stolen paper before fraudulent use is made of it, and catch people in the act,' says Detective Superintendent Daniel McCarthy, deputy head of the City CID. The Italian case took City detectives to Italy, Switzerland, Luxembourg, France and Belgium. It brought them into contact with a group of international criminals in the south of France specialising in financial crime in Switzerland - in the age of electronic communication, criminals need not set foot in the country where their crime is committed, complicating investigations and prosecutions. The case led to the discovery that money raised from the sale of the stolen certificates of deposit would probably have been used to finance a drugs operation. The official response to cross-border liaison includes international conferences and co-ordination through Interpol and other agencies. In practice, City detectives rely on contacts with trusted colleagues in other European forces in order to act swiftly and jointly. Growth in electronic trading will reduce the potential for theft of negotiable paper. But Det Super McCarthy believes it will mean a corresponding increase in computer fraud allied to the corruption of individuals within financial institutions. In 1991, the City force handled 105 new serious fraud cases which - excluding some exceptional investigations such as Maxwell and BCCI - involved attempts to obtain Pounds 946m. Of this, Pounds 936m was recovered or saved from attempted fraud. At a time when the government is pressing for value-for-money policing, these figures might seem likely to make the force the toast of the Home Office. But it is not so simple. Banks are reluctant to admit to the theft of documents, or accept that procedures for cancelling them are not fully effective, for fear that they might look less secure than competitors. This  -allied to the unavoidably undercover nature of the detectives' work - makes it difficult for them to boast of successes and compete for resources. And, if opinion polls are to be believed, the public would in any case sooner see resources devoted to reducing car radio thefts than thefts of certificates of deposit.</p>

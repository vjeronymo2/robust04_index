			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Atari loses court case against Nintendo A US federal court jury has rejected Atari allegations that Nintendo had attempted to monopolise the video game market illegally, Reuters reports. Atari had sought Dollars 160m in damages in the anti-trust suit. The jury returned its verdict on Friday. Mr Michael Khourie, a lawyer for Atari, said the jury ruled that while Nintendo did have monopoly power, it had not tried to monopolise the market illegally. 'The attempt to monopolise is a different offence than actual monopolisation.' The jury was unable to reach a decision on whether Nintendo had abused its monopoly position in the industry. Mr Khourie said this question could go to trial again. In its suit Atari alleged Nintendo had used its monopoly power to force independent software companies to agree to provide games exclusively to Nintendo.</p>

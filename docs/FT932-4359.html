			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: US pressure US selling pressure, after a weak opening on Wall Street, saw Glaxo dip 8 more to 583p and SmithKline lose 14 to 435p. Zeneca's Pounds 1.3bn rights issue looked increasingly under pressure as the day wore on, with overnight US selling the trigger for another difficult session in the stock. Zeneca 'old' opened a fraction better at 619p but early selling soon told and the stock retreated to end a net 5 1/2 lower at 612p, having dropped to within 9p of the 600p rights issue price at one point. Turnover in the 'old' was 6.5m, similar to that in the new 'nil-paid', which closed 5 lower at 14 1/2 p. A leading drugs analyst said that, given the US's sharply diminishing appetite for drug issues over the past year, 'the Zeneca issue could have been better timed; drug stocks are on long ratings and there is not much upside in sight'. Even ICI, whose shares have raced ahead from 608p since the Zeneca demerger became effective two weeks ago to touch 709p early yesterday, came under pressure, ending a volatile session unchanged on balance at 697p. However, traders were by no means downhearted over the Zeneca issue. 'There are still buyers of the shares and this could well be a great buying opportunity,' said one. Fisons' US launch of its Tilade anti-asthma drug, the success of which is seen by drug specialists as vital to the company's future, did nothing for the shares, which dropped 8 more to 149p, the lowest level for more than eight years, and ensuring the stock's departure from the FT-SE 100 list. Turnover in the stock was a substantial 8.7m shares.</p>

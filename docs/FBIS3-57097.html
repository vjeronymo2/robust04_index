			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 21 TASS -- The State Duma (lower  chamber of the Russian Parliament) adopted the temporary  regulations on working and living conditions of legislators at  its morning session on Friday [21 January].    According to the regulations, lawmakers enjoy the right to  be  received immediately by heads of government organisations. The  legislator's ID card is a document granting him the right to  pass freely to any body of state authority as well as any  enterprise, office or organisation.    Parliamentarians have the right to demand that violations of  laws, rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of citizens be  removed without delay.    The regulations also say that the lawmaker's monthly cash  remuneration includes a bonus for special nature and intensity  of work, a long-service bonus and other bonuses in compliance  with operating legislation. The lawmaker's monthy salary is  equal to that of a federal minister.    State Duma members struck out an item from the regulations  today, saying deputies who are members of the federal cabinet,  may receive their pay envelopes only at the lower chamber.    Legislators are entitled to medical and every-day services  enjoyed by cabinet members.    The regulations note that legislators enjoy the right of  free  travel by air, rail, road and water in Russia as well as by all  types of city passenger transport, except taxi. They also have  the right of obtaining travel documents without waiting.    Duma members in the city of Moscow and the Moscow region are  provided with office cars assigned to them permanently.    Lawmakers with no permanent residence in Moscow are provided  with flats for the term of their work at the Duma. However,  they cannot be privatised.    Pending the receipt of a service flat, the lawmaker is  provided with a separate hotel suite or, at the legislator's  wish, cash compensation necesary to conclude a contract for  hiring a living premise in the amount equivalent to the cost of  living at a two-room suite of a four-star hotel.    The legislator receives a diplomatic passport for the entire  term of his duties. The deputy is also granted an annual paid  leave of 48 workdays. He receives an allowance for medical  treatment amounting to two monthly salaries.    To perform their duties, parliamentarians are provided with  offices at the State Duma building as well as at constituencies  where they were elected.    The lawmaker may have up to five assistants. He  independently defines the number of his assistants and the size  of their remuneration within the wage fund for assistants.    The Duma also adopted a decision later in the day under  which  the Russian Government is instructed to take appropriate  measures to implement the regulations which come into force  today.</p>

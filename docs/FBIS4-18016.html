			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Svetlana Turyalay report: "The Unexpected -- Next. It </F> Turns Out That Moscow's Services Are Not Needed in Azerbaijan at  the Moment"]    [Text] Baku -- Deputies were plunged into shock by  Azerbaijan Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov's speech at the  National Assembly on the Russian plan for settling the  Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. The draft peace agreement contains  at least 18 articles which are unacceptable to Azerbaijan.  First, it is proposed that Baku completely renounce the right  to monitor the military potential of the former autonomous  republic and recognize the existence of the "armed forces of  Nagorno-Karabakh." It is proposed to give Azerbaijan's  Lechinskiy Rayon the status of a "corridor" under the full  control of the Armenian side, that is, to enshrine de jure what  has already existed de facto for two years now. According to  the plan the city of Shusha -- the historical and cultural  center of Nagorno-Karabakh -- remains under Armenian control.  The Armenian forces are to vacate the remaining occupied  territories but without monitoring by international observers.    According to the plan which has been proposed, Azerbaijan is  to lift the blockade on all communication routes leading into  Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh even while the negotiation process  is going on. But Russia is proposing that the main question --  on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, the cause of the six years of  bloody war between Armenia and Azerbaijan -- be resolved this  way: When the peace agreement is concluded so-called  international guarantees of the special ownership of this region  will be given, as happened in the case of Cyprus, Nakhichevan,  and the state of Kashmir.    The Azerbaijan Foreign Minister called the present  settlement  plan a plan designed to preserve the conflict because if the  military potential of Nagorno-Karabakh is maintained there is no  guarantee that hostilities will not resume. National Assembly  deputies were far harsher in their comments: This is the  capitulation of Azerbaijan. In this regard opposition deputies  and those deputies loyal to the authorities achieved a rare  unanimity: The Russian plan is not even worthy of discussion and  amendment. They instructed Gasan Gasanov to prepare an  alternative draft, which is to be presented to Russia and  Armenia.    Meanwhile, anti-Russian feelings have increased sharply in  Azerbaijan. Various parties have made a succession of  statements to the effect that they will take up arms against the  Russian Army if the latter is brought into Azerbaijan even in  the capacity of peacemakers. And the Islamic Party has flatly  stated that it will declare a jihad (holy war) against the  Russian authorities.</p>

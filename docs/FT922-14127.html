			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Business election fears grow: Executives say Labour win would hit pound and force interest rise AN OVERWHELMING majority of Britain's business leaders believe Mr Neil Kinnock will be forced to put up interest rates to support a weakening pound if Labour wins tomorrow's general election. An FT-Mori poll of senior executives carried out at the start of this week suggests that Mr John Smith's shadow Budget has done nothing to assuage the anxieties of most companies about Labour's economic strategy. More than a third expected their companies' investment spending in Britain to fall if Mr Kinnock becomes prime minister. The survey, conducted among directors of the FT's top 500 companies in the UK, suggests that businessmen are more worried now than at the beginning of the campaign about the implications of a Labour victory. The survey, coinciding with two national opinion polls suggesting that Mr Kinnock remains set to emerge as the leader of the largest party in a hung parliament, also reveals the business community's deep concern about the impact on confidence of a hung parliament. Its conclusions followed a strong warning by Mr John Major that a Conservative victory was a precondition for the economic recovery now in sight. Senior ministers said Mr Major was resting his hopes - defying the opinion polls - on a last-minute surge in public concern about Labour's tax and economic policies. But Mr Smith, setting out Labour's plans for new incentives for training and investment as part of a national recovery programme, warned that a re-elected Conservative government would turn recession into slump. Ninety-six per cent of the executives polled believed interest rates would rise, while 83 per cent said that Mr Kinnock's entrance to Downing Street would herald a fall in the pound. That compares with the 76 per cent who predicted higher interest rates and the 75 per cent who foresaw a falling pound in the first wave of the FT-Mori survey on March 11 and 12, before Mr Smith unveiled his tax package. The executives' anxieties, however, were not shared on foreign exchange markets, where sterling yesterday made some ground on the D-Mark as investors appeared to take a more sanguine view of a Conservative defeat. Investors switched money into sterling on calculations that a Labour administration or a hung parliament was unlikely to lead to large-scale selling of the pound. Of executives responding, 38 per cent said their planned investment in Britain would fall under a Labour government, against 26 per cent making that prediction in the first survey. Almost all the executives - 94 per cent of those willing to give a voting intention - intend to back the Conservatives, 45 per cent citing Mr Smith's plans to raise tax bills of the higher paid as a significant factor. Before Labour unveiled its proposals for a 50p top rate of income tax and abolition of the ceiling on National Insurance Contributions, only 27 per cent cited personal taxation as a key issue. Some 22 per cent said Labour's higher tax rates would mean they were likely to work less hard, and 48 per cent thought Mr Smith's tax package would reduce work incentives for their middle management. The poll underlines growing concern in the business community about the implications of an inconclusive result. Some 88 per cent say that a hung parliament would be bad for the country and 80 per cent are concerned that it would damage their business.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In its "With The Events" column, AL-BA'TH discusses  Israel's savage attacks against southern Lebanon. The paper  says: Israel aims to promote despair among the Lebanese over the  futility of the legitimate means pursued by Lebanon to end the  Israeli occupation, and, consequently, push it to submit to the  Israeli conditions.    The paper adds: Israel is used to applying such pressures  every time it finds itself encircled by an international move to  pay the dues of peace; that is, withdrawing from the occupied  Arab territories in accordance with the resolutions of  international legitimacy and the laws of the world community.  But every time it retreats in failure and disappointment  because of the Lebanese national resistance.    AL-BA'TH notes that if Israel managed to deal separately  with  a certain Arab party, it will not be able to achieve what it  wants with Lebanon, especially since Lebanon is fortified, both  in its internal front and by its special brotherly ties with  Syria which are based on coordination and cooperation in all  fields.    In its editorial today, TISHRIN discusses Israel's  aggressive  acts, which have become a daily and permanent practice in  southern Lebanon. TISHRIN stresses that the real and natural  response to the Israeli escalation is represented by a growth in  the Lebanese national resistance and continuation of its  struggle against occupation.    The paper says the rallying of all Lebanese people, with all  their sects and constitutional, official, and popular  institutions, around the Lebanese national resistance to support  it and strengthen its legitimate role, is, undoubtedly, a  positive phenomenon. This resistance, which defends Lebanon and  the people, is based on a national and pan-Arab determination to  confront Israeli arrogance with all courage and resolve to  regain the usurped Lebanese territory in the South.    The paper notes that Israel's repeated provocative acts have  made Lebanon a cohesive front against the Israeli attacks and  against the policy of terrorism and bombardment.    The paper says: All signs indicate that Israel is facing a  political defeat on the Lebanese front. It manifests this  defeat through bombardment, continued aggression, and  exacerbating the situation.    Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN stresses that Lebanon's  cohesion and standing as a cohesive, united front behind the  resistance and against the Israeli aggression are supported by  all Arabs. Syria will support Lebanon and its just causes and  defend its march toward peace and reconciliation. It will also  continue to stick to its right to regain its territory,  implement Resolution 425, and end the occupation of southern  Lebanon, the Golan Heights, and the occupied Arab territories.</p>

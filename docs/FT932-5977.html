			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / The Week Ahead BOOTS, the retailing and pharmaceutical group, hopes final results out on Thursday will dispel City worries about its prospects, provoked by recent price battles with Superdrug. Boots shares have underperformed the stores sector by 25 per cent since January. Pre-tax profits are forecast to increase by up to 14 per cent, from Pounds 359.5m to between Pounds 400m and Pounds 410m. The market expects most of the improvement to come from Boots the Chemist, where operating profits are likely to be up almost Pounds 40m at Pounds 285m. Several large property companies recently raised new funds to lower gearing, so the question over MEPC's interim results on Thursday is whether the UK's second largest will follow suit. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of around Pounds 47m for the half-year to March, compared with Pounds 58.6m a year ago, reflecting a decline in capitalised interest as the development programme comes to an end. Recovery in the US remains uneven and the market will be watching the tone of Siebe's statement on activity over the pond where it is heavily exposed. The statement is due out with final results tomorrow. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 181m, against Pounds 169.6m a year ago. They are looking for a small drop in gearing at 69 per cent for the six months to September through cash-flow. Today, Westland, the helicopter group, is expected to announce half-year results with pre-tax profits of around Pounds 11.5m, 10 to 11 per cent up on the previous period. This quiet improvement reflects slack production work on new helicopters, and while upgrade orders have helped fill the delivery gap, the group's aerospace division shows the effects of the cyclical downturn in the civil aircraft sector. The company is expected to hold its interim dividend, with a possible increase on the 1.25p paid at the same stage last year. On Friday, Dunhill, the luxury branded goods company, is expected to announce pre-tax profits for the year to March down at about Pounds 72.2m compared with Pounds 76m a year ago. The market will be scrutinising the company's interest receipts, expected to show the recent cuts in UK base rates. The company is expected to raise its dividend to 8.1p compared with 7.7p in the previous period.

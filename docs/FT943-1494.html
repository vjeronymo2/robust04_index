			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: LVMH posts 36% rise in net income LVMH, one of the world's largest luxury goods companies, yesterday confirmed a sharp increase in first-half profits, recording a 36 per cent rise in net income to FFr1.27bn (Dollars 240m). Including an exceptional gain from January's acquisition by Guinness of the UK of a 34 per cent stake in Moet Hennessy, net income was FFr4.75bn. Sales rose from FFr10.04bn to FFr12bn. The French company, which forecast the rise in profits earlier this month, said the result reflected improved sales and profits across its divisions. The Champagne and wines division increased income from FFr86m to FFr118m and the cognac and spirits division raised earnings from FFr781m to FFr912m. Income from luggage and leather goods rose from FFr968m to FFr1.39bn, while perfumes and beauty products increased earnings from FFr326m to FFr352m. LVMH said the latter increase reflected the success of recent product launches. The rise in champagne and wine earnings was attributable to the impact of lower grape prices and production costs and stronger demand, while a rebound in Japanese sales was cited as the principal reason for improvement in the cognac and spirits operations.</p>

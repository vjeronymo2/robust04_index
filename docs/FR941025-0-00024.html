			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ATA, on behalf of one of its members, requests that paragraphs (a) and (d) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal be revised to provide an option for operators to lock out a thrust reverser that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fails the tests required by those paragraphs in order to avoid unnecessary flight delays and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancellations. The commenter states that the Boeing 737 Master Minimum Equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> List (MMEL) presently grants this relief, provided that the thrust reverser in question is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly locked out.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA concurs partially. The FAA agrees that an option for dispatch relief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be allowed in accordance with the existing provisions and limitations specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the MMEL. Paragraph (a) of the final rule has been revised accordingly. However, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes on which a sync-lock is installed, the FAA, in conjunction with the Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 757/767 Thrust Reverser Working Group, finds that a thrust reverser may be locked out,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but the sync-lock must be operational at all times in order to ensure safe flight. Paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) of the final rule has been revised accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA also has revised paragraph (a) of the final rule to specify that only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes on which the sync-lock installation, the sync-lock wiring modification, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Production Revision Record (PRR) 35105 has not been accomplished are subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of that paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters suggest that the work hour estimates for accomplishment of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments and tests [specified in paragraph (a) of the proposal] and operational tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [specified in paragraph (d) of the proposal] be increased. One commenter states that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate of 2 work hours is more realistic for accomplishment of the adjustments and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests. The second commenter states that the operational tests would actually take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 2.5 work hours. The FAA does not concur. The information provided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the manufacturer to the FAA indicates that the adjustments/tests and the operational tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each take approximately one hour to accomplish. The FAA established its work hour  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate based on that information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATA requests that the FAA coordinate with Boeing a revision to the service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bulletin to incorporate a change for routing certain wiring, since one ATA member had to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deviate from the service bulletin instructions to route certain wire bundles. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter does not specify the service bulletin it recommends be revised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has coordinated with Boeing all requests from operators concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wire bundle routing, and has ensured that any necessary changes to service bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions have been incorporated in subsequent revisions to the service bulletins cited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this final rule. A summary of service bulletin revisions reviewed and approved by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA since the issuance of the proposed rule follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Boeing Service Bulletin 737&hyph;78&hyph;1053, Revision 2, dated February 17, 1994,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Revision 3, dated June 30, 1994: Revision 2 of the service bulletin adds notes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explaining that certain wire bundles were installed in production on some of the affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes, that installation of these wire bundles is not necessary for those airplanes, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that wire bundle W084 is necessary on only some of the affected airplanes. Certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised drawings also are included in Revision 2, one subkit number is corrected, a list of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fasteners is added, and procedures for installation of splices is added.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revision 3 of the service bulletin provides procedures for replacement of different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aluminum foil markers on a particular circuit breaker panel on some airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) of the final rule has been revised to reflect Revisions 2 and 3 of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service bulletin as additional sources of service information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Boeing Service Bulletin 737&hyph;78&hyph;1058, Revision 1, dated February 17, 1994,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Revision 2, dated July 7, 1994: Revision 1 of the service bulletin includes a list of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fasteners and provides procedures for removal of two panels for access to the J20 box  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assembly and related wiring. That revision also provides improved procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removal of the thrust reverser manual drive units and installation of the sync-locks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, May 15 (XINHUA) -- The tertiary industry has  become a new hot spot for foreign investors in Fuzhou, capital  of east China's Fujian Province.    According to local officials, more and more overseas  investors have invested or intending to invest in research and  development, consultancy services, warehousing and storaging,  commerce and catering trade.    The city approved the establishment of 898 foreign funded  enterprises in 1993, with the total investment reaching about  2.67 billion U.S. dollars.    Of the newly-registered enterprises, there are four projects  whose investment exceeds 100 million U.S. dollars each and 78  projects whose investment exceeds 10 million U.S. dollars each.    The confidence of overseas businessmen has been enhanced and  most of them have extended the term of their investment in the  city. In the past, the term of cooperation for overseas-funded  enterprises is usually from 10 to 15 years, but last year the  term was extended to 20-50 years.    Fuzhou's economic and technological development zone, free  trade zone, overseas-Chinese economic development zone, Fuxing  Investment District and high-technology parks have become the  major bases for overseas investment.    Now overseas-funded enterprises have become pillar  enterprises in the textile and garment, shoe-making, motorcycle  and foodstuff trades in Fuzhou City.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The secretary general of the Organization of African  Unity, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, said in Maseru yesterday that he  is satisfied that the situation in Lesotho had returned to  normalcy following the recent crisis caused by rivalry between  two warring factions in the Royal Lesotho Defense Force.    Speaking at a press conference at the end of his two-day  visit to Lesotho, Dr. Salim said stability was important not  only for Lesotho, but for the rest of the continent. He said he  had studied a report by the special envoy of the OAU secretary  general to South Africa, Ambassador Legwaila Legwaila of  Botswana, whom he sent to Lesotho after the crisis to assess the  situation.    The government had embarked on a consultation process which  was continuing to bring the two former rival groups in the army  together. The demands of the army were being formulated by a  20-man strong unit and discussed by a committee of four  principal secretaries, namely of foreign affairs, defense,  finance and home affairs. [Lesotho Foreign Affairs Minister]  Mr. Qhobela said the army demands would be sifted by the  committee and submitted in a final report to the minister of  defense. Dr. Salim and his entourage left Lesotho yesterday.</p>

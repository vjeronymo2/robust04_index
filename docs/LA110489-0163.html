			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> FEISTY 'SOCIAL SECURITY' IS LOADED WITH GAGS, LESSON ON LOVE'S MAGIC  </P> <P> Andrew Bergman, the author of "Social Security," which opened at the Moulton  Playhouse on Thursday, is a veteran screenwriter known for the big laugh. His  scripts include "Blazing Saddles" and "The In-Laws" -- not bad credentials for  a funny man, especially if you like it broad.  </P> <P> And those who do probably won't be disappointed by "Social Security." It's  loaded with gags, at least a handful a minute, most of them as subtle as a poke  to the ribs.  </P> <P> The jokes surrounding art world upper-crusters David and Barbara Kahn and their  skirmishes with her sister, Trudy Heyman, and her dopey accountant husband,  Martin, are pretty sitcomish, built more around silly situations than anything  else. The primary situation is the arrival of Barbara's and Trudy's mother, who  has been dumped on the Kahns when the Heymans find themselves in a family  crisis involving their sexually adventuresome daughter.  </P> <P> The Kahns (Kathleen Collins and Jerry Evans), own a trendy Manhattan gallery;  the Heymans (Marcie Ross and Bruce T. Campbell) live on Long Island and don't  know anything about art. They get on each other's nerves. They put each other  down a lot. They crack wise. Then Mom (Pati Tambellini) comes along and oy vay!  </P> <P> Mom comes on like Jaws but turns into quite a charmer when a famous artist  starts courting her. Bergman, in a fairly graceless but sweet way, delivers a  gentle comment on how love and magic can enter our lives even when everybody  else thinks we're a step from the mortuary.  </P> <P> The rest of the comedy isn't quite as sweet-spirited. "Social Security" can get  a little feisty, as with its ongoing zinger at rich people who worship fine  art, believing it to be emblematic of social standing. It's a good target --  all that pretentiousness and superficial thinking deserves a kick in the shins  -- but it gets weary, old-hat, after a while.  </P> <P> The crowd pleasers in director Beth Hansen's cast have to be Tambellini and  Collins. Tambellini plays it fairly restrained, even when she's creating havoc  for the Kahns, and she serves the role well. Her transition from dud to duchess  is smooth; not funny, but easy to accept.  </P> <P> Collins, on the other hand, is all effect and antics. Her Barbara is a nervous,  neurotic New York mess -- the comedy comes from watching her get overwhelmed by  every little thing. But there's not much character development.  </P> <P> Evans, who approaches David as the quintessence of glib, and Campbell, with his  completely up-tight Martin, do their jobs as comic foils. In a small role as  the old artist wooing Mom, David Paul brings in some class.  </P> <P> The set is supposed to give us an idea of just how successful and important the  Kahns are, but Gil Morales' creation is not convincing. The look is more  medium-cost hodgepodge (would a wealthy couple use what look like clear plastic  end tables?) than expensive chic. And the "beautiful" canvas of Mom, painted by  her "genius" suitor and supposedly a telling symbol of her new life, is without  style.  </P> <P> 'SOCIAL SECURITY'  </P> <P> A Laguna Playhouse production of Andrew Bergman's comedy.

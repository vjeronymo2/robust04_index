			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (9): Showing potential - Germany IT SPEAKS volumes for the nature of the German buy-out market that when LBO France opened up a German operation earlier this year, it decided it had to change its name. 'The problem is that the term LBO means something evil in the German market,' says Mr Eberhard Crain, managing director of Vector Beteiligungsberatung, as LBO France's new German operation is called. 'Anything to do with leverage provokes images of unfriendly asset stripping.' German businessmen are averse to financial innovation. The very idea of selling a business, let alone selling a business to a financial buyer, is often an anathema. Perceptions are not helped by the fact that the first large buy-out in Germany - that of Lignotock in 1989 - went wrong after the vendor fled Germany amid allegations of fraud. In spite of these obstacles the potential market for buy-out finance in Germany is huge - if only because at present it is relatively underdeveloped. Mr Max Romer, chief executive of CWB Capital Partners in Frankfurt calculates that there are 70 or 80 institutions pursuing venture capital business in Germany, and that over the past decade the market has grown sixfold to DM4bn. This compares to a market size of DM6.5bn in France, DM17bn in the UK and DM65bn in the US. Of the total invested in Germany, he says that MBO finance accounts for a relatively modest DM620m-DM630m. While the bulk of the DM4bn financing is start-up or expansion capital, he says about a dozen firms are concentrating on the buy-out segment of the market, where risks and returns are high - and the prospects for growth better than in mainstream venture capital. The first oft-cited cause for optimism is the so-called 'succession problem' in the 'Mittelstand', or mid-sized companies. These family-owned companies, which play a central role in the western German economy, were often built up after the war and have now reached the point where the first two post-war generations of family-managers have retired or are approaching retirement. Earlier this year a study produced by the German arm of 3i, the UK venture capitalist house, argued that third generation inheritors often lose interest in managing the business. Mr Romer thinks 700,000 companies out of the total of 2.3m companies in Germany will have problems with succession during the course of the next decade. Mr Frederich Graf von der Groeben, chief executive of Schroders &amp; Partner, the German arm of Schroder Ventures, says that in addition to the succession problem there are pressing industrial reasons why owners of medium-sized companies will make increasing use of buy-out finance. He argues that many Mittelstand are simply too small to preserve their independence and that they need to merge to achieve economies of scale in increasingly competitive world markets. Buy-out specialists can act as a catalyst to this needed rationalisation. Another cause for optimism is that most of Germany's biggest companies are conglomerates which owe their shape to chance rather than coherent strategy, and in the long term it is likely that they will start thinning out their portfolios. This is another potential buy-out market, as companies may prefer to sell to management and employees rather than to an unknown third party. (However, at present, it is often seen as a mark of corporate weakness to sell a subsidiary, however marginal the business in relation to the group's core activities.) The slow-down in the German economy may act as a catalyst to such sales. But, says Mr von der Groeben, its main effect so far has been to slow down the already slow process of putting together transactions, introducing additional pricing and financing complications. 'You can't make a quick buck in this market.' he says, 'You need patience, continuity and solid financing.'</p>

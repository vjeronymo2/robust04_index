			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Christmas Food and Drink: Independents offer most excitement  -Jancis Robinson selects wines that are a class apart from the supermarket norm ON TWO Saturdays near Christmas, I will devote this column to the better last-minute wine buys from the supermarkets and the high street chains. But, in many cases, I will do so with a heavy heart. It is the independent wine merchant which is most in need of a sales boost derived from column inches - and yet inconveniently, with name, address and telephone number, it takes up so many more of them than the simple word 'Tesco' or 'Sainsbury'. Pure price comparisons rarely flatter the independent, yet in terms of wine excitement per penny, the better independents often win hands down. Here are some wines I have particularly enjoyed over the last few weeks. Their individuality sets them aside from what is all too often the anodyne supermarket norm, selected not because they art too good to miss but to sell at a certain price. The following are mostly red, mainly because so many whites taste the same nowadays: Domaine d'Escausses 1991, Gaillac, Denis and Marc Balaran, Pounds 4.99, Madeleine Trehearne, 20 New End Square, London NW3. (Tel: 071-435-6310). Imported from the Trehearnes' neighbours in France, the worst possible recommendation one would have thought, and yet this was one of my favourite cheaper wines this autumn - plummy yet complex and very well made from a typically Gaillac blend of local grape varieties. A gold medal winner in Paris and Toulouse. For drinking now (unlike its oaked white counterpart). Syrah 1990 Domaine Fadeze, Pounds 5.25, Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester. (0206-764446). A distinctly superior oak-aged Vin de Pays from the Languedoc that held its own when compared with a Crozes-Hermitage from one of the best producers at nearly twice the price. For current drinking. Malvoisie, 1990, Jacques Guindon. Pounds 5.45 Yapp Bros, Mere, Wiltshire. (0747-860423). A real oddity from the Loire - scented, rich to the point of sweetness but with lovely acid and concentration. A truly interesting aperitif. Dr Loosen Riesling, 1991. Around Pounds 6 from: David Alexander of Maidenhead (0628-30295); Hampton Wine of Thame (0844-213251); Bottleneck of Broadstairs (0843-861095); the Hazlemere Cellar (0843-861095); Philip Eyres of Amersham (0494-433823), David Alexander of Maidenhead (0628-302950); and, soon, the Wine House of Wallington (081-669-6661) - see what I mean about space. A consistently lively Mosel demonstrating the usefully open character of this vintage in Germany. Cape Mentelle's stunning Australian reds, especially Zinfandel at Pounds 8.95 and Cabernet Sauvignon at Pounds 10.60 from Adnams of Southwold (0502-724222). The West Australian mother operation of Cloudy Bay, New Zealand's famous Sauvignon Blanc, is even better at making red wines to my mind, and outclasses most Californians with its delightfully accessible Zinfandel grape. The 1990 Cabernet impressed some fastidious French palates recently, but both 1989 and 1990 were excellent vintages. Ch Roc de Cambes, 1991, Pounds 75 a dozen, ex-cellars from Windrush Wines of Cirencester and 1990, Pounds 11.63 a bottle, from Corney &amp; Barrow, London EC1. This is Cotes de Bourg as you have never known it. Made by the passionately meticulous Francois Mitjavile of St-Emilion Ch Le Tertre Roteboeuf, Roc de Cambes provides the opportunity to drink exceptionally well-made claret at non classed-growth prices. The 1989 was ridiculously cheap and is already drinking beautifully. Roc des Cambes is unfortunately no longer a well-kept secret and prices have risen, but it was one of the few properties unscathed by the 1991 frost. Ch La Mission Haut-Brion 1987. Pounds 144 for 12 bottles or Pounds 149 for six magnums from Layton's of London NW1 (071-388-5081) or Andre Simon shops of London W1 and SW1. This large independent has Pounds 3m worth of fine wine to sell and La Mission 1987 is one of the best priced. One of the most concentrated 1987's, to savour now and throughout the decade. Domaine Leroy 1990 burgundies from Farr Vintners of London SW1. (071-828-1960) Quick] Buy some of its tiny allocation of quite sensational classics (at classic prices) before US wine guru Robert Parker raves about them. He has already scored those from the Cote de Nuits from 90 to 100 out of 100 so they sold out in a trice, but some from the Cote de Beaune remain out of the clutches of those who buy numbers not flavours - until the next issue of Parker's newsletter in December, that is. The Wine Society Champagne, Pounds 150 a dozen, and Fino, Pounds 4.75 a bottle from The Wine Society of Stevenage (0438-741177). This special offer will hold until January and gives members Pounds 4 off a well-matured bottle of champagne, non-vintage but based on the 1988 cuvee, from the delightfully traditional house of Alfred Gratien. The case price works out at Pounds 12.50 a bottle - a bargain for those who like the idea of drinking Bollinger-like champagne at an own-brand price. The Wine Society also boasts probably the finest range of sherries in the UK. Its Fino really is fresh, and tangily dry without being a wine for specialists only. In the same week I was told by Tesco that any wine priced at more than Pounds 3.99 a bottle was a struggle to sell, Fortnum &amp; Mason's wine buyer introduced me to its 'house Pauillac', the delicious second wine of top bordeaux Chateau Pichon Lalande 1989, no less, which is selling pretty well in Piccadilly at Pounds 14.50. Meanwhile, Morris &amp; Verdin, the London SW1 fine wine importers which I reported on a month ago, concerning currency-enforced repricing, enjoyed record business last month. Perhaps some people are beginning to realise that the independent wine merchant is a breed that deserves our attention.</p>

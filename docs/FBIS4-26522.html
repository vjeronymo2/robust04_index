			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanchang, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Arable land protection  areas, to ensure the success of intensive farming, stable output  and freedom from drought and waterlogging, have been set up in  Jiangxi province.    The per capita arable land in this major grain-producing  region averages 0.97 mu (one mu equals 0.065 ha) in Jiangxi.  And the figure is decreasing along with industrialization,  urbanization and population growth. The shortage of arable land  is becoming an increasing obstacle to the development of  agriculture and the economy as a whole.    Land in the protection areas can only be used for planting,  and no house building, soil removal or brick making are allowed.  Also banned are the digging of fish-raising pools or graves and  tree planting.    With the setting up of arable land protection areas farmers  no longer worry about their land being "confiscated". This  gives them confidence to throw themselves wholeheartedly into  farming.</p>

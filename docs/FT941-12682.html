			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US floods hit cereals The recent US floods have forced another cut in the forecast for the 1993 world cereal harvest. The International Wheat Council yesterday shaved another 2m tonnes off its estimate of coarse grain production, reducing it to 791m tonnes, despite higher expected outturns in countries other than the US. The forecast for wheat is unchanged at 562m, though the figure comprises several revisions. The most important is an increase of 1.6m tonnes to 17.8m tonnes for Australia, offset by reductions in Argentina, Canada and the US. The IWC's total cereals forecast for 1993 now stands at 1.353bn tonnes, down from 1.355bn tonnes.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / City finds it tough to take cover: Terrorist fall-out hits insurance NEARLY EIGHT MONTHS after the IRA bomb blasts in London last April, the reverberations are still being felt by British business and its insurers. The announcement two weeks ago that insurers would drastically reduce the amount of cover for terrorism from next year is the most recent aftershock. The Association of British Insurers advised its member companies to exclude coverage for terrorism from commercial insurance policies, leaving many of the country's leading companies facing potentially crippling unprotected exposures. While insurers and business alike are pressing the government to help out, many companies, especially those based in London who believe their properties could be terrorist targets, are hastily re-examining their security arrangements. Brokers say they are most concerned about clients who have expensive London headquarters or those - such as life insurers - who own commercial properties as part of their investment portfolios. Property owners are examining alternative methods of insuring against terrorism damage, as they cannot individually shoulder the risks of terrorist action. Mr James Tuckey, vice-president of the British Property Federation, says: 'No individual property owner would have a sufficient capital base to take that risk.' 'It is a matter of great concern,' says Mr Richard Lay, a spokesman for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. 'The government should take a serious interest in the subject.' The implications of withdrawal of cover would extend beyond the targets of terrorism, as it would affect property values and the ease of raising finance. Property owners have already faced big increases in the cost of their property insurance, which have traditionally included terrorism cover. Average rates for all-risks property policies amount to between 0.04 and 0.07 per cent of the rebuilding cost, an average rise of over 20 per cent on rates charged a year ago. One property owner insuring a modern purpose built office block in London this week paid a premium of more than Pounds 20,000 to insure a property whose rebuilding cost could cost more than Pounds 30m, a rate of over 0.067 per cent. The rate increases partially reflect the increase in incidents of arson, crime and other recession-related claims. In addition, there have been a number of significant heavy losses to commercial property in the City itself, reflecting the introduction of more sophisticated construction techniques, the greater use of computer equipment and the increasing cost of claims from business interruption losses and lost rental income. For example, a fire last year at the London Underwriting Centre in the City, which caused losses in excess of Pounds 100m, woke up insurers to the risks of buildings with atriums, which can allow fires to spread more rapidly. This year's bomb blasts have served to underline the extent of the increasing exposures. The losses are large - insurers and their reinsurers face a bill for an estimated Pounds 800m for the damage to buildings in the City and at Staples Corner in north London. Moreover the loss could have been bigger still. For example, the Commercial Union tower, near the heart of the blast, sustained losses of between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m even though it was not totally destroyed. 'The bomb showed that the exposures involved were much greater than anyone had ever appreciated before,' said one reinsurer. Next year much will depend on lobbying by insurers and business groups seeking to win government support. Mr John Greenway, Conservative MP for Ryedale and chairman of the Commons insurance and financial services committee, who is working with the ABI and Airmic, says an extension of the Northern Ireland compensation scheme - whereby the government meets the costs of terrorist damage - to the British mainland would not be 'viable'. Mr Greenway is more hopeful that the government may be receptive to an idea in which it would share the burden of reinsuring with insurance and other companies. If the campaigns fails, prospects are gloomy. Insurers will make some coverage available on a 'buy-back' basis. But the amount will be limited. One broker yesterday suggested that the industry could afford to offer no more than Pounds 10m of coverage per customer. Premiums could be punitively expensive - one broker yesterday reported that a leading UK insurer was offering to insure terrorism at a rate of 25 per cent, over 1,000 times higher than current rates. Insurers are also likely to insist that insurance would be underwritten on a 'per risk' basis, which would involve buyers listing each of the buildings they wanted to have included on the policy. Whether City companies can find insurance or not they will be forced to re-examine their own security arrangements. Mr John Wyatt, a security adviser and anti-terrorist expert, says that he has been approached by an increasing number of companies. Editorial Comment, Page 18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        THE GROWING COST TO INSURERS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Calculating the costs involved in meeting an insurance claim on a building damaged by a terrorist bomb is complex and subject to considerable variations. This is a hypothetical example in which the London HQ of a company suffers considerable bomb damage. The building covers 30,000 sq ft and has 100 employees.  It is badly damaged externally, (windows, walls etc) and the damage internally (furniture, fittings and computers) requires employees to move to another building  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.  Repair to basic fabric of the building is calculated on Pounds 100     per sq ft                                                Pounds 3m  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 2.  Furniture (desks, chairs etc) calculated on the basis of Pound     1,000 per employee                                  Pounds 100,000  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 3.  Systems (software, hardware)                        Pounds 3m plus  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.  Recreating the company's records.  Calculated on 1 per cent to     5  per cent of turnover.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 5.  Increased cost of temporary relocation.  This includes cost of     temporarily moving offices, setting up systems, and telephones,     and moving furniture etc                          Pounds 0.5m plus  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Premiums: These are calculated on the basis of 0.04 per cent to 0.07           per cent of the rebuilding costs.  Premiums have risen by           an average of 20 per cent in 1992.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (9): Getting some cash for your move / A look into the availability of public finance No business can afford to make a relocation decision in the UK without looking into the availability of public finance to assist in the move. The highest profile help comes in the form of the regional selective assistance provided by the government, which can make a significant cash grant towards the costs of a business locating in the assisted areas. Smaller firms may also be eligible for regional investment grants. But there are many worthwhile incentives in other forms, including cheap accommodation, help with training and tax incentives for businesses that locate in enterprise zones. The cash grants provided in the assisted areas make them the most appealing places in the first instance for businesses seeking a new location. Nissan, for example, received two tranches of regional selective assistance worth Pounds 44m in total towards the capital costs of its plant at Sunderland, Tyne and Wear. Regional selective assistance has made a substantial impact on employment in the assisted areas according to Mr Nick Mansley of PA Cambridge Economic Consultants, which last year published an evaluation of the scheme. This estimated that between 1985 and 1988, the scheme had created between 75,000 and 100,000 additional jobs at a net cost of Pounds 560 to Pounds 790 per net job year. 'For companies choosing to locate in the UK, it is on average the third most important factor after a pre-existing presence and the need to be in the UK market,' says Mr Mansley. In most of the assisted areas, a variety of local development bodies can offer further help in relocating a business. These include: The urban development corporations which clear derelict industrial sites and create modern factory and office developments. Training and Enterprise Councils - they can help in recruiting and training staff. English Partnerships, the urban regeneration agency which has inherited the portfolio of factories, workshops and offices managed by English Estates. Regional and local development organisations such as the Northern Development Company which covers the north-east and Cumbria. Enterprise zones offer companies which set up in them exemption from business rates, 100 per cent allowances on corporation tax for capital expenditure on buildings, and greatly simplified planning procedures. At present there are just six, with three more about to be set up in former coalfield areas such as Lanarkshire in Scotland. One of the most successful enterprise zones was set up after the closure of the steelworks in the Northamptonshire town of Corby. Its term expired in 1991, but it had been sufficiently successful in attracting new businesses for Corby to be removed from the list of assisted areas when the map was redrawn last year. At the same time as Corby disappeared from the map of assisted areas, parts of London and the south-east of England were added for the first time. In London, the Lea valley, Park Royal estate and the London end of the East Thames corridor are now included - providing help for companies relocating close to the capital's heart. Outside London, the Isle of Wight and parts of Kent, Sussex and East Anglia have joined the list of economically disadvantaged areas. Overall, the assisted areas cover 34 per cent of Britain's working population. Slightly less than half lie in what are termed development areas, those the government says have the worst unemployment problems. They are eligible for higher rates of regional selective assistance and for both types of regional enterprise grants. Less generous support is available for the remaining assisted areas, known as intermediate areas. The Isle of Thanet in East Kent is the first part of the south-east to acquire development area status, to the delight of the local authority. 'It has taken Thanet into a different league,' says Mr David Ralls, chief executive of Thanet district council. 'We've already had Pounds 2/3 m in grants for Thanet companies seeking to expand. And there is an accelerating range of inquiries from companies thinking about moving into the area, attracted by the availability of grants.' Regional selective assistance is available to manufacturing industries other than those where support is barred by the European Union (such as iron and steel, shipbuilding and man-made yarn). Services also qualify so long as they serve more than the local market. Grants are based on the fixed capital costs of a project and on the number of jobs it is expected to create. On average, awards in development areas run at between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the capital cost of a project. In intermediate areas, the average is 10 per cent. Regional enterprise grants are available to small companies in assisted areas and localities affected by colliery closure. For investment projects, these can cover 15 per cent of the cost of fixed assets up to a maximum of Pounds 15,000. Innovation grants to support the development and introduction of new or improved products or processes cover 50 per cent of eligible costs up to a maximum of Pounds 25,000. They are also available in inner-city areas covered by a City Challenge scheme or a task force. In 1992-93, more than Pounds 200m was paid out in regional selective assistance by the Department of Trade and Industry, the Scottish Office and the Welsh Office. Regional enterprise grants totalled Pounds 8.4m. Northern Ireland, which has its own industrial development programmes spent another Pounds 95m. To qualify for regional selective assistance, there are several criteria: The project must show viability - ie a good chance of paying its way. It must need the grant if it is to go ahead. This requires it to be shown that the project would not go ahead without the grant, or would go ahead on a smaller scale. It must create or safeguard jobs. It must have a regional or national benefit. Meeting both the first two criteria can be a fine balancing act, according to Mr Vince Taylor, a specialist grants consultant with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants. 'It is important not to begin the work before making the application for regional assistance,' he says. 'Officials will assume that if you've already started, you're committed to taking the project forward and don't need help.'

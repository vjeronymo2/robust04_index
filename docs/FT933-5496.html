			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / US blames failure on Croats and Serbs THE US yesterday urged the three sides in the Bosnian conflict to go back to the negotiating table, but placed the blame for the breakdown in talks firmly on the 'stubbornness and intransigence' of the Serbs and Croats. Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, said the Serbs and Croats 'should show greater flexibility in working to achieve the adjustments that the Bosnian government has asked for in order to find a more equitable settlement'. Officials in Washington said the US supported the three principal demands of the Bosnian Moslem government for changes to the division of territory proposed in Geneva: a sea outlet for the Moslems at Neum, enlargement of the Moslem enclave around Bihac in north-western Bosnia, and a land corridor linking the eastern enclaves to the main Moslem territory. The US is keeping open the options of lifting the Bosnia arms embargo or carrying out air strikes against Serb or Croat militias. But Mr Christopher said the first priority should be resumption of negotiations, with tougher action available for 'future consideration'. 'It's our evaluation that with the parties close to settlement and with the winter coming on it would be especially tragic if they don't grasp the opportunity to contain the settlement that seems to be within reach,' he said.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Budget for the supply side BRITAIN ISN'T working. Despite the rise in seasonally adjusted unemployment to just below 3m by mid-January, the Bank of England concluded in its Inflation Report out this week that the government's target range for inflation of 1 to 4 per cent is not secure. In any case, the question has never been whether a recession lasting nine quarters would lower inflation. The question is whether the UK can sustain non-inflationary growth. It is against this test that the Budget offered by the chancellor on March 16 needs to be judged. What is needed is neither a Budget for business nor a Budget for jobs, but a Budget for the supply side as a whole. Such a Budget should not be designed to alleviate each and every business complaint. Nor can it be a Budget crammed with special incentives for supposedly worthy activities. Macroeconomic stability should be at the heart of such a Budget. Instability leads to waste. The excessive investment in property development of the late 1980s was, for example, one fruit of the UK's long inflationary history. The government must offer a fiscal prospect that makes resort to inflation seem highly unlikely. Tax increases seem necessary. The sole alternative would be a dynamic recovery, combined with a credible programme of tight control of public spending. Either way the chancellor has no room for 'giving' anything away. The only question is how much he will have to take. No chance for reform In view of this dismal background, comprehensive fiscal reform would create too many losers. But the fiscal predicament of the government also means that most of the many and varied pet schemes of business lobbyists - relief of surplus advance corporation tax, higher first-year capital allowances, faster depreciation, higher thresholds for corporation tax, exemption from taxes on long-term capital gains, tax relief for export promotion, higher VAT thresholds, lower uniform business rates and abolition of inheritance tax - are also unlikely to be adopted. The lack of opportunity for reform is a pity, mostly because of the absence of any chance for coherent reform after the first year of a new parliament. The British tax system remains riddled with fundamental anomalies. Notwithstanding the adverse background, a few changes may be helpful. Personal equity plans could be extended to include interest-bearing assets and Tessas might be made more flexible. For business, depreciation might be indexed for inflation, VAT thresholds might be raised and the high rate of tax of capital gains might be lowered or, better still, roll-over relief might be offered. Nonetheless, the room for manoeuvre is small. The Confederation of British Industry argues its proposals would cost only Pounds 500m to Pounds 1bn and would be self-financing in the long term. A Treasury faced with a need to borrow more than Pounds 50bn might regard this as petty cash, but even petty cash mounts swiftly up. Fiscal buttresses On one point the Treasury should be firm. It is true that there is double taxation of corporate income earned abroad because ACT cannot be set against foreign corporation tax. But ACT is really just an income tax. It is far from clear that UK residents should not pay income tax on profits earned abroad by the companies they own. If the result is to lower the incentive for corporations to invest abroad, so be it. In the last resort, however, tinkering with taxation is secondary. The government has taken the actions most needed by business, which were to lower interest rates and let the exchange rate depreciate. The principal function of this budget is, therefore, to provide the fiscal buttresses for these changes in monetary policy. The fate of business depends not on further fiscal hand-outs, but on its will to control its own costs, the most important of which is for labour. With the underlying increase in average earnings down to 4 3/4 per cent, things are beginning to look encouraging at last. But control over pay must continue well into the recovery. The fate of businesses lies in its own hands and - given the long-term link between pay and jobs - so too does that of the 3m unemployed. This is the fourth of a series of leaders on the March Budget.</p>

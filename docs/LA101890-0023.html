			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: YOU CAN EAT THE ATMOSPHERE  </P> <P> In the United States, the cheaper something is, the better it's likely to  taste. West-Coast black mussels are invariably fresher than green ones flown  from New Zealand; in-season squashes are nicer than October asparagus from  Peru. The least expensive restaurants tend to be those closest to home cooking  -- a $4.50 bowl of posole at a dive is almost always preferable to a $13 bowl  on Melrose. In certain types of restaurants, Latin-American and Chinese,  quality is usually inversely proportionate to price.  </P> <P> But with steaks you get what you pay for -- the excellence of the raw material  is even more important than the care taken in cooking it. The Grill's $27.50  sirloin may be three times better than the Pantry's $9 job; the dinky,  profoundly aged steak at Michael's in Santa Monica costs nearly as much per  ounce as pure silver, and is probably worth it. The Niemann-Schell ranch in the  Bay Area produces what is by far the best beef in the state of California, but  charges so much for it that the priciest L.A. restaurants can't afford to put  it on their menus. Good steak costs.  </P> <P> So good steakhouses pass along the $15-plus per pound they pay for Prime meat  wholesale, becoming as basically unaffordable as Pacific Dining Car or the  Palm. (Taylor's, an excellent, old-fashioned steakhouse near Downtown, charges  somewhat lower prices for Prime steak becausethey dry-age the meat themselves.)  Other good steakhouses use less expensive grades, but make up for it with low  prices, strong old-fashioneds and plenty of atmosphere. Among L.A. steakhouses,  none are more atmospheric than the Arsenal and the Sherman Room.  </P> <P> The Arsenal is your basic restaurant from the Twilight Zone, with medieval  weaponry mounted on the walls, mortar shells hanging from the ceiling and a  queer, Heironymous Bosch-like mural of crockery and anteaters painted behind  the bar. Nailed to the wall above each red-leatherette booth is the Arsenal's  drink menu, which includes such delights as coffee spiked with tequila and  Swiss cherry liqueur -- at the Arsenal, evidence of your mortality seems always  close at hand.  </P> <P> You order a surf 'n' turf platter by asking for "undecided." The only waitress,  25-year Arsenal veteran Mary Brady, is known to all as the Warden. And I've  seen a tableful of thirtysomething Peaks Freaks here attempting to tie cherry  stems into knots with their tongues.  </P> <P> It's somebody's birthday tonight. The Arsenal's ancient jukebox lurches into a  Bing Crosby-ish recording of "Happy Birthday," and the Warden emerges from the  kitchen carrying a flaming cocktail that both glows a lurid red and drips  gobbets of blue flame down the side of the glass. The honoree, who looks as if  he's been drinking since noon, slouches further down into his seat and stares  slackly into space.  </P> <P> "It's for you," his wife says, beaming.  </P> <P> "Like a big birthday candle," the Warden adds.  </P> <P> The man scratches himself, burps softly and blows out his drink. Everybody in  the dining room applauds.  </P> <P> The menu here is exactly what you expect -- meat, foil-wrapped potatoes with  goopy cheese sauce, and garlic bread -- and though it can take half an hour to  attract the Warden's attention, a chilled plate of salad is in front of you 30  seconds after you order.  </P> <P> The big event seems to be chateaubriand for two, the most expensive thing on  the menu. When it's ready, two honks sound from the kitchen and the Warden  marches down the aisle followed by a busboy carrying a card table. (The  procession wouldn't attract any more attention if Madonna were carrying the  meat.) The busboy sets it down, flicks on a dim, plastic coach-lamp attached to  the table, and carves the charred tube of steak into eight thick slices,  transferring them to two plates. He flicks off the light.  </P> <P> "That was wuhhhn-der-foool," the Warden says.  </P> <P> But really, the steak isn't nearly as good as the show.  </P> <P> Consider a New York steak, which has a little more flavor, or perhaps just a  whole lot of bar-brand Scotch.  </P> <P> The Sherman Room is a little more like a regular steakhouse-bar, the kind you'd  expect to find in Idaho or Kansas City, with sporting prints, dad's-den  paneling and a wait that can stretch more than an hour on weekend nights. A  flagstone fireplace flickers with the cold light of a mechanical log; a blurry  etching on the mirror behind the bar makes you feel as if you've bolted four  martinis before you've even touched a drop. The attractions here are the  prices, which are absurdly low -- steaks cost less than $10; steak and lobster  less than $15 -- and the friendly waitresses, who seem to have been working  there since Century City was a bean field. Plus, the restaurant is 21-and-over,  a joint for grown-ups.  </P> <P> To be truthful, the lobster here isn't the tastiest. The filet steaks seem a  bit like wet cardboard. But the beer is cold, a New York steak ordered rare  comes rare, and the garlic toast is pleasantly sodden. For dessert, there's  that fudgy ice-cream concoction called mud pie.  </P> <P> "Here, let grandma do it," our waitress said one night as she leaned over the  table and extracted a stubborn lobster tail from its shell. (Previously she had  refilled our water glasses half a dozen times, poured beer every time the level  in a glass got a little low, passed out extra napkins in case we wanted them,  emptied the ashtray an average of three times per cigarette, served the steaks  and brought us bowls of delicious, smoky lentil soup.)  </P> <P> "Those things can be tricky," she said.  </P> <P>  The Arsenal, 12012 W. Pico Blvd., West Los Angeles, (213) 479-9782. Open  Monday-Saturday, 10 a.m.-10 p.m. Full bar. MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner  for two, food only, $18-$25.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  The Sherman Room, 16916 Sherman Way, Van Nuys, (818) 881-9363. Open for dinner  Tuesday-Saturday. Full bar. Cash only. Dinner for two, food only, $15-$28.  </P></p>

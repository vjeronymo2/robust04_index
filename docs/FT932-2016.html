			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Observer: Argy-bargy Presumably one of the reasons why Tottenham Hotspur chairman Alan Sugar feels so confident that he has not landed himself with another legal nightmare when he pinched his new manager, Ossie Ardiles, from West Bromwich Albion, is because Ardiles claims to be a trained lawyer. Although Ardiles signed up for Cordoba at the tender age of 12, he learnt his law during his time with Huracan Buenos Aires in the 1970's. Can anyone remember any fledgling British barristers who forsook the silk for the pitch? Failing that, a solicitor would do.</p>

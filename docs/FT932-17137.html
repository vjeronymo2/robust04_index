			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / World Trade News: Russian calls for greater market access MR Sergei Glaziev, Russia's foreign economic relations minister, yesterday called for an end to western trade barriers to Russian goods and services, saying trade was far more useful than more aid. He said he hoped western barriers would be tackled by western leaders, and that early results would be achieved during President Boris Yeltsin's summit with President Bill Clinton at the weekend. 'We are not asking for additional credits. Our main demands are for access to the markets of developed countries and an end to discrimination against Russian goods,' he said. Outlining a programme to stimulate the export of manufactured goods, he said Russia was counting mainly on increased sales to developing countries. But he said that, by applying pressure on governments to close markets to Russian exports, western companies were guilty of unfair competition. He cited as a 'classic example' the closing of US markets to uranium exports. Mr Glaziev's comments reflected growing frustration about what is seen as western hypocrisy in proclaiming the need to help Russia but not giving it the chance to help itself. He said, for instance, that revenues from uranium exports could help finance the conversion of defence plants to civilian uses. 'Just think how the US could save budget expenditures by not giving us credits (for this purpose) but giving us market access.' He also complained that the end of the cold war had put Russian arms exports at a disadvantage because Moscow, unlike the US, did not have the political clout to force countries to buy its weapons. Although western European companies have complained about Russian dumping of metals such as aluminium, he cited what he called undeniable examples of the west closing its doors to the few Russian manufactured goods and services which can compete with the west. One example is satellite-launching services, which Russia can provide at half the price of western Europe's Arianespace but where Russia has agreed to voluntary quotas and price floors. 'Negotiations have been going on for more than a year and still there is no end in sight,' he said. Reuter reports from Bonn: Germany and the ex-Soviet republic of Belarus will sign accords on economic co-operation and investor protection today, the German economics ministry said yesterday. The pact includes guarantees that German investors will be able to move capital freely in and out of Belarus.</p>

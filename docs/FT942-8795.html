			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Haiti's military draws on past to shrug off threats: How previous experience has emboldened generals A storm of international protest rages around them, but Haiti's military rulers seem unconcerned, shrugging off efforts to apply economic pressure for the return of ousted President Jean Bertrand Aristide. Their appointment this week of an alternative government to that of Mr Robert Malval, the pro-Aristide prime minister, appeared to be explicit defiance of the United Nations deadline of this Saturday for tougher sanctions and veiled US threats of a military invasion. In Port-au-Prince, President Bill Clinton's sabre-rattling is dismissed as merely that. The coterie of affluent Haitians who support the military-controlled regime see a US invasion - or even US participation in a multinational force intended to remove the army and reinstate Mr Aristide - as politically too risky for Mr Clinton and unlikely to be supported by Americans. Their reasons for optimism are not hard to find. Even under the existing embargo, trade has continued. Between January and October last year, when Haiti was under embargo, the US imported 2.5m softballs and 678,000 baseballs from Haiti, according to US commerce department figures, significantly higher than imports in the same period of 1992. Having survived sanctions so far, the military feels it can survive those which will come into force if it does not step down by the weekend. Army officers are also looking with more than passing interest at developments across the border in the Dominican Republic. The victory of the incumbent President Joaquin Balaguer in the election there this week, if confirmed, will promise a continuing loophole in the sanctions. Mr Balaguer has been opposed to Mr Aristide's return and is against tougher sanctions. He had previously promised to reduce the incidence of smuggling across the border, but has described the impending embargo as 'an inhuman formula because you are punishing people that already are impoverished.' General Raoul Cedras and the other officers who head Haiti's military long enjoyed support from professional associates in the corridors of power in Washington. Many are past members of the National Intelligence Service, a special unit created in the 1980s by the US Central Intelligence Agency to fight narcotics trafficking, but which has since gone rogue, with former members becoming traffickers themselves. Gen Cedras was once a key source of US intelligence on Haiti and was, by extension, influential in formulating Washington's early and negative impressions of Mr Aristide. The value of these links, and their effect on US policy, were indicated when, in 1992, amid confirmed reports of the murder, imprisonment and abuse of Mr Aristide's supporters, the CIA's leading analyst on Haiti described Gen Cedras as 'a conscientious military leader who genuinely wishes to minimise his role in politics. There is no systematic or frequent violence aimed at civilians.' Gen Cedras and his officers must also have been heartened by the various official attempts in the US to discredit Mr Aristide. Last year the CIA reported that Mr Aristide was a manic-depressive and was prone to violence. The claim that the president had undergone psychological treatment at a Canadian hospital was rebuffed by the hospital named which said it had never treated the president. The list of reasons for the military's sense of security is thus formidable. But in not bending to international pressure, Gen Cedras runs a risk of overplaying his hand. If President Bill Clinton really has concluded that principle must take precedence over personality, and that returning an elected leader to office is now more important than who that leader is, then Haiti's military leaders could come to regret calling his bluff.</p>

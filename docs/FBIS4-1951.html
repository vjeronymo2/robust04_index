			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Shenyang Intermediate  People's Court recently ruled that the No. 7 machine tool  factory should be shut down, making it the 32nd enterprise to  have gone bankrupt in this capital of Liaoning Province.    A collectively-owned enterprise with 388 employees, the No.  7  machine tool factory had suffered losses for eight consecutive  years.    The losses for the eight years totalled to 560,000 yuan in  all, and the factory in addition was saddled with debts  totalling 2.24 million yuan. But the factory's fixed assests  were only about 240,000 yuan.    When Tian Shuangquan, director of the factory, signed an  adjudication paper in court, some of the employees wept.    But some of the employees in court were glad. They said that  if the enterprise was not declared bankrupt, they could not  apply for relief funds from the insurance company.    In August, 1986, Shenyang was named as an experimental city  where bankrupt enterprises could be shut down.    A government official said that before the law on enterprise  bankruptcies came into being, Shenyang decided about bankruptcy  of an enterprise by administrative means.    Since 1993, the city has begun to handle the problem through  the courts.    Shenyang Intermediate People's Court has so far declared 13  enterprises bankrupt.    The official said that about 8,000 employees of bankrupt  enterprises have been well looked after. Most of them have been  re- employed by other enterprises or social services and about  200 laid off people each got 100 yuan per month.    Now a legal procedure must be followed by any enterprise on  the verge of bankruptcy, including application for bankruptcy, a  court declaration of bankruptcy, check on the assets of bankrupt  enterprises, and paying off creditors by using the property and  other assets of the bankrupt enterprise.</p>

The wars waged by your  country through centuries and the oppression exerted by one of  the severest communist dictatorships in the world didn't subdue  the legendary resistance of 'The eagle's sons.' You have been  looked down upon until recently, but now you are manifesting an  unprecedented zeal to integrate into Europe and Western  democracies.    "Showing our affection towards your country, I decided to  accept your invitation and visit your country.    "According to my proposal in Berlin a year ago, and with the  unanimous approval of all our delegations, Albania became an  associate member of our Assembly. In this context I have come  to strengthen our relations. We are proud that you are among  us. Your so fraternal and warm welcome you are extending to us,  confirms once again that there is no doubt that you are part of  Europe and you will be fully committed to your so important role.    "You showed your loyalty to the international community by  giving the warships of NATO and the Western European Union fully  access to your waters to supervise the embargo against former  Yugoslavia, thus placing the interest of regional stability  above your personal interest. We are so indebted to you in this  regard.    "You showed your solidarity with NATO last month by  proposing  them to use your air bases in order to apply the measures  envisaged by the ultimatum addressed to those who were attacking  Sarajevo. You knew well the danger that was threatening you,  anyhow you accepted to undertake this act being convinced that  only this decision would help accelerate the re establishment of  peace in Bosnia.    "You offered your cooperation to some of our Alliance  members  for the realisation of a number of initiatives they had  undertaken. Thus, by allowing U.S. aircrafts to come to your  country to survey the movements of the military troops in former  Yugoslavia, you once more placed the interest of the regional  security above the personal interests. I assure you that these  acts have been welcome by the governments and parliaments of the  NATO member countries.    "Your president signed in Brussels some weeks ago, the  documents which will allow your country to strengthen its  cooperation with our Alliance through Partnership For Peace. We  do not forget that Albania has been one of the first countries  to reply positively to the offer for Partnership For Peace  presented in the extraordinary meeting of NATO on January of  this year. This is a testimony to your good will not only to  continue but also to have faster rates in your reforms to change  your defence structure aiming at harmonising them better with  the principles, means and procedures of the NATO.    "Accepting Albania as an associate member last year and I  hail you on this occasion Mr. Selami who has made a great  contribution to this direction, the Assembly of North [as  received] aimed at making its contribution to precenting the  escalation of war in the zone around you. We hope this act will  serve as an encouragement for the leaders of our countries to be  more sensitive towards your problems because security in the  Balkans is security for Europe as well.    "You are right to be worried about the fate of the 2 million  Albanians in Kosova. Nonviolent resistance of the Albanians  headed by President Rugova deserves the support of the  international community. Believe me, I share this worry with  you with regard to the Serbian decision for the expulsion of the  CSCE observers mission some months ago. Personally I am  convinced that our Alliance will do its best for this decision  to be reconsidered. We should see the possibility of military  and civil deployment of observers in Kosova, as it is being  operated in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM]. Our Alliance should use all its influence in support  or talks which will lead to the establishment of a status which  will observe the fundamental rights of the Albanians in Kosova  because without resolving this problem stability in this zone  will not last long.    "We also know your preoccupation to ensure for the numerous  Albanians in Macedonia a full recognition of their civil rights.  Your wisdom towards this neighbouring country, which is hardly  coming into its full shape, and the political and economic  support towards it are a guarantee for the stability in this  zone. We also support your efforts for the normalisation of the  tensions in the relations between some Albanian and Greek  communities.    "We know that the losses inflicted to you by the embargo  towards former Yugoslavia have to do not only with your security  and the determination of the Albanian Government to strictly  observe the international sanctions is a full justification for  your demands for compensations. International community is  rather delayed in studying the possibilities for the creation of  a fund of compensation for the new democratic regimes which are  greatly affected by the consequences of the embargo in this  difficult economic transition period.    "Even after a cease-fire, which is a necessary preliminary  condition, peace in the Balkans will not be established unless  the peoples of this zone have a fair standard of living and the  ability to use the assets of their countries and their talent to  be more and more prosperous.    "Your resolute economic policy despite sacrifices to be made  by your people, is now yielding its fruits. I am glad to see  that investments in Albania are on the increase. The French, my  compatriots, occupy now an important share in these investments,  but I am convinced that the traditional relations that link you  country with mine, France, need more serious endeavours from  these countries.    "For nearly fifty years your country was self isolated by  the  rest of the continent. What a misfortune! The enthusiasm with  which you are breaking through this isolation arouses great  hopes in you and us. Let me say and you should believe me that  we are going to help you in your revival, just as we have faith  in the revival of a stable peace because we are a single  European and Atlantic family. We are looking forward to seeing  independent and solidarist Albania a NATO member, a cradle of a  great culture as well an examplary case for the democracies of  our great Alliance. I am convinced of this.</p>

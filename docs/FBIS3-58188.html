			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Hakki Atun has declared that any  attempt by the Greek Cypriot Administration to advance the  European Union [EU] membership issue by taking advantage of  Greece's term presidency will sabotage the intercommunal  negotiating process, which is scheduled to begin in the coming  days.    Atun issued a written statement in connection with Greece's  moves to accept the Greek Cypriot Administration as a full EU  member. In his statement, Atun said that it is the duty of the  government to again warn the EU members and the UN Secretariat  General with regard to this irresponsible move on the part of  Greece and the Greek Cypriot Administration.    Atun announced that the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus  [TRNC] will immediately assess any negative moves by Greece  during its six-month term presidency and rapidly make all the  necessary decisions in cooperation with motherland Turkey. Atun  recalled that the illegal Greek Cypriot Administration does not  have the authority to speak on behalf of the Turkish Cypriot  people, to represent them, to conduct negotiations that will be  binding on them, or to sign agreements on their behalf. The  TRNC expects EU member countries to prevent Greece from creating  more impasses by exploiting its term presidency and from further  complicating the problem, Atun remarked.    The UN Secretariat General and Security Council have  seriously been warned about the Greek and Greek Cypriot moves,  which undermine the talks and which contradict all previous  agreements and accepted principles, Atun noted and called on  these organizations to exert the necessary efforts to avoid  negative developments.</p>

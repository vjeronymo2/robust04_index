			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Job gains likely from tax changes INCOME TAX changes in this year's Budget are likely to create almost 1,000 jobs in the Inland Revenue, which only last week announced plans to lose up to 10,000 jobs over the next decade by reorganising its office network to increase efficiency and improve service. Most of the additional jobs will be required because of the introduction of a reduced 20 per cent rate of tax for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. Some staff will be needed to deal with inquiries expected to arise from a more complicated tax structure. There will also be an increased number of claims for repayment of tax from people who have had tax deducted from interest and dividends at the basic rate of 25 per cent and are liable for tax at only 20 per cent. When the reduced rate of tax introduced by the last Labour government was abolished by Sir Geoffrey Howe in 1980 he estimated that it had taken 1,300 tax staff to administer it. Fewer staff will be needed this time because of the computerisation of tax assessment, which makes processing easier. Revenue managers estimate that 200 extra staff will be needed for each million repayment claims. With up to 4m taxpayers liable for tax at only the 20 per cent rate, 800 extra staff will be needed to administer this aspect of the Budget by the 1993-94 tax year, when most claims for next year are likely to be lodged. About 200 further jobs will be created by the proposal to allow the married couple's allowance to be transferred between husband and wife. With staff savings from some Budget measures - for example the scrapping of the business expansion scheme - the Inland Revenue payroll is estimated to increase by 490 posts in 1992-93 and 940 in 1993-94.

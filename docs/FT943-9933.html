			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Stet - the mother of all Italian privatisations - International offerings The privatisation of Stet, the Italian state telecommunications holding company, came back into focus last week following remarks by Mr Michele Tedeschi, the new chairman of Iri, the state holding company and Stet's parent, that the sale could go ahead this autumn. His comments have put the corporate finance departments at several international investment banks on red alert, since they are all keen to have a prominent role in what it has become known as the 'mother of all Italian privatisations'. Although unwilling to be quoted (for fear of blowing their chances of winning such a lucrative mandate), bankers and telecoms analysts at these organisations firmly believe that a further tranche of the state's shares in Stet will be snapped up by both domestic and international investors. Their confidence comes as some surprise when one considers the poor stock market performance of the Italian banks and financial institutions which have been privatised in the last year, and the difficulties which beset the government. But unlike the privatised banks, which although asset-rich are dismissed as dinosaurs in the international world of finance, Stet's strong earnings potential and its cheapness relative to its international peers makes it a firm favourite with international investors. In view of Stet's appeal and the numerous hurdles which still need to be cleared, bankers believe that Iri should not put itself under pressure to meet an autumn deadline for the disposal of shares in its most valuable asset. 'If they rush it, they will end up compromising on price and on size,' says one banker. The preferred route would be first to monitor the stock market performance of Telecom Italia, the new company formed from the merger of Sip, the quoted domestic network operator, with four other state-controlled telecoms units. Shares in Telecom Italia, in which Stet will have a holding of around 61 per cent, are due to begin trading on the Milan exchange on August 18. Second, bankers are hoping that Mr Tedeschi, who returns to Iri after 14 months as managing director of Stet, will press ahead with the planned demerger of the cellular business from Telecom Italia. Although it could take up to three months to achieve, a separate stock market quotation for the cellular business would allow analysts to value Stet more accurately and enable Iri to get the best price for its shares. Iri has not revealed how much of its stake in Stet it plans to sell, and analysts believe that it wants to retain a significant shareholding. A possible first step would be the reduction of its holding of ordinary shares from 61.3 per cent to 40 per cent. At Friday's share price of L5,320, such an offering would raise L4,300bn (Dollars 2.8bn), an amount which one analyst describes as 'big, but do-able'. Some political concessions are also thought to be necessary before Iri can launch the Stet sale. Analysts place the greatest priority on the creation of a clear regulatory environment for the telecoms industry and the elimination of political influence in the setting of tariffs. They are also keen for the government to refresh the privatisation plan which it has inherited from the Amato and Ciampi administrations. On a more mundane note, pro-forma accounts from Telecom Italia would also be welcomed. Bearing in mind that anything is possible in Italy, the likelihood is that the Stet sale will not happen until early next year. Even though Mr Tedeschi is on the inside track, he could well be held back by the conflicts within the government.</p>

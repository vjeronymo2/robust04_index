			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: World Bank and IFC barred from Spanish bond market THE World Bank and the International Finance Corporation, its private sector finance affiliate, are reported to have been barred from issuing further debt in the Spanish bond market. The ban is a result of a dispute between the Spanish government and the World Bank, according to market sources. The argument centres on the Spanish authorities' displeasure at the low number of construction contracts awarded to Spanish companies for World Bank and IFC projects in less-developed countries. Both agencies have been active borrowers in the 'Matador' bond market - the Spanish domestic market for foreign borrowers. But last week the Spanish Treasury, which regulates the market, refused IFC permission to launch its planned Pta10bn five-year Matador bond issue. Instead, the European investment Bank launched a Pta15bn 10-year deal. Officials at the Spanish Treasury were unavailable for comment yesterday.</p>

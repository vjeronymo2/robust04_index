			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Observer: No confidence What on earth is the world coming to? Britain's Inland Revenue seems to have lost faith in the integrity of the Royal Mail. The powers that be at Somerset House have felt it necessary to issue Form CPS1 on the security of cheque payments, which is an effective vote of no confidence in Britain's postal system. The Revenue notes that cheques sent by post may be stolen 'before they reach us'. It recommends tax payers to use the bank giro, electronic funds transfer, or pay by cash at the local Post Office. If you do insist on sending a cheque in the post, and it is lost, you may become involved in lengthy inquiries. Next excuse, please.</p>

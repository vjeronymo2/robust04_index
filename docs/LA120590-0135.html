			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AST RESEARCH OPENS 2 OFFICES IN THE FAR EAST  </P> <P> Personal computer maker AST Research Inc. has established sales offices in  Singapore and Taiwan as part of an effort to boost sales in the Far East.  </P> <P> "The opening of AST's Singapore and Taiwan offices reflects the company's  commitment to the Pacific Rim's personal computer marketplace and its continued  global strategy to gain worldwide market share," said Tom Yuen, AST's chief  operating officer.  </P> <P> "AST's local proximity will allow it to keep pace with the region's rapidly  growing computer industry."  </P> <P> International sales made up 38% of AST's $136.3 million in sales during the  first quarter ended Sept. 28. That was up from 30% for the same period a year  earlier.  </P> <P> The offices will provide distributors and dealers with educational, technical,  marketing and sales support. They will work closely with local dealers and  distributors to develop pricing and distribution strategies specifically for  the region, the company said.  </P> <P> "The new offices allow AST to respond quickly to developments in the local  marketplace," Yuen said. "As the industry grows, it becomes even more important  to provide distribution channels and end users with high-quality products and  support."  </P> <P> In October, the company announced the appointment of the first three Japanese  firms to distribute a personal computer designed to compete with the NEC  Corp.'s dominant line of personal computers in the Japanese marketplace.  </P> <P> AST will sell its full line of products in Singapore and Taiwan, including  personal computers, enhancement products and data communications gear. The  company now has limited sales in Singapore and Taiwan.  </P></p>

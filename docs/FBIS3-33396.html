			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Montevideo LA MANANA in Spanish on 16  February publishes on page 40 a 500-word unattributed article  which views an ALADI [Latin American Integration Association]  report on foreign trade and social and economic indicators of  its member countries. The article notes that ALADI global  exports grew by 5 percent last year -- totalling $122 billion --  represents "a 76-percent increase compared to 1986." The  article continues: "Notwithstanding this sharp increase" ALADI  exports still represent 3.2 percent of world exports, "which  have remained static for the last seven years."    The article reports that imports increased 8 percent in the  same period -- totaling $135 million -- and that ALADI countries  always registered "a balance of trade surplus" until 1992, when  they registered an $8-billion deficit.    The article comments: "ALADI's leading economic partners are  the United States, which accounts for 37 percent of all exports;  the EEC, with 23 percent; and Japan, with 6 percent." Trade  within ALADI member countries accounts for 15 percent of total  exports.    ALADI's chief exports are manufactured goods, food,  beverages, and tobacco. The ALADI report states that member  countries' GDP grew by 3.3 percent in 1993 and that per capita  GDP amounted to $2,150.    The report concludes: "The economies of most countries of  the  region registered, for the third consecutive year, an increase  in activity, a relative stability in domestic prices, an easing  off of their debt service, and a considerable inflow of foreign  capital."</p>

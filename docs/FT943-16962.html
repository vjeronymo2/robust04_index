			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: UK banks At one level, falls of some 3 to 5 per cent in leading clearing bank shares yesterday were a strange reaction to Abbey National's decision to halve its current account overdraft rate. Since Abbey has only Pounds 13m in overdraft business in its balance sheet, its overall lending margin will hardly be affected. That does not seem to warrant a fall of over 3 per cent in its shares. Since it has only around 3 per cent of the market in current accounts, it could double its own business in this area without having much impact on the competition. It would have been different if a large player like National Westminster had slashed its rates. Then its own fall of 5.4 per cent would have seemed a modest reaction. Still, after cigarettes and newspapers it is clear that the equity market does not like price wars. Banks look vulnerable to the phenomenon. While many complain bitterly about over-capacity, their actual returns in the retail sector are quite high: net return on shareholders' funds at TSB, for example, was an annualised 15.5 per cent in the six months to April. That leaves plenty of room for margins to come under pressure. The uncertainty is about timing. The example of credit cards shows that established issuers like Barclaycard can hold out against new entrants who undercut them. While overall loan demand remains slack, there is little incentive for big banks to cut their high retail margins on activities that really matter. They simply risk losing profit without adding volume. Paradoxically it is when loan demand picks up that price wars could really start.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA;  </P> <P> GARBAGE RATES TO GO UP  </P> <P> Garbage collection rates will continue to go up for residents of single-family  homes, the City Council decided Monday night.  </P> <P> Such customers will continue to absorb semiannual rate increases that the city  must pay Athens Disposal until subsidies for single-family rates are phased  out, council members agreed.  </P> <P> Under the city's contract with Athens Disposal, the company receives automatic  rate increases, based on the Consumer Price Index, every June and December.  These increases have averaged 5% a year, said Dennis Danner, the city's  administrative services director.  </P> <P> In the past, rates charged to residents of multifamily complexes have been  higher than those in other San Gabriel Valley communities in order to subsidize  single-family rates, Danner said.  </P> <P> But in 1985, the city decided to phase out the subsidy by passing on fee  increases only to single-family customers. That year, a whopping 21% increase,  prompted by the closure of the Operating Industries landfill in Monterey Park,  was shouldered entirely by single-family residents.  </P> <P> Even so, rates for multifamily dwellers are still about 31% higher than those  in nearby communities, according to a report Danner submitted to the council.  </P></p>

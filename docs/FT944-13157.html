			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Canadian Airlines posts record earnings for term Canadian Airlines Inter-national, which was on the brink of collapse before the conclusion of a financial restructuring earlier this year, has bounced back with record quarterly earnings. The Calgary-based airline will take another important step forward next week when it implements a wide-ranging services contract with AMR Corp, the holding company of American Airlines. AMR paid CDollars 246m (USDollars 182m) for a 25 per cent voting interest in the Canadian carrier as part of the restructuring. The contract, which is valued at about USDollars 110m a year, includes a switch to AMR's data-processing and yield-management facilities and to its Sabre computer-reservation system. PWA Corp, Canadian's holding company, reported third-quarter earnings of CDollars 85.4m, or 11 cents a share, up from CDollars 38.5m, or 78 cents. The latest per-share figure reflects a significant dilution as a result of a big debt-to-equity conversion which formed part of the restructuring, and which cut interest expense. Nine-month net profit was CDollars 19.5m, against a loss of CDollars 199m a year earlier, including special charges. Operating income climbed by 8.3 per cent to CDollars 110.6m, due to increased traffic and an improved yield per mile. The load factor was unchanged at 76.8 per cent. Mr Drew Fitch, senior vice-president for finance, said the airline aims to achieve earnings of CDollars 75m next year, and cash flow from operations of CDollars 500m by 1997. AMR's 20-year contract with Canadian reflects the US carrier's efforts to expand the services which it provides to other airlines. The two airlines are also co-operating in marketing, including reciprocity for their frequent-flier programmes.</p>

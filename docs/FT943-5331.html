			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Management: When the office is the dining room - Teleworking, although popular in the US, has been slow to catch on in Europe As the UK rail strike moves into its 13th week, it is taking an increasingly heavy toll on British businesses. Like January's Californian earthquake and past bomb explosions in the City of London, the strike is encouraging companies to consider promoting telework in order to reduce their dependence on commuters. Teleworking, the practice of using computers and telephone links to work away from the office, inspires grand claims from its advocates. In a recent newspaper advertisement exhorting companies to introduce teleworking to overcome the rail strike, one British consultancy claimed that the practice 'not only overcomes the immediate transport problem . . . it will increase productivity by around 45 per cent'. The supposed ability of teleworking to increase productivity, along with other benefits such as reducing road traffic and creating a more flexible workforce, has won it influential support. The European Commission, which is promoting it as part of its measures on growth, competitiveness and employment, believes that Europe could potentially have 10m teleworkers. Optimistic forecasts about teleworking's potential have been made for 20 years, since before the technology actually existed to make it possible reliably and economically. Yet, even now, the uptake of teleworking is patchy. Although the technological obstacles have been overcome, it is seen by employers as being difficult to manage, while employees worry that their career prospects will suffer if they are not seen in the office. In the US, where the Clean Air Act has forced employers to reduce commuters' car emissions, an increasing number of employees are being encouraged to spend some or all of their week working at home. The Institute for the Study of Distributed Work, based in California, estimates that between 4m-5m people, or 3-5 per cent of the US workforce, are teleworkers. In Europe, however, the introduction of teleworking has been relatively slow. In the UK, a recent Department of Employment report cast doubt on the notion that it was 'slowly but inexorably growing'. Although one in 20 organisations employs at least one teleworker, fewer than one employee in 200 is a genuine teleworker, it said. This figure excludes self-employed homeworkers and people who spend less than half their time working from home. Nor does it include staff who spend most of their time with clients while using telecommunications to keep in touch with the office. This approach, used by companies such as IBM and Arthur Andersen, allows employees to use a limited pool of desks when in the office - a practice known as 'hot-desking'. A Department of Trade and Industry study published early this year argued that the slow speed at which teleworking has been adopted meant that 'the UK and the rest of Europe as a whole are net losers of jobs and trade both to the USA and to developing countries'. The uneven take-up of teleworking can partly be ascribed to the recession. Interest in teleworking increased in the late 1980s, when it was viewed as a way of retaining scarce skilled workers. This became less of a factor during the recession, leaving much of the expansion of home working to the ranks of the self-employed and those who work from home on an informal, occasional basis. Indeed, many companies that pioneered teleworking have stopped their schemes completely. The Department of Employment's report said that 'we were surprised by how many (organisations that used teleworking in the past) had since given up the practice'. The reasons given by these companies included job cuts, the departure of the manager who initiated the scheme, the lack of success of the scheme and changes in the circumstances of employees or the company. For example, FI Group, the computer services company which pioneered British home-working in the 1960s, has stopped the practice completely. This change was precipitated by FI taking on larger projects, which required greater teamwork. 'Because of the complexity of the projects we are working on, we need large, closely knit teams which can work around the clock,' says Rosie Symons, one of FI's managers. Rank Xerox also once associated itself closely with teleworking - to much public relations acclaim - but has now dropped the practice. Its 'networking' experiment in the early 1980s involved employees leaving the staff and working on a self-employed basis, with guaranteed work from the company for a period of time. The networkers kept in touch with Rank Xerox via computers and a telecommunications link. But although the experiment suited the company's particular needs at the time, it was not extended to its regular staff. The fear that teleworking is a back-door route to redundancy has slowed its take-up during the recession. But over the past year, the subject has been re-established on the agenda of large companies, according to Noel Hodson, director of SW2000, a teleworking consultancy. He attributes this resurgence in interest to the growing burden of commuting, the sharp drop in the cost of equipment, and the economic benefits of teleworking that stem from the retention of trained workers, increased productivity and reduced office overheads. In Britain, Digital Equipment, the US computer company, saves Pounds 20m a year in office costs as a result of introducing flexible working practices for 2,500 of its 4,000 employees over the last eight years. This summer it opened a telecentre in Newmarket, the headquarters of its East Anglian operation, which occupies a tenth as much space as its former offices in the town. The telecentre will house just nine staff, working in secretarial or administrative roles. The sales, consulting and customer service staff work from home, their cars, or occasionally from other Digital offices. But Digital believes that the weak state of the property market may prevent it from disposing of unwanted buildings and so fully realising its planned cost savings. After property savings, productivity gains are usually cited as the most powerful benefit from teleworking. As well as taking less time travelling and gossiping, staff who work at home are usually found to take less sick leave. When the City of Los Angeles set up a teleworking project after January's earthquake, it found that the staff involved were 12.5 per cent more productive than they had been previously. But productivity claims should be treated with caution. Ursula Huws, the author of the Department of Employment's report on teleworking, points out that teleworkers are selected because they are trained, responsible and productive. 'Having selected those people, it is not surprising they are more productive,' she says. The financial and productivity gains from teleworking are tempered by obstacles such as the risk of diluting the company's corporate identity in the eyes of employees and customers, senior managers' mistrust of technology, and concern about the security risks arising from the transmission of confidential files. But perhaps the greatest problem concerns the management of teleworkers. This difficulty is most acute for managers who are accustomed to monitoring their staff closely, rather than setting targets and monitoring results. This issue was highlighted in a recent report by the Conference Board, a New York-based business membership organisation, which found that teleworking had been adopted by only 1 per cent of the employees working for companies that offered schemes involving it. Some 75 per cent of the companies surveyed said the greatest hurdle in a teleworking programme was convincing managers that employees can be productive and properly supervised when they work from home. The low take-up of teleworking in companies with teleworking schemes also points to some ambivalence on the part of staff. In some instances, teleworking has brought employees considerable benefits. One case in point is John Ruscoe, a 42-year-old programmer working for ICL, who now lives on a farm on Orkney, off the north coast of Scotland. The teleworking option, which has been embraced by 300 of ICL's staff, allowed him to abandon his 90-minute-long commute from his previous home to Manchester each day. 'I seem to have the best of both worlds,' he says. 'I earn a Manchester salary and live in a nice, rural environment.' Many individuals with young children are also grateful for the opportunity to work from home, although they are unanimous that it is not a substitute for child care. Yet teleworking does not always work out well for the employees. A report by the Science Policy Research Unit into teleworking last year chronicled numerous problems, including isolation, family strife and the feeling that home is no longer a refuge from the office. 'Unless you are physically out of the house, you haven't left work,' said one interviewee. The experience of teleworkers depends largely on the way they are treated by their employers, according to Huws. She believes that middle managers or professionals who are highly valued by their employers often enjoy teleworking because they continue to feel integrated into the corporate culture. Less privileged workers doing relatively low-grade jobs often suffer from isolation. Even those employees who embark on teleworking often find it is not for them. Hodson has found that after a few months of a teleworking experiment, more than half of those who volunteer for the scheme are likely to want to return to the office. A teleworker's potential problems are numerous, including loneliness, distractions from neighbours and family, fear of missing out on promotion opportunities and lack of self-discipline. These difficulties suggest that companies wishing to make teleworking compulsory will meet resistance from their workforce. Even enthusiasts often find they want to return to the office at some stage, for instance when their children have grown up. 'There are stages in peoples' lives when it suits people to work from home but very few people want to do it all their lives,' says Huws. The problems experienced by teleworkers can often be overcome by encouraging them to come into the office regularly to keep in touch with other staff; this was one of FI's early discoveries. 'It is a vital part of flexible working to have a social centre', says Stephen Jupp, a consultant at Digital. Teleworking schemes that require staff to work in isolation need sophisticated management if they are to retain employees and increase the employer's competitiveness. 'There are virtually no technological barriers, no legal barriers, no cost barriers to having people working from home,' says Huws. 'The barriers are human ones.'</p>

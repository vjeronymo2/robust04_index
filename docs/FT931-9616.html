			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Craxi resigns in new setback for Italian Socialists MR BETTINO CRAXI, one of the most influential and controversial politicians in postwar Italy, yesterday resigned from the leadership of the Socialist party which he has headed since 1976. The 59 year-old Socialist leader, who served as prime minister from 1983 until 1987, was forced to step down because of his alleged involvement in the growing corruption scandal in Milan, the centre of his power base. He has received five warrants from Milan magistrates advising him he is under investigation for alleged illicit party funding by obtaining kickbacks on public works contracts. A sixth warrant has been served relating to the fraudulent bankruptcy of the Banco Ambrosiano in 1982. The resignation came after 24 hours of remarkable political events. On Wednesday, Mr Claudio Martelli, once Mr Craxi's closest political ally and possible successor, resigned from his justice ministry portfolio and membership of the Socialist party after being implicated in the scandal. Yesterday morning, Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister and Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, the Milan attorney-general, were obliged to make public statements to scotch rumours that more senior figures in government and industry were in danger of being caught in the corruption scandal. For nearly an hour just before midday there was heavy selling of shares and government paper in the markets and the lira began to slide. However, intervention calmed the markets and brought prices and the lira parity back to the previous day's levels. The reaction of the markets underscored the extraordinary atmosphere of rumour and uncertainty caused by the ever widening investigations by Milan magistrates into corruption. Yesterday a special assembly of the Socialist party met to decide on a successor to Mr Craxi. Last night there were reports that the party leadership was nominating Mr Giorgio Benvenuto, a 55 year-old finance ministry official and former union leader. Mr Valdo Spini, a 47 year-old member of parliament considered to be on the party's left, had appeared a likely compromise candidate. Mr Martelli resigned on being informed he was under investigation, like Mr Craxi, for the fraudulent bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano. Milan magistrates have alleged they were involved in using a Swiss bank account to receive an illicit contribution from the late Mr Roberto Calvi, the head of Banco Ambrosiano who was found hanged in London in 1982. The contribution was allegedly made after a Dollars 50m loan from ENI, the Italian state oil concern. Craxi leaves party but music had already stopped Page 2 Italian stocks Page 35</p>

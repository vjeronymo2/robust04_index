			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NEW ZEALAND LEADER DASHES U.S. HOPES FOR END TO A-WARSHIP BAN  </P> <P> Dashing U.S. hopes, new Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer today said there will be  no change under his administration in the nation's anti-nuclear stance, which  led to U.S. warships being banned from New Zealand's ports.  </P> <P> Palmer also said his administration will be "less exciting" than that of his  predecessor, David Lange, who resigned Monday for health reasons.  </P> <P> Palmer, a 47-year-old lawyer, said he pales in comparison to the colorful  Lange, who for five years captured world attention by disputing with the United  States and France over nuclear issues. But he promised to pursue the Lange  vision of an independent New Zealand.  </P> <P> The United States welcomed Palmer's appointment, noting that he had spent  considerable time in the United States as an academic, and some officials  privately expressed hope that the nation's anti-nuclear policy would be  altered.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : SAVATAGE: MUSICALITY IN THE THRASHINGS  </P> <P> In a field crowded with cookie-cutter metal bands, at least give Savatage  credit for appearing to have been formed with a jagged can lid. At Anaheim's  Bandstand club on Wednesday, the quintet played with an intensity (somewhere  between Motorhead and Canada's Nomeansno) and modicum of originality that set  it apart.  </P> <P> Though singer Jon Oliva seems to have bought his voice down at Ed's Screech 'n'  Growl and the rest of the group had the amps set on "pummel," there was a  distinctive musicality to their thrashings. Guitarists Criss Oliva and  Christopher Caffery churned up some heaving dissonances that would have done  noise artist Glenn Branca proud.  </P> <P> Lyrically, Savatage (which headlines the Palace tonight) falls pretty much in  the post-apocalyptic doom school, though Wednesday the words were chiefly lost  in the tumult and an awful sound mix. It's scarcely ironic then that during the  anti-violence "Of Rage and War" the group's slam-dancing fans and the club's  bouncers were engaged in a limited ground war of their own.  </P> <P> Second-billed Cold Sweat delivered a pandering, rote-rock set capped by a  version of "I Just Want to Make Love to You" that sounded as if Foghat was its  idea of roots.

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Police back cut in senior staff numbers MANY POLICE officers favour abolishing some senior ranks to create a flatter management structure, according to research commissioned for the government's inquiry into police responsibility and rewards. The research, by Ernst &amp; Young, management consultants, is one of the most extensive examinations of the police conducted. Its findings make it probable that when the inquiry reports in May, it will recommend a simpler management structure and some form of performance-related pay. Some provincial police forces have already delegated more responsibility to local level, cutting down on chief superintendents. The Ernst &amp; Young survey says the ranks of chief superintendent and chief inspector are the most popular candidates among officers for abolition. The survey says an important aspect of change in the police service over recent years has been the 'injection of local innovation and experimentation with different management systems'. This trend has the potential to 'increase the responsibilities and accountability of individual officers'. Sir Patrick Sheehy, the chairman of BAT Industries who is chairing the inquiry, said the study had identified opportunities to improve accountability and operational effectiveness. Lord Edmund-Davies, who conducted the last inquiry into police pay and conditions in 1977-78, identified four factors that made police work unique  -the independent status of the constable; risk of assault and injury; prohibition of the right to strike; and disruption to family life. The new report says there is no evidence that these have changed.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bronfmans sell Trustco subsidiaries TORONTO'S Bronfman family is parting with another of its major businesses by selling Royal Trustco's operating subsidiaries to Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). RBC has agreed in principle to pay CDollars 1.65bn (USDollars 1.32bn) for the operations, which include mortgage and other lending, institutional and personal trust services, and investment management. Royal Trust had assets of CDollars 134bn under administration on December 31. The deal, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals, will increase RBC's corporate assets by about CDollars 14bn, or 10 per cent. The bank, Canada's biggest financial institution, had assets of CDollars 137bn on January 31. Trilon Financial, a Bronfman holding company which owns 47.5 per cent of Royal Trustco, said it would back the RBC offer. Trilon had initially proposed selling only part of its Royal Trust stake and contributing to an equity injection. Royal Trust was put up for sale after suffering heavy losses. These stemmed partly from the impact of recession on its core home mortgage business in Canada, but mostly from a costly acquisition spree in the US and Europe in the late 1980s. The value of its assets hasbeen written down by almost CDollars 900m in the past three years, and Royal Trust has either closed or sold almost all the foreign businesses which it bought in the 1980s. It continues, however, to own the UK-based Royal Trust Bank. Royal Trust said yesterday that it suffered a 1992 loss of between CDollars 850m and CDollars 900m. Under the agreement, Royal Trustco will retain CDollars 4.3bn of loans, about one third of them in the UK, and about one quarter non-performing. Prior to the Royal Trust sale, the Bronfman group had raised more than CDollars 2bn this year from the sale of controlling stakes in, among others, MacMillan Bloedel, the Vancouver-based forestry company, and John Labatt, the brewing and entertainment group. Mr Allan Taylor, RBC chairman, said yesterday that the acquisition of Royal Trust advanced 'by several years' the bank's expansion strategy. Canadian banks have been allowed to acquire trust and insurance companies only since mid-1992. RBC said it would finance the purchase partly through the issue of non-cumulative preferred shares, which qualify as tier one capital under BIS guidelines. It said it expected to have a tier one capital ratio 'in excess of' 6 per cent when the deal is closed. Its ratio now stands at 6.7 per cent.</p>

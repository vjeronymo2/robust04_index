			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan leads move into record territory Bourse performances were peppered with record highs yesterday, but downbeat views on German equities from four London sources - James Capel, Kleinwort Benson, Morgan Stanley and (in reiteration) Goldman Sachs - brought a sour note into the proceedings, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN moved into record territory as a buying spree by foreign and domestic investors spurred turnover to an all-time high of L1,030bn. The Comit index rose 8.63 to 636.20. While domestic investors were still sensitive to political developments in the run up to general elections on March 27, foreign buyers from Europe, Japan and the US were less inhibited. Montedison rose another L71 or 7 per cent to L1,089 and the huge volume of L166m shares reinforced speculation that someone was stake building. Ferruzzi added L41 to L1,781 in volume of 40.6m shares. Hoare Govett is forecasting a 25 per cent rise in the BCI index this year, after last year's 39 per cent advance, given the market's very strong liquidity, the improving macroeconomic picture, the cont-inuing privatisation process and the expectation of corp-orate earnings recovery. However, Merrill Lynch said that the turbulent trading of the last five months demonstrated how quickly confidence could come and go, adding that the market's price volatility should always be taken into account. The fact that Italy was likely to be exploited as a lagging market in Europe also raised warning flags about whether its recovery would be sustainable. ZURICH hit a record close for the third consecutive session, although late profit-taking brought prices back from their best levels. The SMI index added 3.9 to 3,095.2, having peaked at 3,110.3. Holderbank rose SFr37 to SFr977 after a recommendation from Credit Suisse. Oerlikon-Buhrle put on SFr9 or 6.4 per cent to SFr150 after one broker recommended a switch into the stock from Georg Fischer, SFr10 lower at SFr1,180. MADRID hit an early peak on the current theme of political and corporate renewal, but after an intraday 353.37 the general index subsided to 348.62 - a mere 0.22 up on the day, but still a closing high. OSLO's financials and industrials took over from a slightly weaker shipping sector as the market peaked again, the all-share index closing 6.88 higher at 673.76. STOCKHOLM majored on blue chips as the Affarsvarlden general index rose 21.1 to a new high of 1,560.2 in turnover of SKr2.7bn. Ericsson reversed its slide after Tuesday's downgrade by Goldman Sachs, and the B shares put on SKr9 to SKr358, while Volvo B advanced SKr16 to SKr653 helped by buy notes. BRUSSELS saw most of its activity in second line issues but the Bel-20 index still made a record high, climbing 5.98 to 1,514.60 in turnover of BFr2.7bn. FRANKFURT came off a day's high of 2,139.32 to close with the Dax only 5.97 higher at 2,125.14. Turnover rose from DM9.1bn to DM9.5bn. Capel's chief strategist, Mr Oliver Kamm, saw a stark contrast between Germany and other European prospects this year; Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley dropped Germany from 9.2 per cent to 6.5 per cent of his global model portfolio; Kleinwort underweighted the market and Goldman Sachs said again that it continued to underweight German equities in its global and European portfolios. Daimler ended DM20.50 higher at DM809 after higher Mercedes car sales forecasts for 1994. However, within the context of a change of stance to overweight on the European automotive sector, Mr Bob Barber of James Capel recommended a Daimler sale - 'based principally on the outlook for aerospace as well as the demanding rating'. PARIS dipped towards the close, disappointed that the Bank of France had made no move on interest rates. The CAC-40 index, after 2,299.52, closed 1.40 lower at 2,280.95, pressured by a downtrend in futures. LVMH improved FFr62 to FFr3,952 following an analysts meeting at which the group said that it expected to make a one-off gain of some FFr4.4bn following the change in its cross-shareholdings with Guinness announced last week. AMSTERDAM gained early ground before slipping back once more by the close, the AEX ending up 0.09 at 425.71 after a session high of 428.56. There was considerable interest among stocks selected by a poll of analysts on Dutch television on Wednesday night: Philips, Akzo, Ahold, Bols Wessanen and Borsumiji. Among these, Akzo slipped Fl 1.10 to Fl 209.70 after its shareholders approved plans for the merger with Nobel of Sweden. ISTANBUL dropped another 7.6 per cent, the composite index's fall of 1,615.04 to 19,513.6 making a five day local curency loss of 33.6 per cent before Wednesday's near 12 per cent devaluation of the lira.

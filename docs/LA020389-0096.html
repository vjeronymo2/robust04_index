			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: NEW RELEASES  </P> <P> Movies  </P> <P> Henry Jaglom's fascination with the subject of a film director in love bloomed  again in "Someone to Love" (Paramount, $79.95, R), which, like his "Always,"  will seem uniquely sensitive to some, embarrassingly personal (and virtually  unwatchable) to others. The 1988 comedy-drama features the last film appearance  by Orson Welles.  </P> <P> Fortunately, Paramount also has some Valentine-oriented oldies out this  weekend, all for $19.95:  </P> <P> "Love With the Proper Stranger" (1963) is a cynical/sweet love story largely  filmed on location in New York City. It stars Steve McQueen as a footloose  musician and Natalie Wood as the Macy's salesgirl who tries to tie that foot  down. Robert Mulligan directed. "The World of Suzie Wong" had William Holden,  Nancy Kwan, a big budget for its year (1960), and several touching moments, but  its American artist-tries-to-reform-Hong Kong-prostitute story still seems  flawed and overlong (129-minutes). It's a little more interesting, though, than  the tepid, black-and-white "September Affair" (1950), though the cast (Joseph  Cotten, Joan Fontaine, Jessica Tandy) and the music are good.  </P> <P> For the unromantic, there are three recent mush-less movies: "Border Radio"  (Pacific Arts, $59.95, R) a gritty, sub-Jim Jarmusch, black-and-white drama  starring local underground-rock musicians Chris D., John Doe and Dave Alvin;  "Uncle Meat" (MPI, $59.95), Frank Zappa's 20-year record of his career; or, if  Zappa isn't gross enough for you, "The Nest" (MGM/UA, $79.95, R), in which a  small town is overrun by murderous cockroaches. Roger Corman produced.  </P> <P> Other Videos  </P> <P> If you're a fan of the man, you've probably already seen most of what's  contained in "Bruce Springsteen: Video Anthology, 1978-1988" (CMV, $24.98),  because it's simply a collection of the great singer-songwriter's often  disappointing MTV-aimed videos. . . . "Talk Radio" star Eric Bogosian portrays  a variety of obnoxious guys in "Eric Bogosian's Funhouse" (Pacific Arts,  $24.95), a 60-minute record of his one-man stage show.  </P> <P> "Margaret Mead and Samoa" (Brighton, $89.95) is a 51-minute documentary that  examines the anthropologist's findings and theories regarding Polynesian  society. For those who don't mind the overly high price, the information number  is (800) 542-5554. On the other end of the price spectrum, one of the  best-selling how-to video experts has yet another golfing-tips tape out: "Bob  Mann's Golf: The Specialty Shots" (Simitar, $9.95). Or, if you've given up the  links out of frustration, you can watch others suffer in "Just Missed, Dammit!"  (Paramount, $19.95), a compilation of golf goofs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Review  </P> <P> ****"The Complete Yellowstone."Holiday. $29.98. Information: (213) 945-3325.  </P> <P> Just because Holiday makes "travel" tapes doesn't mean its videocassettes on  national parks, etc., are any less artfully done or any less watchable than PBS  and National Geographic documentaries on the same subjects. Russ Finley's  superbly composed photography and pleasant narration, plus nice, unobtrusive  music (and a lack of travelogue-ish false gaiety) highlight this 60-minute  guide to major features of the great Western wilderness -- from boiling geysers  to calm lakes and meadows, with an emphasis on wildlife. While the tape doesn't  get into some aspects of the area that more in-depth views have (history,  controversies, etc.), that isn't necessarily a minus for people who just want  to know what to see when visiting -- i.e., you don't have to sit through  something like the sad animal-in-distress sequence that ends a related video,  "Yellowstone in Winter." Like the park itself, "The Complete Yellowstone" is a  scenic wonder. TERRY ATKINSON  </P></p>

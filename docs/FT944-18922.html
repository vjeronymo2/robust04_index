Although the government is formally committed to reform, he said, 'there are questions in the document still to be decided.' The success of Ukrainian reform depends on Mr Kuchma's ability to overcome opposition from farming and industrial lobbies well represented in parliament and the cabinet of ministers, which Mr Masol heads.</p>

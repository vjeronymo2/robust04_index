			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksandr </F> Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow, 30 Apr -- One would like to hope that  today's meeting will break the ice of suspicion and hostility,  which still exists in relations between Russia and Latvia,  stated Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis at a news conference  which took place after his talks with Russian President Boris  Yeltsin.    Evaluating the package of documents signed in the course of  the talks, he said that he views them "as a unified whole and as  a regrettable necessity with which history has presented us.  There are probably some mistakes and contradictions in these  documents, but we view them as a single package which has only  one aim -- to normalize relations between the two states,"  Ulmanis stressed. Having expressed the hope that the parliaments  of the both countries will ratify the documents signed in  Moscow, the Latvian president has refrained from speculations on  how soon this might happen.    Guntis Ulmanis stressed that "feeling responsibility for the  future of these two neighboring states, he reached full mutual  understanding" with the Russian president on all the issues  discussed. [punctuation as received]    In the view of Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, "the  most significant result of the talks was the accord on the  introduction of most favored nation status in the relations  between Russia and Latvia on 1 June." He stressed that a treaty  on economic cooperation and trade is already practically ready,  enabling the adopted decisions to be implemented in such a short  time. Birkavs expressed hope that the visit by Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, during which documents on economic  cooperation between the two countries are expected to be signed,  will take place in the second half of May.</p>

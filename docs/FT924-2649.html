			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Letter: EC's 'use-it-or-lose-it' air slots decision a real breakthrough Sir, One is certainly entitled to beware of UK ministers bearing gifts from Brussels. However, the first hard-won step (discussed in your editorial 'Air Waves', December 9) in regulating the allocation of take-off and landing slots does actually amount to the breakthrough that Mr John MacGregor, UK transport secretary, claims it to be. In emphasising that slots are privileges that may ultimately be withdrawn in the Community interest and are not national rights which are inviolate under the Treaty of Rome, the Council of Ministers has brought the legal position in the air transport sector more into line with the present Commission's policy. That is, in relation to certain intellectual property rights and the exclusive rights of public enterprises - rights hitherto considered untouchable unless actually discriminatory and protectionist. Clearly much still needs to be done; the 'use-it-or-lose-it' principle in relation to slots falls some way short of recent more radical measures such as effectively striking down (albeit belatedly) the UK TV listings copyright and abolishing some exclusive rights in the telecommunications sector. However, in taking one more step towards a free (as opposed to a common) market, the Community has confirmed its relatively recent policy of attacking restrictions of competition where they really originate, namely within the member states and not the private sector. It is to be hoped that, subsidiarity notwithstanding, the seeds that have been planted lately under the present Commission will not fall on stony ground in the next.

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Budget rates This week's almost imperceptible rise in the market despite the half-point base rate cut may be no more than a signal that it is better to travel than arrive. Equally it may indicate a sensible level of caution ahead of the Budget. Yet there are hints that investors are beginning to baulk at paying prospective multiples of over 20 times for a market where a strong earnings recovery is far from assured. While the Confederation of British Industry's reduced growth estimate for 1994 might simply be a last minute hint to the chancellor, the market is starting to take seriously the cautions from company chairmen. Such strength as there was in the market apparently came from Lloyd's investment trust funds being parked in equities. Still, unless the chancellor savages the pension funds' tax benefits or raises taxes very sharply, equities will probably consolidate. Short term rates may not fall again soon, but with the inflation outlook still extremely favourable, the interest rate cycle may not have bottomed yet. Prospects for gilts hinge on the Budget projections of the deficit, though given the ease with which this year's requirement has been raised, there seems little risk of a significant bout of nerves soon. International factors will probably be the decisive influence. On the one hand, economic news from continental Europe continues to be poor; on the other, stronger growth in the US raises the prospect of steadily climbing bond yields and the possibility of a tightening by the Federal Reserve. If that process starts in earnest UK equities will need that earnings recovery to maintain their poise.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries sell-off triggers sharp declines in European sector A sell-off in the US market triggered sharp declines in European bond markets, sparking fears that a rise in US short-term rates could trigger a repatriation of funds invested in European bond markets. Against this background, the best performers were the more peripheral European markets, while French and German bond prices fell about  3/8 point. The Italian bond market rallied strongly yesterday morning, after Prime Minister Carlo Ciampi's offer to resign prompted hopes of a rapid move towards dissolving parliament and new elections. But as the news was discounted, prices were dragged down with other markets in the afternoon. The 10-year BTP future on Liffe fell back to 117.80, slightly down on the previous night's close, and substantially off its high yesterday of 118.62. Danish bonds fell  1/4 point, but continued to outperform the German bond market, bringing the yield spread against bunds down to new lows, following comments by Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the central bank governor, about bringing Danish interest rates below those in Germany. The response to these comments in both the bond and currency markets suggests that traders are taking a sanguine view of this possibility. The spread between 10-year Danish and German bonds has tightened from 59 basis points at the end of last year to 36 basis points. 'In the coming months, talk of short rates potentially falling below Germany should see the market rallying further towards the 15 basis point level,' said Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW. UK government bonds also took their cue from the other overseas bond markets, and tumbled in the afternoon to close  3/4 of a point lower on the day. The market kicked off on a firm note, climbing by as much as a  1/4 of a point, but was pulled down by the fall in the US Treasury market. Five-year gilts ended about a quarter point lower while long-dated issues fell as much as  3/4 of a point and index-linked issues lost over a point. The market is expecting the Bank of England to announce the preliminary details of the next gilt auction today , with speculation focusing on a long-dated auction stock. Japanese bond prices fell as much as  1/2 a point, with unusually heavy trading in the European day, as traders became nervous about plans to sell Japanese government bonds outright to the market. The sales would be used to finance the government's economic stimulus package. The market seems worried about oversupply as the Ministry of Finance plans to issue some Y1,000bn of 10-year bonds in the week starting on January 24. US Treasury prices fell at both ends of the maturity range yesterday following a stronger-than-expected monthly retail sales report. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 1 3/16 at 99 3/4 , yielding 6.263 per cent. The two-year note was also weaker, down  5/32 at 100 1/4 , to carry a yield of 4.098 per cent. Prices eased from the opening in spite of a promising inflation report, which showed that consumer prices in December rose by only 0.2 per cent, or by 0.3 per cent excluding the volatile food and energy components. Overall, consumer prices rose by 2.7 per cent in 1993, the smallest rise since 1986. These figures were in line with forecasts, and had little impact on sentiment, but it was an unexpectedly strong 0.8 per cent gain in December retail sales that sparked the selling. The increase was much bigger than analysts had forecast, and raised fears that further down the road strong retail sales will start to push prices higher.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, March 22 (AFP) -- Governor Chris Patten  on Tuesday defended British changes to Hong Kong's constitution,  saying any amendments could not come into force without the  blessing of the colony's legislature.    "I think it's a storm in a tea spoon," Patten told reporters  after Sunday's press disclosure that London had quietly drafted  key changes to the Letters Patent before the Legislative Council  had a chance to debate them.    "Nothing has been done secretively," he said, adding: "I  have to say as arguments go, this one is an extremely dead  sheep."    The changes, approved in July by the Privy Council in  London,  notably limit the number of directly elected Legislative Council  seats to 20 in the run-up to Hong Kong's handback to China in  1997. The change is part of the second and final half of  Patten's controversial political reform package, which  legislators are to debate and adopt before mid-July.    Several pro-democracy politicians intend to press for a  greater number of directly elected members -- but by quietly  changing the Letters Patent, it appeared that London was trying  to pre-empt them, political observers say. But Patten, in his  first comment on the issue, said the changes were a necessary  step in the reform process, "so that the bill could then be  brought into line with our constitutional arrangements and vice  versa."    He added -- as legal experts already have -- that the  amendment would only become effective after it is published in  Hong Kong's official government gazette. He also said the last  word rested with legislators.    "I suppose that the Legislative Council could either amend  the bill in a way which made it allegedly more democratic or in  a way which allegedly made it less democratic," he said.    Britain and China agree that a new legislature to be elected  in 1995 will consist of 20 directly elected seats -- with the  remaining 40 to be filled by an electoral college, special  interest groups and industrial sectors. But they have fallen  out badly over the details of the crucial polls, with China  declaring that it will scrap Patten's reforms in 1997 and hold  fresh elections based on its own, as yet undefined criteria.</p>

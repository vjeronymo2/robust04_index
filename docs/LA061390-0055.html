			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTING WITH BOB;  </P> <P> MAN VS. MICROCHIP  </P> <P> After four days of racing, I'm $30 in the black with my second bankroll. Not  bad considering what happened to the first one, but not great after my $190  profit on the first day with the second.  </P> <P> Misery loves company, however, and thank goodness for the computer thus far.  Perhaps it needs to re-read "DOS Kapital."  </P> <P> For today I'll bet $15 exactas from Mittens And Mink to Rash Decision and Blue  Sonata.  </P> <P> Bob's Sunday Bankroll $2,070  </P> <P> Sunday's Loss $40  </P> <P> Current Bankroll $2,030  </P> <P> The computer seems to distrust the main track at Hollywood Park. It is sticking  with the turf for its bets today: a $40 exacta of Belle Poitrine to Bragora, a  $20 exacta reversing the two and a $10 exacta box of Belle Poitrine, Bragora  and Imperial Star in the ninth race.  </P> <P> Computer's Sunday Bankroll $1,912.50  </P> <P> Sunday's Loss $60  </P> <P> Current Bankroll $1,852.50  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] La Paz, 30 Dec (EFE) -- Bolivian President Gonzalo  Sanchez de Lozada today announced that 1994 will be the year of  great structural changes, when the traditional "come back  tomorrow" of public administration will become a thing of the  past.    Sanchez de Lozada today, Thursday, met with the local press  at a rural spa in Cochabamba, where he is resting for a few days  to "recharge his batteries" before facing the challenge of the  change beginning with the preparation of the nation's general  budget.    The president explained that the budget proposal he will  send  to congress will be accompanied by several draft laws "which  will give meaning to the budget" and which will implement the  structural changes.    "The first drafts show that more than half of the budget  will  be earmarked for the social area," Sanchez de Lozada said,  because "great structural changes must be made to cover the  growing social needs, to serve as the basis of the coming year:  capitalization, educational reform, law against corruption,  people's participation, and simplification of bureaucracy."    The 63-year-old Bolivian president said that for 1994 there  will be an increase [in salaries] of 7.5 percent in order to  maintain the purchasing power of the salary and that will be  equal to the inflation rate calculated for this year.    "If we begin with greater increases, we will have higher  inflation, greater deficit, and a lower level of economic  growth," Sanchez de Lozada said, and asked whether it was worth  having considerable increases, which would later be overcome by  the increases in prices.    He ruled out the reported increase in fuel prices which  prompted the increase in prices and hoarding of other products,  and added that he will adopt other measures to improve income,  such as reducing the tax rates and increasing the tax base.    Sanchez de Lozada said that a system to simplify state  administration transactions will be implemented next year, thus  seeking "to eliminate the torment the citizens" must go through  when they are involved in these transactions and to eliminate  from public offices the "come back tomorrow."    He ruled out any change in his cabinet. "It was so difficult  for me to organize it," he said. He added that if it does not  yield the expected results in the future, there might be some  changes.    He compared the structure of the Council of Ministers he  inherited from the previous government with a "Model-T Ford with  which we could not win a formula one race." He added: "I built a  race car that could not start because it was not well tuned."    Sanchez de Lozada was optimistic over the state of his "race  car" although he admitted that "if we begin to run strong and if  some part breaks down we will have to fix it quickly" to meet  the expectations of the Bolivians who want to see the government  working.    The Bolivian president will return from Cochabamba, 383  kilometers east of La Paz, next week.</p>

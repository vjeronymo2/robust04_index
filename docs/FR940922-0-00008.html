The following documentation shall accompany each such request for a draw: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) If such request is submitted within 30 days following the close of the Licensee's fiscal quarter, the request shall be accompanied by a Financial Statement on SBA Form 468 (Short Form) reflecting the Licensee's condition as of the close of that fiscal quarter; otherwise, the request shall be accompanied by a formal statement of no material adverse change in financial condition since the filing of the most recent SBA Form 468 (Long or Short Form). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) A certified statement executed by an officer of the Licensee or of a corporate general partner of the Licensee, or by an individual that is authorized to act as or for a general partner of the Licensee, as the case may be, representing that to the best of its knowledge and belief the Licensee is in compliance with all provisions of the Act and SBA regulations (i.e., no unresolved regulatory or statutory violations) or a statement as to the specific nature of any violations of which it is aware. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) A statement that the proceeds are needed to fund a particular Small Concern, which statement shall also include the name and address of the Small Concern, the amount of the Licensee's proposed Financing, and the scheduled closing date thereof.

Failure to submit an accurate Form 1031 or satisfactory written explanation of failure to close will preclude consideration of any subsequent draw requests, and may be deemed an event affecting the Licensee's good standing or constituting consent to restricted operations, as the case may be. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Draw process.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By submitting a request for a draw, a Licensee is conclusively presumed to have authorized SBA to purchase its Preferred Security, or to have authorized SBA or any agent or trustee designated by SBA to guaranty its Debenture or Participating Security and to sell it with SBA's guarantee, to enter into any agreements (and to bind the Licensee to such agreements) that may be necessary to effect: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) The sale of the Licensee's security to a short-term investor, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Its purchase on the Licensee's behalf (or by the Licensee itself), and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) The subsequent pooling of that security with other securities with the same maturity date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provided, however,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> That the Licensee shall retain the right to repurchase its securities upon notice to SBA at least 10 days prior to the cut-off date for the pool in which the Licensee's security is to be included by tendering the face amount of the Debenture, or the face amount of the Participating Security plus Earned Prioritized Payments, as the case may be, to the short-term investor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Debentures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An SBA guaranteed Debenture shall be sold to a short-term investor at a discount calculated with reference to a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with Section 303(b) of the Act (but without regard to any interest subsidy to which the Licensee may be otherwise entitled), as if the maturity date of the Debenture were the next scheduled date for the sale of pool certificates:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provided, however,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> That if the actual sale of pool certificates shall take place after the scheduled date, the Licensee shall pay to the short-term investor, on the actual sale date, an additional sum equal to daily interest as scheduled on the Debenture, at the same rate, from the scheduled sale date to the actual sale date. Failure to make such interest payment on the closing date shall constitute an event giving rise to a condition affecting the Licensee's good standing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Participating securities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Licensee's Participating Security shall be sold to a short-term investor for a sum equal to the face amount thereof.

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / 'Beware the paper in Vietnam tiger': Bureaucracy, a sketchy legal system and ramshackle infrastructure THE SIREN call of Vietnam's much touted economic takeoff could lure many foreign investors into costly mistakes, according to financial advisers who have studied the country's business environment. The hoo-ha over a tough, canny people hungry to emulate and even outstrip other Asian 'miracle' economies overlooks the stifling bureaucracy, sketchy legal system, ramshackle infrastructure and a dearth of domestic funds. Mr Chris Bruton, of Bangkok-based Dataconsult, said: 'People are not going to hang back - they are going to jump like a lot of sheep over a fence into the river and some of them will get drowned.' Excitement about Vietnam was mounting well before President Bill Clinton said earlier this month he was lifting US objections to renewed lending by multilateral agencies. This allows the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to start funding the construction of roads, power stations, telecommunications networks and the like. Infrastructure development might be a prerequisite for speedy growth but few experienced observers have been tempted - as the Vietnamese sometimes have - to view big-project lending as a panacea for the country's economic ills. Mr Hien Tran Trung of Ernst and Young, the first leading accounting firm to set up in the country, said: 'The country has seen its social, physical and intellectual infrastructures destroyed (by decades of war and political campaign). Yet after effectively opening its doors only three years ago it has inflation under control, a stable currency and has attracted Dollars 5.4bn in investments. That must be encouraging.' However, Mr Ray Eaton, chairman of the Export Development Trading Corporation which has several medium-sized investment's in the country, said: 'Expectations are far too high all round. The Vietnamese are being told by their own media that soon everyone will have a Mercedes-Benz and a gold Rolex.' Mr Bruton describes suggestions that Vietnam is at the same economic stage as Thailand was 20 years ago as outlandish. 'I've been horrified by people gearing up to invest in Vietnam as if it was a Tiger in the making - it's nothing like that. I was living in Thailand in 1973, and visiting Vietnam. I can tell you Vietnam now is nothing like as far advanced as Thailand was in 1973. It's more like Thailand probably was in 1953,' Mr Bruton said. Vietnam has shown a remarkable capacity for recovery since the scrapping of neo-Stalinist state planning in the late 1980s and the loss of the former Soviet Union's financial help. There has been an explosion of small businesses and the country has switched from being a rice importer to the world's third largest rice exporter. Mr Peter Brimble, the managing director of Seamico Business Information and Research, said: 'There's something electric in the air. You have the feeling something's going to happen in Vietnam - that there'll be a break-out; very quick growth.' In the supposedly crippling absence of loans from the international lending agencies real economic growth was estimated at 8.3 per cent last year. But Mr Bruton insists: 'In 10 years from now Vietnam will be very interesting; 20 years from now very interesting indeed and 30 years from now it will perhaps be like Thailand is today.' Simple arithmetic shows that even if Vietnam achieves its ambitious 9.5 per cent annual growth target for a decade the country will only be half as rich as Thailand. Foreign companies are usually advised, as far as possible, to drip-feed money into Vietnam: a lot of trauma lies between one of the world's most open investment laws and its practical application. Privatisation, or 'equitisation', has hardly begun; in the meantime joint venture partners are state-owned companies. Tsao Chun-ya, general manager of Taiwan's Yao Teh group, a property company that built Vietnam's first glass-walled office tower, told Taiwanese journalists of the frustration of dealing with the ostensibly autonomous representative of state companies: 'When they hold a meeting with you, they take out a notebook and pencil, jot down your questions, go back to report and give you a response the next time around.' Attempts to circumvent red-tape in the traditional Asian fashion often come unstuck. One Thai businessman lamented the lack of ethics among Vietnamese officials: 'In China if you bribe someone you usually get something. In Vietnam you're more often than not just throwing your money away.' One western investor said that the Vietnamese had become 'progressively more rapacious'. 'It's turning me off the country - perhaps they've been poor so long they've lost a sense of decency.' In the hotel bars of Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) and Hanoi tales are told of joint venture partners suddenly saying 'what joint venture?', of loggers belatedly discovering their newly purchased logs are riddled with old bullets, and of fish farms that mysteriously lose all their fish. The difficulty of isolating key decision makers in a country which still values consensus makes appeals to reason, and bribery for that matter, ineffective. Taiwan has invested more than any other country, yet Mr Huang Chei-yien, of the China External Trade Development Council's Ho Chi Minh City office, urged his countrymen to 'double your estimate of time and costs'. Unesco officials admit privately that the government's much touted 95 per cent literacy rate is functionally much lower. Entrepreneurs are advised to put in a lot of foot slogging on the ground in Vietnam; to tailor - as far as possible - any investment to fit the authorities' idea of a good project, probably exporting or import-substituting; to ensure, where appropriate, that your joint venture partner has adequate access to supplies of raw materials; and be tough - everything is negotiable in Vietnam.</p>

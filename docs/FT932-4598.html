			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (24): Turning point for Fokker - The Netherlands EARLIER this year, Fokker, the Dutch aeroplane maker, gave up its independence. However, it gained a rich source of financial support and capital when it agreed to a 51 per cent takeover by Deutsche Aerospace of Germany. The transaction, approved by the European Commission last month, marks a turning point in Fokker's 74-year history and comes after more than a year of controversy in the Netherlands. The long, tortuous negotiations between Dasa and the Dutch government, which had the power of veto because of its 32 per cent stake in Fokker's share capital, were complicated by emotional and political sensitivities that were inevitably raised by the sale of one of the country's premier industrial establishments to a big German rival. Speaking just before he signed the final contract in late April, Mr Jurgen Schrempp, Dasa's chairman, acknowledged that 'never in history has a substantial industrial marriage between the Netherlands and Germany worked.' But, he added, 'this one is going to work.' The link-up, designed to promote a restructuring of Europe's regional aircraft sector, comes at a time when both Dasa and Fokker are shedding jobs as they grapple with poor demand in the world market for new aircraft. Both companies have recently suffered a decline in profits. But regardless of the short-term difficulties, the partnership is designed to be a long-term response to far-reaching changes in global aviation, including the trends towards mergers and consolidation among the airlines themselves. 'The time of the national company is past,' says Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn, Fokker's president. For Fokker, the attraction of the deal lies in the financial strength of Dasa, part of the Daimler-Benz industrial group. Dasa has bought half of the government's 32 per cent holding and also acquired new shares in Fokker to lift its stake in a new Fokker holding company to 51 per cent. The share issue, plus a bond issue and long-term loans provided by the Dutch state, mean that Fokker will benefit from total proceeds of more than Fl900m (Dollars 500m), ensuring its future. A first fruit of the Fokker-Dasa partnership was the recent decision by Fokker to appoint Mr Horst Steinberg, a senior vice president at Dasa's Dornier subsidiary, as the company's new head of sales in Asia and the Middle East Mr Schrempp has suggested that Fokker may take on the marketing of Dornier's planes - a 19-seater and a 33-seater turboprop - but no decision has yet been taken. Fokker and Dasa will face a difficult decision on when to design and build the Fokker 130, a 130-seater aircraft that is expected eventually to replace the Dutch company's current jet, the Fokker 100. However, Fokker is close to a formal decision to launch the Fokker 70, a 79-seat jet. A prototype made its maiden flight in April, and the new aircraft is scheduled to be put on public display for the first time during the trade days of the Paris Air Show. A central element in the contract regulating Fokker's future under Dasa's control is that Fokker will be responsible for the future design and production of aircraft in the 65 to 130-seat range. This stipulation enabled Fokker to argue that the company will remain a full-fledged aircraft manufacturer with a wide scale of activities ranging from engineering and production to sales and product support, thereby overcoming objections in the Netherlands to the deal. Fokker also insisted on this 'leadership' role in regional aircraft partly because Dasa had made clear from the beginning that it intends to bring in its two partners in the 'Regioliner' design project, Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy, as shareholders in Fokker, in effect turning the Dutch company into a four-way 'Airbus' of the regional aeroplane market. Aerospatiale and Alenia are expected to come on board in three years' time, when the Dutch government is due to sell off its remaining Fokker shares, ending state participation in the company. However, this future stage of the Fokker-Dasa deal is likely to face more intense scrutiny - and possibly objections - from the European Commission. The expected four-way participation later this decade will also bring to a head arrangements for the future of the Fokker 50, a turboprop that competes directly with the ATR-42, a joint product of the Italian and French companies. Dasa has given no guarantees about the future of the Fokker 50, saying only that it will have to continue proving itself in the marketplace.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 23 Feb -- Vladimir Shumeyko, the chairman of  the Federation Council, expressed a suggestion that this year a  treaty may be signed between the Russian Federation and  Chechnya, which is similar to the one with Tatarstan. Answering  journalists' questions at today's "round table" on the situation  in the Caucasus, he reported that the upper chamber of the  parliament plans to hold parliamentary hearings in connection  with the situation in the Caucasus, and all the sides will be  invited there. "We want to hear all points of view, to weigh  them up and to find our position," he noted.    According to the speaker, the issue of mutual relations  between North Ossetia and Ingushetiya is complex, it touches not  just on their interests, but also the problems of settling the  situation in neighboring regions, in particular in South Ossetia  and Georgia. As to Chechnya, this problem is "extremely complex  and delicate." According to Vladimir Shumeyko, one needs to take  into consideration the fact that the Chechen Republic has been  existing for two years, and it has a publicly elected president.  Now, he reported, a process is being observed, when the people  are looking for ways out of the situation which has been formed.  Not everyone believes that Chechnya should exist outside  Russia. He also reported that the republic has public movements  and a Provisional Council of the Chechen Republic that aim at  resolving the issue of the coexistence of Chechnya and the  Russian Federation. After the treaty with Tatarstan is  concluded, one should focus all efforts on resolving the issue  with Chechnya, the parliamentarian stressed. Russia stands only  to gain from signing a treaty with Chechnya."    Commenting on the treaty with Tatarstan, Vladimir Shumeyko  noted that he "does not see a threat in it." He hopes that in  March elections will be held in Tatarstan, and two deputies will  join the Federation Council. The treaty with Tatarstan "is  executed in strict agreement with the Russian Constitution and  the Federation Treaty," he stressed. The speaker warned against  the opinion that "if a treaty is being concluded with a member  of the Federation, then that member is leaving the Federation."  "All it means is that new relations are being formed within the  Federation at a different level", he concluded.</p>

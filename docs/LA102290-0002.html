			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN IN MEN'S LOCKER ROOMS  </P> <P> As an old male chauvinist, the article by Lutdke caused me a pain in my limited  thinking processes.  </P> <P> Since I have been consistently pro-choice on the abortion issue and feel this  is a gender issue that should be decided by women, I have to believe that the  right to privacy is valid.  </P> <P> Now we have the locker room issue. Do these athletes have a right to privacy?  </P> <P> You missed the obvious solution to the problem. Throw all of the reporters out  of the locker rooms -- male and female. Women have many fights to win in the  battle of the sexes. This one should end in a draw.  </P> <P> GLENN R. YOKUM, Riverside  </P></p>

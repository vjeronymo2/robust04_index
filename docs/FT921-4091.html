			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / South African business swings behind a 'yes' vote SOUTH AFRICANS are wild about cricket, and ecstatic about their team's recent triumphs in the World Cup. But instead of hailing victory, yesterday's South African newspapers carried an advert picturing an overgrown cricket field with broken wickets and a torn ball. The message: a 'no' vote in next week's referendum will mean that South Africa will again be shut out of international sport. 'Without reform, South Africa hasn't got a sporting chance.' The full-page advert was funded, not by the ruling National party, but by South African business which is spending R3.4m (Pounds 680,000) to campaign for a 'yes' vote in the referendum on political reform next Tuesday. Some two thirds of the 'yes' camp's total advertising budget is coming from businessmen who fear that their chance of returning to world markets will be sabotaged, yet again, by politics. The political liberalisation of the past two years has already made a huge difference to the lives of most white businessmen. They have been welcomed abroad, where before they were shunned; they have glimpsed a light at the end of the 40-year tunnel of apartheid isolation. Now they are terrified that a vote in favour of reintroducing apartheid will provoke unprecedented international retribution. 'A 'no' vote would be a guarantee for disaster,' says Mr P F Retief, chairman of Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, one of the largest mining houses. He has written to white employees to urge a 'yes' vote. 'If we cannot sell our production because of re-imposed sanctions, both your job and my job will be threatened. If money flees the country, interest rates will be raised even higher and the recession will deepen. Unemployment will rise further with all its consequences ..like the crime and violence we are already experiencing and this will certainly worsen,' he argues in his letter. Mr Peter Mackenzie, director of the Private Sector Referendum Fund, insists the campaign is 'non party-political'. It was launched by one of the country's largest media groups, Times Media, and has had contributions from across the white bus-iness spectrum, not to mention offers of help from black business as well. Residual suspicion of white South Africa has hampered the fund's international campaign - the Toronto Globe and Mail refused to print an advert urging expatriate South Africans in Canada to vote 'yes'. The fund also bought billboards at the World Cup cricket grounds - matches are widely televised in South Africa - and distributed pro-reform T-shirts to fans. But the billboards were withdrawn when a rival group tried to purchase advertising for the 'no' camp. Mr Mackenzie says the campaign's adverts are about to become 'more dramatic and blunt'. The toughest advert so far had an ironic twist to it, though: it showed an operating table littered with used gauze and broken needles, and the message 'without reform, South Africa won't get better'. For many whites, those are the images associated with health care in independent African countries. Many believe they can avoid such a fate by reaffirming apartheid - not by voting 'yes' for reform.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (17): Bargains still to be struck - The various obstacles to reaching agreement on harmonising national systems of credit support / Credit harmonisation GETTING PAID: reports on the way exporters tackle the problems of collecting debts, identifying sources of revenue and securing payment Weeks, perhaps months, of haggling still lie ahead as European governments try to reach an accord on harmonising their national systems of medium term export credit support - a crucial issue for capital goods exporters and their sub-contractors across the region. Although much progress has been made towards agreement on some of the fine technical details, it will probably take direct negotiation at ministerial level to break the deadlock between Britain and the other 11 member states over the level of cover to be allowed for buyer credits. A compromise could be hard to achieve because most EU states see the capture of large projects and capital equipment customers overseas as an important part of their trading strategy and a legitimate national interest justifying government intervention. Over the past few decades, individual countries have evolved different ways to provide this support. All are wary of sacrificing those aspects of national schemes that seem to give them a particular competitive advantage. Exporters want to see a system that combines the most supportive aspects of all the different national schemes, but European Commission officials trying to draft a compromise are also under pressure from national finance ministries to reduce the public expenditure cost of export credit by limiting the scope of cover or raising premiums. Everyone agrees that a middle path must be struck. But there are fierce arguments over how that should be done and which aspects of existing national systems should be sacrificed. Most contentious of all remains the level of cover for buyer credits. At present, Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) is alone in the EU in providing 100 per cent cover. All the other 11 states would like to set a maximum limit of 95 per cent - they believe that the exporter and his bank should have to take at least a minority share of the risk on any deal. They are willing to allow 100 per cent only where a European exporter's bid is in competition with a non-EU tender backed with a 100 per cent credit guarantee, usually from Japan and the US. UK banks and industry are strongly supportive of the UK government's argument for maintaining the right to offer 100 per cent. 'British exporters are determined to ensure that there is no erosion in the cover available from ECGD, as they are acutely aware of America's determination to compete effectively with 100 per cent cover and competitive premium rates,' says Keith Johnson, chairman of the British Exporters Association. 'We must wake up in Europe to the fact that this type of introspective legislation will only diminish job opportunities and reduce foreign earning capacity.' Elsewhere, views differ markedly. The Dutch, for example, are keen to minimise any government subsidy for capital goods exports. 'What we would favour is 95 per cent, because the exporter should have a certain amount of own risk,' says Anne van't Weet, managing director at national credit insurer NCM and the company's representative at the EU negotiations. Although project and capital goods business is less important for the Netherlands than for the EU's larger economies, France and Germany also favour a maximum 95 per cent ceiling. For German companies, 95 per cent cover would actually represent an increase in support above the 85 to 90 per cent currently offered them by export credit agency Hermes (on behalf of the government). Furthermore, the proposed EU scheme would cover interest charges to foreign buyers who pay late, an extra protection not offered under the existing German system. In France the plans for export credit reform seem to have aroused little concern, perhaps because the proposals discussed so far are quite similar to the existing French scheme. 'Our members have more pressing problems to worry about,' says an official with the Club des Exportations, the association representing more than 1,000 exporting firms. 'French companies have never been opposed to European harmonisation,' says a representative of the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 'Banks are generally satisfied with the proposals,' adds a spokesman for the AFB, the French banking association. Dominique Tuffrau-Barriant, who chaired the EU group of experts that has been discussing the options for export credit harmonisation, is an executive of French credit insurer Coface. Speaking as a Coface representative, she argues that the new suggested cover conditions are not much different from those already offered in most of the EU and do not favour any national approach over another. She maintains that the expert group recommendation represents the opinion of most member states. 'I can understand the concern felt by British exporters who can currently obtain up to 100 per cent cover from the ECGD in eligible cases. However, the fear of losing out to Japanese and US exporters does not justify rejecting the expert group's proposals,' Ms Tuffrau-Barriant says. 'Many different elements come into play in such cases and the 5 per cent difference in maximum cover is unlikely to be the determining factor.' French and Dutch concerns appear to centre mainly on premiums. They are relieved that Germany is abandoning its flat rate system - under which Hermes charged the same premium for all countries, from OECD markets to struggling African economies. On July 1 this year, Bonn will introduce a structure that categorises markets into five risk bands, with different levels of premium to match each band. This will mean higher premiums for difficult markets, but cheaper cover for sales to low risk countries. This is broadly similar to the proposed harmonised system for the EU as a whole. The EU scheme will also probably include a sixth category for markets that are 'off cover', although most governments will want the right to guarantee deals for category six markets where they have special 'political' concerns. For example, France may want to support key trade partners in sub-Saharan Africa or the Maghreb, while Britain also has special interests in Africa and the Middle East. Germany is anxious to assist markets in eastern Europe. The Dutch would like a much tougher interpretation of 'off cover'. If governments have special interests, they should support them with grants or aid-based loans, says Mr van't Veer. 'Call it aid and not credit insurance.' But even the Dutch have some national advantages they want to retain and which are opposed by other EU governments. The Netherlands is still arguing for the right to retain its 'negative risk description' in export credit policies. This puts the onus on the insurer to show that a claim is ill-founded rather than leaving the exporter to justify his right to a compensation payment. Clearly hard bargaining lies ahead before any harmonisation deal is done.</p>

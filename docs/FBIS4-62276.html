			<p>BFN     [Text] An explosion shook a residential area in Chechnya's  capital, Groznyy, on Tuesday [10 May]. It killed four people  and injured 10 more. Interfax's correspondents report that an  armed unit of the Chechen opposition, Ruslan Lobozanov's group,  is based there.    A prominent official from Chechnya's Interior Ministry told  Interfax that the mine was set by another criminal group for the  purpose of revenge. It was placed between the 3rd and the 4th  storeys of a building. The blast claimed the lives of two  Lobozanov militants and killed two local residents.    It is believed that this is a continuation of the events  that  took place earlier this year, when nine people died in an armed  clash between Lobozanov's men and another grouping. Lobozanov's  gang lost two men in that fire exchange.    After Tuesday's blast Lobozanov's men went in the direction  of their enemy's headquarters. According to the Interior  Ministry, it is doing its best now to stop the armed conflict  from getting out of control.</p>

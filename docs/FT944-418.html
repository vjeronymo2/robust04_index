			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Bangladesh MPs resign Opposition members of Bangladesh's parliament last night resigned en masse in an attempt to oust the government of Mrs Khaleda Zia, writes Reazuddin Ahmed in Dhaka. The opposition has been boycotting parliamentary sessions for 10 months to press home their demand for early polls conducted under a non-partisan caretaker government to allay the fear of election-rigging by the ruling party. The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party agreed to an opposition proposal that the prime minister resign 30 days before the next general election, due in February 1996. But a deal foundered on BNP demands that the opposition refrain from calling general strikes and blockades during the next year.</p>

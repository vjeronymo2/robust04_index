Militant Bosnian Muslims organized the  demonstrations without permission from local authorities, and  stoned the building, breaking windows and damaging doors on it.    Ambassador in the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry Zivadin  Jovanovic  said that the unprovoked demonstrations were violent, and the  German side was responsible for the damages caused on the  consulate building, the property of Yugoslavia. Ambassador  Jovanovic requested of German authorities to open a thorough  investigation, take adequate measures against the perpetrators  of the violence, and secure all necessary conditions for the  normal work and full security of the Yugoslav diplomatic and  consular missions and representatives in Germany.    Charge d'affaires of the German embassy in Belgrade Gerhard  Schwemgens said he regretted the deplorable incident, and  promised he would communicate the Yugoslav protest to his  government so that similar incidents would be prevented in  future.</p>

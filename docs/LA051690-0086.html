			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Eastern Says Advance Bookings Up Sharply: Eastern Airlines said its advance  bookings have improved dramatically. Eastern, which has been mired in Chapter  11 bankruptcy proceedings for more than a year, said it made 625,000 advance  bookings last week, nearly double its level a month ago. While the jump mainly  reflects Eastern's May 7 offer of bargain children's fares to Florida and a  money-back guarantee for first-class travelers, the naming of Martin Shugrue as  a trustee to run Eastern on April 18 has helped by bringing the carrier a  measure of stability, said Eastern Vice President George Brennan.  </P></p>

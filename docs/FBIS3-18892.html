			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri by an </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given; from the  "Mixer" program -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Fabio Fabbri, Defense Minister,  we have heard our soldiers say that they are ready to go to  Bosnia. You have reacted cautiously. Beniamino Andreatta, the  Minister of Foreign Affairs, has said, at last. Have you spoken  to each other?    [Fabbri] No, we have not spoken recently, but I see no  substantial or fundamental differences between Fabbri and  Andreatta.    [Correspondent] And so his "at last," and your caution are  the same thing?    [Fabbri] We ought to review the facts. We are still not  facing a request from the United Nations. Up until now, the  United Nations has had a rule discouraging countries bordering  the former Yugoslavia from participating.    [Correspondent] Do you know whether or not this UN rule  which  forbids or discourages the intervention of forces from  neighboring countries has been violated?    [Fabbri] I do not think there have been departures from this  rule, and I think that the United Nations should reflect because  once this rule has been violated then the rule has no validity  anymore anywhere in the world.    [Correspondent] Then this would be the first time?    [Fabbri] Yes, it would be when it happened and the result of  a choice, a very important deliberate choice.    [Correspondent] If the United Nations were to request this,  are you ready?    [Fabbri] In principle, we have already been ready to respond  to all UN requests. We have done so in Somalia and Mozambique.  Personally, I am convinced that a country's prestige depends, to  a large extent, on its capacity to respond to these requests.  In the matter under discussion the decision is still mainly to  be made at the United Nations.    [Correspondent] If the United Nations calls, Italy responds.  This is the point?    [Fabbri] Italy will study the problem. It will see...    [Correspondent, interrupting] Have you discussed it?    [Fabbri] For example, I would have no doubts about  intervening on the ground once a peace agreement had been  reached between the sides, if this were the situation. If, for  example, one of the sides in the conflict was not in agreement,  then this is an assessment that the United Nations has to make  beforehand. [sentence as heard] Therefore, that is why it is too  early to talk about this.    [Correspondent] But would the first to go be the San Marco  or  the Folgore regiments? Have you discussed this or is it still  too early?    [Fabbri] No, we have not discussed this because, if you want  my personal opinion, the United Nations, for reasons of  convenience, taking into account constitutional matters, should  not request this.    [Correspondent] Is this also because elections are to be  held  in Italy?    [Fabbri] This is a condition which the United Nations must  take into account. There is a dissolved parliament. It would  be difficult to undertake such a delicate mission, considering  the historic precedents and the geographical position without a  parliamentary vote.    [Correspondent] And this is one of the reasons for your  caution?    [Fabbri] It is one of the reasons for my caution and above  all a reason which the United Nations cannot fail but take into  account. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] At present, the Armed Forces -- we saw this  in the report before this interview -- have a great presence.  They also have prestige abroad and at home. Is there a risk  that the country is being militarized?    [Fabbri] Not at all.    [Correspondent] But is there a danger of a coup d'etat? We  have heard about such things recently.    [Fabbri] These rumors have no foundation. The Armed Forces  are a healthy organ of the nation -- security for the country,  not a danger.    [Correspondent] Were reports on an attack on the Saxa Rubra  radio and TV installations an invention or part of a  destabilizing game?    [Fabbri] I would call this the Saxa Rubra farce because the  investigators themselves say that the organizers ordered an  atomic submarine and 50 F-16's by fax. Think about it: Because  of a lack of resources we have been unable to lease 24 British  Tornados. Therefore, this was a subversive idea which could not  be carried out and was the fruit of the ideas of a group of  confused or excited people. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] So you can confirm that there is no danger  of  a coup d'etat in Italy?    [Fabbri] Absolutely none. Even to hypothesize about one is a  mistake, because there is no possible foundation, no link  between any lunatics who think about carrying out a coup by  taking over RAI and bombing parliament with nerve gas and the  activities of the Armed Forces. The Armed Forces are loyal and  faithful to the Constitution. Soldiers die for being faithful  to the oath of loyalty which they have made to the state.    [Correspondent] Thank you.</p>

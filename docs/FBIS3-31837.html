			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1300 GMT on 25 February within its  regular 4-minute newscast carries reports on situation in the  republic.    In a report on the situation in the zone covered by the 7th  Operations Group, Smail Terzic says that it is "very difficult  in the zone. The aggressor is incessantly launching shells and  destroying civilian buildings. Since the morning hours, he has  fired about 2,000 shells on the defense lines and the towns of  Tesanj and Maglaj. The situation in the zones covered by the  201st, 207th, 203d, and the 110th Glorious HVO [Croatian Defense  Council] Brigade is fierce, but our brave fighters are  withstanding all attacks. About 200 tank shells have been fired  at the regions of Kriz, Obli Kamen, and Filipovici. Moreover,  the enemy is bringing in new forces, mainly from Bosnian  Krajina, and several dozen guns and mortars have been brought to  the temporarily occupied region of Novi Seher. Since last  night, two enemy batteries of 122mm and 150mm are present in the  Potocani region, which means that the enemy has not given up his  offensive."    A studio announcer says that "our correspondent from Fojnica  reports that at about 1100 [1000 GMT] today, 12 projectiles from  a 128-mm multiple rocket launcher fell. Therefore, Ustasha  artillery hit civilian targets in the town for the third time in  a month. Some people are injured, but the final number is still  not known. Ustasha snipers are particularly active and are  opening fire along defense lines. They are active along the  entire zone covered by the 310th Mountain Brigade."</p>

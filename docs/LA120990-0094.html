			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WAS GIONIS TRIAL RECORDING ALTERED?  </P> <P> I just read the Dec. 5 stories by Dana Parsons ("Witness Box Massacre Not a  Pretty Sight") and Jerry Hicks ("Secret Recording Jolts Prosecution in Trial of  Dr. Gionis") about the apparent discrediting of prosecution witness Robert  Davis in the Gionis trial.  </P> <P> This should not have been such a decisive victory for the defense.  </P> <P> Why didn't the prosecution argue that the tape of the interview between Davis  and (Dr. Thomas A. Gionis' limo driver, Ray) Ruiz may have been altered? It's  entirely possible that the tape presented by the defense may be a copy of an  edited original.  </P> <P> If this evidence is as important as the story implies, it may be worthwhile for  the prosecution to have an audio specialist examine the tape.  </P> <P> I was under the impression that tape recordings and photographs are not  admissible evidence because they are so easily altered.  </P> <P> GORDON RUDD, Woodland Hills  </P></p>

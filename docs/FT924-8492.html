			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / World Trade News: EC stirs export credit hornets' nest - Plans to end government monopolies will run into flak THE EUROPEAN Commission is poised to stir a hornets' nest across Europe's insurance industry with plans to transfer short-term export credit activities from government agencies into private hands. For exporters, the reforms are likely to mean higher insurance premiums. For insurers, the critical worry will be getting reinsurance. The Commission has become entangled in disputes about where responsibility for reform should lie and how to proceed. Plans to put short-term export credit insurance for marketable risk into the hands of private insurers have been in preparation by the Commission's external affairs directorate (DG1) for almost a year. In recent months, the competition secretariat (DG4) has taken up the running, causing confusion about who is responsible for reform and delaying implementation. DG4 argues that, as long as government agencies provide commercial credit risk insurance, private sector competitors will remain unfairly disadvantaged. In a draft communication circulated inside DG4 officials complain that Ecu3.24bn (Pounds 2.59bn) are spent each year by EC member states to support their exporters, accounting for about 10 per cent of total state aid to industry. All export aid, they argue, 'is contrary to the spirit of the single market, where exporters and export credit insurers are in competition with one another on an equal basis.' They pinpoint six chief factors which distort competition between private and public export credit insurers and hinder the growth of private sector insurers: State guarantees: these allow state insurers to borrow on the capital markets more cheaply than private competitors and relieve insurers of pressure to reinsure their exposure. No obligation to hold proper reserves: this imposes additional financial costs on private insurers. Tax exemptions: these help both state insurers and those operating with state support. Subsidies and capital funding: these can include compensation for operating losses, loans on favourable terms, no charges for use of public assets, or failure to recover claims. Regulation: public sector export credit insurers are often exempt from regulatory rules applying to private insurers. Free use of infrastructure: the draft communication singles out free access to privileged information. Officials, saying these distortions are incompatible with obligations under the Treaty of Rome, are preparing a 'communication' that outlaws them wherever an insurance risk is 'marketable.' Export insurers across Europe have differing opinions on what risks are marketable and what are not. In Germany, Hermes, the government-backed export credit agency, insists there should be 'a rather limited scope for marketable risk,' excluding political risk and for a maximum credit term of 12 months. The argument has particular force: Hermes claims that German reinsurers such as Allianz and Munich Reinsurance are not ready to cover risk outside this scope. It saysthat insurers like NCM, the Dutch private sector credit insurer, active in the UK as well as Holland, and Coface in France have already absorbed a great deal of Europe's private reinsurance capacity. Small insurers such as Portugal or Greece would find themselves with very limited access to reinsurance facilities. 'It's a matter of reinsurance capacity,' Hermes says. These claims are serious as Allianz and Munich Re are important reinsurers not only in Germany but throughout Europe. However, there may be an element of bluff: from pole position in something of a seller's market, they may simply be signalling that reinsurance premiums are likely to go up. Hermes would anyway face a painful transition, as would state-controlled insurers in Belgium and Denmark, and smaller insurers in southern European countries such as Greece and Portugal. Germany's private insurers, such as Guerling and Algemeine Kreditversicherung, are tiny. The 40-year legacy of offering a single export credit premium rate for all countries means insurers have no experience of country risk assessment. That single-rate system is to be replaced in 1993 with five risk categories; a decision that will provide better risk guidelines to insurers and promote the emergence of private sector insurance. German industry, already nervous about the implications of abandoning a fixed-rate premium system that guaranteed cheap cover in risky but important markets in eastern and central Europe, has echoed German insurers' concerns. Mr Harald Muller at the BDI, the country's leading industry organisation, warns that rapid changes 'would harm not only German companies, but other European companies too, especially when competing against Japanese and US companies.' He says that the worst affected would be Germany's small companies, which find it easier to go to a single state-owned insurer for all of their export credit needs. The easiest transition is likely to be in the UK, where NCM last year acquired from Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department control of the country's short-term export insurance business. In many ways, Commission reformers are watching the experience of NCM, in providing commercial and political risk cover and in obtaining private sector reinsurance, as a possible model for reform across the EC. The Commission is expected to decide within the coming weeks how best to proceed with privatisation. It is still unclear whether the speedier DG4 route, which will give member states six months to comply with a communication which could be issued in a matter of weeks, will be preferred over DG1's proposal for a directive. The latter is the lengthier route, since the directive would need to be ratified by the EC council of ministers.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / BA protest over aid for Air France British Airways yesterday launched a vigorous attack on Air France, urging the European Commission to force the French state-owned flag carrier to repay a FFr1.5bn (Pounds 170m) capital injection, saying it constituted a subsidy in contravention of the Treaty of Rome. The UK airline's attack comes as an EU commission is due to recommend a policy on state aid to ailing European national airlines, many of which are seeking support from their governments. Both BA and the UK government have campaigned against additional state aid to financially troubled European state carriers which they argue are severely distorting the European airline market. BA's objection to the Air France refinancing package before the EU follows Brussels' approval for earlier government injections to Air France of FFr5.84bn in 1991 and 1992. The privatised UK carrier is worried that the French government will soon seek approval for further aid to Air France, totalling more than FFr5bn as part of the latest rescue package for the troubled French carrier. Air France last night rejected BA's claims and insisted that the FFr1.5bn injection involved convertible bonds and other paper issued under normal market conditions. It also stated that the earlier FFr5.84bn it had received involved FFr2bn in a government capital injection approved by the EU as not consisting of a state subsidy, with the remainder raised on the French financial market. Mr David Holmes, BA's head of government and industry affairs, said the FFr1.5bn aid 'was not a commercial investment'.</p>

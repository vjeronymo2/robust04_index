			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Fewer groups seek graduates THE number of companies seeking graduate recruits during the 'milk round' at universities is likely to fall sharply this year, according to the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services, Catherine Milton writes. Almost 30 per cent fewer companies will attend this year's spring round of presentations to students, the association said yesterday. The survey of 77 higher-education institutions found a drop of 5 per cent in the number of companies attending the smaller autumn round last year, mainly because accountancy firms reported an overall 20 per cent fall in vacancies. Overall demand for graduates last year was down 14 per cent on 1991, according to a separate survey published by the Association of Graduate Recruiters. The survey, of 304 recruiting organisations, was conducted by the Institute of Manpower Studies.</p>

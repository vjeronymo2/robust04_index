			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, </F> Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, PMDB]    [Text] The way the CPI [Congressional Investigating  Committee] unfolded is the most conclusive proof of a change in  Brazilian political practice. In former times, the CPI would  not have even been instituted or, had it been instituted it  would have come to nothing. Had it not fizzled out, it would  have been suspended or killed on this and that pretext. In the  end, it would have fallen into oblivion before the culprits were  identified, much less punished.    Let us now compare this gloomy scenario with the reality of  openness, clarity, correction, and balance that has  characterized the work of the CPI. Which leads us to just one  conclusion: The CPI is not the cause, but rather the consequence  of the change in Brazilian political habits.    Moreover, this case is not the only one. The CPI on [Former  President Fernando] Collor's government served as precedent for  the Budget CPI. Optimists were then outnumbered by skeptics  but, in the end, the reverberations of the outcome surprised  everybody. It goes without saying that such a deep change  entails a fair dose of suffering. The reports on the CPI  contained attempts to explain -- which convinced no one --  examples of powerful men being publicly humiliated, and details  of voters' disappointment. Some even considered the CPI a  threat to politicians. It was argued that a tidal wave of  charges could prompt an over-generalization, branding all  politicians -- guilty and innocent -- alike.    If such a risk existed, it was averted. The CPI exalted  Brazilian politicians. A few were exposed, but many grew in  stature, beginning with CPI chairman Senator Jarbas Passarinho  and CPI rapporteur Deputy Roberto Magalhaes. The most  praiseworthy achievement of these outstanding Brazilians was  their presence of mind and balance. They ensured that everybody  had the right to a defense. They never allowed the CPI to  become a witch hunt. If there were injustices, they arose from  the natural imperfection of human judgment.    Political parties also stood to gain from the CPI, starting  with the PMDB. From the very beginning, its representatives in  the Chamber of Deputies staked their good reputation, and the  invariably decisive number of their votes, on the CPI. An  example, among many, of impeccable behavior was that of Roberto  Rollemberg, chairman of the PMDB in Sao Paulo. If a negligible  minority of congressmen have been found guilty in the final CPI  report, the only line to take is to accept the verdict and expel  them from the party. There is no alternative. There has been a  shift in political habits in Brazil. As a final lesson, the CPI  showed us that the most vulnerable points of Brazilian  legislation must be urgently corrected.    Now is the time to do so. The constitutional reform enables  us to implement mechanisms that will prevent (or at least make  more difficult) a repetition of such events. Changing the rules  that govern parliamentary immunity, raising bank confidentiality  for all those who hold an elective post, implementing a new  strategy for drafting the budget, incorporating the mixed  district system [changing the election system to base  representation on units of local government, i.e. counties], and  creating a vote system to enable the dismissal from office,  among other measures, will enhance the management of public  money. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. May  corruption be forever banished from the national budget.</p>

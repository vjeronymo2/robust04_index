			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Mercosur states delay decision on common tariffs The presidents of the four member countries of Mercosur, Latin America's largest planned common market, yesterday agreed to postpone a decision on the full implementation of common external tariffs, the most controversial dispute dividing them. The presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay - respectively Carlos Menem, Itamar Franco, Juan Carlos Wasmosy and Luis Alberto Lacalle - in Uruguay for their regular biannual summit, said they would try to agree on tariffs by the end of June, six months later than planned. This will make it virtually impossible for Mercosur to meet its January 1 deadline to establish a fully-fledged common market, in which goods would circulate freely while imports from outside the region would be subject to common external tariffs. The four have agreed tariffs for trade between themselves and with other countries for about 85 per cent of goods. These are being steadily lowered to come into force at the beginning of next year. However, their failure to agree on external tariffs for sensitive areas like high-technology goods and chemicals means that integration can be only partial at this stage. Brazil has demanded high import tariffs to protect its advanced technology industries, while its smaller, less-industrialised partners want low tariffs. Original hopes of bringing down tariffs on these sensitive products to the lower levels enjoyed by most products by 2001 are also likely to be delayed. Officials have mentioned a possible five-year delay until 2006 for these sensitive goods, which also include telecommunications equipment and computers. Despite the disagreements on tariffs, which were expected, the four countries did make headway in important harmonisation measures. The presidents agreed to recognise the Basle Accord that specifies capital requirements for banks, harmonise regulations for the securities industry and simplify as well as co-ordinate customs procedures at border crossings. The four countries were also due to sign joint investment protection agreements. President Itamar Franco used the meeting to call again for Mercosur to become the base for a free-trade area for the whole of the continent. Regional rivalries, and uncertainty about Brazil's economic instability, have led to only lukewarm responses to Brazil's overtures in the past.</p>

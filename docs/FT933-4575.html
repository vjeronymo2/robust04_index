			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Aviva Petroleum cuts losses Aviva Petroleum, the Texas-based oil and gas company quoted in London, cut its net loss from a restated Dollars 8m to Dollars 269,000 (Pounds 175,800) for the first half of 1993. The company said that Dollars 6.4m of the Dollars 7.7m improvement in its result reflected a change in accounting for oil and gas assets from the 'successful efforts' to the 'full cost' method. In addition the latest figure included a full six months of production at two of the company's Colombian wells, compared with only three months of the 1992 half. This lifted its Colombian oil revenues by Dollars 1.3m. Total oil and gas sales advanced to Dollars 5.4m (Dollars 4.28m). Losses per share were 1 cent, compared with a previous Dollars 1.53. Aviva said its financial health was continuing to improve. Earlier this month it finished restructuring its banking facilities, making funds available for its Colombian exploration and development programme. In July it completed a 12.9m common share placing at 95 cents per share with a group of US institutions and private investors to raise Dollars 11.3m after costs.</p>

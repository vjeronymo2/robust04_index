			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lloyds Bank to pay Pounds 27m for AMC LLOYDS Bank yesterday announced that it is to expand its share of the agricultural finance market to about 15 per cent by acquiring the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation from a consortium of high street banks. Lloyds said it would pay Pounds 27m for AMC, which was set up by statute in 1928 to provide loans tied to first mortgages on agricultural, horticultural and forestry properties. AMC's net asset value in December was Pounds 57m. Lloyds owns 13.3 per cent of AMC. The other shareholders are the Bank of England (27.4 per cent), National Westminster Bank (26 per cent), Barclays (17.3 per cent), Midland (13.3 per cent) and Royal Bank of Scotland (2.7 per cent). AMC was deregulated in 1991 following an Act of Parliament in 1987. Although it made a profit of Pounds 7.8m in the year to last March and expects to make a similar amount this year, it has traditionally not sought large profitability. Mr John Kaye, managing director, said the discounted price compared to asset value reflected the fact that AMC had a high ratio of loans to capital. AMC lendings amounted to Pounds 971m in September - about 8 per cent of the market. Mr Kaye said AMC anticipated the bank injecting about Pounds 25m of capital into its new subsidiary. He said AMC had sought a single owner following deregulation. Mr John Davies, Lloyds deputy chief executive, said the bank believed AMC had a 'very sound' business that could be developed more vigorously under sole ownership.</p>

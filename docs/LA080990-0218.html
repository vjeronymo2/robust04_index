			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> METS HAVE AN ANSWER FOR PHILLIE STRATEGY  </P> <P> Against left-handed pitching, the New York Mets are below .500 and Darryl  Strawberry's average is below .230.  </P> <P> For that reason, the Philadelphia Phillies took left-hander Don Carman out of  the bullpen to start against the Mets Wednesday at New York.  </P> <P> Carman was 5-0 in relief this season, but had not started since last September.  He was no puzzle to the left-handed hitting Strawberry or his teammates.  </P> <P> Strawberry was two for three and drove in three runs to lead the Mets to an 8-4  victory that ended their four-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Carman (5-1) lasted four innings, giving up 10 hits and six runs, and is headed  back to the bullpen.  </P> <P> The Mets (61-45) improved their record against left-handers to 19-20 and ended  a four-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Keith Miller singled in the first inning and scored when Carman walked Gregg  Jefferies with the bases loaded. Miller also singled in the second and scored  on Jefferies' double. In the fourth, Miller singled to start another outburst  as the Mets put together a 6-0 lead for David Cone (8-5).  </P> <P> "We had been lethargic lately," Manager Bud Harrelson said. "Keith was the  catalyst we needed. I planned on meeting with our hitters, but it was so late.  Miller did the job for me. He woke up the hitters."  </P> <P> There was other bad news for the Phillies. Ken Howell (8-7) has an aching  shoulder and probably is out for the season.  </P> <P> Montreal 6, Pittsburgh 2 -- The Pirates, seeking pitching help for their first  pennant run in 11 years, obtained left-hander Zane Smith from the Expos for  three players, but Montreal won the ballgame at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> The Expos will get left-hander Scott Ruskin and two minor leaguers, shortstop  Willie Greene and outfielder Moises Alou, the son of former major leaguer  Felipe Alou, now the manager of the Expos' West Palm Beach farm club.  </P> <P> Smith is unsigned and can become a free agent at the end of the season.  </P> <P> In the game, Tim Raines ended an 0-for-18 slump with two run-scoring doubles to  end the Expos' six-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Doug Drabek (14-5) had not lost since June 28, gave up all the runs and 10 hits  in 6 2/3 innings, ending his six-game winning streak.  </P> <P> Atlanta 7, San Diego 1 -- Dave Justice is still celebrating winning a job as  the Braves' starter in right field after the trade of Dale Murphy.  </P> <P> Justice hit two more home runs at Atlantato help John Smoltz improve his record  to 8-8.  </P> <P> Justice has hit five home runs in his last three games. He helped end a  seven-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Chicago 4, St. Louis 3 -- The Cubs won in the 15th inning at Chicago when Andre  Dawson hit a two-out single to score Joe Girardi from third.  </P> <P> The game was scoreless until the 10th when the Cardinals scored twice. Chicago  scored once and had a runner on third base with two out when Dwight Smith hit a  grounder to third that Terry Pendleton, a former Gold Glove winner, fumbled.  </P> <P> San Francisco 8, Houston 4 -- The Giants mounted a 16-hit attack at Houston to  end a three-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Greg Litton's pinch double in the eighth inning drove in two runs, broke a tie  and ended the Astros' six-game winning streak.  </P> <P> The Giants open a four-game series at Cincinnati Friday night.

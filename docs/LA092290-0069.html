			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> CARNEY SIGNED FOR INSURANCE AT KICKER  </P> <P> As expected, free-agent kicker John Carney signed with the Rams Friday as  insurance for Mike Lansford's sore right leg, and probably will handle the  kickoffs Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> Lansford, who will do the placekicking, said he could probably also kick off,  but the Rams feared that he might further damage his right calf muscle during  the game, leaving the team without a placekicker.  </P> <P> To make room for Carney, the Rams placed tight end Richard Ashe on the injured  reserve list with a stress fracture of the left foot.  </P> <P> Carney said that despite the uncertainty of the situation and knowing he could  be waived as soon as Lansford feels 100%, he was happy to get the chance.  </P> <P> "It's an opportunity to be with the Rams, kick in pregame, and if they need me  to do kickoffs or whatnot, I'll do that," Carney said.  </P> <P> Carney will wear No. 18, once worn by Roman Gabriel.  </P> <P> An interesting situation is developing for the Eagles at guard. They acquired  former San Francisco 49ers starter Bruce Collie off waivers before the season  started, and he is already beginning to push starting right guard Ron Solt out  of the picture.  </P> <P> Solt, obtained by the Eagles from Indianapolis for Nos. 1 and 4 draft choices  in 1988, has been a marginal player at best when physically sound -- he has had  several knee injuries -- or not on suspension -- he was banned for four weeks  last season after testing positive for steroid use.  </P> <P> He has been a frustration for a team that hoped he would clean out running  lanes. So far this season, the Eagles have the 18th-rated running offense in  the league.  </P> <P> Last Sunday, it was Collie, not Solt, who was in the game for the last series  of the Eagles' 23-21 loss to the Phoenix Cardinals. Solt grumbled about it, and  Ryan said he expects Collie to play more against the Rams.  </P> <P> The Rams' No. 1 draft pick in 1986, Mike Schad, is the Eagles' starting left  guard, and Ryan has called him the team's best guard.  </P> <P> It's clear who Jim Everett favors in the Rams' revolving three-tailback  situation.  </P> <P> Ram Coach John Robinson maintains that he will play Curt Warner, Gaston Green  and Cleveland Gary equally this week, and has not said who will start.  </P> <P> "There's no doubt we're in a position where we desperately need to get a  running game going," Everett said. "It will come. I'm not a prophet, but  Cleveland Gary is starting to make a run at the tailback position. Me being his  peer, that's what I see." TIM KAWAKAMI  </P></p>

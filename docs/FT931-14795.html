			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Serbs face peace plan deadline THE self-styled parliament of the Bosnian Serbs is to meet on January 19 to decide the fate of the constitutional proposals for Bosnia-Hercegovina agreed at the Geneva peace conference this week, official Serb sources said yesterday. A Serb official in Pale, the rebels' main base in Bosnia, said the meeting would take place there on Tuesday but the venue might still be subject to change. The European Community has given the Serbs until Tuesday to accept the constitutional principles or face UN punitive action. Meanwhile, Mr Cyrus Vance has 'no plans' to step down from his job as co-chairman of the Geneva peace conference on the former Yugoslavia, Mr Fred Eckhard, his spokesman, said yesterday. Mr Eckhard, commenting on a British report that Mr Vance was intending to leave, said: 'We're working pretty much at fever pitch right now; there is no question of his leaving the conference now.' However, Mr Eckhard made clear that, at some unspecified time in the future, Mr Vance, who is a senior partner in a New York law firm, would like to divide his time more between New York and Geneva in order to continue co-chairing the conference.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Japan laments loss of old work ethic JAPANESE executives are lamenting the disappearance of a breed of model worker delighted to do unpaid overtime, inspired by a passionate loyalty to the company and even 'genetically inclined' towards hard work. As part of an intensifying debate about whether the Japanese work ethic is being eroded by 'western-style' individualism and materialism, the Keidanren, the country's federation of economic organisations, surveyed 2,125 chief executives and senior managers. They agreed that the work ethic was changing but disagreed on the impact. The debate was inspired by Mr Akio Morita, the Sony chairman, who recently announced that managers should reduce working hours, raise workers' salaries, increase dividends and generally become more philanthropic. He also suggested that companies abandon their quest for market share and concentrate on profit quality. Mr Morita's comments were taken by some outraged executives as a direct attack on the terms and conditions of a social contract that had ensured Japan's success. There was also concern that employee enthusiasm may be undermined by a chairman's confession that they were under-compensated. The federation's survey showed that Japanese companies are indeed dependent on the enthusiasm of their staff, as 88 per cent of the companies rely on 'service overtime', that is, unpaid overtime. About 53 per cent of managers surveyed said unpaid overtime should decline but only 19.4 per cent supported an end to the practice, which makes the working year far longer than the official estimate of 2,052 hours. Japan's company-backed unions say the actual figure is closer to 2,400 hours. Asked to describe their employees' source of motivation, 30.9 per cent of managers said promotion prospects were most important and 26.9 per cent thought it was salary. But 37 per cent suggested that the love of work itself was the prime factor. A Nippon Steel executive said 'Japanese corporate energy' came from Japanese-style work values, self-realised desire and a now-declining, but essential love of teamwork. An executive at JR Tokai, the railway operator, said 'individualism' was replacing company loyalty as the most important motivation. Increasing wealth was seen as a threat to the old order, with 41 per cent of executives believing that work values were being eroded by material comfort, although 23 per cent disagreed, and 36 per cent were unsure. These questions prompted the not uncommon answer that the Japanese work-style was fundamentally different because of the rice cultivator tradition - westerners are said to be imbued with the spirit of hunter-gatherers and thus have become more individualistic and aggressive. Mr Tsuneo Aki, vice-chairman of Obayashi, the construction company, said that as cultivators, Japanese people had to toil more diligently. The result, he suggested, was that Japanese became 'genetically inclined' to working hard, with genes quite distinct from those of westerners.</p>

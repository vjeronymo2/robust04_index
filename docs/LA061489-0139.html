			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN'S TRADE SURPLUS DROPS 27%  </P> <P> Japan's trade surplus dropped 27% in May, the government reported today, giving  a sign that the nation's embarrassingly large gap between exports and imports  is finally closing.  </P> <P> The trade surplus with the United States dropped 19%, reinforcing optimism that  the overall imbalance may be shrinking.  </P> <P> But economists said the correction process in trade with the United States  could be undermined if the dollar's recent appreciation against the yen  continues.  </P> <P> "Even if this month's trade picture is good, exchange rate developments in  coming months could offset the trend and make the Japanese trade surplus  increase," said economist Soichi Enkyo at Bank of Tokyo Ltd.  </P> <P> Japan's surplus in May narrowed to $3.78 billion from $5.19 billion a year  earlier. Although exports were up 4.9% to $21.67 billion, imports climbed a  strong 15.7% to $17.89 billion.  </P> <P> Exports to the United States rose 3.2% but imports surged 24.4%.  </P></p>

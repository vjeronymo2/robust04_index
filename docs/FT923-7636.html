			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Observer: Happy holidays Not all of John Major's cabinet colleagues have answered his call to interrupt their holidays for emergency talks on the Bosnian crisis. Douglas Hurd and Malcolm Rifkind will, like Major, be returning to London for tomorrow's meeting of the Cabinet's overseas and defence committee. Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, will also be present. But both Michael Heseltine and Norman Lamont won't put in an appearance. The Prezza has a good excuse. To return from his Fiji hideaway for just a day would take him two or three days. But eyebrows are being raised at Lamont's decision not to interrupt his Tuscan idyll. Ministers flatly reject cruel suggestions that the chancellor's reappearance would deliver another dent to consumer confidence.</p>

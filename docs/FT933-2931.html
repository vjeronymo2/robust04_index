			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Observer: Arafat's energies Back among the bougainvillaeas in sleepy Tunis, Yassir Arafat is probably soaking his right hand in some soothingly cool water. After an enforced absence of 19 years from the US, he made up for lost time. Straight off the aircraft on Sunday he went into conversations with ex-presidents Bush and Carter, followed by a meeting with Jesse Jackson. Monday he breakfasted at the World Bank with Jacques Delors. From thence to the signing ceremony - and more handshakes - on the White House lawn, followed by a visit to Foggy Bottom for a chat with Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. The day concluded amid a welter of prime-time TV interviews. That punishing schedule was enough to slow the strongest; but Tuesday showed Arafat as vigorous as ever. Breakfast on Capitol Hill; lunch downtown at the National Press Club; a tete a tete with UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali; back on a flight to Tunis. Implementing a peace agreement should be easy after all that.</p>

HUD shall require the HA to respond with a report stating the HA's reasons for rejecting the corporation's contract offer or for refusing to negotiate. Thereafter, HUD shall require the parties (with or without the direct HUD participation) to undertake or to resume negotiations on a contract providing for resident management, and shall take such other actions as are necessary to resolve the conflicts between the parties. If no resolution is achieved within 90 days from the date HUD required the parties to undertake or resume such negotiations, HUD shall serve notice on both parties that administrative remedies have been exhausted (except that, pursuant to mutual agreement of the parties, the time for negotiations may be extended by no more than an additional 30 days).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Management contract <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

Provisions on competitive bidding and requirements of prior written HUD approval of contracts contained in the ACC do not apply to the decision of a HA to contract with a RMC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Prohibited activities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A HA may not contract for assumption by the resident management corporation of the HA's underlying responsibilities to HUD under the ACC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bonding and insurance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before assuming any management responsibility under its contract, the RMC must provide fidelity bonding and insurance, or equivalent protection that is adequate (as determined by HUD and the HA) to protect HUD and the HA against loss, theft, embezzlement, or fraudulent acts on the part of the resident management corporation or its employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Waiver of HUD requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon the joint request of a resident management corporation and the HA, HUD may waive any requirement that HUD has established and that is not required by law, if HUD determines, after consultation with the resident management corporation and the HA, that the requirement unnecessarily increases the costs to the project or restricts the income of the project; and that the waiver would be consistent with the management contract and any applicable collective bargaining agreement. Any waiver granted to a resident management corporation under this section will apply as well to the HA to the extent the waiver affects the HA's remaining responsibilities relating to the resident management corporation's project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;964.230 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Audit and administrative requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> TOP grant recipients.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The HUD Inspector General, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any duly authorized representative shall have access to all records required to be retained by this subpart or by any agreement with HUD for the purpose of audit or other examinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Grant recipients must comply with the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OMB Circulars A&hyph;110 and A&hyph;122, as applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A final audit shall be required for the activities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenditures made pursuant to this subpart by a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), in accordance with generally accepted government audit standards.

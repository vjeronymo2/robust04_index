			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POE'S MYSTERIOUS GRAVESIDE ADMIRER CAPTURED IN PHOTO  </P> <P> A mysterious stranger who leaves three roses and a bottle of cognac on Edgar  Allan Poe's grave every year on the author's birthday has been captured on film  for Life magazine.  </P> <P> A New York photographer, armed with $17,000 worth of sophisticated equipment,  took what apparently is the first photograph ever of the visitor to the West  Baltimore grave.  </P> <P> But the visitor's identity still is not known.  </P> <P> The photo appears in Life magazine's July issue, due on newsstands today.  </P> <P> Photographer Bill Ballenberg staked out the Westminster Burying Ground on Jan.  19, Poe's 181st birthday, and snapped a fuzzy photo of a man in an overcoat  crouched at the gravestone.  </P> <P> "It was hours and hours of boredom punctuated by less than a minute of sheer  panic," Ballenberg said.  </P> <P> Ballenberg had accompanied Life magazine writer Gary Smith to Baltimore to  investigate the graveyard tradition, which dates at least to 1949 and doubtless  has been carried out by more than one person.  </P> <P> Smith initially wanted to uncover the visitor's identity.  </P> <P> But Smith said he was persuaded by Poe House curator Jeff Jerome not to disturb  the visitor.  </P> <P> "It meant so much to him to not ruin the mystery. We decided to respect his  wishes," said Smith, who suggested the story to Life after seeing coverage of  past graveyard visits.  </P> <P> Jerome said he agreed to let the Life team wait with him for the visitor this  year, as long as they did not try to nab, identify or talk to the man. "That's  none of our business," Jerome said.  </P> <P> Poe, whose most widely read poems and stories include "The Raven" and "The Pit  and the Pendulum," was found semiconscious on a Baltimore street Oct. 3, 1849,  and died four days later.  </P></p>

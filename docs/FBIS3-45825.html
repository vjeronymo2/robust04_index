			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Zhu Jiazhen, vice minister of </F> labor, from the "Random Talk on the Rural Economy" column by  staff reporter Liu Xianri (0491 7639 2480); place and date not  given: "How is Rural Work Force Heading for the Market?--Zhu  Jiazhen, Vice Minister of Labor, Comments on Building the Rural  Labor Market"]    [Text] The huge transregional movement of rural labor  force is one of the most magnificent [zhuang guan 1104 6034]  phenomena arising from reform and opening up in our country.    The prosperity along the coast and the development in the  interior has inevitably been accompanied by massive migration.    Even though this type of movement has been relatively well  organized in some localities, generally speaking, it is still in  a disorderly state. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee proposed building a labor market. How can we  help the building of the rural labor market proceed in a healthy  manner and enable the rural work force to move onto the normal  and orderly track? I recently interviewed Vice Labor Minister  Zhu Jiazhen on this issue.  <H3>  The Job Problem Existing in the Rural Areas is a Necessary  Element of the Market Economy </H3>   Zhu Jiazhen thought that our country had already established  a rudimentary labor market, which is nevertheless still in its  initial stage of growth. The growth of such a market is not  proceeding at the same rate in different regions and  enterprises. Particularly in the vast rural areas, the building  of labor market has just begun.    For more than four decades, the state basically has not  thought about the problem of jobs for the surplus rural labor  force. Listing the rural labor force as part of the unified  resources of the labor force in society when pondering policy  decisions is a thing which has emerged only in the past few  years. It is also a requirement for the development of the  market economy.    He said that, in fact, our country's rural labor force  currently stands at 450 million people, 74 percent of the total  labor force in society. There are approximately 1.4 billion mu  of farmland in rural areas throughout the country, as well as  some reserve land resources. According to a comprehensive  analysis based on the current level of agricultural productive  forces in our country, these lands can be operated well by 200  million laborers at most. In recent years, along with the  development of secondary and tertiary industries, such as  township and town enterprises in rural areas, approximately 110  million rural laborers have been absorbed, but there are still  100 million surplus laborers who have nothing to do. Most of  these people live in the major grain- and cotton- producing  areas and the economically undeveloped areas in central and  western China. If this surplus labor force is not organized and  guided to move in a steady and orderly manner, the contradiction  between many people and little land will intensify, and this  will seriously hinder the broad masses of peasants from  improving their living conditions. Inevitably, there will by  many problems.    Our country's task of shifting the rural labor force is  still  very difficult, however, and the duty of building a rural labor  market is even more arduous. Judged from our country's current  development speed and analyzing according to prevalent  international practices, the task of reasonably shifting the  large number of surplus rural labor force cannot be accomplished  in five or 10 years; it is a huge project which transcends the  centuries.  <H3>  Attention Must Be Paid to the Difficulties Caused When Rural  Laborers Seek Jobs in Other Localities </H3>   In discussing the difficulties and problems associated with  building the rural labor market, Vice Minister Zhu Jiazhen  thought that first, the system of providing employment services  for the surplus rural labor force must be perfected. For  various reasons, many laborers are still not included in the  service network; quick access to information is not available;  the avenues for providing services cannot meet the demand; some  localities are still characterized by the tendency of resorting  to administrative measures; and some localities lack a rational  structure. Second, there are no venues for training the rural  labor force, and, even though some localities provide such  vocational training, they cannot do so on a regular basis, and  other corresponding service systems fail to catch up. Take the  problem of insurance in rural areas as an example; some  insurance systems are based on households and have yet to be  expanded to include individual laborers. In addition, various  services, which face the market, lack the necessary funds and  policy support, to the extent that the service methods of market  service systems are still in the primitive state of oral  introduction and that corresponding file management and  information processing systems have not been established. This  does not meet the development needs of the labor market. As for  the means of macro regulation and control, effective ways of  meeting the needs of the labor market have yet to take shape,  and macro regulation and control is lagging behind the  cultivation and development of the labor market.    The above-mentioned problems make the outward migration of  the rural labor force chaotic and disorderly; in particular,  before and after every spring festival, large "tides of  laborers" take shape, concentrate, and flow, causing great  pressure on railways, stations, piers, and other modes of  transportation, having repercussions on cities and bringing  about a series of social problems. Individual job seekers also  suffer serious losses.    Zhu Jiazhen thought that the phenomenon of "tides of  laborers" reflects inadequate job opportunities in the rural  areas, the inability of the current employment management system  to cope, and especially the lagging behind of the building of  the labor market in the rural areas. Trends show that, for a  certain time to come, transregional rural labor migration will  expand even further. Therefore, when we uphold the principle of  developing local economies to enable a large number of laborers  to change jobs in their own localities, we must earnestly  improve labor market mechanisms and perfect market regulations,  order, and corresponding management, service, regulatory, and  control means, to make the transregional flow of labor force an  orderly one. This will remove the negative effects of the  "tides of laborers" and will open up smooth channels for rural  laborers seeking jobs in other localities.  <H3>  Establish a New System of Employment and Implement the Plan  for Coordinating Employment in Urban and Rural Areas </H3>   In discussing the goal of building the rural labor market,  Zhu Jiazhen pointed out that the country must form a basic  system to manage the transregional migration of labor as it  adapts to the market economy -- as well as a market information  system and a service network -- to enable the major regions with  larger scales of inward and outward rural labor flows to achieve  an orderly migration. The outward flow should be organized, the  inward flow should be managed, the flow itself should be  serviced. There should be means of regulation and control, as  well as diverting measures in case of emergency.    In order to improve and perfect the rural labor market, the  Labor Ministry recently proposed a three-year first-phase "plan  to coordinate employment in the urban and rural areas." The  plan will be implemented nationwide, and it targets the major  areas with inward and outward labor flows, including the  developed coastal areas such as Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong,  Zhejiang, and Jiangsu and the municipalities of Beijing,  Tianjin, and Shanghai; it also targets those areas with  relatively large volumes of outward labor flows, such as  Sichuan, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Henan,  Hebei, and Gansu.    According to Vice Minister Zhu, in this project, efforts  will  first be made to sum up and promote Guangdong Province's  experience in coordinating with the work force-exporting  provinces in order to divert the "tides of laborers." Efforts  will also be made to grasp the work in diverting laborers during  the spring festival of 1994, and a preliminary set of plans and  emergency measures will be formulated to divert the "tides of  laborers." The second step is to establish labor market  regulations and a system for managing the employment of outside  laborers in the major work force-importing areas and to  establish a system registering job seekers who leave the work  force-exporting areas for other localities. A nationwide  unified basic system will be established on this base. Third,  to establish a labor market information exchange center in  Guangdong, accomplish the building of a labor market information  exchange center incorporating the three major regions of south,  east, and north China, and form a system to collect, handle, and  disseminate labor market information centering on various major  work force- importing areas. The urban and rural employment  service agencies in the work force-importing areas should  thoroughly open up to the rural labor force, and the development  of urban and rural employment service agencies and various kinds  of nongovernmental service organizations should be promoted. By  1996, the key areas should be able to basically ensure orderly  labor flows. Thereafter, the scope of implementation should  expand from the key areas to the entire country, so as to  thoroughly implement the basic transregional labor migration  system.</p>

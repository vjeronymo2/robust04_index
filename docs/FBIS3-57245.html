Kozyrev said that neither the patriots, nor the fascists  influence Russian foreign policy in any way. However, he  apologized for the "fascist statements made in Moscow recently."  The protection of ethnic Russians in the former Soviet  republics has nothing to do with imperialism, he continued. He  emphasized, though, that "we cannot remain indifferent to  violations of ethnic Russians' rights, particularly in Latvia,  from where they are being forced out."    Akayev said that he did not see any imperial ambitions in  Russia's foreign policy. "Without a strong and great Russia,  stability in Eurasia is unthinkable," he said. Speaking about  the problem of dual citizenship, he noted that it should be  tackled on a bilateral basis.    Kozyrev announced that Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin was to arrive in Bishkek shortly for comprehensive  talks on economic cooperation.</p>

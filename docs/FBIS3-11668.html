That would  indicate that one, or possibly both suspects are residents of  Tijuana. [Passage omitted] Mr. Cano, do you know either of the  suspects?    [Cano] No, sir, I do not.    [Zabludovsky] I will give you the names, which we now have  here, in case you have heard of them. Are you from Tijuana?    [Cano] Yes sir.    [Zabludovsky] One is Mario Aburto Martinez, 23 years old.  The other is Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela.    [Cano] I do not know them.    [Zabludovsky] He is 45 years old.    [Cano] I do not know them, Mr. Zabludovsky. [passage  omitted]</p>

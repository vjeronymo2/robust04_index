			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EX-SDSU STUDENT GETS 120 DAYS, PROBATION IN SEXUAL ASSAULT  </P> <P> A former San Diego State University student was sentenced Tuesday to 120 days  in custody and five years' probation for the 1988 sexual assault of an SDSU  student near campus.  </P> <P> Timothy Michael Healey, 22, pleaded guilty Dec. 6 to one count of sexual  battery stemming from the assault on the woman on Feb. 11, 1988. The court  recommended that Healey serve his sentence at the West Fork honor camp in East  San Diego County and that his sentence begin after the current school semester  is over.  </P> <P> In passing sentence, Superior Court Judge Herbert J. Exarhos cited Healey's  lack of premeditation and his lack of previous convictions as reasons for  granting Healey's request for probation.  </P> <P> During the preliminary hearing, the victim -- who went to high school with  Healey -- testified that he met her at Winter's nightclub on El Cajon  Boulevard. Later they left for her apartment, where he raped her. Attorneys on  both sides of the case acknowledge that both parties were drunk at the time.  </P> <P> Without the plea bargain, Healey could have been sentenced to a maximum of 36  years if convicted on all the charges, which included rape with a foreign  object and assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury.  </P> <P> Healey is now enrolled in an undisclosed school, after withdrawing from SDSU  because of publicity about the case.  </P></p>

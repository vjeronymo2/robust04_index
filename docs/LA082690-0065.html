Aug. 19)  opposing more drilling for oil off California's coast both elitist and morally  offensive.  </P> <P> Too many Americans are self-righteously prepared to make war to preserve our  access to Mideastern oil. Heaven forbid that we should drill for it right here  in our own neighborhood.  </P> <P> Why is the environment in the Middle East of less value than our own? How many  lives is an unblemished view of a sunset worth?  </P> <P> KEVIN McGILL  </P> <P> Chula Vista  </P></p>

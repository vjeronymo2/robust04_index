			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour ready to flesh out tax and spending plans - Economy THE LABOUR party plans to give more details of its proposals for taxes and spending before the general election expected on April 9, Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, said yesterday. His comments came as senior ministers prepared to press Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to reinforce the contrast between the Conservative and Labour approaches to tax by cutting 1p off the basic rate in his March 10 Budget. Speaking ahead of their traditional cabinet discussion of the scope for tax changes, the ministers said that the Treasury's insistence on the need for prudence had run up against a growing Tory consensus that tax cuts were an essential springboard for the party's election campaign. Speaking at a Westminster press conference, Mr Smith said that he would defer some detailed tax decisions to his first Budget after Labour's anticipated election victory. He stressed that a plan to finance higher child benefit and pensions by lifting the ceiling on National Insurance contributions and introducing a 50p top rate of income tax would remain a pivotal part of his party's strategy. But Mr Smith left open the question of whether the tax and National Insurance increases might be phased in and where the new top rate would begin to bite. He will unveil more details after the Budget, including how Labour would reallocate funds committed by Mr Lamont to pay for the expected cut in the basic rate of income tax at the Budget. Senior members of the shadow cabinet last night sought to dismiss suggestions that Mr Smith was under pressure to abandon or defer tax increases because of the depth of the recession. The shadow chancellor added that the net effect of his proposals had been judged by independent economists as 'mildly reflationary'. There is, however, concern among some Labour MPs that the Budget should be followed by a simple package to show that most voters would not face higher bills. The Conservatives, meanwhile, plan to return to the offensive on taxation later today by highlighting Labour's plans to impose National Insurance contributions on the income from savings of more than Pounds 30,000. Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, said last night that Mr Smith had already been shown to be 'in full retreat'.</p>

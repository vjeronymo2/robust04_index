Zorin] </F>   [Text] The F-22, proposed by a group of firms headed by  Lockheed, was chosen in the course of a 54-month program for  engineering evaluation of competitive YF-23 and YF-22 prototypes  for subsequent development as the U.S. Air Force advanced  tactical fighter. A number of shortcomings were identified in  the process of subsequent ground and flight tests of models of  this aircraft, and a program running up to the end of 1993 was  drawn up to remedy them.    The external appearance of the series model of the F-22  fighter (see figure [figure not reproduced]) did not undergo  substantial changes. This basically affected design features of  the airframe and particularly the wing. In the opinion of  Lockheed specialists, the configuration and external lines of  the new aircraft became more refined and elegant.    A total of 22 changes were made, the main ones being an  increase in wingspan from 13.32 to 13.50 m, but its area did not  change (78.32 m[.sup]2[/]) since the leading edge sweep angle  was reduced from 48 to 42. The latter will permit improving  the aircraft's maneuver qualities and characteristics of  cruising flight at subsonic speeds (through reduced aerodynamic  drag), inasmuch as, according to calculations of U.S. aircraft  specialists, the optimum wing sweep angle in which maximum roll  rate is achieved is 40-43. The wing planform presumes a  reduced radar signature and increased design efficiency.    Thickness of the wing root section was reduced to decrease  drag at high speeds and its camber and twist were changed, which  improved maneuver characteristics at supersonic flight speeds.  The sweep of other edges was reduced to 42 similar to the  wing's leading edge, which provides a decrease in amount of  radar cross-section. The area of each vertical tail surface was  changed from 10.13 to 8.27 m[.sup]2[/], which permitted  reducing aircraft height from 5.4 to 5 m and reducing its drag  in addition.    The program also provides for a number of modifications to  the Pratt and Whitney F119 engine. In particular, it is planned  to improve specific fuel consumption indicators in  nonafterburning conditions when cruising flight is made at  supersonic speeds (Mach 1.4-1.5).    The following are other substantial changes:     -  displacement of the air intake edge 46 cm to the rear,  which improves the aircraft's stability and  controllability;    -  some forward displacement of the pilot cockpit  and increased bluntness of the nose, which improves the view of  the forward hemisphere and characteristics of the onboard  radar;    -  a 66 cm decrease in overall length of the aircraft while  preserving the very same horizontal tail area.       It is envisaged building 11 F-22's (nine single-seaters and  two two-seaters) for $9.55 billion and 33 F119 engines ($1.375  billion) for full-scale fighter development. It is planned to  conduct flight tests in these aircraft to evaluate design  changes. Fabrication of the first series model is planned for  late 1993. It is planned to reach maximum production rate (48  aircraft per year) in 2002. According to statements of Pentagon  representatives, the first air wing (48 F-22's) will gain  combat-ready status only in 2002. It is planned to purchase a  total of 684 F-22's for the U.S. Air Force which basically will  replace F-15 tactical fighters (except for the last F-15E  modification).</p>

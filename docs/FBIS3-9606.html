			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Pool report] </F>   [Text] Bileca, March 26 (TANJUG) -- Members of the Bosnian  Croat Army on Saturday continued attacks on Moslem-controlled  parts of Mostar using grenade launchers and rifles with  telescopic sights, Moslem radio said, quoting a statement by the  information service of the fourth Bosnian Moslem army corps.    Croat-Moslem conflicts in the south of the former Yugoslav  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and in its central parts continue  despite the agreement signed by representatives of these two  peoples to form a federal state in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was  signed in Washington on March 18, under strong pressure from the  United States. Members of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) on  Saturday morning set fire to a nursery school in Mostar, said a  Moslem army statement. Five civilians were wounded on Friday in  mortar attacks by ustashi, as the Sarajevo Radio reporter called  the local Croat troops. The command of the 4th corps of the  so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Army (the Bosnian Moslem army) has  rejected explanations by Croats that some 'extremist elements of  the HVO' are violating the truce. Moslem units in the fronts in  the wider region of Serb-controlled Doboj in northeastern  Bosnia-Herzegovina, continued offensive actions, this time  against both Serb defence positions and villages, the  information service of the First Krajina Corps of the Bosnian  Serb army said on Saturday Morning. Bosnian Serb troops on  Saturday managed to repulse an infantry attack by the Moslems  northeast of Serb-controlled Teslic in northern Bosnia. An  attempt by a Moslem subversive-terrorist group to penetrate deep  into Serb territory in this part of the Teslic front was  successfully thwarted, and two Moslem infantry attacks on the  southern and southeastern sectors of the Trebava front were  repulsed. Moslem forces on Saturday also launched mortar attacks  against Serb villages on the right bank of the river Bosna.    Strong Moslem attacks using mortars, anti-aircraft and  infantry weaponry were recorded in the night between Friday and  Saturday from their positions some 20km northwest of Zvornik, a  town in northeastern Bosnia which is on the border with the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Bosnian Serb troops returned  strong fire to protect their positions. There were no casualties  on the Serb side, the sources said. Moslems attacked Serb  positions in the area of Konjic, Foca and Cajnice (southeastern  Bosnia) with infantry and anti-aircraft weaponry from the wider  region of Gorazde, the information service of the Herzegovina  Corps said on Saturday.</p>

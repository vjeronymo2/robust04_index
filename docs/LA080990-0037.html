			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZSA ZSA GABOR IN JAIL  </P> <P> What? A 72-year-old woman was jailed for fighting back with a cop who roughed  her up when she tried to defend herself against his manhandling. Terrible!  What's the U.S. coming to? Oh, it was that loud-mouthed Zsa Zsa Gabor? That's  different. Let her eat TV dinners in jail.  </P> <P> JAN KNOWLTON  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

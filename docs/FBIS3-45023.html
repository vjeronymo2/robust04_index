Mesfin said the relations between the two countries are very  good, adding that Ethiopia has had a lot of support from and  cooperation with China in achieving national unity and economic  development.    He hailed the economic development in China as a great  success, which he said will be a great encouragement to Ethiopia.    Qian Qichen, who is also Chinese vice-premier, said China  treasures the friendship between the two countries and is  willing to strengthen the cooperation on the basis of the five  principles of peaceful coexistence.    Qian said, the realization of peace in Ethiopia after 30  years of civil war shows what can be achieved by Ethiopia can  also be attained by other similar African countries, so long  clue efforts are made [as received].    The Chinese vice-premier said Ethiopian national economy  grows very fast, with a growth rate of 7.9 percent in 1992-93  fiscal year.    Qian Qichen said at a time when Africa is facing many  challenges and new difficulties, there have been varied  approaches to the continent, some think human rights is the most  important for Africa and others think it is the democratization.  In the light of the practice of China, we hold that the most  important tasks for Africa at present are: firstly to keep  political and social stability which is the primary condition  for the development of economy, secondly to develop economy  which is the central task and fundamental goal of all work.  Thirdly reform, only by which can all construction make  progress. Stability is the condition, reform is the motive  force, while development is the central task.    The Ethiopian foreign minister agreed with the analysis of  the Chinese vice-premier, believing that stability and  development is inseparable.    Qian Qichen also praised highly Ethiopia's policy of good  neighborliness and regional peace.    He said Somali question is the most important one in Africa.  China is paying great attention to the development in Somalia  and sympathizing with the sufferings of the Somali people.    He said, the Somali issue can only be solved by the Somali  people themselves, adding that the key to the peaceful solution  of the Somali problem is to achieve a broad national  reconciliation in Somalia.    However, Qian noted that the international community should  help the Somali people to resolve the Somali issue, but should  not do everything in their stead.    He also expressed the hope that all Somali factions could  iron out the differences through discussions and dialogues and  the Organization of African Unity and countries in the horn of  Africa can play an important role in seeking a solution to the  Somali issue.</p>

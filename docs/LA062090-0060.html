			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> CANADIAN PACT FALLING APART AS PUBLIC BALKS  </P> <P> Less than two weeks ago, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney could argue that he had  it all sewn up: The political elite of the country had signed a constitutional  deal that would avert the threatened breakup of English- and French-speaking  Canada.  </P> <P> No more.  </P> <P> In a remarkable political upset, public opinion has swept Mulroney's arduously  crafted plans into complete disarray. The constitutional deal that looked like  a juggernaut just one week ago now looks as though it will die Saturday.  </P> <P> Oddly, the seemingly mortal blows have been dealt by obscure figures in  Manitoba and Newfoundland, have-not provinces that don't often make it into the  national news headlines.  </P> <P> Analysts have been predicting that if Mulroney's constitutional accord fails,  Quebec will take steps toward restructuring its relationship with  English-speaking Canada, perhaps even toward independence.  </P> <P> There are also predictions that the damage to Mulroney will be profound. Even  before this week, his standing in the polls was painfully low, and the events  of the last few days have shown just how determined he can be to ram his ideas  through, regardless of public opinion.  </P> <P> "The trust of Canadians in their leaders has been ruptured," said Christopher  Dunn, a political scientist at Memorial University here in St. John's.  </P> <P> Already, a member of Mulroney's Progressive Conservative caucus quit last week  over the prime minister's constitutional management, bringing to six the number  of Tories who have either left or been kicked out of the party in recent  months. Although Mulroney's constitutional package may yet be saved -- the past  few weeks have already brought a number of big political surprises -- more  Tories may jump ship, depending on what happens over the next few days and  weeks.  </P> <P> "If Meech doesn't pass, he's shagged," fisherman Don Stanford said of Mulroney.  </P> <P> "Meech" is shorthand for the now-notorious Meech Lake Accord, a package of  constitutional amendments that were written in 1987 to give greater powers to  Canada's 10 provinces, and in particular to the French-speaking province of  Quebec.  </P> <P> The accord started out as an innocuous effort to persuade Quebec to sign the  national constitution, which it hasn't done so far. But over the three years  since the accord was drafted, it has evolved into a political Frankenstein,  frightening some Canadians into thinking that the country will fall apart if it  is ratified, and others into believing the country will fall apart if it isn't.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, Mulroney launched an all-out effort to silence the opposition to  the accord and to persuade all 10 provincial premiers to ratify the amendments.  If the amendments aren't unanimously ratified by Saturday, the accord will  become null. Mulroney called the 10 premiers to Ottawa, the national capital,  and essentially closeted them in a conference center until they agreed to sign.  Even then, Manitoba and Newfoundland held out as long as they could.  </P> <P> The secrecy of the meetings annoyed many Canadians, but when the talks were  over, Mulroney declared victory. He and the 10 exhausted premiers held an  emotional accord-signing ceremony in Ottawa, making speeches about national  unity in an auditorium draped with colorful provincial flags.  </P> <P> It was a triumphant moment, but only a moment. As soon as the premiers of  Newfoundland and Manitoba went back to their respective capitals -- St. John's  and Winnipeg -- saying they would put the accord to a vote in their  legislatures, new trouble erupted.  </P> <P> In Winnipeg, the trouble took the unexpected form of Elijah Harper, a quiet  Indian chief and the only native Canadian member of the Manitoba legislature.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, Harper was virtually unknown outside of his own impoverished  district. He cuts a humble figure, his long black hair clipped in an austere  ponytail, his shoulders slumped, a beaded lanyard hanging at his neck. When he  makes television appearances, he seems unable to look straight into the camera  and instead gazes bashfully at the floor. In the legislature, he clutches an  eagle feather for moral support.  </P> <P> But when his fellow legislators tried to introduce the Meech Lake Accord for  debate and ratification, Harper launched a one-man procedural battle that has  held up all discussion for nearly a week. Thanks to his effort, it now looks  certain that Manitoba will miss the ratification deadline.  </P> <P> Harper's motivation comes from the general feeling among native Canadians that  the Meech Lake Accord assumes that French and Englishmen, not natives, are the  nation's founding fathers. Native Canadians are convinced, with some  justification, that the drafters simply forgot all about aboriginal people when  they wrote the pact.  </P> <P> Harper is a Cree, but he has won the support of numerous other tribes in  Canada. When he appears in the legislature, Indians congregate outside, beating  thunderously on ceremonial drums.  </P> <P> The federal government has tried to condemn Harper as a lone meddler holding up  a vital process for the nation. But it is a hard argument to swallow. In  addition to the accolades of fellow Indians, Harper has won widespread support  and admiration from white, English-speaking Canadians who have long opposed the  accord for their own reasons but couldn't figure out what to do about it. When  Harper walks in or out of the legislature, he receives applause, cheers and  slaps on the back from white strangers.  </P> <P> The sudden burst of sympathy from people who never showed much concern for the  Indian point of view in the past has surprised and touched Harper, who  sometimes has tears in his eyes when he quietly makes his simple public  remarks.  </P> <P> The federal government earlier this week rushed an envoy to the prairie  province to meet with an assembly of native chiefs and offer them various  goodies if they would back down. The Indians listened, then said no.  </P> <P> In Newfoundland, on the other hand, Manitoba's Indian uprising has delighted  legislators who themselves face a vote Friday on whether to ratify the accord.  Many legislators here have wanted to vote against the accord but are afraid of  going down in history as the ones who single-handedly drove Quebec out of the  confederation. Harper's activities have taken some of the pressure off them.  </P> <P> Some analysts even think that if it is a sympathetic Indian chief who blocks  the accord, rather than a body of English-speaking politicians, Quebec won't be  able to react as harshly.  </P> <P> "I don't say they won't be furious, but they won't be as furious," said Dunn of  Memorial University.  </P> <P> While events play out in Manitoba, the 52 members of Newfoundland's House of  Assembly have been frantically canvassing their constituents, asking them  whether they should vote yes or no for the accord. Here in Newfoundland, as in  Manitoba, the answer is generally no.  </P> <P> In Newfoundland, the central objection isn't native rights but the feeling that  special constitutional powers given to Quebec would elevate French Canadians  unfairly above the rest of the nation. Quebecers argue that they need such  special powers because as French speakers they represent a threatened minority  group. But Newfoundlanders aren't buying it.  </P> <P> "That's what we are condemning South Africa for -- trying to protect the Boer  society," said Angela Sullivan, who came to an open house thrown by her member  of the legislature in a school gym. She pointed out that Canada imposes  economic sanctions on South Africa while trying to elevate a minority group  above all others.  </P> <P> "You can't have it both ways," she said.  </P> <P> Newfoundlanders have been convinced by past experience that Quebec is a dirty  dealer that doesn't need any more power than it already has.  </P> <P> Back in the 1960s, when Newfoundland wanted to harness the hydroelectric power  of a mighty waterfall on its Churchill River, Quebec refused to let the  Atlantic coast province build transmission lines over its territory. Without  the transmission lines, Newfoundland couldn't deliver the power to markets in  southern Ontario and the United States. So Newfoundland negotiated to sell its  power to Quebec over 65 years at a fixed price; Quebec could then resell it  farther south.  </P> <P> Soon after the document was signed, energy prices soared and Newfoundlanders  found themselves locked into a deal that gave Quebecers the power at a tiny  fraction of its market price. Today, Newfoundland's hydro-power pours hundreds  of millions of dollars a year into Quebec's coffers.  </P> <P> Newfoundlanders haven't forgotten this and are urging members of their  legislature not to forget it either when they vote this Friday.  </P> <P> "Seems like if the French don't get their own way, they just bitch," fisherman  Bob Morris told his representative, Shannie Duff, when she came to visit him  and his fellow crewmen in a shack above their small wharf Tuesday.  </P> <P> "The Newfoundlanders never get nothing," agreed his friend, Don Stanford.  </P> <P> "Let Meech die," said Morris.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> The Meech Lake Accord, a package of constitutional amendments giving greater  powers to Canada's provinces and in particular to French-speaking Quebec, must  be ratified by all 10 provinces by Saturday or it becomes null. In  Newfoundland, where sentiment is strong against the accord in general and  Quebec in particular, the legislature is scheduled to vote Friday. In Manitoba,  an "Indian uprising" seems certain to delay a ratification vote beyond the  deadline.  </P></p>

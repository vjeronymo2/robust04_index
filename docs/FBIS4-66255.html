			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Nan (1728 0589), M.A. Candidate, </F> Department of Commercial Economics, Jinan University: "Voluntary  Export Restraints: A Business Strategy Analysis"]    [Text] I. Introduction    What is meant by Voluntary Export Restraints (VER) is that  exporting nations or regions, under demands or pressures from an  importing nation, will "voluntarily" impose restraints on  exports to a particular country for certain goods for a given  period of time. VER is a neo-protectionist measure in nature,  with the following special features:    1. Nontransparency. VER are arranged privately between  governments after bilateral consultations. Calling it  "voluntary" is an excuse to bypass the principles of GATT, and  conduct "grey area" measures.    2. Discrimination. VER is not restricted by GATT's  "nondiscrimination principle." It usually has an anticipated  purpose and is highly selective, directed at individual  countries and individual producers.    3. Flexibility. VER is usually a short term measure, with a  term of from three to five years. VER can be renewed, extended,  or expanded. It is much more flexible than long term, fixed  tariff measures, making it more direct and efficient for  handling temporary trade disputes.    Although under certain conditions these characteristics can  make VER simpler, more direct, faster and more efficient than  other trade protection measures such as tariffs, VER can have  serious limitations.    Trade experts consider VER to be one type of "imperfect  protectionism." Trade protectionism itself will twist the  disposition of resources, plus it is "imperfect," causing profit  losses in importing countries which implement VER. This is  because under VER, "scarcity of profit" caused by trade  restraints will be gained by exporting countries. When tariffs  are used, this part of the interest is obtained by the importing  countries' governments by means of tariff income; under a quota  system, most of them will be gained by importers with quotas by  means of "quota rent." Obviously, a nation adopting VER is  actually sacrificing the profits of its own domestic consumers,  to increase the interests of its exporters or the exporting  nation's government. Moreover, it is equivalent to pushing, even  compelling, other nations to create export cartels to deal with  its citizens. This is where VER is "imperfect." So, just from  the standpoint of economic efficiency, based on the above  analysis, VER is not at all more reasonable or efficient than  other trade protection policies such as tariffs; on the  contrary, to a certain degree, it turns out to be even worse.    However, the statistical reality shows that in current  international trade, VER is being used more frequently,  affecting a growing number of nations, regions, and industrial  areas. From 1981 to 1988, among all the nontariff policies  adopted by the EC for imported industrial products, the VER  proportion increased from 24.6 percent to 38.1 percent, while in  the same period, the U.S. proportion grew from 59.3 percent to  66.5 percent, close to two-thirds. At the outset of the  nineties, 15 percent of the world's trade had been arranged by  VER.    Why has VER, a kind of "imperfect protectionism," become  such  a popular instrument of trade policy? This article will try to  find answers to this question from the standpoint of marketing  strategy.  <H5>  II. VER's operating system and the combination of operations </H5> and marketing    1. The involvement of large enterprises.    Before discussing VER's operating system, we must first pay  attention to an important fact: VER is not just an activity or  arrangement between governments.    First, surveys show that 80 percent of VER are formal  agreements between governments, while the remaining 20 percent  are "informal" (that is, agreements between governments and  industries) or "nongovernmental measures" (that is, agreements  between industries or enterprises). Because the latter two forms  of VER are usually entered into secretly, and therefore  difficult to document, the above results may not be  representative. But regardless of whether they are "informal" or  "nongovernmental measures," they differ from common export  cartels in that they usually have the approval or tacit consent  of the importing nation's government. In 1971, the Japanese  Steel Association announced it was implementing VER on its steel  exports to the EC. This was the result of secret negotiations  between the major steel corporations of Japan and Europe.    Second, VER agreements between governments usually also have  the enthusiastic participation of large enterprises. These  enterprises are usually of large scale, and solid strength, so  it is not difficult to forecast that in most VER arrangements,  the interests of trade groups or large enterprises usually  receive priority consideration. In return, these trade groups or  large enterprises will be more obedient to their governments'  control. For example, in the U.S.-Japan VER agreement on  semiconductors, such major U.S. enterprises as Motorola, Intel,  and Texas Instruments, and major Japanese enterprises like  Toshiba, Hitachi, JVC, and Panasonic all participated in the  initiation and negotiation of the agreement, and were decisive  in its formulation and conclusion.    It is just because the establishment of VER are so  influenced  by individual trade or enterprises, that this kind of measure  tends to have administrative decisions concerning export quotas  which are based on how specific enterprises compare with  tariffs, quotas, etc., so it is easier to use to lay out a  specific operating and marketing strategy based on a  competitor's position, attraction of the target market, and  product cycle.    2. VER's operating system and the combination of operations  and marketing.    Combining operations and marketing is one aspect of an  enterprises's operating and marketing strategy; at the same time  it is also a combination of the controllable variables of  operation and marketing for enterprises to use in implementing  operating and marketing strategies. Since the restraining  policies of VER are usually manifested in restrictions on such  variables of operating and marketing as prices, market size,  etc., of exported products, therefore VER's own mechanisms can  work directly or indirectly to combine operations and marketing,  and become an efficient and precise measure for reflecting and  conducting enterprises' operating and marketing strategies. This  cannot be defeated by such trade protective measures as tariffs.    The figures listed below are based on survey statistics from  289 VER agreements. In these VER arrangements, the individual  variables restricted in operating and marketing combinations  were distributed as follows:    export amount in established markets (rate)    53% market share in established markets    25% increased export supply    10% the lowest export price in established markets    20% conditions and opportunities of distribution    30% assigned conditions [tiaojian] and opportunities  [shiji]    1) VER's effect on pricing policies.    As listed above, 20 percent of the sample VER agreements  included provisions for the lowest export limited price. For  example, in 1990, in the EC-Japan VER agreement on  semiconductors, it stipulated that Japanese semiconductor  manufacturers would set the lowest price at 9.5 percent higher  than production cost for their "dynamic random chip." In  addition to its direct influence on overseas manufacturers  setting their export price to the importing nation, this kind of  policy sometimes also limits their export price to third  nations. For example, in 1986, a VER agreement on  semiconductors between the United States and Japan implemented  market price oversight on certain products in third countries.    Since VER increasingly has been used as a way of avoiding  anti-dumping and anti-subsidy punitive measures, this kind of  lowest price policy becomes increasingly important in VER  agreements. Its direct result is to cause the price of the  exported product to rise in the importing nation's market. For  example, the 1981 VER agreement on automobiles between the  United States and Japan caused the total U.S. import price index  to drop 5 percent during the period 1982 to 1985, while the  automobile price index rose 7 percent.    (2) VER's effect on product strategy.    With the restriction of VER, exporters have to give up some  of their price advantage, and in order to maintain their  competitive position, they must turn to improving their  products' nature, improving quality. This will push enterprises  to continue expanding their product mix when determining their  product strategy, developing new products (including new models,  new designs, etc.), developing toward areas which have not been  restricted by VER; constantly improving the level of their  products, and strengthening their competitiveness.    One interesting example is the automobile VER between the  United States and Japan (1981-1985): although the number of  automobiles exported to the United States from Japan decreased,  Japanese enterprises were able to maintain their profit level in  the automobile market by improving models and adding new models  which were outside those restricted.    (3) VER's effect on distribution strategy.    VER's stipulations will often involve every aspect of  distribution strategy in enterprises, for example, items  concerning time of supply, "expected quantity" and "reserved  quantity," mode of transport, port of entry, etc. They may even  stipulate marketing channels in the importing nation. These  detailed restrictive measures are very meaningful and important  for importing nations to implement protections, and for  exporters to strengthen monopolies.  <H5>  III. VER and competitive strategies. </H5>   1. Exporters' competitive strategies.    As challengers to the overseas markets, exporters can  implement a series of competitive strategies, including the  following very typical ones:    (1) Frontal attack strategy. Market challengers launch a  direct attack on market leaders. This kind of direct  confrontation will usually lead to a VER agreement. This was  precisely the situation with U.S. semiconductors at the  beginning of the eighties: the Toshiba Corporation of Japan--the  second chip manufacturer in the world, launched an "attack" on  the leading U.S. chip manufacturer, the Motorola Corporation,  and their intense market battle led to a U.S.-Japan VER  agreement in 1986.    (2) Flank attack strategy. Exporting corporations try to  avoid a frontal fight through bypassing the market leaders in  exporting countries, and obtain a market share from the side. In  the seventies and early eighties, while major U.S. automobile  manufacturers were still devoted to making large-sized cars,  Japanese corporations began concentrating on producing and  exporting small-sized cars.    (3) "Eating little fish" strategy. Market challengers turn  to  attacking and eliminating smaller competitors instead of  fighting with the market leaders in importing countries. In the  seventies and early eighties, European data control machine tool  manufacturers adopted exactly this strategy to "attack"  initially the same type of small enterprises in the U.S. market.    Under VER arrangements, exporters usually must abandon the  frontal attack strategy, and turn instead to the flank attack  strategy or "eating little fish" strategy. At the same time,  because VER leads to similar cartel activity by exporters, it  gives them on the one hand the ability to share in monopoly  profits, while on the other hand it makes them pay more  attention to nonpricing competition under the stronger pressure  of price competition. This makes for comprehensive improvement  in their products' competitive ability.    2. Competitive advantage for manufacturers in importing  countries.    The competitive advantage for manufacturers in importing  countries under VER acts chiefly as an advantage in protecting  their market share and established profits, so actually it is a  "protective advantage." This functions to:    (1) Share markets with overseas manufacturers.    With the stronger trend to internationalized production and  sales and the increasing progress made in science, technology,  and productive forces, more enterprises with strong technical  and products advantages attempt to improve the level of their  profits by means of expanding their quota in the international  market. Therefore, manufacturers in importing countries are  facing an increased risk of frontal attack from foreign market  challengers. In this situation, importing countries try to reach  agreement on sharing the market with the challengers, while the  "imperfect" parts of VER mentioned above can be understood  partly as designed to compensate or encourage the other side to  accept this sort of agreement. For example, in mid- eighties,  due to the implementation of VER, Japan increased the price of  its video tapes exported to the EC market by 50 percent; steel  prices in the EC market rose 14 to 16 percent.    So, VER can make enterprises in importing countries  negotiate  with foreign challengers, attaining price and profit levels  which would be impossible under other conditions. It is only in  this way that VER receives the further protection and support of  bilateral parties. For example, when Japanese automobile  manufacturers went outside Congress to launch their opposition  to replacing the U.S.-Japan VER agreement with quotas or a  tariff on automobiles exported from Japan, they obtained support  from the U.S. International Wholesalers Association and several  major U.S. auto makers.    (2) Restrain foreign manufacturers.    Most VER agreements include a provision to restrict the  market share of foreign manufacturers, with the purpose of  limiting their market within a smaller scale. So, for the  domestic industries that will implement protections, this kind  of VER is more clear, reliable, and efficient, at least for the  short term. In the seventies and eighties, France obligated  Japan to voluntarily restrain the growth rate of its French  market share to no more than 3 percent of its small car exports,  which effectively limited Japanese imports, and protected  domestic enterprises of the same type.  <H5>  IV. VER and market mix. </H5>   Competitive strategy is closely related to market mix. It is  not difficult to find that implementation of VER is concentrated  in a small number of industries. These industries can generally  be divided into two large categories: (1) industries in which  the market mix is characteristically an oligarchical monopoly,  such as steel, automobile, electrical products, etc.; (2)  industries which have problems adjusting mix, and are in decline  in the developed industrial countries, such as shoes, fabric  products and clothing, etc. VER plays a different role in these  two kinds of industries.    1. VER as a protective measure.    VER chiefly is employed in the second type of industry as a  kind of protective arrangement, and usually does not include the  factor of importing countries and enterprises in exporting  countries seeking a joint monopoly. However, due to the  intrinsic "imperfection" of VER, this kind of protection  functions very unsatisfactorily. As Jiadisi Pagewadi [6328 6611  2448 1584 2706 3907 5530] has noted, this sort of "imperfect  protectionism" of VER on the one hand, goes along with the  exporting countries, permitting them to continue exporting under  import tariff conditions which are closer to free trade; on the  other hand, it also goes along with the desire of policy makers  in importing countries of wanting to conduct free trade while  seeking to reduce the threat from imports.    2. VER promotes seeking joint monopolies.    In the first kind of industry mentioned above, there  commonly  is an oligarchical monopoly market mix. When these industrial  oligarchs expand into foreign markets, they meet intense  competition. If they compete, both of them will be hurt; so they  discuss sharing monopoly profits. Under VER agreements,  importing countries threaten more severe trade restrictive  measures; exporting governments also step up coercive measures,  to eliminate apprehensions about violating anti-monopoly laws;  in addition, VER itself establishes an operational system of  regular inquiries, communication of information, and resolution  of special problems, and all this has provided a strong impetus  for importing countries and large enterprises and trade groups  in exporting countries to seek joint monopolies. The result is a  trend to further concentration in the steel, automobile, working  machine tool and electric products industries. For example, in  the electrical industry, the 25 largest corporations dominate 50  percent of the total output of electrical products, while the  top 200 corporations dominate 80 percent of the world's gross  output.    So we can see from this, VER is an arrangement of monopoly  agreements by large corporations or trade groups in the  international market, and the government's involvement actually  provides a "cover" for them from anti-monopoly laws' oversight  restrictions, as well as help safeguard them from coercive  measures taken against destructive and violating agreements.  <H5>  V. Conclusion </H5>   VER is not only an "imperfect protectionism," but also a  kind  of forceful power. It can form precise and flexible operating  strategies in global trade, which can be overcome by other  measures such as tariffs, quotas, etc. To operate this weapon,  besides governments, there are more individual large enterprises  and trade groups taking advantage of VER, changing strong  foreign competitors into collaborators, jointly sharing the  market profits.    At present, this kind of measure, which violates free  competition global trade policy, is getting wild. As GATT expert  Professor Jackson has observed: with trade policy becoming  complicated and flexible, people will see more clearly that  activities due to a lack of unified rules for international  competition, especially activities among privately run  enterprises, definitely will damage the objective of global free  trade.    Establishing unified rules and policy for international  competition will very possibly become major topics in the next  cycle of GATT negotiations.  <H5>  Major references: </H5>   1.

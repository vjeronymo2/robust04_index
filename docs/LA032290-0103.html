			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEUD BETWEEN CITY OFFICIALS HEATS UP;  </P> <P> MONTEREY PARK: COUNCILMAN BARRY HATCH SAYS CITY MANAGER MARK LEWIS ABUSED HIS  AUTHORITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE POLICE CHIEF'S RESIGNATION. HE WANTS TO FIRE  LEWIS.  </P> <P> Councilman Barry Hatch, accusing City Manager Mark Lewis of financial  mismanagement and abuse of authority in connection with the resignation of the  police chief last week, is trying to enlist residents in his efforts to oust  Lewis.  </P> <P> Hatch, who called for Lewis' resignation after Police Chief Ken Hickman quit,  said other council members have ignored his request for a city investigation of  the city manager. So Hatch is hoping residents will help pressure his  colleagues to change their minds.  </P> <P> At a news conference Tuesday outside City Hall, Hatch reiterated his demand  that Lewis resign.  </P> <P> "Our police chief should never have been allowed to go," said Hatch, who  credited Hickman with streamlining police operations and controlling costs  during his one year on the job.  </P> <P> Lewis, who has the support of at least three of the five council members,  denied Hatch's charges: "I think those allegations are absolutely without  foundation." Lewis became city manager in 1988, the third since 1986.  </P> <P> Hatch said Lewis had undermined Hickman's authority by maintaining an "open  back door" policy that allowed police officers to go to Lewis and win reversals  of the chief's policy decisions.  </P> <P> Hickman resigned after the Monterey Park Police Officers Assn. gave him a vote  of no confidence. One of the association's complaints was that Hickman had  drastically reduced overtime. Overtime costs reached a high of $30,000 a month  last year but were reduced to $6,000 a month in January, Capt. Dan Cross said.  </P> <P> Hatch accused Lewis of telling his staff to conceal mounting overtime costs and  shortfalls in projected city revenues. He charged that there is a $300,000  deficit in the city's budget of $30.5 million.  </P> <P> Helen Bell, Monterey Park director of management services, denied that a  deficit exists. She said officials expect the city to be in the black by June,  the end of the fiscal year.  </P> <P> In addition, Hatch was critical of Lewis' decision to appoint former police  Chief Robert Collins as interim chief, even though he has retired and is  receiving disability benefits for a heart condition. Hatch said bringing back  Collins could create additional worker compensation liabilities for the city if  he experiences further medical problems while filling in as chief.  </P> <P> "I have lost total faith in our city manager," said Hatch, adding that he will  try to gain support for Lewis' ouster as he campaigns door-to-door for  reelection to the council. In the April 10 election, he is among six candidates  vying for three seats.  </P> <P> Already, he said, a unspecified number of residents plan to press for Lewis'  resignation at council candidates' forums and at Monday's council meeting.  </P> <P> Mayor Patricia Reichenberger scoffed at Hatch's accusations and defended Lewis  as a good manager who keeps the council informed of financial matters.  </P> <P> "Mark has always been direct with us," she said.  </P> <P> In response to Hatch's charges, Lewis said he keeps an open door for city  employees so they have "the opportunity to talk with the city manager about  things that really bother them." On the police officers' dispute with Hickman,  Lewis said he did not intervene until the matter got out of control.  </P> <P> In terms of the city's financial situation, Lewis said he never instructed  staff members to hide information from the council. Bell said revenues from  some new municipal fees are lower than anticipated but said there is no  cover-up.  </P> <P> "I never heard Mark say not to tell the council," Bell said.  </P> <P> And as for the appointment of Collins, Lewis said doctors have determined that  the retired chief is medically fit to work. He said attorneys have assured him  that appointing Collins as interim chief will not lead to workers' compensation  problems.  </P></p>

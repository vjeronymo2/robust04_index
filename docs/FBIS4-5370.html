			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 11 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has given  troop transport vehicles and ammunition to the Cambodian Army, a  Japanese newspaper reported from Phnom Penh on Sunday.    With North Korea's support, last month the Cambodian Army  was  able to capture Pailin, the "capital" of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge  guerrillas, the SANKEI SHIMBUN said.    Pyongyang supplied the materiel free of charge to maintain  friendly relations with Southeast Asian nations in a bid to  avoid international isolation resulting from suspicions over its  nuclear program, the newspaper quoted a Cambodian Army official  as saying.    The North Koreans sent six troop transport vehicles and  scores of tons of field guns, mortars, rifles and ammunition by  air to Cambodia and plan to supply additional ammunition in  April, according to the official.    Making use of the North Korean weapons, the Cambodian Army  staged a fierce attack on the rebels and succeeded in driving  them out of Pailin on March 21, the official said.    Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk and North Korean President  Kim Il-song have maintained a close relationship and Sihanouk  visits Pyongyang every year, according to the official.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Record set for Victorian artist's work: Saleroom A PAINTING by Arthur Elsley depicting a little girl saying goodnight to her pet dogs sold for Dollars 176,000 (Pounds 100,000) at Christie's in New York on Wednesday. The sentimental picture, which doubled its high estimate, set a record price for the late Victorian artist. The auction of 19th century European paintings totalled Dollars 2.9m, with 22 per cent unsold. 'Retour des Champs', a young girl carrying foliage by William Bouguereau, sold for Dollars 198,000 and 'The Golf Links, North Berwick' by Sir John Lavery did well at Dollars 121,000. Christie's in London yesterday disposed of 19th century decorative art. A cabinet, made in ivory in the shape of a Gothic castle and created to display the artist's virtuosity, sold for Pounds 19,250. 'Teucer', a Homeric archer, cast by Hamo Thorneycroft around 1903, fetched the same sum. Anthony Thompson, the former head of Christie's rugs and carpets department who has set up on his own to compete with the large auction houses, brought in Pounds 104,500 from his second textiles auction in London yesterday. The top price was the Pounds 9,350 paid for an Aubusson tapestry of the 19th century. A Crewel work panel, produced in England in the early 18th century, sold for Pounds 3,960. A painting by Cezanne, 'The Stove in the Studio', has been allocated to the National Gallery under the acceptance-in-lieu procedures. In negotiations between Christie's and the Museums and Galleries Commission, the estate of the late Mrs Helen G. Chester Beatty has been relieved of a tax liability of Pounds 750,000. Phillips yesterday raised Pounds 124,888 from the stamp collection of Mr Nissim Capon, who died last year aged 103. The top price was the Pounds 13,200 paid for a mint stock of stamps from Bosnia and Herzegovina, issued just before the First World War. After the creation of Yugoslavia in 1919 the new government bought back the stamps from Cappon and over-printed them. He subsequently acquired them again. Their appearance at auction could scarcely be more timely.</p>

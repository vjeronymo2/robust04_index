			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President of the Republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim  Rugova held a news conference in Prishtina today. Asked about  the Serbian mass media threats to arrest him, Rugova answered:  I carry out my job and I am here. For more details, let us  follow reporter Sherif Konjufca:    [Konjufca] The raids and arrests of Albanian citizens by the  Serbian police are being accompanied with the brutal demolition  of houses and the destruction of their properties.    Mr. Rugova said that, during last week, Selman Daci was  killed at the Hani i Elezit border point for no reason. The  trumped-up trials against Albanians continued in Peje and other  cities in Kosova. On the other hand, movements of the Serbian  Army have been observed in many areas in Kosova, particularly at  the border area with Albania. Police formations are continuing  to be stationed in many areas, such as in the factory of [word  indistinct] near Kacanik, the Prishtina-Podujeve road, Komoran,  and other localities.    After the closure of the academy, the Serbian authorities  have decided to close the Albanological Institute, which is an  institution that bears a symbol of the national identity of  Albanians. Unlike the first closure of the institute in 1957,  this time the institute will continue its work just like the  other scientific, cultural, and state institutions in Kosova,  despite whatever will happen with its building.    Mr. Rugova said that we, once again, warn the Serbian regime  and its exponents installed in Kosova of the consequences of all  these provocations against the Albanian population in Kosova.    On this occasion, Mr. Rugova greeted NATO's intervention in  the Bosnian sky, the Bosnian-Croat agreement, and the statement  by U.S. Secretary of State Christopher that all the problems in  the former Yugoslavia will be resolved by the United States and  Europe without bloodshed. This gives us hope that the problem  of Kosova, too, will be solved by placing its territory under UN  protection.    Answering a question about the possibility of intervention  by  an external factor, particularly Albania, in the case of war or  a Serbian massacre in Kosova, President Rugova answered: We  have worked to avoid conflict in Kosova. However, Albania, which  is concerned about the fate of its fellow nationals in Kosova,  is also not interested in a conflict. Today, the whole world  knows the catastrophic consequences that such a conflict may  bring to the whole region.    Regarding a journalist's appeal to comment on the threats of  the press and several Serbian party leaders to havre him  arrested, Mr. Rugova answered briefly: We are all threatened,  but I carry out my job and I am here.    Meanwhile, responding to the possibility of Albanian-Serbian  dialogue, Mr. Rugova said: We have said that we favor dialogue,  but the Serbian side does not give such signs. First,  repression should be stopped and an appropriate atmosphere for  talks be created. The talks should be held in the presence of  an international mediator. For the moment, the Serbian regime  has erected a mental blockade and cannot find courage to do  that, Mr. Rugova said at the end of his meeting with reporters.</p>

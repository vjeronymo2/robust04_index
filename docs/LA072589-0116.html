			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRASH DEATHS CLIMB TO 111; TAIL DAMAGE STILL A PUZZLE  </P> <P> The tail section of the shattered United Airlines DC-10 was moved into a hangar  Monday so that investigators could try to reassemble it, and officials said the  initial phase of the crash probe was nearing an end.  </P> <P> "Certainly by mid to late week we hope to have completed everything out at the  airport," Ted Lopatkiewicz of the National Transportation Safety Board said.  Meanwhile, searchers were still looking for pieces of the jet's rear engine,  and the number of lives lost to the crash last Wednesday rose to 111 with the  death of an injured passenger.  </P> <P> Brent Bealer, 27, of Quakertown, Pa., died Sunday night at St. Luke's Regional  Medical Center, Rhonda Ostrihonsky of the hospital staff said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 32 Still in Hospitals  </P> <P> The plane carried 296 people, of whom 185 have survived. Officials at St.  Luke's and Marian Health Center said that 32 of the survivors remained  hospitalized.  </P> <P> United said that 108 bodies had been positively identified by Monday afternoon.  </P> <P> Joe Hopkins, speaking for United, said the airline on Monday provided a special  flight to Chicago to carry 12 bodies, 29 relatives of the dead, one survivor  and five United employees. On Sunday, a United flight carried 11 bodies, 33  family members and one survivor to Chicago.  </P> <P> United officials said that Capt. Alfred C. Haynes, the pilot of Flight 232,  would be released from Marian Health Center today and would make a statement.  Haynes, of Seattle, has been praised for keeping the plane aloft and guiding it  to the airport after almost all means of controlling the jet had been lost.  </P> <P> Investigators used cranes to move the plane's tail section into a hangar, where  they tried to piece it back together to determine how much damage was done when  the No. 2 engine broke up over the farms of northwestern Iowa.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Farm Fields Combed  </P> <P> Other teams continued searching a 16-square-mile section of corn and soybean  fields about 60 miles from the crash site, in hopes of finding missing pieces  of the engine, Lopatkiewicz said. None had been found by Monday, he said.  </P> <P> Officials had jets from the Nebraska Air National Guard take infrared  photographs of the area and asked that farmers watch for pieces of the engine  in the fields.  </P> <P> Lopatkiewicz said it will "take about nine to 12 months" to determine what  caused the jetliner's tail engine to come apart and sever hydraulic lines.  </P></p>

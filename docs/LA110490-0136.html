			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TIP OF THE HAT TO COUNTRY  </P> <P> ** 1/2 CLINT BLACK "Put Yourself in My Shoes" RCA  </P> <P> Black's 2-million-selling debut album last year presented a newcomer who seemed  more than just another wide grin under a wide brim -- though he proudly sports  both. Not only could he sing real purdy, but he could write, with songs such as  "Killin' Time" offering new twists on the old bar-stool philosophizing and  straying from the Strait and narrow path.  </P> <P> But instead of staking out his own niche with this follow-up, the Texan strives  too hard to be all things to all fans. He's a honky-tonk swinger here, a  restless balladeer there, a working stiff, a lover . . . never just Clint  Black. He's capable of keen observations and neat turns of phrases, but often  settles for such things as "No man is an island, but I'm still all alone" --  one in a sea of nautical cliches in the Jimmy Buffett-like "Gulf of Mexico."  </P> <P> When he hits, he hits high: "The Old Man" is an impressive meditation on  mortality, with Black musing, "Will I ever be the old man who's too far gone?"  But more often the album hinges on the music (expertly executed, but there's  not a lick that's not recycled) and Black's voice (he's good, but hardly the  pure singer that, say, Randy Travis is). And that leaves pretty much just the  grin and the brim. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

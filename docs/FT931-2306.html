			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Ministers braced for rebellion on coal industry white paper THE government is preparing to risk another political row over the coal industry by publishing a white paper in the next two weeks before it has won any guarantees to keep open some of the 31 threatened pits. Ministers want to lay the white paper before parliament by April 2 even though they have conceded it will not be possible to conclude negotiations with generators for coal tonnages additional to those in 'base' contracts nearing conclusion. Their decision comes five months after launching a coal review prompted by the furore over the closure decision. It means that the future of thousands of threatened miners' jobs will remain uncertain for several months longer. It will also lay the government open to potential further rebellion by dissident Tory MPs. Labour will charge that the all-party trade and industry select committee was able to produce a formula for saving at least half the 31 pits by the end of January. The date of the white paper will depend on when, and if, the negotiations for the base contracts between British Coal and the electricity companies can be concluded. Officials in the Department of Trade and Industry are expected to work over the weekend to resolve remaining issues through binding arbitration. Although considerable progress was made in negotiations in the last two days, some regional electricity companies are still saying they do not want to sign anything before the white paper is published. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has said the contracts must be signed before the white paper. A compromise is likely. But even if the problems over base tonnages can be resolved, talks with the generators for additional contracts are some way off conclusion. It is these negotiations which will determine how many of the 31 pits can remain open. The white paper will stress that the future of mines should be determined by the market. It is likely to offer the prospect of providing subsidies to keep open some of the threatened pits but will leave the detail of how many to the outcome of negotiations between British Coal and the generators. This is likely to take several months. Meanwhile, as a prelude to privatisation of the coal industry, the government will arrange for private mining companies to lease pits which are not wanted by British Coal. Leasing talks cannot begin before the white paper is published.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Fujitsu to sell supercomputers in US FUJITSU, Japan's largest computer manufacturer, announced yesterday it plans to sell its highest performance supercomputers in the US, a move the company expects to create a political backlash. 'We have seen some Japan bashing, and we will possibly now see some Fujitsu bashing,' said Mr Thomas Miller, vice-president of sales and marketing for Fujitsu America's supercomputer group. Fujitsu's entry into the US supercomputer market and efforts to expand sales in Europe, pose a challenge to Cray Research, the leading US supercomputer manufacturer and world market leader. Initially, Fujitsu will try to limit political criticism by focusing its marketing efforts on the US private sector. Japanese suppliers have been effectively excluded from the public sector under pressure from Congress and the Bush administration. Last November, Fujitsu was forced to withdraw an offer to donate a supercomputer to a Colorado-based international environmental research project. If Fujitsu is successful in the private sector it seems unlikely to ignore the US public sector for long. Publicly funded sales represent about two-thirds of the total US supercomputer market. The US is under increasing pressure to open its public supercomputer market to Japanese companies following an undertaking by the Japanese government to allow US companies to bid for public computer purchases in Japan. Fujitsu is also pre-empting charges that it will offer steep discounts in the US as a way to garner sales of the ten models it plans to sell there. 'Our US prices will range from Dollars 2m to Dollars 17m, and are based upon world-wide pricing at fair market values,' Mr Miller said.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Technology: Easing the tender nightmare - Worth Watching Going out to tender for large projects can prove a nightmare, with employees reduced to sifting through mountains of details once the bids are put in. To aid such companies Computer Management Group (CMG) is marketing a system developed by PowerGen which uses artificial intelligence to help pick the successful bidder. The Intelligent Contract Management System (ICMS) combines expert systems, where the software responds as an expert evaluator would, with neural networks, which 'learn' how to assess the bids as the system is used. The software analyses the data and produces a report on each bid, highlighting errors, where clarification is needed and so on. It can also recommend which bid to accept on the basis of the tender and previous work. CMG: UK, 071 233 0288.</p>

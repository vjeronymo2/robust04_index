			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 4 (AFP)--The cost of living in  China's 35 largest cities rose in February from an average of  25.9 percent the previous month to 39.3 percent, the State  Bureau of Statistics reported Monday [4 April].    The bureau, quoted by the Economic Daily [JINGJI RIBAO], did  not specify which city had the highest price increases, but  named 18 in which inflation registered between 26 percent and  39.3 percent.    All of the 18 cities named were in the eastern half of the  country, the majority of these in coastal areas with the notable  exceptions of Xian and Urumqi. Conversely, nearly all the  cities with inflation rates of less than 20 percent were in the  interior.    Taking January and February together, the rate of inflation  rose about 20 percent over the same period the previous year,  and 25 percent year-to-year in the big cities, the report said.    Major contributors to February's roaring inflation included  vegetables, grains, and seafood, which rose in price between 30  percent and 53 percent.    In another report Monday, the China Youth Daily [ZHONGGUO  QINGNIAN BAO] quoted the bureau as estimating March's urban  inflation rate at not less than 20 percent. These statistics  and predictions underline the difficult task facing the  government, which had promised to keep inflation below 10  percent for 1994.</p>

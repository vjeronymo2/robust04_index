			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong adds a further 4.2 per cent ACTIVE buying by life assurers and arbitrageurs bolstered trading as large capital issues firmed along with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which rose to its highest level in one month, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gained 91.61 to 20,174.42 after a low of 20,097.01 in the morning and a high of 20,338.83 during the afternoon. The average has lost 1 per cent on the week. Volume rose to 341.4m shares against 258m. Advances led declines by 615 to 368, with 182 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 8.80 to 1,654.01 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.85 to 1,285.35 . Telecommunications issues led the rise with NTT up Y32,000 to Y906,000 and KDD, the international telecom company, rising Y400 to Y13,100. DDI, a long distance telecom company listed on the second section, gained Y320,000 to a record Y6.78m. Video game makers, which were previously sold on expectations of lower profits, were sought by bargain hunters. Nintendo rose Y100 to Y8,120, Konami gained Y170 to Y4,020 and Namco Y110 to Y3,060. Retailers, which announced falls in profits earlier this week, lost ground. Daiei fell Y40 to Y1,390 and Seiyu lost Y30 to Y1,450. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 186.72 to 22,327.91 in volume of 23.6m shares. Roundup THE region maintained its record breaking ways yesterday. Bombay remained closed for the third day as brokers maintained their strike action in an attempt to force the government to resolve an impasse over stocks seized by the tax authorities in connection with an investigation into a securities scandal. HONG KONG continued on its roll with a wall of foreign and local money, and an absence of investors wanting to sell, propelling the market a further 4.2 per cent higher to a 10th consecutive record close. The Hang Seng index added 351.58 to 8,763.98, after a day's peak of 8,777.14, in turnover up to HKDollars 9.09bn from HKDollars 6.45bn. The market has risen 8.6 per cent over the week and 17.6 per cent since the rally began on September 28. Investors welcomed news that Britain was prepared to treat reforms for local elections next year and for legislative polls in 1995 separately in talks with China. This was viewed as a concession by Britain that could lead to a breakthrough in the talks. SINGAPORE was encouraged by funds coming into the market ahead of next month's listing of Singapore Telecom. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 35.00 to 2,112.95, its fifth consecutive gain, and a 4 per cent rise on the week. Singapore Telecom's listing on November 1 is expected to add between SDollars 30bn to SDollars 40bn to the market's capitalisation of some SDollars 140bn. KUALA LUMPUR's composite index saw another new closing high, up 8.43 at 927.46, but off an intraday record of 937.70, for a week's gain of 5 per cent. NEW ZEALAND turned back from a four-year intraday high, in line with a slowing of demand for Telecom, which has been driving the market. The NZSE-40 Capital index finished 12.33 ahead at 2,072.55, after a peak of 2,083.98, for a 2.8 per cent rise on the week. TAIWAN edged higher on late bargain-hunting after early losses triggered by news that parliament had rejected a motion to cut the stock transaction tax on Thursday. The composite index, which opened 33 points down, ended 10.4 higher at 4,025.27, 4.2 per cent higher on the week. MANILA saw foreign demand push prices higher for the fifth consecutive day, the market index rising 30.50 to a record 2,175.25, 9.7 per cent up on the week. AUSTRALIAN industrials led the market higher and the All Ordinaries index gained 12.1 to 2,074.1, for a 2.4 per cent rise on the week.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Bank chief holds firm line: Short-term rates to remain high until structural budget deficit is addressed SWEDEN'S short-term interest rates will remain high until the country's government and its parliament agree on a strategy to eradicate Sweden's structural budget deficit over the next two to three years. This was the message delivered yesterday by Mr Bengt Dennis, governor of the Riksbank, the country's central bank. Over the past two days, he said, there had been a 'satisfactory response in the markets' to the central bank's decision to lift its marginal interest rate to commercial banks to a towering 75 per cent. He added that there had been 'a substantial inflow of capital' as a result. Mr Dennis, aged 62 and celebrating his tenth year as governor this month, is also pleased at the unanimity among Swedish industrialists and politicians in support for the authorities' fixed exchange rate policy and repudiation of devaluation. 'We have learned from experience that devaluation was the wrong policy,' he said. He added that 'no restrictions' were being imposed on the central bank to use whatever means were necessary to defend the krona. Mr Dennis reaffirmed that Sweden still wanted to achieve associate status with the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System as soon as possible, within a 2.25 per cent band with access to support from other central banks and credit facilities. This would be in place before the country joins the European Community, which would be in 1995 at the earliest. But the governor is anxious for the government to come up with a medium-term plan to eliminate the structural deficit and satisfy the markets. 'The sooner we have such a policy the better,' he said, adding that at the moment, 'there is no programme, no timetable, nor has parliament agreed on any measures. This is what is troubling the markets'. There was 'a long way to go' before the politicians focused on the budget deficit problem. 'They have not got down to serious basics yet.' In the current fiscal year the total budget deficit is believed to have more than doubled, with some estimates suggesting it could be more than SKr160bn (Pounds 15.66bn) compared with SKr68bn in the last fiscal year. The central bank estimates that about half of that deficit is due to the downturn in the business cycle and would disappear in a revival of the economy, but the other half is structural. Any determined action to reduce the deficit will mean painful cuts in a wide range of government spending programmes which have made Sweden a model welfare state. Politicians of all parties have been reluctant to confront this problem because of the unpopular measures it would involve. Parliament is not due to return from its summer recess until October 6. 'This makes it difficult for the government to carry out a dialogue with the opposition parties in a meaningful way', Mr Dennis said. The markets wanted to see the details of a package of measures designed to eliminate the structural deficit. 'If the government and the Social Democrats could agree on the main elements of a fiscal policy, the markets would respond', he added.</p>

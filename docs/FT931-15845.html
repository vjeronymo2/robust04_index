			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / UN set to press Bonn on greater role for military MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general, today begins a two-day official visit to Bonn and will tell the German government that it cannot expect a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, or play a greater role in the organisation, until and unless it defines the role of its army outside Nato. The secretary-general will also outline plans to reform the UN in talks with President Richard von Weizsacker, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, and leaders of the main parliamentary parties. UN officials believe the outcome of the talks could help the country's main political parties reach a consensus on how the constitution could be amended to allow the Bundeswehr (German army) to become more involved in non-Nato operations outside Germany. Article 87 of the German constitution stipulates that the use of German troops must be limited to self-defence on its own territory, while article 24 allows Germans to fight alongside allies in joint security pacts, such as Nato. Since 1949 the federal government has consistently adopted the political position that the constitution does not allow the deployment of German forces outside the Nato area. The mood among some of the political parties is shifting towards constitutional amendments enabling German troops to participate in UN peace-keeping operations, and UN-backed humanitarian efforts. Any change in the constitution would require a two-thirds majority of the Bundestag, and support from the opposition Social Democratic party. So far there is little consensus among the governing coalition of Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union and Free Democrats, and the SDP on the Bundeswehr's role. The CDU/CSU want the Bundeswehr to be engaged in international operations even outside the auspices of the UN, when it is necessary for peace. The SPD wants the Bundeswehr to be linked directly to any UN Security Council resolution and limited to peace-keeping operations, although the SPD is considering involvement in the military protection of humanitarian aid convoys. The FDP wants any peace-enforcing missions by the Bundeswehr to be carried out under the auspices of the UN. 'We cannot express our intentions (of any future involvement in the UN) until we have come to grips with this constitutional problem,' a Foreign Ministry official said. 'We have to come to grips with this problem over the coming months otherwise we will face a credibility gap with the international community.' Germany, which is the third largest contributor to the UN, has already deployed 1,500 soldiers in Cambodia in the form of medical back-up and supplies, and has provided aircraft and pilots to help the Somalia relief operation.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / US growth at 5.9% in fourth quarter President Bill Clinton's hopes of fostering US economic renewal were boosted yesterday by official figures showing gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 5.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year - the fastest quarterly growth since 1987. Real GDP grew by 2.9 per cent during 1993 as a whole against 2.6 per cent in 1992, confirming the US economy is forging ahead while many trading partners remained mired in recession. 'You can't get much more solid and steady growth than that,' said Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, referring to the accelerating pace of recovery last year. The fourth-quarter surge reflected strong increases in business investment, residential housing and spending on durable consumer goods - sectors that have benefited from the sharp fall in long-term interest rates. GDP grew at annual rates of 1.9 and 2.9 per cent in the second and third quarters. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 19.13 at 3,945.43 a record. Bond prices also rose sharply despite the evidence of faster growth, because the GDP report indicated little upward pressure on inflation. The GDP fixed-weight deflator (the broadest measure of inflation) rose at an annual rate of 2.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, less than expected. Mr David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities in New York, said financial markets were beginning to realise that faster growth did not entail higher inflation. Administration officials are also increasingly confident about the prospects for non-inflationary growth. Output is expected to be artificially depressed early this year by arctic weather and the Los Angeles earthquake, but the underlying pace of growth is seen as at least 3 per cent. The composition of growth is more encouraging than at the end of 1992 when a similar surge in GDP proved short- lived. This time growth was led by business fixed investment, which grew at an annual rate of 21 per cent, easily outstripping consumer spending which expanded at an annual rate of 4 per cent. Companies were also careful to keep inventories lean, preventing an overhang of stocks that could have curbed growth this year. In addition to rapid growth and low inflation, the White House is taking credit for a sharp improvement in budgetary trends, highlighted by President Bill Clinton in his State of the Union address. The independent Congressional Budget Office predicted the deficit would fall to Dollars 223bn (Pounds 148.6bn) this fiscal year and Dollars 166bn by fiscal 1996, before rising later in the decade. Mr Bentsen has urged Federal Reserve governors and regional presidents, who meet next week to discuss monetary policy, to take the tighter fiscal stance into account when setting interest rates. Most Wall Street analysts, however, still expect the Fed to nudge short-term rates higher in the next few months as a sign of its determination to prevent economic recovery eventually leading to higher inflation.</p>

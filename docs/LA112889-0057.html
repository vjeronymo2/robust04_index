			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SEN. GLENN IN PASADENA TO REASSURE DOUBTERS  </P> <P> Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), grand marshal of the 1990 Pasadena Tournament of  Roses Parade, dropped by the Tournament House on Orange Grove Boulevard Monday  to "straighten out" any doubters who might have questioned his integrity, he  said.  </P> <P> Glenn and four other senators are being investigated by a special counsel of  the Senate Ethics Committee. They are accused of improperly intervening with  federal regulators on behalf of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan after  receiving political contributions from its owner, Charles H. Keating Jr.  </P> <P> The senators met twice in 1987 with regulators to question why Lincoln had been  audited for more than a year. On Monday, Glenn again denied any wrongdoing and  said he was merely trying to discover why the audit had taken so long. He  withdrew once he learned the savings and loan was to be investigated by the  Justice Department, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Rentokil tops poll of its peers Rentokil, the highly profitable business services group, has replaced pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo as Britain's most admired company, according to a survey today. Queens Moat Houses, the debt-ridden hotel group, was least admired, although Lonrho and Eurotunnel were only just ahead in the poll published by Management Today magazine in association with Loughborough University Business School. The survey covered the 10 biggest quoted companies by stock market capitalisation in each of 26 industrial sectors. The chairman, chief executive and five other directors from each of the businesses were asked to rate companies in their sector on a scale of one to 10 on the basis of nine criteria. These ranged from management quality, financial soundness and ability to recruit and retain top talent to innovation, community and environmental responsibility and use of corporate assets. Sector analysts at 10 leading investment companies were also asked for their opinions. Aside from Rentokil and Glaxo - the latter topped the previous survey in 1992 - Marks and Spencer, SmithKline Beecham, Unilever, Reuters and Shell were all well regarded and retained their places in the top 10. Among less familiar names Electrocomponents, the electronic and mechanical components distribution group, and Bowthorpe, the manufacturer of specialist electronics, were eighth and 10th respectively. Companies making the greatest strides from the 1992 survey included supermarket group Asda (up from 239th place to 198), Whitbread (161 to 25) and British Steel (189 to 54). Among the biggest losers were the exhibitions group Blenheim, which has been plagued by poor results, profit warnings and internal dissent (down from 80 to 256), pharmaceuticals group Wellcome (11 to 108) and Enterprise Oil, the unsuccessful bidder for Lasmo (79 to 222). Rentokil was considered best value as a long-term investment and the best user of corporate assets. GEC was regarded as the most financially sound, while Vodafone's management and British Airways' marketing were seen as the best quality. Glaxo was judged to have the best capacity to innovate. In the conglomerates category BTR beat Tomkins and Wassall into second and third place respectively. HSBC was top in banking, followed by Lloyds and Abbey National.

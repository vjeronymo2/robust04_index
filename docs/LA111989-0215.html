			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES;  </P> <P> MARCHERS PROTEST U.S. AID TO SALVADOR  </P> <P> Holding paper crosses bearing the names of six Jesuit priests murdered this  week in San Salvador, about 700 people marched Saturday to MacArthur Park for a  rally to protest the U.S. government's financial involvement in El Salvador's  escalating civil war.  </P> <P> The high turnout for the march was fueled by concern after a week of guerrilla  warfare in El Salvador culminated in the murders of the priests.  </P> <P> Organizers of the protest said the priests were killed by the army or  right-wing death squads at the behest of the Salvadoran government, a charge  the government has denied.  </P> <P> Father Mike Crotty of St. Vincent's Church, and the Right Rev. Frederick  Brosch, bishop of the Episcopalian diocese, were among the clergy at the rally.  </P></p>

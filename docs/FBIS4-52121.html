			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Monetary Authorities Do Not Want Rapid </F> Appreciation of the Yen"]    [Text] U.S. monetary authorities decided to intervene in  the foreign exchange market by buying dollars as the yen  exchange rate in the New York foreign exchange market reached  almost 100 yen to a dollar. Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd  Bentsen made an unusual statement to the effect that excessive  fluctuation is to be avoided, indicating a firm position to  guard against the depreciation of the dollar.    The market has now awakened from its illusion that the U.S.  authorities favor a policy of "inducing yen appreciation." It  is now time to listen to the U.S. message that it does not want  rapid appreciation of the yen.    The Federal Bank of New York started buying dollars to  intervene in the market because the dollar was depreciating not  only against the yen, but also against the German mark and other  European currencies. If nothing were done about the situation,  the dollar might depreciate rapidly. This would then stimulate  the market's apprehensions about inflation, leading in turn to a  triple drop in the value of the dollar, government bonds, and  stock prices. This might then dampen the ongoing economic  recovery in the United States.    Before going into dollar-buying and yen-selling, the Federal  Bank of New York had already engaged in dollar-buying and  mark-selling. Dollar-buying was undertaken not because the  Japanese Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan requested such  intervention, but rather because of domestic circumstances in  the United States. Actually, this was a dollar stabilization  policy aimed at avoiding any confusion in the U.S. market and  securing the U.S. economy on the track of recovery.    At the Tokyo foreign exchange market and other foreign  exchange markets all over the world, there had been persistent  speculations that the Clinton administration is bent on inducing  yen appreciation to correct the trade imbalance between Japan  and the United States. However, in a floating rate system,  without monetary policy coordination and powerful concerted  intervention, verbal intervention can only influence the market  temporarily.    If, as the market speculated, the U.S. monetary authorities'  strategy were to induce dollar depreciation and yen  appreciation, it would have to lower interest rates and engage  in dollar-selling. However, what the U.S. authorities did was  the exact opposite. Short-term interest rates were raised  thrice, and the monetary authorities also moved to buy dollars.  It is said that U.S. monetary officials are strongly critical  of economist Fred Bergsten's statement on inducing yen  appreciation.    The market is still expecting the yen to appreciate in the  future. The prevailing view is that Japan's huge current  accounts surplus will serve as pressure on the yen to increase  its value. However, there is a great gap between the economic  conditions in the United States and those in Japan and Germany.  As the United States implements a tight monetary policy,  Germany continues to adopt an easy monetary policy, and Japan  also maintains a basically easy monetary policy. There is also  an interest rate gap. From the economic fundamentals, there  should not be any substantial pressure for the yen to appreciate.    Furthermore, there are quite a number of political factors  that should encourage the selling of yen, such as the unstable  Japanese political situation, and the explosive situation on the  Korean peninsula. There is speculation in the market that the  political instability will make Japan unable to bring about a  breakthrough in its frictions with the United States. However,  the U.S. Government has decided to postpone sanctions against  Japan in such areas as government procurement in consideration  of the Japanese political situation. It is even more unlikely  that the United States will choose to apply pressure to  appreciate the yen in order to place the Hata administration in  an extremely difficult position.    The exchange rate is decided by the market. In that sense,  the market should reflect accurate information. This time, the  market will probably get the message of the U.S. monetary  authorities. Needless to say, regardless of whether the Hata  administration will be a stable government or not, timely  measures should be taken to expand domestic demand and relax  government regulations in order to reduce the current accounts  surplus, which is a root cause of the volatility of the foreign  exchange market.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> 24 YEARS LATER, TARTARS AVENGE BIGGEST LOSS -- TOPPLE SERVITE, 59-52  </P> <P> It took 24 years, but Torrance High finally avenged the biggest basketball loss  in school history Wednesday night in the first round of the Southern Section  4-AA Division playoffs.  </P> <P> Torrance played host to Servite of Anaheim, which dealt the Tartars a 62-60  loss in the 1965 2-A championship game at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> There was a different ending this time as Torrance parlayed an aggressive  defensive effort and big fourth quarter into a 59-52 victory.  </P> <P> The Tartars (15-10), third-place finishers in the Bay League, advance to the  second round of the playoffs Friday night at Freeway League co-champion Sunny  Hills of Fullerton (17-8), which had a first-round bye.  </P> <P> Torrance overcame a sluggish performance by opening the fourth quarter with a  10-0 run to take the lead for good at 48-42. Servite, dogged by the Tartars'  full-court pressure, did not score until 4:05 had elapsed in the period.  </P> <P> "We tried to press a little bit more in the second half," said Torrance Coach  Carl Strong, who celebrated his first playoff victory in four years. "We tried  to use the press to get something going, to start a heartbeat."  </P> <P> Servite (12-11), which tied for third in the Angelus League, was hurt by  turnovers (22) and poor free-throw shooting (6 for 18). Torrance made 20 of 30  foul shots, including 10 of 15 in the decisive fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "I think we were fortunate tonight," Strong said. "Free throws won the game.  They missed theirs and we made ours."  </P> <P> The Tartars needed defense and free throws on a night that their top scorer,  junior guard Rick Robison, suffered through his third straight poor shooting  game. Robison led all scorers with 26 points but made only 6 of 20 shots. He  was better at the foul line, converting 11 of 13.  </P> <P> Center Art Terrill added 13 points and 7 rebounds for Torrance and point guard  Ray Wang passed off for 10 assists.  </P> <P> Forward Steve Marusich led Servite with 18 points but was held in check after  scoring 10 in the first quarter. Strong made a defensive switch in the second  quarter, putting forward Toby Wollard on Marusich. That, along with foul  trouble, kept Servite's top player quiet the rest of the way.  </P> <P> Servite point guard Chris Johnson, who spent last fall handing off to  All-American running back Derek Brown as the Friars' quarterback, helped his  team take a 42-38 lead in the third quarter by scoring 11 of his 15 points.  </P> <P> But Torrance took control by scoring 10 unanswered points to open the fourth  quarter. Forward Matt Cummins capped the streak by stealing the ball from  Johnson and hitting a layup.  </P> <P> From there, the Tartars kept Servite at a distance by hitting 6 of 11 free  throws in the final three minutes.  </P> <P> St. Bernard 91, Long Beach Wilson 70 -- The home-team Vikings exploded for a  24-11 fourth quarter to pull away from a close game. Center Ed Stokes led four  Vikings in double figures with 29 points, 18 rebounds and 9 blocked shots and  had several powerful rebound dunks in the second half when St. Bernard took  control. Forward Terrell Steen had 9 points in the second half and finished  with 15 points and 12 rebounds. Forward Juno Armstrong scored 10 points in the  second half and 13 overall. Guard Marc Raveling added 21 points, and point  guard Sean Patikas had 9 points and 14 assists as St. Bernard improved to 23-5.  Sheldon Grigsby kept Wilson (15-13) close with 21 points, including five  3-pointers.  </P> <P> St. Bernard Coach Jim McClune noted of his dominating 6-11 center, "Edward  (Stokes) seems to be playing meaner now. It's happening at the right time."  </P> <P> Bishop Amat 75, West Torrance 51 -- In a 4-A Division game at La Puente,  visiting West High stayed close for a half but Amat pulled away for an easy  victory behind star Jason Green. West, an at-large playoff selection, finishes  at 12-13. Amat improved to 15-9.  </P> <P> Morningside 55, San Marino 50 -- The Monarchs, the fourth seed in the 3-A  Division, built a 15-point lead in the third quarter, then held off a late San  Marino charge at Morningside. The visitors hit six 3-pointers in the fourth  quarter to make it close. Morningside (21-4) had three players in double  figures: Eddie Scott with 14, Chris Vance with 13 and Jeff Crowe with 10. The  Monarchs led, 29-18, at the half and expanded the lead in the third quarter,  then pulled in the defense and almost paid for it. San Marino finished at  14-10.  </P> <P> Bell-Jeff 73, Miraleste 53 -- In a 2-AA Division opener at Bellarmine-Jefferson  in Burbank, free-lance selection Miraleste took an early 11-10 lead, but  Bell-Jeff switched to a full-court press that forced 14 turnovers in the second  quarter and the host team took a 30-20 halftime lead. Bell-Jeff forced 32  turnovers and pulled away in the second half behind center Nick Sanderson's 22  points. He finished with 30. Scott Klein and David Terrell led the Marauders,  who finish at 15-6, with 14 points apiece. Bell-Jeff is 20-4.  </P> <P> Montclair Prep 62, Chadwick 53 -- In a 1-A Division opener at Montclair,  Chadwick pulled to within 1 point in the fourth quarter but fell short.  Montclair (18-9) led, 28-19, at the half and built a 12-point lead in the third  quarter, but Chadwick came back behind the shooting of Gary Calissi, who hit  three 3-pointers on the way to 15 points. Dolphin center Larry Williams was in  foul trouble much of the game and finished with only 8 points and 8 rebounds.  The Dolphins finish the season at 8-16.  </P> <P> Redondo 74, California 68 -- In another 4-A Division playoff at Cal High in  Whittier, Redondo got two late 3-pointers from Ian Martin to wipe out a 60-57  deficit and outscore the home team, 14-8, in the last three minutes. The Sea  Hawks hit 25 of 35 free throws, which proved decisive. Martin scored 10 points  in the fourth quarter and 20 in the game as Redondo improved to 18-8. The Sea  Hawks' David Dinnel led all scorers with 28 points, 15 in the first quarter.  Redondo will play host to second-seeded St. Paul on Friday. Cal High finished  at 16-8.  </P> <P> Mary Star 86, Brentwood 77 -- In a 1-A Division game at Brentwood, at-large  selection Mary Star improved to 17-7 in knocking off the Delphic League champ.  The Stars took control with a 21-9 third quarter. Five Star players scored in  double figures led by George Pisano's 23 and Rich Negrete's 21, including three  3-pointers. Brentwood bows out at 14-9.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills 87, Lompoc 66 -- Senior center John Hardy scored a career-high 44  points on 18-for-27 shooting to lead the top-seeded Titans to a first-round win  in the 3-A playoffs at Rolling Hills.  </P> <P> With Lompoc pressuring the Titans' outside shooters, Rolling Hills worked the  ball inside to Hardy with success. They made only four 3-point shots and didn't  put the game away until late in the third quarter.  </P> <P> "We didn't play very well," said Rolling Hills Coach Cliff Warren. "But we got  the ball into John."  </P> <P> The Titans (23-4) will play Bellflower (17-9), a 92-90 winner over Blair, in  the second round Friday night. A coin flip will determine the home team.  </P> <P> In an all-around performance, point guard Mark Tesar had 11 points, 8 rebounds  and 7 assists for Rolling Hills.  </P> <P> Millikan 84, Leuzinger 68 -- Ibn Maddred scored 8 of his 19 points in the third  quarter to help break open a close game and spark the Rams (21-6) to a 5-AA  Division playoff win at Millikan. Guard Cliff Ramer led Leuzinger (15-12) with  25 points.  </P></p>

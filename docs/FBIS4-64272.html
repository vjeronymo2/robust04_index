			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["u-r"-signed report: "Bayer Chemicals Company at Turning </F> Point"]    [Text] Cologne -- The Bayer group, Leverkusen, will achieve  a significantly better result in 1994, thus ending its downward  trend. At the group's general assembly in Cologne, Board  Director Manfred Schneider announced that both domestic and  foreign capacities will be increased. The group's turnover in  the first quarter of 1994 went up by 6.3 percent, to 11 billion  German marks [DM], with positive impulses mainly coming from  foreign trade. The group's operating results improved by 18  percent, to DM755 million. This favorable development mainly  resulted from rationalizations that involved a reduction in  staff by 4,500, to 150,300 over a period of 12 months,  concluding at the end of March.    Two groups of shareholders holding different opinions  confronted each other in the debate. While the first group  praised the board for Bayer once more for being "top of the  class in the chemicals industry," the other group was mainly  critical. In no fewer than 47 countermotions, the Bayer  management was accused of numerous failures. One of the  criticisms was that the wages Bayer pays in the Third World do  not meet FRG standards.    Schneider addressed the negative effects of the health  structure act. These effects will be "counteracted" by  reorganizing sales and including generic products in the group's  range. The purchase of a parcel of shares (28.3 percent) of the  U.S. company Schein Pharmaceuticals at $312 million is only a  first step. The majority could be purchased over the next seven  years.    On the reduction in the number of Bayer shareholders to just  under 300,000, Schneider said that a large part of Bayer shares  is now probably managed by funds. Good results and appropriate  dividends are the best way to increase the attractiveness of  Bayer shares even further. At the general assembly, 48.8  percent of the DM3.4 billion in capital were represented. All  items on the agenda were adopted with a vast majority.</p>

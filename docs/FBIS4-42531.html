			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Monica Bjorklund: "Dahl Fobs Off Liberal Party"] </F>   [Text] Uppsala -- "With the policies the Liberal Party  represents today I cannot imagine that the Social Democrats and  Liberal Party will cooperate after the election."    This is what Birgitta Dahl, the Social Democratic Party  [SDP]  spokesperson on issues of social welfare, stated when SVENSKA  DAGBLADET spoke with her on May Day. She had just taken Liberal  leader Bengt Westerberg to task from the speaker's podium.    Previously, Social Democratic chairman Ingvar Carlsson and  party secretary Mona Sahlin had repeatedly invited the Liberal  Party to share the government after the election.  <H5>  Greater Responsibility </H5>   "It is not an invitation without demands," explains Birgitta  Dahl, without wanting to go into what is required from the  Liberal Party in order to be accepted as a governing partner.    From speaker's podiums in Enkoping and Uppsala, in the warm  sun but icy wind, she criticized the nonsocialist government in  general and the Liberal leader in particular.    ``As deputy prime minister and social minister he has a  greater responsibility than most people for the social  disarmament and the growing chasms in our country.    ``The policy that Bengt Westerberg is actively participating  in is creating a segregation that is more merciless than the  injustices of old times.''  <H5>  "Westerberg Is a Hypocrite" </H5>   The Liberal leader himself on Friday [29 April] accused the  Social Democrats of wanting to turn back the politics 20-30  years in time. On the Liberal Party's election posters the  Social Democrats are likened to a prehistoric lizard. And,  according to Bengt Westerberg, it is the Social Democrats who  have caused the segregation in society with the large, sterile  housing areas of the their million-kronor program.    Birgitta Dahl tells SVENSKA DAGBLADET that Bengt Westerberg  is a hypocrite and espouses a double moral. And the fact is that  she is tougher in her criticism of the Liberal Party leader than  of the leader of the Conservative Party.    "Carl Bildt, at least, says straight out what he wants. The  Liberal, Center, and Christian Democratic parties say one thing  -- pretending to be finer and nobler than others -- but do  something entirely different. I think that is worse," says  Birgitta Dahl from the podium.  <H5>  Difficult Task </H5>   She also warns that a difficult task awaits after an  election  victory.    "We cannot promise quick results. Even less can we promise  material improvements -- restoration -- to anyone who is healthy  and has a job."    On the other hand, she promises that the Social Democrats  will tackle unemployment and, above all, youth unemployment. And  there will be fairer taxes, with "proper taxation of capital  gains from stocks," a special 5-percent defense tax for  high-income earners and the possibility of raising the municipal  tax for municipalities that need to.    She delivered two other clear messages: The child care  subsidy will be eliminated immediately. No form of maid service  deduction will be introduced by a Social Democratic government.</p>

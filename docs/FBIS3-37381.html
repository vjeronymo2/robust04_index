			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Russian Defense Ministry Press and Information Directorate </F> report: "Chief of the General Staff Has Not Handed In His  Resignation"]    [Text] Yesterday's announcement by a number of mass media  that Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian  Armed Forces General Staff, has allegedly written out his  resignation and sent it to the Russian president does not accord  with reality.    Here is what Mikhail Kolesnikov himself said about the  report  of his resignation:    "This is another fabrication. The purpose of such articles,  in my view, is to sow mutual enmity, force a split within the  leadership of the Defense Ministry, and thus weaken one of the  most stable of state institutions -- the Russian Armed Forces.  These articles personally do no more than disgust me. This is  all the more unpleasant since we have established good  businesslike relations with many mass media.    "I would like to appeal to mass media leaders and  journalists. We are open, we are always ready for frank,  constructive discussion. We do not make a secret of our plans  or the state of the Armed Forces, we do not make a secret of our  work. Journalists are frequent visitors to us. Not a single  function of public importance takes place at the Defense  Ministry or the General Staff without representatives of the  mass media being involved. So those people who are really  interested in obtaining reliable information about the Armed  Forces have every opportunity to do so."</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANDOR AT ANY COST  </P> <P> Seconds before the City Council voted Tuesday not to hold a public debate on  the conflicts of interest created by Mayor Tom Bradley's private business  dealings, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky leaned over and quipped to his colleague  Nate Holden that what "the city needs now is a little glasnost."  </P> <P> Holden, of course, is one of Bradley's opponents in next Tuesday's mayoral  election. Yaroslavsky himself withdrew from the race only after he decided the  mayor could not be beaten. Nevertheless, while the comment was flippant, it  also was apt. Openness, which is what glasnost means, is the only thing that  can redeem this unseemly incident.  </P> <P> As they have unfolded so far, the facts of the case are as straightforward as  they are disturbing: For more than a decade, Bradley has received $24,000 per  year for serving as a director of Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan. Two of  that thrift's subsidiaries have received city approval for zoning changes on  properties they own, and the parent firm is involved in a $2.7-million tax  dispute with the city.  </P> <P> When asked whether his employment with a private financial institution  conflicted with his obligations as mayor, Bradley replied, "I am a very unusual  person and I don't want you comparing me with somebody else in some other city  in some other circumstance. I bring something to this equation that you won't  find the run-of-the-mill elected official being able to bring to the table."  </P> <P> Last month, the mayor announced he was returning $18,000 in fees he had  received for serving as a foreign trade adviser to Far East Bank, where some  city funds are on deposit. Bradley now says he returned the money after he  learned Far East does business with the city. However, his decision coincided  with a newspaper investigation into his ties with the bank.  </P> <P> At one point while he was in the bank's employ, Bradley -- after receiving a  call from Far East's president -- telephoned the city treasurer and discussed  Los Angeles' policy on bank deposits. Following that conversation, the city  doubled the amount of its deposit with Far East to $2 million.  </P> <P> The mayor insists "there was no impropriety" in those calls, just as he defends  his employment with Valley Federal. But the conflict between Bradley's private  relationship with these financial institutions and his public responsibilities  as mayor is so clear that his assertions to the contrary are simply  insupportable.  </P> <P> Nor should this matter be treated like an ordinary campaign issue, which is  what Bradley's supporters on the council did when they voted not to discuss the  question in public. What is at issue here is the mayor's conduct and not what  his political opponents may make of it.  </P> <P> The mayor's business activities already are the object of an investigation by  City Atty. James K. Hahn. Holden's motions have been referred to the Council's  Governmental Operations Committee. The result of both inquiries ought to be not  only a full airing of Bradley's dubious moonlighting, but also reform of the  city's fragmentary and inadequate regulations on the disclosure of public  officials' private business activities.  </P></p>

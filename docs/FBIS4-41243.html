			<p>BFN     [Text] Comrat, BASAPRESS, 18/6/1994 -- "We have made too  many concessions regarding the "Gagauz-Eri" special juridical  status to the Chisinau officials and we decided not to accept  any more compromises," told BASA Maria Marunevich, from the  Gagauz Parliamentary Presidium. "We will insist that President  Snegur and Speaker Lucinschi sign the last variant of the  project agreed upon in the last meeting between Moldovan top  leadership, president Topal, and Gagauz Speaker Kendigelyan and  that this project be examined by parliamentary factions and  adopted by the Moldovan Parliament," added Marunevich.  Referring to Suleyman Demirel's recent visit to Comrat, she  expressed concern that "several statements were made recently  that contradict the Gagauzians' wish for self-determination."  The newspaper HABERLAR stated on this issue that "certain  internal divergences between Comrat and Ciadir-Lunga could not  be concealed from the eyes of the guests. The Turkish guests  felt that some speakers avoided the usage of terms `Gagauz  Republic' and `Gagaouzia'; they preferred to use such terms as  `our region,' `the districts densely inhabited by Gagauzians' or  merely `the Ciadar-Lunga district.' This happened despite the  fact that Suleyman Demirel himself repeatedly said that he did  not come to a certain district, but to Gagauz peoples, to  Gagauzia." According to Marunevich, "the Gagauz-press agency  called this an event that politically damaged Gagauzia's  position as Demirel's visit had utterly different motives."</p>

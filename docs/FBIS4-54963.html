			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas by </F> Maria Graczyk; place and date not given: "Destination: West"]    [Text] [Graczyk] The signing of a treaty between Poland  and Lithuania on friendly relations and good neighborly  cooperation, is just the first step on the road to agreement.    [Brazauskas] More steps will follow shortly. Order must be  finally instated at the border between our two countries -- we  are striving not only at reviving contacts among people, but  also at facilitating the flow of merchandise. This has an  enormous significance for bilateral trade and transit from the  Scandinavian countries, Russia, and the Far East, to Poland and  to the West. This could become a major source of revenue for  both our countries.    I also appreciate the significance of cultural ties and of  ordinary human interactions, I mean in particular Poles living  in Lithuania and Lithuanians living in Poland. So far, there  has been a great deal of talk about this but right now -- after  the signing of the treaty -- various organizations and  associations will have the opportunity to spread their wings.  They will be able to solve problems concerning national  minorities that have not been settled yet or to which we have  not paid enough attention. The treaty creates many  opportunities, and it is up to us whether we will avail  ourselves of these opportunities and to what extent we will  improve our mutual relations which are burdened with historical  legacies. Let us not forget that we are neighbors. That creates  a commitment.    [Graczyk] But both sides continue to be very distrustful of  each other and old prejudices often emerge in various  discussions.    [Brazauskas] We have been meeting various Lithuanian  citizens so I can say we do not value enough those contacts that  are already in place. While talking to Poles living in  Lithuania, I have never noticed that they have any political  problems. Sure, they have economic problems, like all of us.  Contrary to popular views, Poles and Lithuanians live alongside  each other in peace in this country and there is no hostility  between them.    [Graczyk] But your optimism is not shared by many  politicians on both sides of the border.    [Brazauskas] Well, unfortunately some of those politicians  incite and demonize problems which would not require this much  attention under normal conditions. But I have faith that  President Lech Walesa's historical visit to Lithuania will  establish a long-awaited foundation for calming down moods and  leaving complaints behind, both in Lithuania and in Poland. For  some time to come, we have to take into account the noisy  presence of "great patriots" who demand the impossible.    [Graczyk] Against this backdrop, do you not fear problems  with ratifying the treaty in the Lithuanian parliament?    [Brazauskas] The most difficult stage is already behind us.  There should be no problem with pushing the treaty through the  Seimas [parliament], especially given that two-fifths of the  votes will suffice for that purpose. I am sure we will manage  to gain this many votes. Demonstrations and protests cannot  change anything in that regard. After all, this is also about  our security.    [Graczyk] The "Partnership for Peace" proposal has recently  brought back the idea of a so-called Baltic Sea-Black Sea  community.    [Brazauskas] It is just one of many ideas, nothing else. I  am not an enthusiast of such alliances, especially military  ones. My view is that we should have a uniform system of  security for our countries. But economic alliances are a  different story -- Baltic states already cooperate with one  another very closely in many areas. So I think President Walesa  will like the idea of developing cooperation between our three  countries and the Visegrad group. I do not hide that we would  be very interested in this kind of direction of development of  our cooperation. After all, ever since we regained  independence, we have been clearly saying: Destination -- West.    [Graczyk] During a recent meeting of the three Baltic  states' presidents in Palanga, it was said, among others, that  the Polish-Lithuanian treaty should become the first step on  this road.    [Brazauskas] We agreed at the meeting that we will strive at  making contacts with the Visegrad Group closer. It is an area  of cooperation which suits us very much. I submitted exactly  this proposal to President Walesa and I think that we will  debate it further in Poland shortly.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Hosokawa on an agreement on </F> political reform bills with Liberal Democratic Party President  Kono at a joint news conference at the Diet building in Tokyo --  live]    [Text] The pen is not mine, but as for the contents of the  document, I have made considerable concessions to the  LDP-proposed compromise plan. Today, as Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP] President Kono said a moment ago, he and I  intermittently held meetings which lasted over six hours with  some intervals wherein we had time to study each other's  proposal. As far as the details of our agreement are concerned,  these are specified in the documents which are being handed out  to you. As President Kono mentioned, we were summoned by House  of Representatives Speaker Doi before 1900 this evening --  yesterday. Speaker Doi presented her proposal to us. With her  proposal as the basis, President Kono and I started the  meetings. I believe that Speaker Doi's proposal served as a  catalyst or a remarkable start for producing such fruitful  results. Although the speaker's proposal was not reflected  satisfactorily in the agreement, we, with the speaker's proposal  in mind, have agreed on each point specified in the documents  handed out to you.    In conducting the meetings, President Kono and I discussed  the political situation facing Japan. We have shared the common  understanding that unless the political reform issue -- which  has been discussed for over six years and which the people  expected to be solved -- is brought to an end, it would be  impossible to solve economic issues and regain the people's  trust of politics, thus further undermining the international  community's confidence in Japan. Given such a situation, we  have shared a mutual understanding that it is necessary to take  a broad view of the political reform issue to settle it. Based  on such an understanding, we have had frank talks. As a result,  overcoming our own difficulties, I, as the representative of the  ruling parties, and President Kono, as the representative of his  party -- as I have just said, we have reached the agreement from  a standpoint of securing the national interest.    Since tomorrow is the final day of the current Diet session,  I cannot make any comments now on specifically how plenary  sessions will be conducted or the joint committee of both houses  will be held, as that will be up to the Diet itself. However, I  cannot find the words to describe how happy I feel that the  political reform bills have come to be settled in this way.  Regarding issues which are pending at a time like this, such as  economic problems and the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, I  would like to have Mr. Kono spend some time with me as soon as  early next week to hold frank discussions. This is how I feel  right now. I will respond to other issues in the  question-and-answer session.</p>

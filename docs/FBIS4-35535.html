			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Fatah Leadership Has Not </F> Issued Decision To Withdraw Palestinians' Arms"]    [Excerpts] Damascus -- Fatah Central Committee member  'Abbas Zaki has stressed that he has obtained assurances from  leaders of the Palestinian forces opposed to the Oslo accord to  prevent "Palestinian infighting." He said that he had urged  them to "coordinate among themselves on fundamental issues like  settlements, Jerusalem, and the refugees' return." [passage  omitted]    'Abbas Zaki denied that Fatah has issued a decision to  withdraw arms from the Palestinians, "especially as there are  armed Israelis outside the police and the Army.... When there  is incomplete sovereignty over Gaza and Jericho and a partner  participating in ruling these areas, it is extremely difficult  to apply the decision to Jericho or Gaza, or to the Palestinians  and not the settlers." However, he pointed out that there is a  big differences between a decision issued by Fatah and "a  process conducted here or there and which we tackle in time....  We might withdraw arms from those who err, but to eliminate  arms completely without any guarantees and while there are armed  people outside the Israeli police -- that would be an unjust  decision. And we cannot take such a decision." He added: "The  time has not yet come to withdraw the arms. We will withdraw  them when we take direct responsibility for the area without  anyone's participation." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / SEC says Japanese firms broke law THE Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities market watchdog, yesterday charged four Japanese securities firms with breaking securities laws. Three of the firms - Daiwa, Nomura and Yamaichi - have reached settlements with the SEC over the allegations, which relate principally to book-keeping, and have agreed to retain independent consultants to review their internal policies and procedures. The case against Nikko Securities is continuing. Separately, Daiwa reached a settlement with the SEC over its role in the Salomon Brothers bond auction 'scandal' - in which the Wall Street investment bank was accused of rigging Treasury bond auctions between 1989 and 1991. A complaint filed by the SEC against Salomon last year described how a dealer at another firm (known to be Daiwa) handed over to Salomon Dollars 3bn in Treasury bills which he had secretly bought at the request of the US firm's chief bond trader. Daiwa was subsequently investigated by the SEC for its auction-related conduct, and discussed a possible settlement with the US regulators last year. However, as a result of yesterday's deal - which involves a profits payback to the SEC - the Treasury is temporarily restricting Daiwa's bidding in government auctions. Daiwa will only be permitted to make purchases for its own account for a three-month period. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it,too, was taking action, suspending trading activity with Daiwa for a month from March 1. The allegations of securities law violations against the four firms stem from revelations two years ago that their parent companies had compensated favoured customers for trading losses. These disclosures, in Japan, prompted the SEC to investigate US subsidiaries, discovering instead other alleged breaches of the law. In Yamaichi's case, for example, the SEC claims that the firm improperly repurchased from a 'favoured client' certain securities at a price which exceeded their actual value. Daiwa is alleged to have improperly recorded monies received from a client. The firms are each paying a Dollars 200,000 fine and will review internal procedures. In the continuing Nikko case, the SEC alleges that the firm, 'acting through its most senior officials, deliberately concealed' more than Dollars 18m in foreign exchange-related trading losses. Yesterday, Nikko said that it was contesting the action because the SEC was demanding unduly heavy penalties.</p>

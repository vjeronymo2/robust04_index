			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIAL SAYS LEAST SAFE THING ABOUT MALATHION IS THE COPTER SPRAYING IT  </P> <P> State Health Director Kenneth W. Kizer, trying to quiet fears in Southern  California neighborhoods sprayed with malathion, said Tuesday that the risk of  a helicopter crash is greater than any hazard from the pesticide.  </P> <P> Kizer said studies have shown repeatedly that the chemical being sprayed from  the air to halt a Mediterranean fruit fly infestation does not pose a human  health hazard.  </P> <P> "It is not viewed as having significant untoward health effects at the dose  that is being used currently," Kizer said. "The greatest acute health hazard  that might be related to the spraying program is the risk of a helicopter crash  that might occur -- and not the chemical that is being used."  </P> <P> In a separate effort to allay public concerns, Food and Agriculture Director  Henry Voss promised to release the names of 16 heretofore-secret ingredients  that make up 5% of the malathion potion used by the state. By late afternoon,  however, the list had not been made public. These chemicals are in addition to  the corn syrup bait used in the spraying program to attract the insects and had  not been previously disclosed because they are trade secrets.  </P> <P> The comments from Voss and Kizer came at an unusual forum called to answer  questions from legislators whose constituents have grown increasingly upset  over the aerial spraying.  </P> <P> Democratic Assemblyman Richard Katz, whose home in Sylmar was sprayed Monday  night, protested that residents are not given adequate notice of the spraying  schedule and that a hot line to keep residents informed is usually busy.  </P> <P> And Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) questioned whether aerial  spraying is needed in his district and whether the state could instead use  sterile fruit flies.  </P> <P> Isi Siddiqui, assistant director of the Department of Food and Agriculture,  said the department would prefer using sterile fruit flies after the first  bombardment with malathion. But the Southern California infestation has become  so large that the state cannot produce enough sterile insects for the entire  area.  </P> <P> At the moment, he said, a laboratory in Hawaii is producing 100 million sterile  fruit flies each week that are being released in parts of Los Angeles and at a  separate infestation in Santa Cruz County. Shipments of up to 40 million more  insects have arrived from Mexico.  </P> <P> But until another lab is completed in Hawaii this spring, there will not be  enough flies for all of the infested regions, he said.  </P> <P> In a later interview, Siddiqui said a 36-mile spray area around Garden Grove  and Westminster in Orange County would be "an excellent candidate" for  replacing spraying with sterile Medflies once the new flies are ready. Just two  fertile flies have been found in that area -- and none in more than a month.  </P> <P> Siddiqui said he expects that the state can double its supply of sterile flies  by "early May" and then quickly eliminate spraying for certain areas. Officials  had previously said they planned to spray all the current Southland zones up to  a dozen times, probably through June or July.  </P> <P> Kizer said: "Public anxiety . . . is being fueled by some inaccurate reports  that sometimes border on being inflammatory in the public media. It is not  viewed as a carcinogen or a teratogen -- something that causes birth defects.  The issue has been looked at and relooked at and relooked at. My staff feel  very comfortable with regard to the safety of the product."  </P></p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's The modest queue of corporate financiers forming outside Lloyd's must be heartening for the management of the stricken insurance market. Whether investors will be tempted to put money into Finsbury's trust or any of the other investment vehicles waiting in the wings remains an open question. Since the terms on which corporate capital might be admitted will not be decided by Lloyd's council until next month - and not put to the vote until October 20 - there can be no sure answer. For corporate capital to stand a chance of participating in the 1994 underwriting year, the bankers will have to move fast thereafter. Finsbury has opted for an investment trust; Sedgwick and BZW are working on a quoted investment company. US investment banks will doubtless have their own novel ideas. All will stand or fall, though, on their ability to pick winners among underwriting syndicates.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / World Trade News: US-Soviet launch venture - Correction An article published on March 18 ('US-Russian space venture in key deals') stated that Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energia International (LKEI), a US-Russian venture to launch satellites using Russian Proton rockets, had secured contracts to launch up to five satellites for Societe Europeene des Satellites (SES), the operator of the pan-European Astra satellite system. Although LKEI has reconfirmed it has an agreement to provide launch services for SES, a final decision on the launch provider for Astra 1F will, according to SES, not be made before the end of 1994. The US-Russian venture has pointed out that final agreements have yet to be reached on specific launches. SES said that it has not signed a contract for the launch of five satellites on board Proton launch vehicles. However, SES is 'considering launching the Astra 1F satellite on a Proton launch vehicle,' said Mr Yves Feltes, a spokesman for SES, 'and is proceeding with technical activities necessary to make such a launch feasible.' SES was incorrectly identified in our report as the operator of the DirecTV satellite broadcast system, which is about to be introduced in the US by Hughes. We regret this error.</p>

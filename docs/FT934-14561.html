			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities recover from early weakness THE LONDON stock market rallied from early losses to close firmly yesterday as traders decided that an unexpectedly large fall in unemployment last month did not change the City of London's perceptions of the short-term outlook. Although the unemployment figures indicated stronger economic recovery than suggested by the fall in manufacturing output announced on Wednesday, analysts remained convinced that UK base rates will be cut soon, probably at Budget time in November. In early dealings, the stock market appeared confused as it measured the implications of this week's batch of economic data. Shares gained ground at first, reflecting the view that Wednesday's news on manufacturing output and domestic inflation had strengthened the chances for a rate cut and reduced the likelihood of tax increases in November. But the announcement that unemployment had fallen by 13,600 in September confused these expectations and the stock market fell sharply as bond prices turned downwards. At worst, the FT-SE Index was more than 13 points off at 3,067.5, although trading volume was fairly modest. The London market soon steadied, but the recovery which pushed the Footsie into plus territory was triggered by strength in the US bond market and on Wall Street, which gained 12 Dow points in UK hours, in response to US producer price statistics. Increased volume in equities as the market moved higher appeared to indicate underlying confidence among leading institutional investors. The final reading of 3,086.3 on the FT-SE Index showed a net rise of 5.4 on the session. Seaq volume of 618.2m shares compared with 659.2m on Wednesday when retail business was worth a healthy Pounds 1.5bn. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index slid 3.9 to 3,464.4, with non-Footsie trading making up around 61 per cent of the total. 'This week's economic data have added little to the argument over prospects for a base rate cut,' was the view of one leading house, which held to its prediction of a one per cent cut in base rates, probably around the time of the Budget which will probably bring around Pounds 5bn to Pounds 6bn in higher taxes, spread over the next three years. With domestic factors now on hold until the Budget, the London stock market has moved more closely in tandem with other European bourses this week. UK strategists remain convinced that, despite the unwillingness of the Bank of France, interest rates will be cut in Europe very soon, thus opening the way for the cut in UK base rates which the market seeks. The outstanding feature of the market yesterday was the alert prompted among telecommunication stocks by the Dollars 22bn bid from Bell Atlantic of the US for Tele-Communications Inc, which opened up the range of opportunities for global inter-active entertainment and information networks. Stores and similar retail stocks moved narrowly around overnight levels as confidence in base rate prospects was recovered. Banks, which are also prime beneficiaries of rate cuts, were mostly a shade firmer. The final picture in the marketplace appeared optimistic, with traders noting that buyers had again appeared when share prices weakened.</p>

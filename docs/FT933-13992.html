			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Technology: Fish food wins a new lease of life - Worth Watching Few spin-offs from the Russian space programme have proven as bizarre as the case of the long-life fish food. A way of preserving food during the long trips into space is now being used in the former Soviet Union to preserve worms and larvae as fish bait or as a food for aquarium fish. The wriggly creatures are sealed into sachets containing a fluid, details of which remain secret. Here they can live for up to six weeks, long enough for them to be imported into the UK by Barraclough's Fish and Aquarium Supplies, of Bradford. Barraclough: UK, 0274 576241.</p>

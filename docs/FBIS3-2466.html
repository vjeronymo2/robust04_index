Some regions in recent  years did try to carry out partial reforms of the public-funded  and labor insurance medical systems, with the aim of controlling  rising medical expenses within a reasonable limit and of better  and effectively utilizing the limited public health resources  under the premise of ensuring basic medical care for staff  members and workers.    Reform has already begun, and its direction has been  determined. Only by accelerating the pace to reform the current  medical care system, by establishing diverse forms and different  levels of the medical care system which is adapted to China's  actual conditions, and by gradually increasing the percentage of  people covered under the medical insurance, will it be possible  to allow all members of society to receive basic medical  guarantees and raise the health level of the entire nation.    An authority from public health circles pointed out that the  purpose of reforming the current medical system is to  fundamentally safeguard the citizens' basic rights for medical  treatment and to ensure against the lowering of their level and  quality of medical treatment.    China's public-funded medical system was established in  1952,  initially covering personnel in all levels of government organs;  political parties; people's organizations; educational,  scientific, cultural, and public health institutions; and some  disabled military servicemen. That system was later expanded to  cover students at higher institutes of learning. Presently  there are some 29 million people throughout the nation enjoying  the benefits of public-funded medical care. Government budgets  finance the costs of medical care.    China's labor medical insurance began in 1951. Staff members  and workers, as well as their dependents at collective-owned  enterprises, enjoy the benefits of the labor medical insurance  system. Both the publicly-funded medical system and the labor  medical insurance system provide the same kind of medical  services. Enterprises pay for the costs of medical treatment  incurred by their employees. Presently some 144 million people  throughout the nation are under labor insurance medical coverage.    Undoubtedly, public-funded and labor insurance medical care  systems have played important roles in safeguarding the health  of staff members and workers, have promoted economic  development, and have helped maintain social stability in their  40 years of implementation in China. However, the defects of  those systems are also apparent. As state and enterprises pay  for medical expenses, and as individuals do not have to pay for  medical expenses, there is a lack of an effective system to stop  abuse. Some of the abuses include: a person who is covered  under the public-funded medical system receives medical  treatment for the rest of his family; some pass themselves off  as eligible for free public medical service; patients make  unreasonable demands for certain medicines; doctors prescribe  medicines to show personal favors; doctors prescribe expensive  medicines; and doctors conduct unnecessary medical examinations.  These abuses have caused a serious waste of public health  resources    With the increase costs of medicine and medical equipment,  the renewal and replacement of medical equipment, the graying of  the population, and the changes in the nature of illness in  recent years, annual expenditures in public-funded and labor  insurance medical costs have increased rapidly, far exceeding  state revenue growth and forcing the state and enterprises to  shoulder a heavier financial burden. An expert pointed out that  the level of China's social and economic development at this  stage cannot support the current medical care systems.    The economic development and constant deepening of the  reform of the economic system in the 1990s presented  public-funded and labor insurance medical care systems with new  problems. As there is a lack of rational mechanisms to pool  funds for medical care and to stabilize the financial sources  for medical expenses, staff members and workers will be unable  to enjoy their rightful and basic medical treatment when the  operation of their enterprises become difficult.    The present medical care system does not provide medical  guarantees for staff members and workers employed at some small  enterprises; at privately-run enterprises; and at Sino-foreign  joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and wholly  foreign-owned enterprises. In addition, some eight million  people in urban and rural areas who are employed in the private  industrial and commercial sectors are also excluded from the  current medical coverage. The current system, with a small  percentage of people under its medical insurance coverage, and  with its poor management and service and low degree of  socialization, is not only unable to adapt to the requirements  for building a socialist market economy in China, but is also  finding it increasingly difficult to continue operating.    Is there a way out? Reform is the only way out. In March  1989 the State Council formally approved four cities--Siping in  Jilin, Dandong in Liaoning, Huangshhi in Hubei, and Zhuzhou in  Hunan--to conduct a pilot program to reform the medical  insurance system. A pilot program to reform the social medical  insurance system was also conducted in Shenzhen and Hainan.    Many regions have begun practicing a medical-cost-sharing  system. According to this system, staff members and workers are  required to pay a small amount of their medical costs when  receiving treatment. About 90 percent of the people who receive  public-funded medical care have now joined the  medical-cost-sharing system. About 80 percent of small and  medium enterprises under the labor insurance medical care system  also practice the cost-sharing method. When seeking medical  treatment, an individual is generally required to pay for 10 to  15 percent of the cost. The highest amount which a staff member  or worker pays for their medical costs during a year does not  exceed the average level of their monthly wages.    The same expert cited above claims this cost-sharing system  will have some effect in helping staff members and workers  become cost-conscientious and in helping control excessive  medical costs. Public Health Minister Chen Minzhang stressed:  "The purpose of reforming the social medical safeguard system  is to increase efficiency in using the limited public health  resources, and to raise the awareness of the individual and the  family to invest in health." It has been learned that relevant  departments of the State Council have drafted opinions on  carrying out a pilot program on the establishment of a medical  insurance system for staff members and workers. As the reform  of the medical safeguard system for staff members and workers is  a major reform involving the personal interests of staff members  and workers, and as there is no sufficient and good experience  as yet for such reform, the State Council has decided to select  two cities to carry out the experiment in order to ensure a  stable transition.    This reporter has learned the basic thinking for reform is  to  divide into two portions the medical costs of the public-funded  and labor insurance medical care systems, which is now being  jointly financed by state budgets and enterprises. Some of the  funds will go to the establishment of a social insurance fund,  which will be used to cover expenditures for treatment of major  illnesses of staff members and workers; other portions will be  used to establish a medical account for individuals. Staff  members and workers shall regularly contribute appropriate funds  from their wages to replenish individual medical accounts for  general medical treatment expenses. Localities must work out  measures to suit local conditions and avoid uniformity. All in  all, reforming the medical insurance system has become  imperative.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Inquiry into taxi wars Anarchy, greed and the lust for power were behind a bloody war between taxi operators in rural South Africa, a judicial inquiry said yesterday, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. A report by the Goldstone commission into the taxi war in Groblersdal, in the eastern Transvaal, said one of the root causes was lawlessness and 'a culture of taking the law into one's own hands'. The report gave no figures for casualties in the taxi war which erupted in 1991, but said there was 'serious loss of life, injury and damage'. The inquiry into taxi wars is part of a broader attempt by Judge Richard Goldstone to define and defuse the roots of South Africa's political violence.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Laszlo Hovanyecz: "Calmly"] </F>   [Text] This is the big task now: To be calm -- regardless  of the fact that some people call the events that have happened  a sweeping, annihilating victory and others call it a defeat.  We must look into the future with calm.    Up to now, it was possible to talk about intrigues,  falsifications, and ill-willed predictions. However, from now,  we can only talk about facts; that the majority politics of  recent times have failed.    The power that gained the majority in 1990 has lost the  people's confidence. It can search for excuses in the  international situation, in world economic recession, in the  country's desperate situation, and we could carry on listing the  many negative circumstances. All these do not excuse them the  same way as these did not excuse the stupid actions of the  previous regime. History does not grant acquittals for  failures, even in situations a thousand times more difficult  than what we have had. Especially that the social lifting power  of the change of the regime offered exceptional opportunities  after the change. Lessons can always be learned.    For the power that, in all probability, will have to say  goodbye after the [second round of] elections in three weeks'  time, the main lesson will obviously be that dialogue with  society cannot be neglected by any political force. Those who  have been leading the country up to now believed that that they  infallibly knew the wishes of the "people" and the "nation." In  the meantime, they humiliated the object and subject of their  governing every day.    They deliberately confused the Rakosi and the Kadar regimes  and the various phases of the latter. This carried the message  that the people were like a flock of sheep that was waiting for  a good shepherd to appear from nowhere. If someone believes and  even keeps repeating that this people is waiting for "bread for  3.60" [price in forints for kilo of bread in Kadar's time], he  is wrong and even deceives himself. Contrary to all belittling  assumptions, Hungarian people can count very well. Rather than  bread for 3.60, milk for 3, or sausage for 2, people first,  second, and third want dignity. They wish for their abilities  and performance to be recognized, and for their leaders to give  free scope to their creative abilities. The country has mainly  been disappointed in this wish in the past four years. We are  probably right in assuming that this is the reason it voted the  way it did.    Naturally, all this also has lessons for the future. Those  newly coming to power will have to deal with the same people  desiring dignity. Sober-minded politicians cannot believe that  it is good to produce radical government changes every four  years. To put it differently, it is not at all wise or bearable  to provide the grounds for such a deep disappointment. Those  coming to power as a result of this year's elections will have  to assess, thoroughly, the current successes, and even more  carefully, the reasons for the failure of the current losers.  As a result, they will have to conclude the following. First:  They have to come to an understanding with the people. Second:  They have to come to an understanding with the opposition. And  third: They have to prepare for both keeping and handing over  power.    Assessing all this calmly, those who are coming to power  will  have to be clear that "their coming into position" means that  they respect the nation's dignity and they interpret popular  sovereignty to be supreme, above themselves.</p>

The Secretary is also aware that the regulatory provisions differ from the guidance the Department has issued with respect to rebates of excess interest. However, these regulations reflect the provisions that are contained in section 427A(i) of the HEA. The Secretary does not have the authority to change these statutory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters suggested that the Secretary extend the 30-day period to credit the refund to 45 or 60 days. The commenters believed that a lender with a large volume of loans for which a refund was required may not be able to make the appropriate refunds within 30 days from the last day of the calendar year in which the quarter falls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary realizes that a lender that has a large number of loans for which a rebate is required may have difficulty making the appropriate refunds within the 30-day period. However, the 30-day time period is expressly mandated by section 427(i)(5) of the HEA. The Secretary does not have the authority to change this statutory requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.207&blank;Due Diligence in Disbursing a Loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter suggested that a school, when receiving FFEL proceeds via check, should be given the option to receive those proceeds via a master check or individual checks. The commenter pointed out that the disbursement of FFEL Program loan proceeds via a master check will place the extra administrative burden and costs associated with processing the master check and cutting individual checks to borrowers at a school in cases when a school would otherwise endorse an individual loan check and deliver it to the borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees with the commenter that disbursement of a loan proceeds via a master could impose such a burden. The Secretary agrees with the commenter that a school should be provided the authority to choose if it wishes loan proceeds to be disbursed via a master check.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A change has been made. The final regulations provide that FFEL Program loan proceeds may be disbursed via a master check if both the lender and school agree to the use of a master check.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters suggested that the Secretary should require a school to obtain a borrower's written authorization to release FFEL Program loan proceeds that are disbursed via a master check. The commenters believed that this is a necessary control to ensure that the borrowers are aware they are receiving their loan proceeds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees with the commenters that requiring the borrower's written authorization for the release of the initial and any subsequent disbursement of each FFEL loan to be made is a necessary control to ensure that a borrower is aware he or she is receiving the loan proceeds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A change has been made. The final regulations have been amended in &sect;682.604 to require a borrower's written authorization for the release of his or her loan proceeds via a master check.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.305&blank;Procedures for Payment of Interest Benefits and Special Allowance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters suggested that the Secretary notify a guaranty agency, or a new holder of a loan, that the originating lender has failed to pay the origination fees. The commenters argued that a guaranty agency or a new holder will not know if the origination fees have been paid on a loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary does not agree with the commenters. The Secretary believes that the most practical way for a lender or guaranty agency to find out if the origination fees have been paid on a loan is through the lender selling the loan or the lender that is submitting the claim. It would not be practicable for the Secretary to verify if the origination fees have been paid on a loan every time a loan is sold or a default claim is filed. The Secretary is not informed by lenders when a loan is sold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters believed that a guaranty agency should not be penalized by loss of eligibility for reinsurance on a loan because a lender did not pay the origination fees. The commenters believed that the lender should be held responsible and be penalized for failing to pay the origination fees on loans that it has made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary does not agree with the commenters. It has been the longstanding policy of the Secretary that an FFEL Program loan is not eligible for reinsurance if the lender or agency has failed to comply with all Federal requirements with respect to the loan. However, the Secretary agrees with the commenters that a lender that fails to pay the origination fees should be penalized for failing to do so. The Secretary will take whatever action necessary against a lender to ensure that the origination fees are promptly being paid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters suggested that the Secretary amend this provision to permit a lender that purchases a loan to pay the origination fees to the Secretary. The commenters argued that many originating lenders sell their loans upon disbursement and have contractual agreements with the purchasing lenders that provide that the purchasing lender will pay the origination fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary does not believe that such an amendment is necessary. The Secretary has promulgated this rule because, in many cases, such origination fees are not being paid to the Secretary. The Secretary believes that it is necessary to hold an originating lender responsible for such fees because this will decrease the incidence of origination fees not being paid to the Secretary. A purchasing lender may reimburse the originating lender for the origination fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.401&blank;Basic Program Agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters suggested that the Secretary provide in the regulations that a guaranty agency may (generally) not insure less than 98 percent of the unpaid principal balance of loans insured under its program. The commenters suggested this change because they believed this reflected the language of the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary does not agree with the commenters. The Secretary believes that Congress intended to bar a guaranty agency from paying lenders more than 98 percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest on default claims filed on loans made on or after October 1, 1993. The Secretary believes therefore it would be a misuse of a guaranty agency's reserve fund to pay more than 98 percent of the unpaid principal and interest on a defaulted loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters suggested that the Secretary's limitation of collection costs that may be included in a Federal Consolidation Loan to 18.5 percent was unreasonable. The commenters believed that 18.5 percent would not cover the collection costs incurred on some loans. The commenters also argued that this provision debilitates the deterring effect collection costs have with respect to a borrower repaying his or her loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary does not agree with the commenters that limiting collection costs to 18.5 percent of the borrower's outstanding balance is unreasonable. The Secretary wishes to clarify that this provision is intended to encourage a borrower with a defaulted loan to consolidate the loan in order to get the loan out of default and reestablish his or her eligibility for student financial aid. The Secretary believes that limiting the collection costs that may be included in a Federal Consolidation loan will provide an incentive for a borrower to get out of default.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

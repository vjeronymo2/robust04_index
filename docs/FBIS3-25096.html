			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Pedro Manuel in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Good evening. There has been no progress at the  negotiations this afternoon. The mediators and observers met  with Jorge Valentim, but it produced nothing. It has been  reported that, so far, UNITA has not reacted to the document  issued by the mediators and observers entitled General  Principles on National Reconciliation. Most of UNITA's  negotiating team is still in Cote d'Ivoire. Only Jorge Valentim  is in Lusaka. UN Special Representative Blondin Beye is also in  Cote d'Ivoire and might return on 9 February.    This morning the government team met with the mediators and  observers. According to a source, the meeting reviewed the  document issued by the mediators and observers in what could be  described as the government's first reaction. The source says  that, in general, the government agrees with the views of the  mediators and observers and has not proposed major changes to  the document.    A number of questions still need to be addressed -- namely,  when will the UNITA negotiating team return and what will the  working agenda in Lusaka be tomorrow? Analysts say it is  unlikely that the talks will be productive while Beye and  UNITA's negotiating team are absent.</p>

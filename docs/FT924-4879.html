			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / French group for sell-off offers bleak prospectus RHONE-POULENC, the state-owned chemical group that the French government is trying to privatise partially, has painted a bleak picture of its prospects in the US prospectus for the sell-off. It says that conditions, already poor last year, deteriorated sharply during the third quarter of the current 12 months. A number of divisions have been particularly hit by the slowdown. Sales of chemical intermediates such as soda ash and chlorine have been knocked by slowing demand and falling prices in European markets. Management does not expect any significant improvement for this division before 1994. No improvement is expected at the fibres and polymers division, hit by price falls of 6 per cent during the first nine months. Management does not expect an amelioration in the division's operating profits before 1994. The company's sales were also affected in the first nine months by the depreciation of the US dollar. This influenced prices of products manufactured in Europe competing against products exported from the dollar zone. Translation of US earnings into francs reduced Rhone-Poulenc's operating profits by about FFr250m (Pounds 30.5m). Agrochemicals sales will continue to be hit in 1993 by the EC's new common agricultural policy.</p>

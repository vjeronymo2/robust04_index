			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu reiterated Tuesday that replacing the  Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace pact is a matter for  Seoul and Pyongyang, not Pyongyang and Washington, to work out.    "The United States is a signatory of the Armistice and  therefore will get involved in that sense," Han told reporters,  "but Washington fully agrees with Seoul that the matter is for  the two Koreas to resolve."    North Korea will end up hindering high-level dialogue with  the United States if it insists on the change, Han said. "The  next round of North Korea-U.S. dialogue will not discuss this  issue."    Pyongyang unilaterally announced last week that it was  withdrawing from the Military Armistice Commission but would  keep on its commission secretaries and liaison officers.    In addition, it announced that Poland, a Neutral Nations  Supervisory Commission (NNSC) member chosen by North Korea, will  be withdrawn from the commission.    Han said the North was trying to isolate the South in  talking  only with the United States and trying to "break up" Seoul-  Washington relations.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / ITV teletext tender attracts five bids FIVE consortia yesterday delivered sealed bids to the Independent Television Commission for a new 10-year public teletext licence. Oracle, the existing service run as a subsidiary of the ITV companies, was challenged by: Intelfax and Carlton Communications. Teletext UK, a consortium led by Media Ventures International. TV-am Cable Television, a subsidiary of the breakfast television company that lost its broadcasting franchise. Update Teletext, a consortium put together by Independent Television News. As with the tenders for ITV franchises, the teletext licence for Channels 3 and 4 will go to the highest bidder meeting content requirements unless there are 'exceptional circumstances'. The period of the licence runs from January 1 next year. Teletext is the news and information service carried on spare lines in the television picture. Nearly 7m homes have sets that can receive teletext. Oracle promised a new computer system that would greatly reduce the time taken for news to reach viewers. Update Teletext, whose shareholders apart from ITN are MAI Broadcasting, Scottish Television and Anglia Television, is promising local news, weather and events. The TV-am bid is evidence that the company is trying to survive the loss of its television franchise and find other broadcasting outlets. The company is offering 14 separate regional services and special multicultural pages. The main news on the service will be provided by the Press Association news agency. Media Ventures is backed by Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail, and Philips Electronics. It is promising a more comprehensive service with sharper headlines and faster updates of news. Carlton, winner of the London weekday television franchise, has joined forces with Intelfax, which already provides information for the Channel 4 teletext service. The proposed service - to be called Gemini  - will offer a total of 2,600 pages of information across Channels 3 and 4 with a strong emphasis on regional information. The ITC plans to announce the winner in April.</p>

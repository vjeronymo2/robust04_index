			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Bad Habit of Finding Fault With Others Must Be Discarded" </F> -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The Japanese  reactionaries are alleging that there is a possibility for the  DPRK "to develop nuclear weapons in the future" and the South  Korean puppets are blabbing that the North "will stockpile 200  kg of plutonium every year" in the future and "export nuclear  weapons", making a fuss over its "nuclear issue".    Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: To  call in question the past of the DPRK's nuclear activities is a  deliberate move of those who dislike a smooth solution to the  nuclear issue to complicate the situation.    For the Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppets  to make much ado about the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the  DPRK is a sinister act to lay an obstacle in the way of a smooth  solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the United  States and deliberately aggravate the situation on the Korean  peninsula. Lurking behind it is the intention to divert  elsewhere the cautious eyes and criticism of the world directed  to them, accelerate nuclear arms development by gaining time and  justify their nuclear armament.    In actuality, the nuclear armament of Japan has reached the  danger line. The South Korean puppets also have long since been  stockpiling plutonium and stepping up the development of nuclear  weapons.    The Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppets are  raising a futile row over the DPRK's "nuclear issue", afraid  that they shall lose the pretext for their nuclear armament, if  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is fundamentally  solved through dialogue.    They must renounce the bad habit of finding fault with  others, give up the nuclear design and stop the futile act of  putting a spoke in the wheel of a fundamental solution to the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.</p>

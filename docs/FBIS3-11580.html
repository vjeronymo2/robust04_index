			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Katin] </F>   [Text] The Supreme Court of Justice [CSJ] contends the wave  of mass evictions nationwide within the past three weeks could  lead to an explosive crisis with unpredictable consequences.    CSJ President Orlando Trejos Somarriba said the eviction  cases will be studied by a special commission comprising  representatives from the National Assembly and various  magistrates. He added: "This is an issue with serious  consequences involving all state branches."    Dr. Rodolfo Robelo, a commission member -- the commission  also includes Rodolfo Vargas Sandino and Alba Luz Ramos -- told  BARRICADA that no specific agreements were reached in Tuesday's  meeting with various Sandinist party representatives, but he  added that there was a CSJ initiative "to begin an in-depth  investigation" of more than 1,000 evictions occuring within the  past three weeks.    The National Assembly should appoint a group of deputies  from  different parties to begin the investigation no later than  Monday.    Robelo said only the investigation will confirm or deny  accusations on the alleged politization of court orders, and he  declined any further comments.    Nevertheless, Magistrate Robelo said that if the commission  confirms the irregularities reported by the injured parties --  namely, that many of the decisions resulted from widespread  political corruption within the judicial branch -- "the CSJ has  the authority to not only sanction the judicial officials who  have taken part in these presumed irregularities, but also to  try those officials in compliance with the country's laws."    Magistrate Robelo said: "I want to make it clear that this  investigation in no way will undermine the independence of the  judicial branch," like some self-serving individuals have  claimed concerning the parliamentary initiative to resort  directly to the CSJ.    "Rulings on these cases will be issued by various judges of  this state branch," Dr. Robelo added.    Concerning the evictions still being carried out, Robelo  issued an appeal to the people, urging them "to understand that  when a decision is made, it must be carried out."    The magistrate also explained the difference concerning  cases  between private individuals, over which the state has no  jurisdiction, and those cases in which it does have  jurisdiction. "It is one thing when the state has awarded  property to someone, in which case the state has to assume  responsibility," said Robelo, pointing out that the plaintiff  must take action against the state rather than against the  person who occupies a house or other type of property.    Robelo believes that in cases in which a poor person has  been  favored by the state with a home or property, "his rights to  that property should be respected when he fulfills all the legal  obligations."    Meanwhile, CSJ President Orlando Trejos rejected the charge  that the execution of justice is being delayed within his state  branch.    "What is happening is that, because there is no court for  administrative disputes, all cases come directly to us when they  actually only need an administrative legal ruling," Dr. Trejos  said.    The CSJ president has been approached by a group of former  customs employees who have been waiting for a court decision  since June to recover their jobs. The magistrate has promised  to receive them in his office on Monday.</p>

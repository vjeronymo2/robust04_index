Addressing a meeting held in support of Serbia in Moscow  on Saturday, Zhirinovskiy said that his party "may come to power  for good in the current year". Held in Sokolnikiy, the meeting  gathered about one thousand people.    Zhirinovskiy accused the Kremlin and the government of  conniving with the West which "is testing mechanisms for  destroying Russia" in Serbia. According to him, "the third  world war waged against the Slavs and the Orthodox Church by the  USA, West Germany and the Vatican" is already in progress in  Yugoslavia. The West, Zhirinovskiy said, wants to surround  Russia with "a green Muslim corridor" by destroying the people  of Serbia and populating their land with Muslims, and leave it  only one direction for development -- "from Moscow to Vologda  and Arkhangelsk". Zhirinovskiy demanded that the economic  sanctions imposed by the U.N. against Serbia be lifted, and  compared the French President, Francois Mitterrand, who, he  said, called for bombing the positions of Bosnian Serbs, with  Hitler.    Zhirinovskiy condemned Russia's reorganized government for  retaining Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Deputy Premier  Anatoliy Chubays and Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, and  declared that they "betrayed not only the Russian people, but  also all the Slavs". As for the resignation of Yegor Gaydar and  Boris Fedorov, the LDP leader qualified it as an action  "designed to deceive the populace", and described the Russian  Choice faction as "fallout".    Had he been Russia's president, Zhirinovskiy said, he would  not have signed a treaty on friendship, neighborliness and  cooperation between Russia and Georgia, but suggested that  Georgia should join Russia as one of its provinces, and cut all  contacts with Tbilisi, if it refused.    The meeting was addressed by a spokesman for Serbia, who  urged the Russian people to save their brethren in Serbia along  with the Orthodox Church.</p>

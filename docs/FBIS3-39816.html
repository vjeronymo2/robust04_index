			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gisela Hopfmueller] </F>   [Text] In a first reaction to the Swiss decision [to block  truck transit across Switzerland by road], Transport Minister  Viktor Klima said that this gives Austria support in the  negotiations with the European Union [EU]. Is this really the  case? Might this not make negotiations more difficult, because  the EU will be all the more careful to find transit routes for  its trucks? Minister Klima said:    [Begin Viktor Klima recording] I think that we can now  expect more understanding in Brussels. We can only achieve a  positive result in the referendum [on EU membership] if we  manage to keep the transit agreement. This is the positive  thing about it. I agree, however, that there might be some  shortsighted people who say: We will now need a thoroughfare  through the Alps, and we want to use Austria for this. It will,  therefore, be very important to stick to our clear position.    [Hopfmueller] Will it be sufficient for us to insist on  keeping the transit agreement? Let me give an example: The  transit agreement will expire in 2004. But 2004 is also the  year the Swiss completely ban transit trucks from their roads.  This means that trucks that are no longer allowed to pass  through Switzerland might go via Austria because the  restrictions of the transit agreement are no longer there.    [Klima] The year 2004 is not the result of a poker game  where we can trade or change around, but it is a result of  measures we have to take. Measures to further develop the  railroad infrastructure, to strengthen combined transport. Once  we have taken these measures -- and we have envisaged to  complete them by 1994 -- we can be sure that the transport  policy will have been adjusted in such a way that the  infrastructure, that is the railroads, will be used. I am sure  that if we really implement these measures we will get more  transport onto the railroads and will thus reduce the road  transit problem. Switzerland is taking a similar course. [end  recording]    Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek, Austrian People's Party [OeVP]  chairman, adds:    [Begin recording Busek] For me, and for the OeVP, this means  that extending the railroad system in the Alps must have  absolute priority. We must find a solution that involves  building tracks underground, using noise-reduction technologies.  I think we will have to win over the EU to participate in this  solution. There is no doubt that this will be easier from the  inside than from the outside. The question has been asked  whether this will make the situation for Austria easier or more  difficult. I think that our standpoint is now clearer for the  EU; but things have certainly not gotten any easier. What is  needed now is action. [end recording]    Some time ago, the Swiss voted against the European Economic  Area. Now they are saying no to truck transit. This means that  the Swiss rate European integration quite differently from the  Austrian Government. Chancellor Vranitzky said on possible  effects:    [Begin recording Chancellor Franz Vranitzky] You cannot  compare any two countries. Switzerland has had international  relations much longer than Austria. There is hardly any Swiss  company that does not have strong international contacts. This  brought Switzerland many advantages in the past. As you will  know, Switzerland will be facing a number of very difficult  challenges if it chooses to stay away from the European  integration process. I talked to Swiss Government members this  morning because I was interested in knowing how they interpret  this matter. They voiced concern that international cooperation  might get more difficult for Switzerland following this  attitude, because international cooperation does not only  consist of international transport, but there are many other  things involved. As you will also know, Switzerland has  concluded a transit agreement with the EU, which will lose its  basis in the future. Switzerland is thus facing important  negotiations with the EU although it is not a member and has not  yet decided in favor of joining.    [Hopfmueller] Following this Swiss decision, do you fear a  psychological effect on Austria regarding the EU referendum that  will be held in Austria sometime in the future?    [Vranitzky] We made great efforts negotiating the transit  agreement with the EU three years ago. In the meantime, the  importance of this agreement has increased a great deal. It is  undisputed now, and many people are attaching great importance  to maintaining it. I think that maintaining the agreement will  be our foremost aim in the EU negotiations, and I think that  what you call a possible psychological effect must be seen  against this background.    [Hopfmueller] All negotiations, including those with the EU,  are a kind of poker game. Can keeping tough in transit not mean  giving in, say in agriculture?    [Vranitzky] I do not see such a link at the moment. We have  clear standpoints in both transit and agricultural policy, and  we will clearly advocate them. [end recording]</p>

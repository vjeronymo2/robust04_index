			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Technology: Reshaping the trading floor - The role of broker-dealer may be transformed with the launch of order-driven systems Is share trading in London on the brink of its next technological revolution? The first came with the Big Bang reforms of 1986, when the stock market shifted from the floor of the Stock Exchange to the telephone. The next possible step is electronic trading, with computers bringing together buyers and sellers and, in some cases, fixing the prices of trades as well. If that happens, the role of the Stock Exchange and broker-dealers could be transformed. The latest attack on the current market structure comes from Tradepoint Financial Networks, a start-up venture which aims to compete with the renamed London Stock Exchange on a capital base of only Dollars 11m (Pounds 7.7m). Tradepoint, due to be launched in October, is an order-driven system: anyone who wants to buy or sell shares posts an order on a screen, then waits to see if anyone comes forward to trade against that order electronically. That makes it an alternative to the dealer-driven (or quote-driven) telephone market, which is based on prices advertised by marketmakers. Buyers or sellers use the telephone to trade, often negotiating a better price than the one advertised (something that happens in 55 per cent of share trades in London of more than Pounds 100,000, according to the London Stock Exchange). Constructing an order-driven or auction market is cheap and technically easy to do. Tradepoint reckons it needs to win only 1.5 per cent of London's stock market business to break even. Off-the-shelf software has helped to cut the cost. Tradepoint studied stock market systems offered by Transvik (whose cross-border market in Scandinavian shares, Nordex, recently closed) and OM (the Swedish futures and options market) before picking VCT. This system, developed by the Vancouver Stock Exchange, has been installed in Mexico and Caracas. The market will be run on a Stratus fault-tolerant computer, under a facilities management arrangement with Extel Financial. The communications software comes from Ericsson and the screens use Microsoft Windows. Tradepoint is being launched as Instinet, the Reuters-owned electronic dealing system, is renewing its efforts to break into the London markets. Instinet, created in 1969 and bought by Reuters in 1987, has 200 terminals in use in Europe, double the number of a year ago, and claims the level of business it is handling has risen six-fold over the same period - though it declines to give absolute trading levels. Instinet has adopted a lower-risk approach than Tradepoint, prefering to depict itself as an alternative broker rather than an alternative stock market. The only difference with other brokers, it says, is that its users have full access to all the buy or sell orders it has received. With its established base of users in the US, around 90 per cent of trades currently done in London bring together US institutions on the one hand and UK brokers on the other. Electronic trading systems have been tried before and failed. Markets are fine-tuned mechanisms: they must bring together different groups of users, each with a different interest and a different level of information, in a way that leaves each feeling they have a fair deal. Using technology to replicate an existing market, or to create a new one, poses challenges which go beyond the technological. A decade ago, attempts were made to launch similar order-driven markets in London for both equities (known as Ariel) and bonds (Eurex). Ariel was created by a group of institutional investors looking for a way to avoid the high minimum commissions on the London Stock Exchange. When the fixed commission structure disappeared, the impetus behind the system withered. Eurex did not get off the drawing board: marketmakers saw it as a threat to their existence and opposed its creation, according to Stanley Ross, a former head of Deutsche Bank Capital Markets in London, who is is now president of Tradepoint. The real reason telephone trading has survived could be more simple. Investors prefer to deal by phone because it enables them to negotiate over price and because the relationships between institutional investors and equity and bond salespeople makes human intermediation an important part of the way markets operate in London. Why should electronic trading succeed this time round? Two factors have changed since the early 1980s, and both point towards a greater use of technology. The first is cost. Both broker-dealers and investment managers are under greater pressure, due to overcapacity in the securities markets. As the cost of computing power has fallen, the cost of human dealers has risen. Order-driven systems hold out the promise of cutting out dealers altogether. However, there is little immediate sign of change. When asked, most investors say they are getting good value out of the London markets. They can generally trade in large volumes instantly, rather than having to wait for another investor to provide the other side of their order. They also say the liquidity provided to the markets by broker-dealers is relatively cheap. Members of the London Stock Exchange made a return on capital of less than 1 per cent between them in the first nine months of last year. Since the mid-1980s, their best performance was the 15 per cent return in 1989 - a poor return given the big losses they have shouldered in other years. Cost considerations have already brought a degree of automation to the existing market. Trade, an automated system run by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays bank, claims around 10 per cent of the total number of bargains passing through the stock market. Orders are submitted to the system by independent brokers around the UK, and are executed automatically at the 'yellow strip' price - the best price quoted by any marketmaker in the particular stock at the time. According to BZW, around 15 per cent of deals received by marketmakers over the telephone are subsequently disputed in some way, involving expensive human intervention after the trade. The error rate on automated trades, by comparison, is 'a fraction of 1 per cent'. The second reason electronic trading systems may finally have come of age is that the nature of investment has changed, with computers becoming more involved in decisions to buy or sell stocks. Index-tracking funds, which seek not to outperform a stock market index but to match it, now account for an estimated 15 per cent of funds under management in London. The newest wave of funds use so-called quantitative investment methods - they analyse stocks for pre-selected properties to try to identify under-valued shares. 'All this money is crucial to us - it's managed by computers,' says Mike Sanderson, president of Instinet. As this trend increases, the human intervention of a broker's sales staff becomes less important. Also, computer investment strategies such as index-linking are intended to provide low-cost entry to a stock market, making order-driven trading systems, which cut out the marketmaker in the middle, theoretically attractive. Instinet has been reshaped to appeal to the new age of computer-based investors - though its commission rates, which are the same as those charged by conventional brokers, may deter some indexed funds. There is one other overriding challenge the electronic markets face. A natural gravitational force draws investors and traders to markets which are already actively used. Why should they abandon an existing, bustling marketplace for a new, deserted one, whatever the theoretical advantages? The new trading screens will gather dust if they cannot generate their own activity quickly. Peter Cox, a former Stock Exchange executive who recently joined OM (London), says: 'The most important thing is liquidity - and a system, no matter how good, won't get it for you on its own.'</p>

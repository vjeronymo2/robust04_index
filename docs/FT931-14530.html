			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Letter: Quango sets a lead Sir, We note that Remploy appears in your list ('Patronage determines who serves at the top', January 14) of the Top 40 quangos for 1990-91 at number 27 showing expenditure of Pounds 191m. These figures may be misleading. In fact, the government contribution to Remploy in the form of a subsidy to compensate for the extra costs of its disabled employees was Pounds 75m, including capital investment of Pounds 12m. You are probably aware that Remploy is a private company, limited by guarantee, whose members are the directors who are in turn appointed by the secretary of state for employment. The company's objective is to employ severely disabled people who would not be able to find employment in a commercial environment and who would cost the state a similar amount in disability and other benefits. The balance of Remploy's expenditure was covered by sales of Pounds 114m, including exports of Pounds 6m to countries such as the US, Japan, France and Germany. Remploy is a leading company in many of its core activities such as clothing, furniture, packaging and medical products. Sales last year rose to Pounds 120m, including Pounds 10m exports, demonstrating the highly commercial nature of the company in a recessionary environment. Ivor Cohen, chairman, Remploy, 415 Edgware Road, Cricklewood, London NW2 6LR</p>

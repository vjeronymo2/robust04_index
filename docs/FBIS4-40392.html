			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Belyy: "Amur Oblast Has Every </F> Opportunity to Stop Being Subsidized"]    [Text] Blagoveshchensk -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's working trip to Amur Oblast continued 15 June. In  Blagoveshchensk he visited a shipbuilding plant where seiners  for Far East fishermen are assembled and difficult orders  connected with the defense industry are carried out. The  president met with workers in the workshops and expressed  interest in the course of economic reform at the major  enterprise involved in conversion. Boris Yeltsin also visited  one of the leading enterprises in the Amur region -- the  multi-sector "Partizan" joint stock company. This enterprise  alone produces more soybeans, for example, than the whole of the  neighboring Khabarovsk Kray.    A detailed conversation about the fuller use of the Amur  region's potential took place at the oblast administration.  There the president briefly shared his impressions from  meetings with Amur inhabitants and stressed that the people's  mood struck him favorably: They are not hiding the  difficulties, but, he noted, they are not panicking. Boris  Yeltsin spoke critically about local trade, noting the small  range of output in the stores. It was noted at the conference  that a beginning has been made on the formation of a market  infrastructure in Amur Oblast.    However, parasitical attitudes and contempt for the laws of  a  market economy at the primary level, in the enterprises, is one  reason for the economic crisis and the fall in the volume of  production.    Apart from the crisis factors common to the whole country,  there are also purely regional factors. The cost of output is  high because of transportation expenditure and the disparity  between the price of industrial and agricultural output, as a  result of which 100,000 tonnes of soybeans, produced last year,  are left unclaimed in storehouses. The biggest problem of all  is the lack of a base for processing agricultural raw materials.  To overcome it, Amur Oblast needs to construct a major plant  for processing soybeans; after all, the Amur region provides  something in the order of 70 percent of Russia's soybeans.  Right away, turning to A. Shokhin, the president gave the  government instructions to work on this question and provide the  necessary federal assistance. Similar instructions were given  to develop a free trade and economic zone in the Blagoveshchensk  area.    The task was set of bringing the oblast's mineral and raw  material resources more quickly and fully into economic  circulation; their overall value is assessed at $360 billion.  There is a possibility of increasing the volume of gold  extraction by a factor of 1.4-1.7 in the next five years. The  overwhelming proportion of known reserves and predicted  resources are concentrated in developed areas, so that growth  can be achieved without using up big allocations.    In the evening of 15 June B. Yeltsin left Blagoveshchensk  for  Kyzyl.</p>

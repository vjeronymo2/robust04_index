			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / People: Shanks' new finance man Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management company whose share price has nearly halved since early October, has found a new finance director. David Downes, 47, finance director of Hunter Saphir, the fresh produce distributor, joined the company yesterday. He replaces Alastair Fowler, 55, whose surprise resignation on October 1, helped precipitate the collapsed share price. The company said that Fowler retired early because he did not want to move down South as the company relocated its headquarters from Scotland. However, the combination of his abrupt departure, followed by poor interim results, led to a sharp drop in the Shanks' share price. Following yesterday's announcement the share price rose 5p, to 92p.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Motorola Inc.: Third-quarter profit edged up 2% to $89 million from a year ago.  Sales totaled $2.41 billion, up 20%. The Schaumburg, Ill., electronics and  communications company cited strong sales in its General Systems Group and its  Government Electronics Group. The results reflect a pretax provision to cover  the anticipated costs of the voluntary severance program announced earlier this  month and a decrease in the estimated 1989 full-year tax rate.  </P></p>

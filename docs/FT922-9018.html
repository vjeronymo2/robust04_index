			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / CIS to retain control of nuclear forces NUCLEAR FORCES of the former Soviet Union will remain under joint Commonwealth control for the time being despite Russia's decision to form its own military forces, Gen Pavel Grachev, acting Russian defence minister, said yesterday. He spelt out plans for dismantling the Red Army at a ceremony to commemorate the anniversary of its finest hour - the defeat of Nazi Germany 47 years ago today. Gen Grachev, appointed on Thursday when President Boris Yeltsin ordered the creation of a Russian army, said Russia was counting 2.63m of the former Soviet Union's 3.7m-strong armed forces as its own, including some stationed in other republics. However, Russia aimed to cut numbers to 1.5m by 1996 to create an army that was 'powerful, mobile ..manageable and professional'. It planned to set up rapid deployment forces and would take its general staff from that of the former Red Army. However, this did not mean the immediate disappearance of the Commonwealth joint command, which would remain in place until all strategic weapons were withdrawn from Belarus and Ukraine. Gen Grachev suggested Russia might have to negotiate a separate treaty with Kazakhstan, the other republic with nuclear arms on its territory, or find a means of prolonging some kind of Commonwealth control over these weapons. Belarus and Ukraine have committed themselves to becoming non-nuclear weapon states, but Kazakhstan has insisted on keeping its options open.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Markets: Sharp rise in charitable giving through Gift Aid - At a glance Gift Aid, the scheme which allows tax-efficient single donations to charity, took off in the third quarter of last year, according to figures issued this week by the Inland Revenue. Donations from individuals increased from Pounds 25m in the three months to the end of June to Pounds 37.9m, while corporate donations rose from Pounds 19.2m to Pounds 30.1m. Average individual donations rose from Pounds 1,764 to Pounds 2,073, which suggests that the move cannot be accounted for by the cut in the minimum donation allowed under the scheme from Pounds 600 to Pounds 400. The figures are included in the latest edition of The Outline Guide to Charitable Giving and to Establishing Charitable Gift Trusts, published by Investment and Tax Publishing Services (tel: 0234 218740), which gives full details of the scheme. Price Pounds 48 (Pounds 42 until February 26).</p>

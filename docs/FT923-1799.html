			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Doubts hang over weaker currencies THE FRENCH FRANC moved higher against the D-Mark last night but the apparent narrowness of the Yes vote in the referendum cast further doubt over the prospects for some of the weaker currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism. As currency trading rooms across Europe opened for business last night, investors switched funds into the French franc and the D-Mark while sterling dropped to a new low against the German currency. Mr Hermann Remsberger, chief economist at BHF-Bank, the German bank said any sense of relief on the Yes vote would evaporate given the big political difficulties about moving to economic and monetary union according to the current time table. Weaker currencies still within the ERM, such as the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo, could prove vulnerable to selling pressure as doubts grow about whether individual European economies will converge. Attention is also likely to focus on the government's economic policy after the pound's withdrawal from the ERM last week. In early far eastern trading the franc jumped to about FFr3.4060 per D-Mark. This compared with Friday's close of FFr3.4200 and was roughly three centimes above its FFr3.43 floor in the European exchange rate mechanism. Pressure remained on sterling in early Tokyo trading where it dropped to DM2.5616, down more than five pfennigs on Friday night's close, giving the UK government less room for an early cut in interest rates. Against the dollar, the pound was quoted at Dollars 1.7355, little changed from Friday's New York close. The dollar weakened against the D-Mark and was quoted at DM1.4760 in Tokyo, more than two and a half pfennigs down on Friday's New York close. Traders reported Bank of Japan intervention in the currency markets. Mr Avinash Persaud, senior currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the Swiss bank, said: 'There is some relief about a Yes vote, but the margins are too narrow to give any clear direction to trading.' Mr Mark Austin, an economist at Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank said: 'The outcome of the referendum looks like a nightmare. It leaves everything up the air.' Among the few beneficiaries of the vote, apart from the French franc, were Ecu bonds which rose by 1 point on muted relief by investors in these securities about a positive vote. French government bonds also rose in price slightly on prospects that France would remain a part of the low inflation core of the ERM, linked to the D-Mark. The lira, due to return to the ERM tomorrow after suspension last week, fluctuated in initial trading but recovered to about L835 against the D-Mark, up slightly on Friday's close in London of L836.1, but still beneath its ERM floor of L820. Mr Axel Siedenberg, an economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt said he foresaw 'a lot of movement and uncertainty' in currency trading when markets in Europe open today.</p>

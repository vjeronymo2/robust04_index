			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS ARE EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE MULTIYEAR CONTRACT FOR RADER SOON  </P> <P> An announcement that the Angels have rehired Manager Doug Rader -- with the  multiyear contract he sought -- is imminent and could be made as soon as today.  </P> <P> Rader's status was among the topics Wednesday when General Manager Mike Port  met with Angel owner Gene Autry and Autry's wife Jackie, who has authority in  club business matters.  </P> <P> It's believed that in those discussions, the Autrys authorized Port to give  Rader a contract longer than one year, a condition about which Rader had been  adamant.  </P> <P> Although Port cautioned that "nothing is as simple as it sounds," he added,  "It's possible I'll have something for you (reporters) shortly. Not today,  because we need one more day of speculation."  </P> <P> Rader, whose second one-year contract expires after this season, declined to  discuss the terms he requested. "Whatever it is I'm interested in should remain  between myself and the ownership," he said. "Until something happens, there's  no need to discuss it." HELENE ELLIOTT  </P></p>

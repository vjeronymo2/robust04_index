			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> AUSTRALIA TARGETS TV VIOLENCE  </P> <P> The Australian government moved Thursday to reduce the violence shown on  television, particularly in news programs.  </P> <P> Transport and Communications Minister Kim Beazley said he supports the  recommendations in the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's report on television  violence, which was brought up for discussion in Parliament.  </P> <P> The key recommendation is that the television industry draw up a uniform code  on how to treat violence.  </P> <P> Although the emphasis is on "supervised self-regulation," Tribunal Chair  Deirdre O'Connor said in a separate statement that if the code could not  satisfy public concerns, "the Tribunal would be driven to consider a range of  options which could include imposing program standards and license conditions."  </P> <P> The report said there is widespread worry about the repetition of violent  images, close-ups of blood and intrusion on grieving people.  </P></p>

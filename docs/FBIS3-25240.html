			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge </F> Chikoti by correspondent Berenice Bettencourt in Geneva; date  not given--recorded]    [Text] The Angolan Government has accused Portugal of  supporting UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola]. The Angolan deputy foreign minister has told the UN  Human Rights Commission that all the countries that authorize  UNITA to set up offices on their soil share in the  responsibility for the war, which has left over 500,000 people  dead in Angola in one year alone. [figure as heard]    Berenice Bettencourt reports from Geneva:    [Bettencourt] Angolan Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Chikoti  denounced cases of involvement in the Angolan civil war by  foreign countries, which support UNITA for reasons pertaining to  their own interests and are, in his opinion, co-responsible for  over 500,000 dead, 200,000 amputees, and the country's general  state of famine and destruction. According to Chikoti, it is  the aforementioned countries that--together with UNITA--are  fomenting human rights violations in Angola. When I interviewed  Chikoti, he told me he said this to the UN Human Rights  Commission.    [Begin recording] [Bettencourt] Which countries do you mean?    [Chikoti] Well, directly, in military terms, there is South  Africa. Then there is Zaire, which supports UNITA logistically  and allows it free passage through its territory. The political  support comes from all the western countries that still have  UNITA offices on their soil and where UNITA resorts to all  manner of false propaganda. As you know, UNITA has one or two  offices in the United States, one in Britain, one in France, and  one in Portugal. These are the very countries that have  diplomatic relations with Angola at the same time, the very same  countries that once expressed the wish that Angola should  undergo a democratic process--which was done. So UNITA must not  be allowed subterfuge. In so doing, these countries are trying  to show UNITA that even though it is waging war, even though it  lost the elections, they are still prepared to give it shelter.  [end recording]</p>

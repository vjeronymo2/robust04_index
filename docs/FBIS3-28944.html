			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Beijing-based correspondent Yu Tong-hui: "What </F> Is Beijing's Method of Solution?"]    [Text] With the beginning of the "march of crisis" of the  North Korean nuclear issue toward the deadline of 21 February,  people's attention is directed to China's attitude.    When the situation was dashing toward a catastrophe after  North Korea declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear  Non-proliferation Treaty [NPT] on 12 March last year, what the  people had to watch attentively was China's attitude. This was  because China is the only nation that can exercise influence on  North Korea and is a permanent member state in the UN Security  Council whose consent is absolutely necessary when the Security  Council takes procedures for sanctions against North Korea.  However, as long as the North Korean nuclear issue is  concerned, the Chinese side kept a consistent position, at least  outwardly, whether in the situation of crisis or in the stage of  negotiations.    China put forward as a precondition its position that  neither  the North nor the South of Korea should have nuclear weapons.  Nevertheless, China maintained the position that the North  Korean nuclear issue is a problem which should be resolved  between North Korea and the United States; between North and  South Korea; and between North Korea and the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. Proceeding from this position,  China opposed referring the issue to the UN Security Council.  Moreover, China maintained that the problem should be resolved  through dialogue and persuasion, instead of sanctions.    The past one year can be called a course of application of  the Chinese-style method of solution to the North Korean nuclear  problem through dialogue. However, the resolution of the problem  through dialogue has not been successful for the past one year.  At this point, therefore, mere repetition of the Chinese side's  basic position may be criticized as an irresponsible attitude of  the nation with the responsibility for international problems.    Some people, however, predict that although China is  outwardly opposed to taking procedures for sanctions against  North Korea, it would internally give strong pressure to the  North Korean side. China does not want to aggravate relations  with Western countries, including the United States, even while  maintaining its existent position. Besides, China is expected to  play an active role in leading the situation in such a way as to  resolve the problem through dialogue.    China presently has more favorable conditions than last year  for exercising influence on North Korea. First, distrust caused  between China and North Korea by the establishment of ROK-China  diplomatic relations was removed last year to a considerable  extent. Recovery of North Korea's trust in China would broaden  the scope of China's persuasion of North Korea. Second, with  persistent nuclear crisis, the degree of North Korea's economic  reliance on China has been deepened.    However, even if the situation comes for China to take  advantage of the card pertaining to energy, China will not  likely use this card as the West expects. What one should pay  attention to in observing China's attitude is the issue of  renewing most-favored-nation status in early June. It is  expected that the issue of renewing the most-favored-nation  status will cause considerable discord because the Clinton  administration put forward the improvement of China's human  rights as a precondition.    This being the case, China will strive to gain maximum  practical interest by opposing the West's method for solution to  the nuclear problem to the maximum possible extent. The basic  reason for China--a nuclear power--not to keep step with the  West is the difference in views on whether the North Korean  nuclear arms are an actual threat or a diplomatic card.    Unless clear evidence of the existence of North Korean  nuclear arms is revealed to the public, "China's brakes" will  likely continue in the future.</p>

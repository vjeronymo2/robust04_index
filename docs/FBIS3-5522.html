			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Senior ASEAN officials have agreed in principle  to the idea of inviting Burma to a meeting of ASEAN foreign  ministers taking place in Bangkok in July, a Thai foreign  ministry spokesman said yesterday. But it remains to be decided  whether Burma should be invited as "guest of the host country,"  or "guest of ASEAN," said Suwit Simasakun. "There's still time  to think about this. The principle is not to isolate them (the  Burmese) but how far they will be involved depends on them," he  said.    ASEAN officials have long made clear that an invitation to  Rangoon would be contingent on progress toward political  liberalisation in Burma.    Thailand is hosting what will be the 27th annual conference  of foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian  Nations.    Consensus on inviting Burma to the ASEAN foreign ministers'  gathering was reached yesterday at a meeting in Bangkok of the  grouping's foreign affairs and security officials. The  so-called special SOM (Senior Officials' Meeting), continuing  through tomorrow, is concentrating on preparations toward the  first ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the grouping's new mechanism  for security dialogue. In the first mention of dates, officials  yesterday said the foreign ministers' conference would take  place from July 23-24 and would be followed by the first session  of the ARF on July 25.    The annual Post Ministerial Conference with seven so-called  dialogue partners the United States, Canada, Australia, New  Zealand, South Korea, Japan and the European Union is set for  July 26-27. The six ASEAN member states are inviting these  dialogue partners and five others -- China, Russia, Vietnam,  Laos and Papua New Guinea -- to attend the ARF.    Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha Khunakasem  called the ARF a mechanism for solving security problems.  Yesterday's meeting endorsed a related idea -- the proposed  establishment of a regional peace-keeping centre. But it  remains to be decided whether the centre should function as a  nucleus for training regional peacekeepers or one for exchanging  information, said Mr Suwit.    The idea of setting up a regional peacekeeping centre  surfaced last month in response to the United Nations  secretary-general's "Agenda for Peace". Reportedly the  brainchild of Indonesian scholar Jusuf Wanandi, of the Institute  of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS), the idea will be  discussed in depth at an ASEAN-ISIS workshop scheduled in  conjunction with the next meeting of senior ASEAN officials in  April.    The ASEAN officials' meeting yesterday also saw Thailand  propose holding a Southeast Asian Ten Nations Conference.    The proposal calls for a ministerial-level meeting of the  six  ASEAN member states, and neighbours Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and  Burma, said Director-General of East Asia Affairs Department Don  Pramatwinai. Yesterday's gathering also discussed outstanding  problems in the South China Sea, on the Korean Peninsula, and  prospects of setting up a Zone of Peace Freedom and Neutrality  (ZOPFAN).

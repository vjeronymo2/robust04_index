			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> HOLIDAY RUSH: Sheriff Brad Gates, trying to keep the jail population within  court-ordered limits, has asked local judges to forsake a longstanding holiday  tradition. . . . Reluctant to lock up less serious prisoners over the holidays,  judges typically stay sentences until Jan. 2. The result: up to 1,000 people  lining up for booking on the day after New Year's. . . . Gates is asking that  the rush be spread over four to six weeks, and Superior Court Presiding Judge  Leonard Goldstein says judges will try to cooperate. Jim Newton and Jerry Hicks  </P></p>

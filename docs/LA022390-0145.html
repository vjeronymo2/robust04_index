			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BIRD RESCUE STATION SHUTS DOWN;  </P> <P> CREWS PREPARE FOR FINAL PUSH TO REMOVE OIL  </P> <P> As the tanker American Trader steamed into San Francisco Bay for repairs,  cleanup crews marshaled their forces Thursday for a final effort that could  take weeks to remove the remnants of a 394,000-gallon oil spill that fouled  miles of Orange County coast.  </P> <P> Although it will be a while before the last oily residues are picked up,  cleanup officials say, stretches of once-blackened shoreline between Newport  Beach and Huntington Beach might be reopened to the public within several days.  </P> <P> "I think it's gone very well so far, but there is still more work to do," said  U.S. Coast Guard Capt. James C. Card, who is supervising the cleanup.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the American Trader -- with a concrete patch over two holes in its  hull -- sailed under Coast Guard escort into San Francisco Bay, where it docked  about 3:30 p.m. at Southwest Marine Inc., a shipyard at Pier 70.  </P> <P> The 811-foot ship received a 3-foot by  </P> <P> 5-foot gouge in the bottom of a forward oil storage compartment when it struck  one of its 12.5-foot-long anchors during routine mooring operations on Feb. 7  off Huntington Beach. A second, smaller hole was opened but no additional oil  leaked.  </P> <P> Coast Guard helicopters flew over the tanker as it approached the Golden Gate  Bridge, then a 41-foot cutter picked up the escort and enforced a strict safety  zone around the ship. Two Coast Guard officials boarded the tanker for the  final few miles of its voyage from the Port of Long Beach.  </P> <P> In the days ahead, a 15-foot square piece of hull -- weighing 8,000 pounds --  will be removed and preserved so Coast Guard investigators and others can  inspect the damage to the inch-thick steel plating. Repairs are expected to  take about a week.  </P> <P> Investigators suspect that the tanker punctured its hull by rolling atop its  port anchor while attempting to moor at an underwater oil terminal owned by  Golden West Refining Co. of Santa Fe Springs. The accuracy of navigational  charts has come into question, and authorities are conducting tests to  determine if the waters around the mooring are shallower than indicated.  </P> <P> Back in Orange County, about 35 Coast Guard officers, government officials and  representatives of British Petroleum, which owned the spilled oil, met at  Huntington Beach City Hall on Thursday morning to discuss final cleanup  operations and a timetable for reopening beaches.  </P> <P> In preparation, workers tested sand-cleaning equipment, cleared debris with  rakes and shovels and cordoned off stretches of beach with yellow tape to  identify areas where oil had accumulated under the sand to depths of up to a  foot.  </P> <P> Of concern to cleanup managers and government officials is the discovery of  pockets of buried oil along at least six miles of beach from the Huntington  Beach Municipal Pier south to 18th Street in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Authorities estimate that 500 to 1,000 gallons of oil residue and crust might  have been driven under the sand by last week's heavy rain and pounding surf.  Most of it will have to be removed or sifted from the sand with rakes, shovels,  drag lines or other mechanical devices.  </P> <P> "The whole process of the cleanup's second phase will try to find out where all  of this is," said Charles Webster, a crisis manager for British Petroleum.  "When we are done, we would like to say with a high level of confidence that we  have addressed it and successfully dealt with it."  </P> <P> Between Newland Avenue and the Huntington Beach Municipal Pier, workers made  test runs Thursday morning with two beach-cleaning vehicles that British  Petroleum hopes to get approved by the state for use in the spill area.  </P> <P> One is a tractor-drawn device that scoops up sand, runs it through a filter and  deposits it back on the beach. The other is a disc device that can be used to  overturn the sand and expose oil so it can be broken down by sunlight.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, more than 350 workers, including 100 members of the California  Conservation Corps, took to a 14-mile stretch of beach for a variety of mop-up  procedures. Some crews equipped with low-pressure water hoses scoured patches  of oil that were stuck to jetties in Newport Beach and rocky bluffs at Bolsa  Chica.  </P> <P> Others scooped oil-stained sand from the beach into plastic trash bags. Debris,  including trash and branches, also was removed from the Santa Ana River mouth  on the Newport Beach-Huntington Beach border.  </P> <P> "We are just raking up sticks and stuff, so we can come back over and get the  oil down in the sand," said Les Wilkins, 37, a cleanup worker from Anaheim.  "It's keeping us busy."  </P> <P> One of the most difficult and tedious tasks remained for 64 workers assigned to  the jetties at the Santa Ana River mouth, where quarter-inch-thick black crude  coated the rocks. Workers in yellow slickers dabbed at the oil with absorbent  cloths, while others sprayed it with warm water. The process is expected to  take weeks.  </P> <P> To keep oil sheens from entering the nearby wetlands during the cleanup, crews  were planning to restore the sand dike across the Santa Ana River mouth, which  was washed out last week.  </P> <P> "It's not like a beach, where you have just one surface," explained Rick  Humphrey, an area supervisor for British Petroleum. "You have to reach behind  everything, you have to deal with the tide. Its real time-consuming."  </P> <P> So far, beaches have been reopened from 15th Street in Newport Beach to Newport  Harbor and areas south of the harbor mouth, including stretches of Corona del  Mar such as Pelican Point, Crescent Cove and Treasure Cove.  </P> <P> Officials have placed high priorities on reopening Bolsa Chica State Beach and  certain stretches from the Huntington Beach pier to Newland Avenue in  Huntington Beach. They hope to open those sections within the next few days.  </P> <P> Remaining areas along the 14-mile stretch between the Newport Beach Pier and  rocky bluffs near Bolsa Chica -- some of the hardest to clean -- will be some  of the last reopened.  </P> <P> The decision to reopen some beaches in Huntington Beach will hinge upon tests  by the city to determine the extent of pollution. Those results will be  forwarded to county health authorities, who will decide whether the beaches are  clean enough for public use.  </P> <P> With cleanup operations winding down, federal health and safety officials said  Thursday that, considering the size of the work force mobilized to clean up the  spill, the number of worker injuries has been "minimal."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Mark Stein contributed to this report from San Francisco.

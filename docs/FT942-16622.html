			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Laidlaw earnings tumble to Dollars 17m in second quarter Laidlaw, the Ontario-based waste and passenger services group, blamed the Los Angeles earthquake, harsh winter weather and regulatory problems at its flagship hazardous waste dump for a 40 per cent drop in earnings in its second quarter. Net income fell to USDollars 17m, or 6 cents a share, in the three months to February 28, from Dollars 28.1m, or 10 cents, a year earlier. Revenues climbed to Dollars 520.4m from Dollars 469m. Laidlaw's results no longer include any contribution from its 24 per cent stake in ADT, the international security and vehicle auction group. The Canadian company began distancing itself from ADT last January through an issue of debentures which it can redeem with its ADT shares. Income from Attwoods, the UK-based waste management company in which Laidlaw has a 35 per cent stake, fell to less than Dollars 1m from Dollars 4.3m, due to a previously-announced special charge. Mr Jim Bullock, chief executive, expressed disappointment with the results, but predicted an improvement for the rest of the year, due to the strengthening US economy and to a flurry of acquisitions of US ambulance operators. The move into ambulance services is expected to contribute Dollars 125m to fiscal 1994 revenues. Disruptions to school-bus services caused by the California earthquake and the severe winter are estimated to have sliced Dollars 12m off quarterly revenues. Passenger service margins narrowed to 7.5 per cent from 13.2 per cent a year ago. But about half the operating income lost to bad weather and the earthquake is expected to be recovered later in the year. Operating income from solid-waste services grew to Dollars 17.9m from Dollars 13.4m, while margins improved to 10.2 per cent from 7.6 per cent. Hazardous waste earnings dipped, however, to Dollars 8.8m from Dollars 11m, with margins narrowing to 7 per cent from 9.6 per cent. The fall was due mainly to the continuing absence of any contribution from the big hazardous waste landfill at Pinewood, South Carolina. Earnings for the first half were Dollars 55m, or 20 cents a share, down from Dollars 77m, or 28 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.07bn, up from Dollars 981.9m.</p>

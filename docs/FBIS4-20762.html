			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Muhammad Jamal 'Itabi from Jeddah: "17 </F> Industrial Investment Opportunities Worth $490 Million in Saudi  Arabia"]    [Text] The gross investment that is needed for 17 new  opportunities for industrial production that are being offered  in Saudi Arabia is nearly $490 million. The Gulf Organization  for Industrial Investments has offered these 17 opportunities in  cooperation with the Saudi Ministry of Industry and Electricity  and the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Industry.    The list of proposed projects includes a project for the  production of heat-formed steel blocks, with a gross investment  (not counting land) of 888.9 million Saudi riyals [R] ($236.3  million), with R822.4 million ($219.6 million) needed for  machinery and assembly, R37.4 million ($10 million) in  pre-production costs, and working capital amounting to R25.1  million ($6.7 million), with a construction period of 30 months.    The project's profitability is estimated at a 22-percent  average private return, 34-percent average private return on  invested capital (for easy loans) and net present value (at an  average 10-percent discount) of R861 million, or $230 million;  an annual return on investment of 30 percent, an operating  margin of 45 percent, annual operating profit of R219 million  ($58.5 million), and annual cash flow of R267.4 million ($71.4  million). One million tons of steel blocks would be produced per  year, on three daily shifts, over 330 days, which is the number  of days of annual operation. Products would be sold in  international markets, especially the Far East, Europe, America,  and Canada, noting that the size of the local market is expected  to reach 3 million tons by the year 2000, with export market  volume to reach 100 million tons by the same year.    Another project will produce 200,000 tons of iron rolls.  These would include finished elongated rolls, reinforced beams,  and light sections, with gross investment (not counting land) of  R353.2 million ($94.3 million), of which R265.7 million ($71  million) is for machinery and assembly, R51.1 million ($4  million) for buildings and civil installations, and R45.9  million ($12.2 million) for pre-production costs.    Working capital is R26.5 million ($7.1 million), with  construction time of 20 months, with project profitability of  22-percent average private return, 26-percent average private  return on invested capital (in case of loan), and net present  value (at an average 10-percent discount) of R285 million ($76.1  million), 25- to 29-percent annual return on investment,  29-percent operating margin, R74.9 million ($20 million) annual  operating profits, and R102.8 million ($27.5 million) in cash  flow.    The project study defined the geographic marketing area as  the Western Province of Saudi Arabia, which represents 95  percent of sales, with 5 percent of sales for export markets on  the basis of an estimate of the Western Province's market volume  of more than 1 million tons per year. The proposed opportunities  also include a project to produce  acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene or ABS products, for the  manufacture of high-quality and specialized products. Production  would be about 30,000 tons per year: 10,000 tons of commercial  products per year and 20,000 tons per year of specialized  commercial products. Gross investments (not counting land)  would be almost R261 million ($69.7 million), of which R222.5  million ($59.4 million) would be for machinery and assembly,  with a working capital of nearly R16.8 million ($4.5 million).  Pre-production costs are R21.7 million ($5.8 million), with a  construction period of 24 months.    The sale price per ton would be R5,868 ($1,567) per  factory-delivered ton. Marketing operations would include the  GCC states, which represent 63 percent of sales, with 37 percent  going to international markets. The volume of the Gulf markets  in this area was an annual 24,000 tons in 1991.    The other 14 projects include a project to produce  high-efficiency dehumidifier units, with a gross investment  (excluding land) of nearly R9.98 million ($2.67 million); a  project for electric engine insulators, with a gross investment  of nearly R1.02 million ($275,000); a project for polystyrene  sheets for packaging and wrapping "tabak" [tobacco; as  transliterated] at a cost of almost R2.03 million ($540,000); a  project for the press-method manufacture of stainless steel  products, costing $16.4 million; a project for the manufacture  of steel castings products, with a gross investment cost  (excluding land) of almost R74.1 million ($12.5 million). The  list also includes a project producing plastic pellets for  health use with a gross investment of nearly R28.5 million ($7.6  million); a project to produce a rubber compound for covering  the floors of flatbed trucks, with a gross investment of R21.7  million ($5.8 million); a project producing paper pulp and paper  from palm trees at a total cost of nearly R67.4 million ($18  million); a project to produce synthetic diamonds for industrial  uses, with an investment of R35.23 million ($9.41 million); a  project for reinforced concrete bricks with a gross investment  (excluding land) of 15.3 million ($4.1 million); a project to  conform light aluminum products, with a gross investment of  R11.32 million ($3.02 million); a project to produce flexible  enamel-coated copper wire with a gross investment of nearly R4  million ($1.1 million); and a project to produce products  extracted from used motor oils with a gross investment  (excluding land) of R28.7 million ($7.7 million). The final  project produces complete sets for computer cleaning, with a  gross investment (excluding land) of R2.14 million ($570,000).</p>

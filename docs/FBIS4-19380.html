			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Messages Abound in Sunday's </F> Demonstrations"]    [Text] Ankara--As the public mulls over the significance of  the weekend demonstrations by an angry pro-Islamic and  ultranationalist coalition of forces--angry in this case at the  Bosnian Serbs' unopposed entry into Gorazde--analysts and  diplomats in Ankara were busy on Monday [11 April] trying to  decipher the messages in this development which carried  disturbing implications.    The targets chosen by thousands of rampaging demonstrators  chanting religious and nationalist slogans and demonstrating a  clear inclination to go out of hand, if a convergence of certain  events took place, merely added to the importance of trying to  understand what had happened and what may follow in its wake.  In Ankara the main targets were the United Nations  building--which was pelted with rocks and forced to take down  its flag to appease the crowds--the U.S. embassy--whose grounds  were entered and windows smashed--and the Russian trade mission  which was also showered with rocks.    These were attacked alongside "domestic targets" such as the  state owned Turkish Radio and Television's (TRT) building, and  the headquarters of the ruling True Path Party (DYP) with both  also having their windows smashed.    Apart from the attacks on the TRT, the privately owned media  was also showered with abuse and its reporters and cameramen  jostled and kicked.    At one point during the demonstration in Ankara there was  also serious concern that the crowd might also turn against the  Parliament grounds, which are in the same vicinity of all the  other targets attacked.    All of these targets were significant and indicative of the  ultimate political inclination of those partaking in the  demonstrations and who and what they stood opposed to when the  chips are down.    These demonstrators were not only attacking one of Turkey's  closest allies, together with an international institution  which, for all its shortcomings, Turkey continues to be a  staunch supporter of. At moments it appeared that they would  also turn against the key institutions of what is integral to  Turkey's secular and pluralist system.    The fact that the demonstrations in Ankara and Istanbul were  attended by thousands of people carrying religious banners and  shouting angrily with fists in the air had automatically  increased the explosive nature of the situation at hand.  Officials were saying later that while everything ended with  just a few smashed windows this was not due to the police but in  fact a matter of luck. Especially when the police in both Ankara  and Istanbul were clearly taken by surprise, totally outnumbered  and in effect unable to control the crowd numbering thousands up  to 10,000 in Ankara and 20,000 in Istanbul. The sigh of relief  among officials later was also coloured by the fact that the  Marines in the U.S. embassy compound, a part of which had been  overrun by the demonstrators, did not make any move that would  have sparked off something which would be extremely difficult to  control and clear up later.    In fact the speed with which the Turkish public later got  news of the NATO airstrikes against Serbian targets in Gorazde  suggested close cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey in order  to diffuse the situation.    Giving the news before CNN and all the other international  agencies TRT said in its 8.00 pm bulletin that the information  had come from Turkish military sources who in turn were quoting  NATO sources.    Given that the planes in the operation against the Serb  targets were U.S. the assumption in Ankara was that this quick  transfer of information was the product of the two sides working  to ensure things did not get out of hand in Turkey especially  vis a vis the U.S. embassy and other western targets. The mood  in the Turkish Foreign Ministry following these events was  inevitably gloomy given that developments and images carrying  overtones of Iran in 1979 had gone out of the two main cities of  Turkey whose pride and joy is its secular system. Trying to  play down in Western capitals the RP's [Welfare Party] success,  Sunday's developments were precisely the kind of thing that  Ankara has been keen to avoid.    What the crowds in Ankara and Istanbul, as well as other  cities around Turkey, were incensed at was reports that Bosnian  Serbs had entered Gorazde which they had been bombing since  March 29.    Rumour was spread that the Serbs were using chemical  weapons and killing of thousands of Bosnian Moslems as they  progressed into Gorazde.    When the news of this was disseminated in a provoking manner  by two private TV channels, and when officials--including Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller and State Minister and Government  Spokesman Yildirim Aktuna gave statements suggesting the  information was true--the crowd could not be contained,  believing as it did that thousands of their Bosnian brethren  were being mercilessly slaughtered at that very moment. Charged  with the fervour of the gains by the RP and the ultranationalist  Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) in the local election, the  crowd--mostly supporters of these parties--turned their ire to  "the Christian West, which refuses to act while Moslems are  being slaughtered," and it institutions, such as the U.N. as  well as its extensions in Turkey such as the TRT and the DYP.    Most analysts believe that this whole incident has proved to  be "an excellent object lesson" to government officials in  Turkey about when to speak and when not to speak on occasions  that touch on public sensitivities.    It was noteworthy that while Ciller and Aktuna appeared to  be  "playing to the gallery," that foreign minister Hikmet Cetin was  indicating there was no evidence that chemical weapons had been  used, that he had checked this, not just with U.N. and NATO  sources, by also the Bosnian Prime Minister in Sarajevo which is  only 65 kilometers from Gorazde.    The bottom line was that while tension reached fever pitch  as  these rumors were being spread neither Ciller nor Aktuna had  bothered to check with the foreign ministry as to what the  situation really was in Gorazde.    Ciller's critics say that having turned her visit to  Sarajevo  in February, together with the Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto, into political capital prior to the local elections, she  is still captivated by the issue which makes her give statements  that are not absolutely sound.    But there is also a message here for Bosnian Muslim  officials  whose attempt at drawing attention to atrocities by introducing  unconfirmed elements into their account of events--in order to  add a heightened sense of urgency--has clearly been seen to be  explosive in Turkey's case.    Given the heightened sensitivities in Turkey following the  self-confidence gained by the pro-Islamic and ultranationalists  after their electoral gains this element in Turkish society is  seeking missionary outlets to vent its new found strength.  Bosnia has proved itself to be an important galvanizing factor  in this case, making it incumbent not just on Turkish officials,  but also Bosnian officials to act cautiously and responsibly in  volatile circumstances such as the one surrounding Gorazde.    The presence of an official from the Bosnian Embassy trying  to calm the angry crowds down in Ankara as they tried to storm  the U.S. Embassy appeared to demonstrate that even the Bosnians  were disturbed by the "political Frankenstein" that had been  released into the streets of Turkey.    The main message of what transpired in Istanbul and Ankara,  as well as other cities in the country, on Sunday is of course  to the key countries in the West.    These events have signalled the extent to which the Islamic  masses around the world are being pushed to taking a specific  view of the West, and all that is associated with it, because of  what appears to be Western indifference to the slaughter of  Moslems in places such as Bosnia-Herzegovina.    If the U.N. and the main countries in the Security Council  had acted decisively days before against the Serbs when they  first attacked Gorazde, which is supposedly a U.N. safe haven,  the chances are Sunday's scenes from around Turkey would not  have taken place. This lack of overall determination to say a  definite stop to the Serbs is today sowing the seeds for  hundreds of thousands of Mujahedeen.    If these ever "hit the streets" charged as they will with an  irrepressible feeling of vengeance, then the West is going to  suffer as much as countries like Turkey--whatever its broader  plans and calculations may be.</p>

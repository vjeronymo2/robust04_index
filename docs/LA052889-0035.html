			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: A RETURN TO EARLY '88 RATE LEVELS IS UNLIKELY SOON  </P> <P> Interest rates have come down during the past few weeks but are still nowhere  near as low as they were just a year ago. And here are half a dozen reasons  rates won't go back to early 1988 levels very soon:  </P> <P> 1. Even if inflation is under control, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan  Greenspan is not the type to dramatically reverse direction on monetary policy.  "By his very nature, Greenspan is not inclined to lurching," says Peter Rona,  head of IBJ Schroder Bank &amp; Trust, a unit of Industrial Bank of Japan. Rona  believes that if Greenspan decides to ease up on his yearlong tight-money  policy, he'll do it "in small doses." It was the Fed's tight monetary policy,  of course, that drove interest rates higher in the first place and is keeping  them there.  </P> <P> 2. Interest rates won't come down sharply because inflation isn't under  control, especially not worldwide. Prices are rising at levels that are  unacceptable to the West Germans, Japanese, British and other important trading  partners, so there is intense pressure from abroad to keep interest rates high.  During the past few weeks, experts here have been arguing that the United  States' inflation scare is over. But not everyone -- especially not the Federal  Reserve -- seems convinced of that.  </P> <P> "Inflation will remain high in the months ahead," says William Sullivan,  director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds, who estimates that  consumer prices will be up at an annual rate of 5% to 6% during the next three  months. "There is some evidence that the core inflation rate may be picking  up," Sullivan adds.  </P> <P> Inflation at the producer level in this country has been running at an 8.4%  rate during the past few months, while prices on the consumer level are moving  up at a 6.6% yearly rate.  </P> <P> Just last week, the government reported that orders for durable goods, or big  ticket items, rose a larger-than-expected 2.9% in April. If durable goods  growth of that magnitude continues, or if other financial data confirms that  the economy is still very strong, fears of inflation will return before long.  </P> <P> 3. Interest rates won't come down quickly or sharply because the Fed is saying  things, and more important doing things, that indicate it is not ready to ease  monetary policy. On the same day last week that the Wall Street Journal was  quoting government sources as saying "some Fed officials have begun to consider  easing credit to stem the dollar's surge," the central bank was draining  reserves from the monetary system. That move, which keeps pressure on interest  rates, anchored the federal funds rate at a lofty 9.75%. The recent peak for  that rate was a tad higher at 9.875% a little more than a month ago.  </P> <P> "The Fed is standing still right now," says Francis Schott, chief economist at  Equitable Life. "The Fed's aim is not to ease prematurely. Its action this week  reflects a policy stance that in all likelihood was defined at the Open Market  Committee meeting earlier this month."  </P> <P> Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson also said last week that the central bank's  main concern is domestic inflation, although he also commented that recent  inflation data "looks encouraging." Johnson added that when the Fed sees the  inflation situation getting better, it might ease up.  </P> <P> That's true. But are "encouraging" hints on inflation enough to prompt lower  interest rates? The experts don't think the Fed is going to risk going back to  square one on inflation just because of a few "encouraging" economic figures.  </P> <P> 4. Interest rates won't come down sharply until there are sure signs that the  U.S. economy is slipping into a recession. Only under a recession threat will  the Fed risk pulling rates down quickly. "The economy doesn't appear to be in  any danger of falling into a recession," says David Resler, chief economist at  Nomura Securities.  </P> <P> 5. And the Fed will not drag interest rates down simply to get the dollar under  control, as much as some White House officials may want it to. "The dollar  ranks fourth, maybe third, in the Fed's policy parameters," says Kim Ruppert, a  Fed watcher for MMS International, a consulting firm.  </P> <P> Ahead of the dollar on the Fed's list of worries, Ruppert says, are inflation,  the strength of the economy and money supply growth. "I don't look for a major  change in interest rates," she says.  </P> <P> 6. Even if the Fed does loosen, it will be awhile before banks pass their  savings on to borrowers.  </P> <P> Financial markets, of course, take heart whenever there is even the slightest  sign that interest rates are declining. But if you are someone who doesn't care  about the financial markets and just wants to borrow some money at a better  rate, you might have a long wait.  </P> <P> Even if underlying interest rates come down, banks will be slow passing on the  lower rate to borrowers. Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co., says that  even though banks would be justified in lowering their prime lending rate, it  won't happen soon. "Banks have been under pressure and they will try to keep  their profit margins up for as long as possible," says Sinai, who adds that  sizable drops in rates won't be seen until much later this year.  </P> <P> There may be one temporary exception. Robert Heady of Bank Rate Monitor says 10  of the nation's top 100 banks reduced the rate on their 30-year fixed-rate  mortgages below 10% last week.  </P> <P> Heady says this was partly in response to the banks' lower borrowing cost, but  mostly because demand is very slow for mortgage loans. Heady thinks that this  trend will be reversed just as soon as demand picks up.  </P> <P> "There's blood in the street. It's a disaster."  </P> <P> No, this guy isn't talking about the post-election situation in Panama or even  describing a typical day in Central Park. He's a stock trader who dabbles in  speculative takeover issues, and he's talking about the state of his business  recently.  </P> <P> "It's a gut-wrenching game. You'd better be prepared to lose 25%," he warned  small investors who might want to play what on Wall Street is sometimes known  as rumortrage. (Translated, rumortrage is betting on rumored deals that haven't  been announced and may never be.)  </P> <P> As predicted, there haven't been many takeovers announced lately. Investment  banking sources have been saying high stock prices and hefty interest rates  have kept American companies from making acquisitions, with foreign companies'  chances of making a good buy hurt by the soaring dollar. To make matters worse  for speculators, some of the takeover situations they thought were the most  promising have disappointed them tremendously of late. McGraw-Hill, for  instance, destroyed one of the longest-lasting rumors when it got British  investor Robert Maxwell to sign a standstill agreement. That means Maxwell, who  probably wasn't going to bother the publishing company anyway, really won't be  bothering it now.  </P> <P> And Amway didn't follow through with its takeover bid for Avon Products.  Nothing further has developed at Honeywell, which lost a proxy battle earlier  this month. Cray Research opted for a restructuring that hurt its stock price.  And Sea Containers, another durable takeover rumor, hasn't panned out.  </P> <P> "It's the day of reckoning for speculators," says my friend the trader, who  sees some irony in the fact that investors in the bluest blue chip stocks, such  as General Electric, have been doing just fine while he has been playing  rumortrage roulette.  </P> <P> Outplacement specialist Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas says 20% of all  upper-level executives are performing 1 1/2 to two jobs. That may be why the  median job tenure for those executives who quit in the first quarter was 8.75  years, the lowest figure in seven consecutive quarters.  </P></p>

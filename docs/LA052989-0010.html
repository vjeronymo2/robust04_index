			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Soviet soldiers planned to massacre people during a pro-independence rally  April 9 in the Georgian republic and used clubs to beat the injured and the  elderly, an official report said. The report, issued by a Georgian commission  that looked into the clash that left at least 20 dead, was circulated among  deputies to the new Congress of People's Deputies, which met in Moscow over the  weekend. The report said soldiers "blocked crossings, surrounded citizens and  beat them with clubs and shovels. They did not spare hunger strikers, girls,  old women, doctors and Red Cross workers."  </P></p>

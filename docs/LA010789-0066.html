			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAPPOINTMENT OF WATER BOARD CHIEF OPPOSED  </P> <P> Angry water distributors in the San Joaquin Valley and urban Southern  California are campaigning against the reappointment of W. Don Maughan as  chairman of the state Water Resources Control Board.  </P> <P> The opposition to Maughan stems from a proposal made by the water board staff  Nov. 3 to set aside more water in the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers for  preservation of fisheries and to put a cap on future shipments of Northern  California water to the south.  </P> <P> It has drawn fierce protests from the southern half of the state, and the  question of whether Maughan should be reappointed has become a focal point for  the anger, even though the board has not yet taken a position on the staff  proposal.  </P> <P> "There are attorneys and water district managers up and down the state who  figure the governor has a real problem," said Jason Peltier, managing director  of the Central Valley Water Project Assn. "To say they're upset is an  understatement. Outraged is more like it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Support  </P> <P> However, there is no support for Maughan from those environmentalists who  believe the water board staff did not go nearly far enough in curbing water  shipments to the south and saving water for the north.  </P> <P> "We are not that happy with the standards ourselves," said David Fullerton,  spokesman for the Committee for Water Policy Consensus, in which most San  Francisco environmental groups are represented. "We don't consider Don Maughan  to be particularly on our side."  </P> <P> The powerful five-member board has the final say -- short of the Legislature  and the courts -- on California water rights questions. The terms of Maughan  and another member, Elisio Samaniego of Visalia, expire Jan. 15. All board  members are appointed by the governor.  </P> <P> So far, there has been no indication from Gov. George Deukmejian's office  whether either will be reappointed. Urban and agricultural water interests in  the southern half of the state have expressed no opposition to Samaniego.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stay on Job  </P> <P> When terms of water board members have expired in the past, it has been  customary for the governor to ask them to stay on the job until a decision is  made on filling the job.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: PARAMOUNT;  </P> <P> 9-HOME TRACT APPROVED WITH EQUESTRIAN ZONING  </P> <P> Construction is expected to start in about six months on nine single-family  homes with horse corrals in Paramount's only residential area zoned for  equestrian use.  </P> <P> Last month, the City Council unanimously approved a zoning amendment for  keeping horses in the area.  </P> <P> Developer Michael Fierro of Hollydale is proposing to build the homes on 2 1/2  acres of vacant land on the south side of Century Boulevard between Orange  Avenue and the Los Angeles River.  </P> <P> Under the new regulations, each home can have no more than four horses and the  horse stalls must have direct access to the county bridle trail along the  river. Corrals must also be at least 40 feet from the homes. Homeowners are  allowed to board animals belonging only to them.  </P> <P> In the mid-1980s, protests from residents stopped a developer's proposal to  construct apartments on the land, said Pat West, deputy city manager. There has  been no protest on the latest proposal.  </P></p>

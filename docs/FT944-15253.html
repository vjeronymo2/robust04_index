			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Emap expands magazine distribution Emap, the publishing and exhibitions group, is expanding its presence in the magazine distribution market in the UK through a joint venture with Hachette Distribution Services. Hachette is forming a 50-50 joint venture with Frontline, a consortium in which Emap is the majority shareholder. The other Frontline shareholders are the BBC and Haymarket. Frontline, founded by Emap, is devoted to the distribution and trade marketing of magazines produced by its three owners and that will continue. The new distribution company, called Seymour, will be aimed at 'third party business' - distributing magazines for other organisations under contract. Emap already has close links with Hachette. They publish jointly three former Murdoch titles, Elle, Elle Decoration and Sky. The existing Seymour company has 4 per cent of the magazine distribution market in the UK by retail value, compared with Frontline's 19 per cent. Seymour already distributes magazines such as Time International, The Spectator, National Geographic and Investors Chronicle. Mr Geoff Stott, Frontline's chief executive, will also become chairman of Seymour and Mr Lloyd Wigglesworth becomes managing director of Frontline.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Economic Viewpoint: 'Advice given to ministers . . .' An essay entitled 'Some reflections on the (UK) Treasury' * by that department's permanent secretary, Sir Terence Burns, is a timely confrontation with its critics. This is so despite the tendency to argue both (a) that the critics are misguided, and (b) that their criticisms have already been taken on board. Inevitably parts look as if they have been put together from pages supplied by different divisions. But the key sections bear Sir Terence's personal imprint. He scores a number of direct hits. For instance: 'The demand for greater independence of the central bank has come to be the most popular single answer to the problem of inflation that was once reserved for the exchange rate mechanism.' He might have added that similar enthusiasm had been shown only slightly earlier for floating exchange rates and monetary targets. But should not Sir Terence come clean on where he himself has stood and now stands on such matters? His stated complaint, however, is that less than one-fifth of the Treasury's resources goes into the design and execution of macro-economic policy; yet nearly all the public attention focuses on this area. He is also amazed at the importance attached to forecasts. For, as he says: 'The margins of error are well-documented and substantial. Unfortunately there is little sign of improvement despite significant technical and analytical developments.' He complains that the 'other 1,400 people in the central Treasury suffer the frustration of seeing their efforts judged by the forecasts of 30 or so economists - and even for those economists the forecasts are only one aspect of their performance.' Methinks he doth protest too much. Whether the macro-economic side of the Treasury is regarded as the head or the tail, it undoubtedly wags the dog. For it is on its doctrines and forecasts that the detailed work of the other sections hinge. At present that work is governed by the forecast of a Pounds 50bn public sector requirement this year, only running down to Pounds 30bn in 1997-98. But how much the budget deficit matters, and over what timescale, if at all, it needs to be eliminated, is very much a matter of doctrine, theory - call it what you like. Despite Sir Terence's eyebrow-raising over forecasts, the Treasury feels more at home with numerical projections than with economic ideas, which it likes to think are provided by ministers and their mysterious outside friends. Although there will always be a few highly technical papers, drawing on the academic literature, floating around the Treasury on particular matters, there is still a tendency to regard straightforward discussions of ideas as so much hot air, and for the inescapable theoretical presuppositions to be breathed in rather than explicitly discussed. If the Treasury really wanted to downplay forecasts, why, for instance, did it appoint a seven-person Panel of Independent Forecasters instead of a Council of Economic Advisers with a proper secretariat to analyse the conditions for a sustainable recovery? No doubt the on-the-record answer is that such decisions are taken by chancellors and that any advice given by officials is on a par with the secrets of the confessional, not to be revealed on pain of death. I have difficulty in convincing some of my newer colleagues that when 'Terry Burns', as he then was, joined the Treasury as chief economic adviser in 1980, at the tender age of 35, he was regarded as a new broom from outside, chosen because he was sceptical of the then-prevailing orthodoxy centring around incomes policy and demand management in real terms. I was not merely an enthusiastic supporter, but tried to help by 'forecasting' his appointment. Now, however, when the successive and rival variants of the new orthodoxy, such as the medium-term financial strategy and, subsequently, the exchange rate mechanism, came unstuck, he should have been prepared to discuss openly the new mistakes - as the politicians and journalists who backed the new approach had to do - rather than retreat into reactionary incantations about the confidentiality of advice given by civil servants to ministers. This supposed Ark of the Covenant had already become an ironical incantation when I was writing a book on the Treasury in the 1960s. The then-Treasury permanent secretary, Sir William Armstrong, would urge me in the evenings to see former Tory ministers, who were not then in the habit of writing books, and he would even contribute some strong indiscretions of his own; but in the mornings he would lecture me about the confidentiality of advice. I made the mistake of letting Armstrong have a copy of my manuscript. This was promptly handed over to Reginald Maudling, the then chancellor. At a lunch paid for by The Observer (for which I was then working), Maudling came as near to reading the Riot Act to me as that clever but laid-back politician had it in his nature to do. A future Treasury minister remarked to me how lucky I was that I had not had to face threats and bluster from someone like Lord Hailsham. There was an interesting sequel. When the next edition appeared, Maudling - by then in opposition - wrote a friendly and favourable review in The Spectator. Without any Sir Humphrey at his heels, he made no mention of the confidentiality of advice and said that for events of which he had personal knowledge the book was remarkably accurate. Burns, then a rising economist at the London Business School, was delighted to lap up all the investigative journalism he could find. The official defence of ultra-confidentiality has not changed in all those years. Even the olive branches about revealing more of the background thinking to parliamentary committees were offered three decades ago. It is still said that officials will not give good and frank advice if it is to be disclosed. One could as easily argue the opposite: that advice will be better if those giving it know that they will have to defend it. The quality of Fed deliberations does not seem to suffer from public-ation of the minutes of the Open Market Committee six weeks after it has taken place. But surely private sector organisations do not deliberate in public? The big difference is that profit-making companies are held accountable by the famous bottom line. (Even so, it might have been in the public interest if more had been known about how the clearing banks had taken their credit decisions.) The bottom line in Whitehall is the sacking, resignation or electoral defeat of the ministers who receive the advice. Nor can I attach the same importance as permanent secretaries do to the same officials advising politicians of all parties and all hues. Some officials used to boast how they had prepared bills both to nationalise and denationalise steel with equal zest. That was in the days when Oxford-type economists used to teach that ownership was of supreme irrelevance. Even then, I found such boasting a little nauseating. What is wrong with many large organisations, and the British government in particular, is that everyone is responsible for everything and no one is responsible for anything in particular. My main reason for supporting an independent central bank is not that it would have the magic power to maintain low inflation painlessly. It is that one set of people would be clearly accountable for monetary policy. Similarly, if officials were accountable for advice to ministers - which they would not have to pretend was unanimous - outsiders would be able to judge how far what had gone wrong was due to politicians not taking that advice and how far it was because that advice was itself wrong. Such specific allocation of responsibilities would not produce the millennium, but at least the air would smell fresher. *To appear in a book of essays in honour of Sir James Ball's 60th birthday, to be published this autumn by Edward Elgar</p>

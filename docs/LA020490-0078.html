			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHBISHOP ROGER MAHONY  </P> <P> May I express my indignation? Allegedly Bill Kenkelen, West Coast correspondent  for the liberal National Catholic Reporter said that Mahony is "a church  political animal."  </P> <P> Further: "He was liberal in the '60s, when it was profitable to be liberal. And  now under this Pope, it's advantageous to be conservative."  </P> <P> I do not know who Kenkelen is, but I am sure that he is a not-well-educated  Catholic. He should know that there are basic doctrines in the Catholic faith  that do not depend on who the Pope is. Another quotation, from Father Thomas  Reese, that "bishops are not liberal Democrats -- they are coming out of a  Christian perspective" is the right judgment in this question.  </P> <P> STEPHEN J. FELSZEGHY, Los Angeles  </P></p>

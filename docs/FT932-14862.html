			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Letter: Accomplices to Bosnia massacre Sir, At last a leading political figure has come out publicly saying what many of us feel ('Thatcher attacks Hurd on Bosnia', April 14). Since the Bosnian crisis began, more than a year ago, we have seen a totally pusillanimous lack of response from this government - one excuse after another to do nothing. Yet to do nothing in the face of the daily overwhelming evidence of genocide is to be accomplices to this massacre. To deny people the means to defend themselves is utterly unbelievable. We have the means to do much, yet we do virtually nothing - and absolutely nothing that works. Picking up the wounded, maimed and tortured people of Bosnia after the Serbs have done their worst is not an adequate response. We have a moral duty to do more, much more. Seldom can there have been such a blindingly obvious case of right and wrong. What has this government done? We have a silence from John Major, a vacuous smile that echoes his total lack of policy across the board and will in this matter. And we have a foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, whose utterances are truly disgusting, and a 'defence' secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, who sees scoring debating points as a substitute for action.

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Goodwood switches to horsepower: A new motor racing festival plans to bring back a bygone elegance 'Glorious Goodwood', the cliche title of one of the main events on the horse racing calendar, is acquiring a double meaning for Goodwood Company Estate, the family-run company which controls commercial activities on the Duke of Richmond and Gordon's 12,000 acres of West Sussex. This weekend the Duke's heir Charles, Earl of March and Kinrara, is turning the estate over to motor sport, for which it was once as famous as Silverstone in Northamptonshire is now. The 'festival of speed' includes an auction of racing and classic cars, with the international classic car market looking for a turnaround in prices, which have slumped since 1989. The festival also includes a hill-climb intended to recreate the elegant social atmosphere of early post-war motorsport - 'racing's equivalent of Ascot or Henley' - according to Mr Robert Brooks, the Brooks auction house principal helping to organise it. A hundred and thirty cars will race against the clock near Goodwood House. The estate is poised for a more ambitious project - to bring back competition to the nearby Goodwood motor racing circuit. The circuit, which also contains an airfield, is used for testing and high-speed driving courses. The Pounds 5m project, which includes a new museum of motor racing, will create 300 jobs and provide an economic stimulus in this mainly rural corner of southern England. The proposals have met with some protests, mainly from a private housing development near the circuit. In response, the number of proposed race days has been cut and Glasgow-based Acoustic Services is to install acoustic barriers around the circuit to prevent excess noise spilling into the countryside. The plans have won provisional approval from Chichester's environmental health committee and the formal planning application was submitted two weeks ago. Goodwood Aerodrome and Motor Circuit, an estate company subsidiary, has proposed three motor racing meetings a year, starting in 1996, featuring Aston Martins, Le Mans Jaguars, Ferraris and other historic cars mainly owned and driven by wealthy enthusiasts. At least 25,000 people are expected at this weekend's festival, which is expected to involve the most valuable collection of classic and modern racing cars to compete in a single motorsport event. Several dozen of the 130 competing cars have previously been sold for more than Pounds 1m. A pointer to what many might be worth now is expected tonight when one of the world's most famous racing cars - the 1957 Aston Martin DBR2/1 driven at Le Mans by Stirling Moss - goes under the hammer. It is expected that prices of the nearly 100 cars being auctioned will reflect a cautious strengthening since the spring. Stirling Moss, whose own career was cut short in a 140mph crash at Goodwood, will be one of the celebrities driving in the event, as well as McLaren grand prix team owner Ron Dennis, and entertainer Rowan Atkinson. The festival will mark the 100th anniversary of competitive motor sport. Competing cars flown in from around the world range from a 1894 Peugeot Vis-a-Vis, to the latest grand prix cars.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Relocation move means double taxation Sir, The Treasury will have surpassed itself with the efficiency of impending legislation which will not only raise a tax, but also a tax on a tax. This is the inevitable result of the only option left to major companies relocating employees after the government's proposed new tax on relocation expenses is implemented. Responsible companies pay only the expenses necessary to achieve a rapid relocation, the employee not being out of pocket. Typically, the cost of this (including agent's fees, solicitor's fees, duty charges, bridging costs, etc) is more than double the Pounds 8,000 non-taxable limit suggested by the chancellor in March. From August the employee will be required to pay tax on expenses in excess of this limit. In reality the employer will pay the employee an additional amount sufficient to meet both the cost of the tax and the tax on the additional amount. The net result? Companies are doubly taxed on a necessary expense. Expanding, multi-location companies are disproportionately penalised. Is this really the most appropriate way to increase government income?

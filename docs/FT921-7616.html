			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Surprise at Thai Airways price tag - The airline's plans to sell a tranche of shares THAI Airways International, the state-owned airline run by senior air force officers, has announced plans to offer a first tranche of shares to the public between March 16 and 27, giving new life to the long-running controversy over Thai's management and profitability. Thailand is selling 95m shares, or about 7 per cent of the company, at Bt60 each, valuing the airline at Bt82.62bn (Dollars 3.2bn). A further 5m shares will go to Thai's employees at the par value of Bt10. The shares, already listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) but 99 per cent held by the Finance Ministry, are due to begin trading on May 20. Details of the offer have yet to be finalised, but the airline has drawn up plans to sell 40m shares to some 200,000 small investors through commercial banks, and a series of 'roadshows' will be launched next month to publicise the stock offer. A further 15m shares will be set aside for foreign financial institutions buying through brokers in Thailand, with the rest reserved for Thai institutions and securities companies. As is so often with initial public offerings in Thailand, brokers are in a dilemma. They have grave doubts about Thai's profitability and have expressed surprise at the Bt60 price. It gives a prospective 1992 price/earnings ratio of 16.2, which looks expensive alongside the much lower p/e ratios of better-run competitors such as Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines. But the brokers are also aware that Thai will account for such a large share of the SET index that it will be difficult for institutional investors to ignore, and they know that local punters have a habit of driving up the price of shares on the grey market and in the first days of trading. 'There's going to be fist-fights,' said one broker, assuming that shares to small investors would be sold on a first-come, first-served basis, 'but fist-fights push up prices in the grey market.' Critics in Thailand say the airline is poorly managed by the air force officers who have made it their fiefdom. Travellers complain of delayed or cancelled flights, and Thai has been accused of deliberately neglecting profitable routes to IndoChina for the benefit of 'rival' local airlines with links to the military. There are doubts as to whether it is receiving cost-effective services from all its suppliers. Thai's first-quarter results for the 1991-92 financial year were disappointing, casting doubt on the company's rosy projections for the three years to 1994, and last year's Bt5.09bn pre-tax profit was massaged ahead of the share flotation by the inclusion of more than Bt2bn from the sale of four Airbuses which were promptly leased back. Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, Thai's chairman and the head of the air force, rejects criticism of the high p/e ratio implicit in the offer price. 'Thai's huge assets and its goodwill should be taken into account,' he said. 'Moreover, Thai is a state enterprise which has backing from the Thai government.' More pertinent for foreign investors is the fact that Thai's less-than-sparkling management record gives it the sort of scope for improvement not available to its competitors in Singapore and Hong Kong. 'It has tremendous upside potential,' said one broker. 'There is great room for margin appreciation.' Bangkok has the advantage of a substantial domestic and regional hinterland in a fast-growing market, and its profits could probably be rapidly increased by eliminating corruption, cutting unprofitable domestic routes or raising prices on them, and by negotiating the regional traffic rights which are its due. It is not yet clear if Thai will be able to grasp the opportunities at hand. The Finance Ministry is said to be anxious to proceed with the offer of the first 100m shares before a new - and possibly corrupt - government takes over following the March 22 elections, and a further 200m shares are expected to follow within months. Even then, nearly four-fifths of the company will be in government hands. Serious investors will hope the trading of Thai shares on the SET and the need for foreign financing will make the airline's accounts more transparent and its management more answerable to the needs of shareholders. But, in the short term, the speculators will hold sway. As one broker put it: 'We see very little fundamental justification to invest in Thai. But so what? Clients should buy every share that comes their way.'</p>

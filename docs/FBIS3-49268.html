			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [New Year's Address delivered by President Michal Kovac in </F> Bratislava on 1 January 1994]    [Text] Fellow citizens, from time immemorial the New Year  has always been an opportunity for settling personal,  family-related, and social problems. Since January 1993, the New  Year has assumed a new importance to us, being the anniversary  of the establishment of our state. This gives us an opportunity  to reflect upon the first year of our lives in an independent  state and, above all, to consider what our country needs and how  we, all of us, can help our country. Our historical experience  teaches us that our statehood is one of the most important  guarantees of our national freedom and of our fully fledged  national life, for which it is worth fighting and making the  greatest sacrifices.    For a long time, we lived in the shadow of others more  powerful. Many of us doubted whether we would be able to rule  ourselves, whether our own statehood made any sense, whether it  had a real value, and whether it was not an excessive luxury for  Slovaks.    Many of us were afraid that our new state would not be  internationally recognized. We were afraid that we would not be  able to quickly build the state institutions needed for the  existence of our independent republic.    Today, we can see that these catastrophic predictions have  not come true. According to these predictions, Slovakia would  have been unable to avoid certain catastrophes. However, we are  not hiding the fact that the new situation demands certain  sacrifices. The peaceful and civilized partition of the Czech  and Slovak Federal Republic has given us a good starting point  for a promising future.    In a short time, the Slovak Republic has been recognized by  most sovereign states, including all of the great powers. This  testifies to the fact that the international community has fully  respected the right of the Czech and the Slovak nations to  establish their own states. This community has expressed trust  in them and met them halfway.    We, in the interests of peace and security in Europe, have  embraced cooperation with all democratic nations and countries.  Our objective is to jointly establish political, cultural, and  economic prosperity in Europe and the world. This is the way we  want to proceed in the future. Our democratic Constitution is  our fundamental guarantee of civil rights and freedoms, as  declared and demanded by hundreds of thousands of people in  November 1989. For the first time in our modern history, we have  become the architects of our own destiny. We ourselves have  decided to establish our own state, as the historical  development required or even dictated. The existence of the  Slovak Republic is an undisputable fact. Those who accepted its  establishment with nostalgia should understand it and respect  it. Certain situations are unique and do not repeat themselves.  We have taken the opportunity offered to us by history. Our task  is to build this state as a common state of all of its people,  irrespective of their nationality or religious and political  affiliations, and to secure democracy, freedom, and legal order,  so that the law may prevail over willfulness and  unscrupulousness, and responsibility over impunity and  corruption. I call upon everyone to participate in that work. It  is our right, our duty, and our common interest.    Our democracy must become a modern civic democracy in which  the plurality of political parties, coexistence of the  government and the opposition, and freedom for all must be  secured. However, freedom means responsibility. We cannot  tolerate freedom in the sense of an anarchic destruction of  authorities and constitutional institutions, or the freedom to  set various groups in society against one another. We will  defend, as far as we can, our statehood, sovereignty, freedom,  independence, and territorial integrity.    The quick completion of our central state organization and  institutions, the establishment of our Army, and the  introduction of a separate currency, which we did not have  before our state was established, are very important for our  present existence and our future.    I believe it is exceptionally important and encouraging  that,  now that the unified economic space we shared with the Czech  Republic has been divided, the Slovak economy and currency have  not collapsed. According to an international comparison giving  the most important economic indicators, the Slovak Republic  ranks second or third among the postcommunist countries. This  should not be overestimated, but it certainly should not be  belittled or ignored, either. I have been delighted that, apart  from the newly established state institutions, hundreds of civic  initiatives, associations, and nongovernmental organizations,  usual in developed societies, have been registered in the first  year. It is precisely in these organizations that civic activity  should be concentrated and creative abilities provided by the  democratic system utilized. Here we have opportunities to  provide charity and assistance and express understanding and  sympathy, which are features that give a human face to our  society.    Despite all of the mistakes and serious problems, I can  proudly say that independent Slovakia has withstood the test in  the first year of its state sovereignty. I want to thank the  government, parliament, all state and public officials, and  mayors of the cities for all of this. I want to sincerely thank  all of you, my fellow citizens, for the patience and  understanding that you showed last year. You know quite well  that we not only had to face our lack of political culture, but  also to get rid of bad habits and ailments inherited from the  totalitarian system. We have inherited an extremely inconvenient  economic structure and devastating way of thinking and morale. I  appreciate that most of you have contributed to alleviating the  difficulties and creating a gradual renewal of a peaceful and  sensible life. My sincere thanks also go to all who are working  without profit on the spiritual and moral revival of our society.    We are proud of our artists, scientists, sportsmen,  producers  of top-of-the-line products, and others who help to spread  Slovakia's good reputation abroad.    Dear fellow citizens, if I have evaluated the first year of  our state existence positively, it does not mean that I am  satisfied with the results we have achieved. I am convinced that  they could have been better in both the material and the  spiritual spheres, especially with respect to the general social  atmosphere and our life-style. We could have avoided various  political feuds, unnecessary stress, and various scandals. All  of this disappointed many people and caused them to stop  trusting in politics and politicians and to lose drive and  optimism.    I am saying with pain in my heart that I believe that many  difficulties have been caused by our failure to mobilize and  unify all of the political and nonpolitical forces in our  society, with the objective of jointly solving our essential  problems. We did not try to find out what our errors were but  pointed to the errors of others. We did not try to find  ourselves allies but preferred to discover adversaries and  enemies to be blamed for everything. Fortunately, we do not have  too many parties in parliament, which made it easier to join our  political forces. However, we did not succeed in establishing a  coalition that would be able to secure the necessary stability  of the government, or, at least, productive cooperation between  political entities.    It would be our tragedy if we thought that all of our  important problems would be solved by capable and strong  individuals. Today we know that a successful solution to our  problems requires cooperation between dozens or hundreds of  brains, if not thousands or hundreds of thousands. We need a  government with a wider coalition that would mobilize the best  brains of our society so as to solve its main problems and carry  out its main tasks.    Personal animosities must not hamper the formation of such a  government. People who have the necessary knowledge and ability  to cooperate decently with their colleagues should be appointed  to such a government. This is why I appeal to the leading  representatives of the parliamentary parties, movements, their  elected bodies, and ordinary members to seek the appropriate  personalities from among their ranks. When carrying out this  task, we must put Slovakia's interests before the interests of  individuals, parties, and movements. A broad coalition  government must be based on the results of the last elections,  in which the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia won a majority.    It would be a very unfortunate situation if the  parliamentary  parties were based on one person and fell along with that  person. Slovakia now needs political stability, conditions for  peaceful and productive work, an atmosphere of tolerance,  understanding, and goodwill. The key to solving our problems  lies in cooperation among our parliamentary political parties  and not in confrontation, in stretching our partnership and not  in putting some people above others, in intensifying our mutual  trust and respect and not in suspecting and accusing others, not  in radicalization but in moderation and temperance. Our  responsibility for Slovakia's destiny dictates that we should  put an end to government-drafted makeshift solutions and  improvisations and try, using all democratic and peaceful means,  to establish political stability and a stable government that  would also be trusted abroad. This is a condition for being able  to focus on the uncompromising fight against unemployment and  the growing crime rate, disorder, lack of discipline, and  injustice. This is the basic prerequisite for improving our  trustworthiness abroad and renewing the trust of people in our  politics and the correctness of the road upon which we have  embarked.    Dear fellow citizens, we are entering a year that the United  Nations has declared to be the International Year of the Family.  Even though our country is in a difficult situation, we must not  allow the human, spiritual, and cultural level of families to  decline. As head of state, I will demand that state bodies help  to create a social climate that stimulates a peaceful and  harmonious family life, the protection of children and elderly  people, and the sound development of the younger generation. I  will require that a state program be established to support  young families, which would help satisfy at least their basic  needs in housing and starting their new lives.    We are obliged to provide young families with a way out of  today's unpleasant situation. No one except parents can assume  the role of the mother or the father, however. This is why I  appeal to you, dear parents: Give more love to your children and  be a good example to them. It is in the interests of your sons  and daughters, and also in your own.    It is very important to ask: What do we still lack for a  humane, respectable, and happy life? Material welfare or  humanity, mutual trust, love, respect, and other spiritual  values?    I know that a decent human life requires adequate material  conditions. This is why we are vehemently implementing economic  transformation and trying to improve the output of our economy.  Our efforts must not fade away.    I am convinced that we need more human values. A peaceful,  balanced, and happy life is impossible without them. It will  depend on ourselves how much effort we exert to secure material  welfare and how much to secure spiritual and human education.  The more we concentrate on doing our daily work well, the more  we will help, indirectly, to create the material prerequisites  for a decent human life.    We all have the opportunity to do good and contribute to a  rapid improvement in the conditions of our lives. There are  indeed people among us who need, for various reasons, the help  of others. But the rest should not rely on someone else's help  to improve their material and spiritual lives. Without their own  diligence, it would be immoral to demand better material and  spiritual conditions of life.    Doing good cannot be replaced by anything. We only have to  want to do good. Please, my fellow citizens, try to reflect upon  my words and let us try to change our daily lives. It is worth  the pain!    Apart from democracy, mutuality, love, tolerance, and  goodwill are the great riches in every society. Let us protect  them and improve them.    Dear fellow citizens, at the very beginning of the New Year,  it would be the most simple thing to wish you a happy New Year,  better than the one preceding. However, I know that particularly  in economic life there will be no essential reversal. Our  situation is complicated but not desperate. We have many reasons  to face the future with real optimism. Everyday we become more  convinced that our people are highly educated, that we have  capable scientists, comparable technological experience, and  responsible and industrious people. We are quickly acquiring  managerial and entrepreneurial skills and learning foreign  languages. We have the opportunity to embrace international  cooperation and experience. However, we lack sound  self-confidence. I have to take this opportunity to address the  churches, the cultural and educational institutions, the  intelligentsia, the publishers, the mass media and the teachers,  and to ask them to help as much as they can to create a sound  basis for our future life, to strengthen political and civic  stability, the mental health and harmonious life of the family.  Only than will we be able to look calmly into the future.  Building a state, the foundations of which we have already laid,  is like building a home in which our family will live. If we  have sound and prosperous families, our state, too, will be  sound and prosperous. All that we do for the harmonious and  sound development of our families will become our most precious  contribution to a better and new future for all of us. So help  us God.    In this spirit I greet you, fellow countrymen, brothers and  sisters, who live dispersed all over the world, and wish you  Happy New Year for 1994, good health, optimism, unity, and trust  in yourself and your country.</p>

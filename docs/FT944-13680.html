			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (7): Looking for a super glue - Document management lacks an umbrella system The paperless office has been an enticing image since the invention of word processing a few decades ago. The promise was that it would improve efficiency and profitability by doing away with document duplication, lost invoices and desktop paper mountains. But most of business information is still on paper. 'At least 80 per cent of information is in paper form and that's not going to change in a hurry,' says Andrea Wharton, research director of Wharton Information Systems in the UK. 'Computers might communicate with each other, the buffs are communicating on the Internet, but for the majority of us, we'll still be using paper for at least another five years.' The human attachment to paper is only partly to blame. For many small companies, it may not yet be worth the relatively high cost of investment in document imaging systems, and for larger organisations, the move from paper is still a 'big conceptual leap', says Ms Wharton. But the move away from paper has started and it is speeding up. The financial services sector continues to be the biggest user of document management systems, followed by the oil and chemicals sector and government bodies. Electronic document processing and management is one of the fastest-growing sectors in office automation. In its latest survey of buying intentions*, International Data Corporation, the US information technology analyst, predicts that more than a third of companies and organisations will buy document management systems this year. The survey, of 300 US-based companies and organisations, indicates that government bodies are catching up with the financial sector as the biggest buyers. And while companies are becoming more demanding as the industry matures, more than 60 per cent of current users say that logging paper in and out of their document management systems is already saving them time. In a UK survey** by Wharton information Systems, more than two-thirds of current users said they planned more spending in the coming year. But while there is a wide choice of software for specific applications, such as accounting and loans procedures, the big gap in the market, according to the Wharton report, is in comprehensive systems that can be used across organisations regardless of the type of information or where it is stored. 'At the heart of future systems there will have to be a product that can track and manage all the files in an organisation, no matter where they reside and no matter what data type they are - voice messages, images, text files, data file.' In addition, users will need the 'most flexible type of retrieval possible'. At the moment, organisations are 'using bits of the ultimate solution, usually the bits that they perceive as having the most immediate impact on their organisation'. The report predicts that by the middle of this decade, the point will have been reached where the disparate elements of document management will have to be brought together in an umbrella system. 'It is unlikely that any single organisation will be able to provide that umbrella system plus all of the elements that operate underneath it. If modern networking systems such as Novell Netware can be viewed as a sort of organisational glue . . . then what we are looking for in document management terms is a super glue.' Organisations currently moving towards providing such a glue include Interleaf, Saros, Soft Solutions and Excalibur, whose pattern recognition technology is already being used by other vendors as a building block into their own systems. Both the Wharton and IDC studies point to trends already under way that could lead towards a unified solution, helping buyers to find products that will easily integrate with their existing systems and that will look after all their processing needs. IDC says alliances are being formed that will create standards to make document management possible across disparate systems. 'The first of these efforts is the Shamrock consortium, initiated by Saros and IBM, and joined by document managers, user corporations and infrastructure vendors such as Microsoft, Interleaf, Hewlett-Packard, Adobe and Frame.' The Wharton report, however, cautions that Shamrock, while seeking an umbrella system, also intends to preclude development of incompatible and counter-productive systems. 'While we . . . applaud any action that helps to set standards . . . we are rather more concerned about the idea of working to 'preclude incompatible and counter-productive' standards,' says the report. 'Who is to be the arbiter?' Such statements, it adds 'are more than a little worrying, especially when such large organisations . . . as IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft are members of the coalition'. The Shamrock alliance has promised to produce integrated architecture that will bring together enterprise library services, document communication and generation with business process applications. A first version of the full system is due to be unveiled early next year. In the meantime, choosing a document management system continues to be difficult, especially for smaller companies that cannot afford to employ specialists. Even for large organisations, the choice can be hit and miss, particularly at a point in the industry's development when the central component for successful document management may be still missing. In the UK, according to the Wharton report, Keyfile led the market last year among suppliers of software packages, most of which are Dos-based. Canofile still dominates in turnkey systems costing less than Pounds 50,000, according to Wharton, which identifies no clear leader among vendors of client/server systems costing more than Pounds 50,000, with the market shared by Filenet, Olivetti, Wang, ICL and Trimco. Cimage, Intergraph and Trimco, lead in large format systems, which the industry is targeting the oil and utilities markets. Advice on buying new systems can be sought from industry bodies, such as the UK Association of Information and Image Management (UK Aim). There are also specialist books on the market such as the Document Management Yearbook, along with a raft of specialist magazines. * The 1994 Document Management User Awareness and Buying Intention Survey, &amp; Document Management Market Review, International Data Corporation, US.

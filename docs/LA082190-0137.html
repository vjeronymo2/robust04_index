			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> DEFENSE INDUSTRY MAY BE BIG WINNER IN PERSIAN GULF CRISIS  </P> <P> Bernard L. Schwartz, chairman of New York-based Loral Corp., said the defense  industry could benefit in the near term from the heightened military tensions  resulting from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Loral supplies a wide range of electronic warfare gear that is now being  deployed in air and ground systems in Saudi Arabia, including tactical  reconnaissance systems aboard aircraft and sensors in a variety of missiles,  Schwartz said.  </P> <P> And Ford Aerospace Corp. in Newport Beach, which Loral is in the process of  acquiring for $715 million and other obligations, could also come out ahead if  the Saudis purchase more McDonnell Douglas F-15E fighter jets from the U.S.  government, as reported over the weekend.  </P> <P> Ford Aerospace makes the guidance systems for AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air  missiles that are used on the F-15E. So far, Don Flamm, spokesman for Ford  Aerospace, said he is not aware of any impending sale of Sidewinder missiles to  the Saudi government.  </P> <P> But he said any Sidewinder sale would be a boon to the company's aeronutronic  division, which employs 2,700 people in Newport Beach. The division has made  130,000 guidance systems since the program was started in 1950.  </P> <P> The guidance system has accounted for $1 billion in Ford Aerospace sales since  1969, Flamm said, and it continues to be one of the division's major programs.  Each system costs about $20,000, Flamm said.  </P> <P> Schwartz has acknowledged that the Newport Beach division, which accounted for  $316 million of Ford Aerospace's $1.85 billion in sales last year, is  unprofitable. But he believes the aeronutronic arm is poised for a turnaround,  and another sale of Sidewinders to the Saudis wouldn't hurt.  </P> <P> For the long term, however, Schwartz said he believes the Iraqi crisis will  have little impact on military spending levels.  </P> <P> "I would hope there will be a renewed focus on the idea that the United States  has global interests that need protecting and that funding will be determined  by the requirements for protection," he said.  </P></p>

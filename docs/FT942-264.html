			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Enterprise cash raid snaps up 9.8 per cent of Lasmo Enterprise Oil raised the stakes in its long-running bid for Lasmo yesterday by buying nearly 10 per cent of Lasmo's stock from its largest shareholder for cash. The deal, clinched in a long-awaited raid timed to coincide with the opening of Wall Street, angered other shareholders who are being offered only Enterprise shares and warrants under the terms of the bid. The Pounds 1.6bn takeover offer, which aims to create a prominent new oil exploration and production company, has hung in the balance for several weeks, but the Enterprise raid was intended to wrest advantage just ahead of the bid deadline at 1pm tomorrow. However, some institutional shareholders in Lasmo remain undecided, and analysts last night said the bid was still too close to call. Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management, Lasmo's biggest shareholder, confirmed last night that it had sold 77m shares at 169p a share. It sold the shares hours after a meeting with senior Lasmo executives. However, PDFM still holds half of its original 16 per cent holding, and the decision it will announce today on how that will be voted will be crucial. Enterprise bought 9.8 per cent of Lasmo shares in two tranches. It said 86.8m shares, which includes those bought from PDFM, were purchased at 169p a share and 7.77m at 161p. Mr Rudolph Agnew, Lasmo chairman, said the purchase made the paper offer - of 36 new Enterprise A shares and 13 warrants for every 88 Lasmo shares - worthless. He told Reuters: 'This means the rest of the City are left with a junk paper offer and they would be well advised not to accept it.' Some institutions and private shareholders were angry at yesterday's developments. One private investor who complained to the Takeover Panel said: 'Every shareholder apart from a lucky few will suffer.' The Takeover Panel took no action after the raid because it did not appear to have breached the takeover rules. The fact that Enterprise's raid was paid for in cash rather than Enterprise paper did not matter so long as the value was the same. The rules also permit a bidder to buy up to 10 per cent of the target company's stock. Analysts said Enterprise could have jeopardised its bid by antagonising institutions that were unable to take advantage of the cash offer. On balance, though, it appeared to have ended up in a stronger position. By buying half of Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management's stake, it has reduced the size of Lasmo's biggest shareholder and gained control of a useful portion of its quarry's stock. Lasmo's shares remained firm at 144p, and Enterprise's fell 27p to 381p. Lex, Page 28 Victory parade or retreat, Page 30 Bid could create warrants worth Pounds 105m, Page 38</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Answer to reader's question from Vitaliy Lystsov, deputy </F> chief of the Russian Federation Ministry for the Protection of  the Environment and Natural Resources Main Administration for  Ecological Safety, under the "Question-Answer. We Inform, We  Advise, We Consult" rubric: "`Spots' on Map"]    [Text] Your newspaper has repeatedly written about  radioactive contamination of Russian oblasts. Can they not be  listed? (D. Chvilev, city of Vidnoye, Moscow Oblast).    Vitaliy Lystsov, deputy chief of the Russian Federation  Ministry for the Protection of the Environment and Natural  Resources Main Administration for Ecological Safety, replies:    "They are Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kaluga, Kursk,  Lipetsk, Leningrad, Nizhniy Novgorod, Orel, Penza, Ryazan,  Saratov, Smolensk, Tambov, Tula, Ulyanovsk, and Chelyabinsk  Oblasts and the Republic of Mordovia. Eighteen territories in  all. But it must be said that the danger to people's health  compared with other sources of risk (smoking, for example) is  not high here. In the main the level of contamination does not  exceed 1 curie per square km. Certain parts of Bryansk Oblast  (310 square km) with contamination of over 40 curies per square  km are an exception. A total of 17 percent of this oblast's  territory is contaminated. The most contaminated territory is  in Tula (39.7 percent), Orel (37 percent), Ryazan (13 percent),  and Kaluga (11.7 percent) Oblasts, but the contamination there  is not great (mainly between 1 and 5 curies per square km).  Admittedly, in Tula, Kaluga, and Orel Oblasts there are `spots'  where contamination is between 5 and 15 curies per square km."</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / BTR buys US group for Dollars 820m BTR, the UK-based industrial conglomerate, went back on to the acquisition trail yesterday with an agreed Dollars 820m (Pounds 550m) purchase of Rexnord, a US industrial manufacturer based in Milwaukee. BTR has been talking since May with Fairchild, the US supplier of aerospace and industrial components which has a 44 per cent stake in Rexnord. The UK group already has irrevocable commitments for more than 50 per cent of the shares. Rexnord makes material conveying systems, power transmission components and industrial and aerospace seals for US and international manufacturers and users of industrial equipment. In the year to June 30, the group made operating profits of Dollars 83m on sales of Dollars 533m. Net earnings before extraordinary items were Dollars 23.9m. Rexnord employs about 4,700 people. It has 14 manufacturing sites - 11 in the US, two in Germany and one in Italy. Although the UK group has a fearsome reputation as a cost-cutter, Mr Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, said he was more interested in increasing Rexnord's sales by widening its market beyond the US. 'In particular, we see great potential for substantially growing Rexnord's sales in the large Asian markets and also in Europe.' He said the purchase would be earnings-enhancing from year one. If the deal goes ahead, BTR's gearing is likely to go up from 40 per cent at the year-end to about 60 per cent. Mr Jackson said he was comfortable with that level, not least because Rexnord was very cash generative. BTR said Rexnord's brand names were a good fit with the group's existing products and would expose it to a wider market. One of Rexnord's attractions was that 50 per cent of sales were spares. This deal is the biggest announced by BTR since it paid Pounds 1.55bn in 1991 for Hawker Siddeley, the UK aerospace and engineering group. Mr Jackson said BTR was concentrating resources on industrial manufacturing. The policy has recently led it to invest in Chinese bottling plants and dispose of two wholesale distribution businesses in the UK and US. The UK group will pay a total of Dollars 420m in cash for Rexnord and assume borrowings of about Dollars 400m.</p>

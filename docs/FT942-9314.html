			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Large job growth forecast for City Central London is likely to see a growth in total office employment of between 50,000 and 65,000 jobs by the year 2000, according to a report published yesterday. The growth in office employment could generate demand for nearly 10m sq ft of extra office space, according to a report by the chartered surveyors St Quintin. The employment growth is likely to be less important in generating demand for offices however, than the need for City occupiers to change and upgrade their accommodation. A quarter of City tenants are housed in unrefurbished buildings built before 1970. An anticipated growth in the amount of floorspace occupied by each worker is also expected to increase demand by up to 4.5m sq ft. The report says the chance of another explosion in the financial and business services sectors, which grew sharply in the mid-1980s, is 'extremely unlikely'. Increasing productivity and greater use of technology means that employment in the insurance and retail banking sectors is likely to undergo further rationalisation in the short term. Overall, the financial and business services sectors, which account for nearly half of Central London's employment, are expected to grow at an annual rate of between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent in the next six years. The bulk of job growth is likely to occur in professional and business services rather than in the financial sector. The report's projections are based on the assumption that London retains its position as Europe's leading financial centre. However, it highlights a number of potential threats to that position, including inadequate infrastructure, increased teleworking and competition from other centres such as Frankfurt. Mr Peter Damesick, head of research at St Quintin, emphasised the uncertainties involved in making long-term projections. 'Even the modest increase in occupied floor space in our projections is not guaranteed,' he said. The report was commissioned by the Corporation of London, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Investment Property Forum, a surveyors' group.

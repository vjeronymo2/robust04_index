			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Invergordon declines to Pounds 11m - Overstocking and weak demand take toll on mature whisky prices AFTER nearly a decade of uninterrupted growth, Invergordon Distillers, the independent Scotch whisky producer, reported a 23 per cent decline in first half pre-tax profits, from Pounds 14.6m to Pounds 11.3m. Mr Chris Greig, managing director, said the result reflected a fall of 10-15 per cent in the price of mature whisky because of weak demand and overstocking in the industry. 'There are indications, including lower stocks of grain whisky, that trading conditions have stabilised,' he said. 'Although we do not expect to match 1992's profit in the full year, we believe that the impact has been taken in the first half.' Earnings per share in the six months to June 30 dropped to 6p (7.7p) but the interim dividend goes up to 2.9p (2.8p). Operating profit was 27 per cent lower at Pounds 11.8m on turnover down 8 per cent to Pounds 36.8m. Gross margins were reduced from 53.6 per cent to 48.9 per cent, their level in 1990. In the UK turnover increased from Pounds 22.4m to Pounds 23.1m because of the resilience of the own-label supermarket sector. Overall volumes were maintained at the record levels achieved in the first half of 1992. A 3 per cent reduction in Scotch was offset by increased volumes of gin and vodka. Bottled-in-Scotland whisky volumes were 17 per cent ahead. Total production was reduced by 4 per cent. Though the grain distillery continued to operate at more than 90 per cent capacity, output of malt whisky was cut by 21 per cent and the company's four distilleries were operating at 50 per cent capacity. COMMENT Invergordon's own stocks of lower-cost mature whisky and the resilience of its supermarket customers have enabled it to weather adverse trading conditions longer than most others in the industry. It has also made good use of the three years since flotation to strengthen its balance sheet; doubling net assets to Pounds 64m, and reducing borrowings from Pounds 46m to Pounds 22m, and gearing from 143 per cent to 35 per cent. Market pressures have now begun to take their toll, however. Analysts have cut their forecasts of full year profits to about Pounds 27m compared to last year's Pounds 32.5m and recovery is not expected before 1995. Whyte &amp; Mackay, which holds a 41 per cent stake, can afford to wait and watch the effects on the share price before renewing its bid, but the prospects of securing it for a bargain price seem slim. The shares lost 9p to close at 286p yesterday, still above the 275p offered by W&amp;M two years ago.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Peers warn Howard of need for changes to police bill The government was warned last night that it faces embarrassing defeats in the the House of Lords unless it initiates radical changes in the bill to improve the effectiveness of magistrates' courts and the police. Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, led demands for amendments to proposals in the police and magistrates' courts bill to subject magistrates' clerks to fixed contracts and performance-related pay. He said this could have 'no place' in a judicial context. Viscount Whitelaw, a former Conservative home secretary, was joined by Lord Callaghan, the former Labour prime minister, in attacking provisions which could open the way for a nationally controlled police force. In a BBC interview, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said he had 'listened with care' to the criticisms made by the Lords but held out no prospect of significant concessions. Lord Whitelaw looked for the changes which would 'inevitably' be made to the bill to produce a measure likely to attract cross-party support. Lord Callaghan told Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor, that to secure cabinet approval for the changes required by the Lords he would have to battle hard against Mr Michael Howard, 'a wilful and ambitious home secretary'. Opening the second reading debate, Lord Mackay dismissed as 'groundless' fears that it would lead to the independent advice given by magistrates' clerks being undermined. Ominously for the government, his assurances made little impression on Lord Taylor, who described the provision authorising the appointment of new officials to manage the offices of justices' clerks as 'chilling'. He maintained that the government's decision to include words in the bill proclaiming judicial independence could not constitute a guarantee, even if printed in capital letters. He said peers would be failing in their duty if they allowed a bill to pass which gave the impression that the advice magistrates received, or the judicial decisions made by their clerks, were no longer a matter of their own discretion. Lord Whitelaw underlined the importance of maintaining public confidence in the impartiality of the police and condemned the provision enabling the home secretary to appoint the chairman of each police authority.</p>

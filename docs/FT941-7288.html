			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Grab for a lifebelt: Auditors want to put a cap on their liability Mr Larry Weinbach, chief executive of Arthur Andersen, the world's largest accountancy firm, does not hesitate when asked to name the three most important challenges for his profession today: 'Litigation, litigation and litigation.' Mr Weinbach has been leading a campaign in the US to limit the exposure of auditors to litigation. Yesterday, the largest eight accountancy firms in the UK joined the bandwagon. The UK firms want company law amended to allow auditors to negotiate limits on their liability if they are sued when a company collapses. They would like to change the principle of joint and several liability in English law, by which the courts can force auditors to pay the full extent of any damages regardless of their degree of blame. However, the firms recognise the difficulty of winning public support for such a radical change. So in the short term they are calling for section 310 of the 1985 Companies Act to be excised. Under this clause, first introduced in company law in 1928, auditors are forbidden to place any limit on their liability. If the section were removed, auditors would be free to negotiate a cap on their damage liability calculated as a multiple of their audit fee. Under the present system, the firms' exposure is unlimited, at a time when the sums to which they are exposed have escalated sharply. In the most notable example, legal actions commenced against auditors in connection with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International total more than Dollars 8bn in damages. Settlements reached with auditors in the past few years have also involved large sums. For example, Ernst &amp; Young paid out Dollars 110m last year in connection with its audit of a company acquired by Allied Irish Banks, and Dollars 400m in 1992 in connection with its work on savings and loan institutions (the equivalent of UK building societies) in the US. The firms argue that they are increasingly seen as tempting targets for plaintiffs because they are perceived to have 'deep pockets' - substantial resources generated by profits or insurance cover. Other potential defendants in corporate collapses, such as the directors, often have minimal assets and are therefore not pursued for compensation. In a submission on Tuesday to the Department of Trade and Industry, the firms argue that if they remain unable to cap their liability they may turn away high-risk clients and raise audit fees. 'There is a real danger that firms will collapse,' says Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner of Price Waterhouse. 'The Big Six firms could become the big three within a very short space of time.' The firms say that commercial insurers have stopped providing cover after concluding that the risks of audit litigation settlements are unquantifiable. The report sent to the DTI suggests that the number of claims against the largest six firms jumped from just three in 1982-83 to 627 last year. Over the same period, insurance premiums increased by a factor of nearly 38 and the limits below which the firms had no external cover rose 27 times. For the largest eight firms, insurance premiums, negligence claims and legal costs as a proportion of audit fee income are calculated to have risen over the past decade from 2.6 per cent to 8 per cent. Not everyone is swayed by such figures, however. There are two significant objections: that auditors are only facing legal actions because they have audited negligently; and that the firms are still highly profitable and the crisis not as great as they portray. Mr Martin Hayman, group legal adviser to Standard Chartered, the international banking group, says: 'If auditors were doing their job properly and went back to basics we would not have this litigation. From our experience there has been a manifest failure by them to carry out their responsibilities.' The bank successfully sued Coopers &amp; Lybrand and other defendants for Dollars 62m in 1992 in connection with the audit of Miniscribe, the US disc-drive maker Mr John Newman, a partner with Chantrey Vellacott, a medium-sized accountancy firm, says: 'The campaign is riddled with the illogic that can only arise through self-interest. Auditors have been given a government licence to conduct their work. That comes with a cost. Just show me a case in the last 10 years where the firms have paid out unjustly.' Mr Brindle replies: 'We do not do every audit perfectly. We are human beings. If we made a mistake we are willing to pay our fair share. But we object to paying everyone else's share too. Fairness seems to have gone out of the window.' Mr Hayman is also sceptical about the selective figures chosen by the firms to present their case, which do not show data such as the total value of claims or settlements, and which give no idea of the firms' profits or assets. 'If people were to see the worldwide earnings of the firms, they would not have any sympathy,' he says. Mr Brindle of Price Waterhouse says the DTI has not requested any such financial information, although the firms would consider providing it if asked. But he argues that the litigation crisis is now so great that 'you may as well take my inside leg measurement, it's as relevant'. Critics maintain that the argument for reform in the US - which has jury trials for civil litigation and more writ-happy plaintiffs - is stronger than in the UK. Mr Emile Woolf, litigation services partner at Kingston Smith, the accountancy firm, says a change to the law may not be necessary because recent decisions by English courts have tended to restrict the liability of auditors for damages. He adds that introducing and publicising a cap on audit fees would prompt plaintiffs to increase their claims in litigation up to that level. For its part, the DTI says that any new legislation would require wide consultation, and would have to provide a solution that serves 'the wider public interest', and not just the firms. The accountancy firms draw some comfort from the appointment late last year of Professor Andrew Likierman as government accountancy adviser. In 1989 he co-ordinated a report - later dropped - calling for reform of the law on audit liability. The question is whether the crisis has become appreciably worse since then. At present, the public interest case seems weaker than the self-interest of the firms. Unless firms furnish additional financial information to the government, and an analysis is undertaken of the quality of the audits for which they have been sued, convincing the DTI and the public to support their case may prove difficult.</p>

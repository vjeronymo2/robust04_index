			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A San Quentin Prison guard was stabbed in the neck by an inmate serving a life  sentence, prompting a lock-down of the facility, officials said. In the  apparently unprovoked attack, the guard was stabbed in the right side of the  neck while conducting an evening meal lock-up, said prison spokesman Cal White.  The unidentified guard underwent surgery and is listed in good condition at  Marin General Hospital. The unidentified inmate was placed in a prison wing  that houses violent prisoners. A search turned up a weapon with a six-inch  blade and a taped handle that was apparently made from a broken mirror, said  White.  </P></p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Gardening: Not so scary seeds WHY ARE so many gardeners still scared of sowing seeds? I know they are scared because when I am showing a visitor a plant, they put up their defences as soon as they are told that it grows like a weed from seed. 'I like your Erodium daucoides' means 'Can I have a chunk of it to put in the car boot?' And 'Have a seed pod' means 'I dare you.' These fears are absurd because many seeds germinate with childish ease. People are scared, wrongly, by the more difficult varieties. And anyone who is gardening abroad ought to bless the explosion of varieties in some of the best seed lists: there is much less of an excuse nowadays for people who complain that they are denied a wide range of plants grown in Britain because they garden outside the country. My favourites range from bulbs to border plants through annuals and spreading things for pots. From Scotland to the east Mediterranean, the next fortnight is the moment to place an order among the unknown. Each year, my mind's eye fastens on one particular image in the darkness of January. This year, once again, it starts with a haze of white cosmos daisies. It is no use saying they are too much of a bother, for they are absurdly easy to raise. I am not fond of the usual purple forms - in my garden, cosmos is white only. Seedsmen now offer two varieties: the older Purity and the newer Sonata. Purity is taller, larger-flowered, much more impressive - and cheaper. White cosmos does not need to be sown until late March but immediate sowing is needed for two of my other front-runners. If you start seeds of the electric-blue salvia patens under heat within the next fortnight, the plants will grow on to be potted individually, planted out late in May, and trusted for their stems of brilliant blue flowers when the rest of the garden starts to look exhausted. Plants of this half hardy perennial will turn up at Pounds 2 each on plant stalls early in summer - one reason why a packet or two of seed from Thompson and Morgan of London Road, Ipswich, are one of the year's better gambles. The other star turns require you to transfer to the rising star among British seed catalogues, the list from Chiltern Seeds, Bortree Stile, Ulverston, Cumbria LA12. The service includes shopping by credit card, a 24-hour answering service, and a fax on 0229-54549: this amazing list is within anyone's easy reach world-wide. Expats who are losing their home roots will be astonished at how much more is available now. All of us might like to try a new hybrid from Japan, lilium formosan Snow Trumpet. Usually, this white lily would flower in a scramble if sown early during its first year, but Snow Trumpet is much quicker, more vigorous and need not be sown until February. It is pretty reliable and produces big, white, trumpet-shaped flowers from August onwards. Seed is Pounds 1.70 a packet, but it germinates easily in heat indoors (and I need hardly remind you what an individual bulb would cost). Up among the perennials, you have a cheap chance of two of my lesser-known favourites: apricot foxgloves (Thompson and Morgan's are the best) or the tall, thin, late-flowering verbena bonariensis. Much less usual are the white-flowered gillenia and the small, sky-blue adenophora tashiroi. Chiltern sells seeds of both - the easiest method of propagation. The adenophora looks like a small bell flower with stems about 1 1/2 ft high, but I decided that it had such charm last summer that I have majored on it in a sunny corner. Few nurseries stock it and most books exaggerate its preference for shade. While the gillenia is not cheap as a pot-grown plant, it is even easier to raise from seed. It has delicacy, strong colouring and a willingness to grow in semi-shade. If I could take only one white-flowered perennial from late June, this wildflower from North America would be my choice. It is as tough as nails, about 2ft high and, at Pounds 1.15 a packet, it ought to give you at least a dozen plants for less than the price of a single one off a stall.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> * Mature choices: A new survey says most of the nation's governors recall their  favorite reading as kids to be typical children's books such as "Huckleberry  Finn," "The Little Engine That Could" and "Peter Rabbit." But not George  Deukmejian. California's Republican governor lists his three favorite childhood  books as "A Tale of Two Cities," "The Making of the President" and "The Book of  Common Prayer." The survey by a national pizza chain was released Wednesday to  observe National Young Reader's Day.  </P> <P> * It's over: Gov. Michael S. Dukakis conceded for the first time that the  Massachusetts Miracle that nearly carried him to the White House is no more.  But the former Democratic candidate for President said that the formula that  produced a white-hot economy in the early 1980s can bring Massachusetts back  from the brink of recession. "The miracle of the '80s may be over, but the  fundamental strengths that made it happen are still here," he said. Declining  revenue has left Massachusetts with a $720-million budget deficit.  </P> <P> * One more time: Actor Todd Bridges will be retried on a felony assault charge  stemming from a shooting at a South-Central Los Angeles drug den, a spokeswoman  for the district attorney's office said. Bridges, 24, was acquitted last week  of attempted murder and attempted voluntary manslaughter in the Feb. 2 shooting  of convicted drug dealer Kenneth (Tex) Clay, but jurors deadlocked on the  assault charge. Bridges played Willis on the TV series "Diff'rent Strokes."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Immediately before the meeting between the  Visegrad four presidents and U.S. President Clinton, Slovak  President Michal Kovac said that if Visegrad Group countries are  not sufficiently mature to enter NATO, they could at least join  NATO's political structures. Based on this, we asked Ivan  Mjartan, Slovak ambassador to the Czech Republic, whether this  attitude was still valid after the adoption of the  U.S.-sponsored Partnership for Peace plan by NATO yesterday.    [Begin Mjartan recording] [passage omitted] President Kovac  wished to indicate that he could see another, more dynamic way  of incorporating the Visegrad Four countries into NATO. His  idea is based on the fact that incorporating into NATO's  political structures will immediately create certain security  guarantees and will provide guarantees in the process of  creating another sphere of security and cooperation in Europe,  in particular in eastern Europe.    The NATO summit unanimously approved the U.S.-sponsored  Partnership for Peace proposal yesterday. We emphasized on  several occasions -- not only in speeches by the president and  the prime minister, and in speeches by our other representatives  -- that the Partnership for Peace is an acceptable alternative  at this stage for us. We regard it as an intermediate stage  which will be followed -- as we expect -- by the adoption of a  specific timetable for a further course of action by both the  United States and NATO. The outcome of this should be the final  and full-fledged membership of these countries in NATO.    Given this situation, the Partnership for Peace is in fact  the only and acceptable alternative for us. [end recording]</p>

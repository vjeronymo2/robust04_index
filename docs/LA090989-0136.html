			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> J.M. PETERS REPORTS DROP IN PROFITS  </P> <P> J.M. Peters Co. Inc., the Newport Beach home builder, said profits dropped to  $3.5 million in the second quarter on housing sales of $56.6 million, compared  to $7.3 million in profits on $86.1 million in sales last year.  </P> <P> The lower earnings disappointed stock analysts, who had projected profits of as  much 75 cents a share earlier this year. That was far higher than the 25 cents  a share the company actually earned in its fiscal second quarter, which ended  Aug. 31. Last year the company earned 53 cents a share, or 53% more.  </P> <P> The analysts attributed the problems to construction delays, particularly in  J.M. Peters' Los Angeles markets. That meant the company sold fewer homes even  though orders for homes increased: Buyers ordered 322 homes during the second  quarter compared to 277 last year.  </P> <P> For the first half of its fiscal year, Peters earned $8.5 million on sales of  $112.1 million, compared to $14.5 million on sales of $173 million. New orders  for the first half were down by nearly 200 homes, the company reported, or 25%.  From 758 last year, orders dropped to 572 this year.  </P></p>

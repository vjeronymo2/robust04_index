			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / RTZ rules out bid for mining assets RTZ, the international mining group, formally ruled out a bid for British Coal mining assets as the deadline for tenders closed yesterday afternoon. However, Taylor Woodrow, the construction company, was among companies confirming that it had bid. The deadline brought hope of revival for at least three mines which are no longer operated by British Coal and are being offered as stand-alone pits. English Coal, one of three management buy-out teams, said it was interested in Ellington in Northumberland, Annesley/Bentinck in Nottinghamshire, and Thorne in South Yorkshire, and was bidding in conjunction with its tender for the three English regions. English Coal said that if successful it would want to re-open Ellington and Annesley/Bentinck as soon as possible, creating at least 550 jobs. The other management buy-out bids are Celtic Energy, which is bidding for South Wales, and Northern Coal, which has planned a tender for the central-north region. RJB Mining said it was bidding for all five regions, and Coal Investments, chaired by Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal commercial director, is concentrating on central north and central south in partnership with the Union of Democratic Mineworkers. Ryan Group is involved in bids for three regions - one with Alcan Aluminium of Canada for the north-east of England, one with construction company Miller Group for Scotland, and one alone for the south Wales region. Other possible bidders for at least some of the five regions include NSM and CP Holdings. The government hopes to announce preferred bidders for each region and, where appropriate, each stand-alone pit, by the middle of next month. Letters, Page 18</p>

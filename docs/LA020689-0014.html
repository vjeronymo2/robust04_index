			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is going to federal Court in  Los Angeles today to protect the image of its famous Oscar. At issue is a  statue manufactured by Creative House Promotions of Chicago and awarded by the  Houston International Film Festival. "No other trophy manufacturer has imitated  us quite as enthusiastically," said Academy executive administrator Bruce  Davis. Oscar, a sculpted man holding a sword, is 13 1/2 inches tall (including  a 3-inch base), weighs 8 pounds and is 24-karat gold-plated. The Houston  trophy, a man holding a large star, is 12 inches tall (including a 4-inch  base), weighs about 5 pounds and has a gold-colored metallic coating. Creative  House Promotions also sells the trophy to other groups. Houston festival  director J. Hunter Todd said he doesn't believe that "any of the movie  directors or stars who have been awarded the trophy have in any way confused it  with an Oscar." Houston has used the trophies for 11 years, but the Academy has  not complained until now, Todd noted. Davis says the Academy became aware of  the similarity about a year ago and wrote letters trying to dissuade the  festival from using the trophy. "If you know about an infringement and fail to  object to it, you risk having your trademark become public domain," said Davis.  ALEENE MacMINN and JUDITH MICHAELSON  </P></p>

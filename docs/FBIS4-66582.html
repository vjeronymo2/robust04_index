			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Izzah 'Ali: "Major Role for Private Sector, </F> Social Fund in Providing Jobs; Limited Number of Specialties to  be Appointed in Governmental Services Agencies"]    [Text] Indicators of the 1994/95 development plan confirm  that the private sector and the Social Fund will have the  largest role in solving the problem of unemployed graduates and  providing productive job opportunities for them.    The plan gives a new role to the Ministry of Insurance and  Social Affairs with regard to absorbing part of the unemployment  problem through productive family projects. The Ministry of  Agriculture will also share in solving the problem of unemployed  graduates, through conveying ownership of reclaimed land.    Indicators also confirm that the government's commitment to  assigning graduates will be limited to appointing graduates of  medical colleges and nursing institutions to the health sector,  and graduates of teaching colleges and supplementary studies to  the education sector.    A responsible source in the Ministry of Planning stated that  the government's role in the coming plan is confined to  appointing specific career specialties to serve directly in  service areas. Its present role is to concentrate on indirectly  increasing employment through encouraging the private sector,  and on the role of the Social Fund to encourage small projects  in cooperation with local administrative agencies and banks.    Moreover, the government intends to issue a number of  administrative decrees, such as early out for retirement,  encouraging departures, and offering loans for an indefinite  period.    By establishing manufacturing training centers, the  government is aiming at requalifying the work force and  graduates, commensurate with labor market needs, either domestic  or in the Arab countries.  <H5>  Educated Unemployed </H5>   'Usam Fahmi, head of the Central Office for Labor and Human  Resources in the Ministry of Planning, confirmed that the  state's plan to employ graduates is based on several studies  that have been conducted recently by the Cabinet and the  Ministry of Local Administration, in participation with the  Ministry of Planning. Initial results make it clear that the  largest percentage of unemployment is among the educated, while  it is lower for the uneducated, since their jobs do not require  specific qualifications and it is easier to go from one job to  another. It is different for the educated, whether highly  qualified, above average, or average. The number of unemployed  graduates, during the period from 1983 to 1993, was about 1.425  million out of a total of 3.438 million graduates.    In this study, conducted in 21 governorates--excluding the  border governorates--it was noted that the highest percentage of  educated unemployed was in Port Said, where it totaled 16.5  percent, followed by Suez at 13.5 percent and Kafr al-Shaykh at  11 percent. The Upper Egyptian governorates of Bani Suwayf,  al-Minya, Asyut, and Aswan were 11.2 percent, 11.7 percent, 11.4  percent, and 11.4 percent respectively. The unemployment rate  was 10.9 percent in the governorate of al-Daqahliyah, 10.7  percent in al-Sharqiyah, and 10 percent in al-Minufiyah. It  dropped in al-Jizah, where it was less than 5.6 percent.    It was also clear that the highest unemployment rate was  among 1992 graduates, totaling 12.4 percent, while the lowest  rate was among 1983 graduates at 5.5 percent.    A study of unemployment distribution by skills showed that  the highest rate was in the intermediate range, followed by  above average and highly qualified.    With regard to graduates of average skills, the highest  unemployment rate was for graduates of commercial institutes,  representing 67.8 percent, followed by industrial school  graduates at 28.7 percent, and social services at 1.5 percent.  Agricultural school graduates were at 0.7 percent, hotel  training 0.3 percent, and health technicians 0.2 percent. It was  found that the highest unemployment rate for highly-skilled  graduates, during the period from 1983 to 1993, was for  graduates of the Business College, which was 34.6 percent,  followed by graduates of fine arts colleges at 15.3 percent, and  law and agriculture at 14.6 percent and 14.5 percent  respectively. The lowest rate was for graduates of engineering  colleges at 3.8 percent.</p>

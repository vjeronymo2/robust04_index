			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 22 (TANJUG) -- Police in the  Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) stopped Monday a French U.N.  battalion convoy carrying from Croatia ammunition to Moslems in  western Bosnia, writes Belgrade's daily POLITIKA EKSPRES.    The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 by Serbs in the Serb  ethnic  and historical territories in response to Croatia's forcible  secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and Croatia's  violations of human and national rights of Serbs there. It lies  between the former Yugoslav Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina and  Croatia.    The Belgrade daily set out that the French convoy was  stopped  at the Krajina-Croatia Turanj border-crossing and that the  explosive cargo was intended for the Moslems in the Cazin  region, a Moslem enclave in western Bosnia.    The UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] members presented the  papers for the cargo showing they were carrying 720 rounds of  mines for 80 mm mortars, 60 smoke pots, 112 packs of teargas and  21 signal rockets which the Moslems in the Cazin region used as  a gift from NATO, the daily said. When asked by the R.S.K.  border police to examine the cargo's content and establish it  matched the description in the papers, the check was not  allowed. After that the R.S.K. police returned the convoy to  Croatia, the daily noted. The daily added that one day (Sunday)  prior to this event Canadian UNPROFOR member tried in the same  way to drive six trucks with 10 tonnes of ammunition towards  their base in the Lika area, but lacking permission and prior  announcement were turned back to Croatia.    One may understand the claim that UNPROFOR was  "replenishing"  its ammunition stocks, but the question remained what the  teargas and smoke grenades and mines were for, asked the daily.  "Does the U.N. expect some special military action soon and  what kind? Perhaps this action is to be veiled by a smoke  screen, so that there can be no detection from which side  hostile action comes from. Or is this the "dowry", as ordered,  for the latest Croatian-Moslem "marriage" in the former Yugoslav  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina for some future time?" the daily  asked.    The Bosnian Moslems and Croats, who clashed for the past  year  for domination over territories, signed under U.S. pressure last  Friday in Washington an agreement on forming a Moslem-Croatian  federation in Bosnia which would later form a confederation with  the neighboring Croatia.    Political analysts say the motive for creating the  Moslem-Croatian federation and subsequently a confederation with  Croatia was to isolate and pressure the Serb side into accepting  the peace settlement as designed by the West.</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAV-ON DRUG SETTLES FALSE-ADVERTISING CASE;  </P> <P> RETAILING: THE CHAIN WILL PAY FINES AND EXPENSES OF $110,000. IT SAYS EMPLOYEE  ERRORS LED TO THE OVERCHARGES IN QUESTION.  </P> <P> Sav-on Drug's owner agreed Friday to pay $110,000 in fines and expenses to  settle charges that the chain overcharged customers on merchandise advertised  at special sale prices.  </P> <P> The settlement with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office follows  similar false-advertising cases brought in recent years against K mart and  Thrifty Corp., the state's biggest drugstore chain.  </P> <P> Sav-on blamed the overcharges on employee errors, and said it is installing  computerized cash registers as part of its effort to eliminate the problem.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Healey said the investigation of Sav-on was launched  in July, 1989, when county agents checked 14 of the chain's drugstores.  </P> <P> The investigators, responding to a consumer complaint, bought items at random  to determine whether the prices paid at the cash register matched advertised  prices.  </P> <P> The result: Investigators were charged higher-than-advertised prices at 13 of  the 14 stores. They were overcharged on 81 of the 230 items they bought, paying  $1,074 on goods advertised at $944.  </P> <P> Michael Miller, the Sav-on spokesman, said the case involved "lack of  communication" among store employees. "We've taken substantial steps to make  sure it doesn't happen again," he said.  </P> <P> The company, Healey said, "was genuinely apologetic and seemed anxious to clear  up the problem."  </P> <P> Along with accepting the fines and negotiated penalties, Sav-on agreed to a  five-year injunction against false advertising.  </P> <P> Healey said the company could be subject to huge penalties if it is ever found  to deliberately violate the injunction, with fines of as much as $2,500 for  every customer who is overcharged.  </P> <P> Sav-on, with 163 locations in California, is the state's third-largest  drugstore chain and is second in Southern California only to Thrifty.  </P> <P> Sav-on is operated by American Drug Stores, which in turn is owned by Salt Lake  City-based American Stores. Other American Stores holdings include Lucky and  Alpha Beta supermarkets.  </P> <P> In a similar false advertising case settled in 1987, Thrifty agreed to pay  penalties of $117,940 after a year of negotiations with the Los Angeles County  District Attorney's Office.  </P> <P> Last year, K mart agreed to pay Los Angeles, Kern and Kings counties $450,457  in connection with an overcharging case.  </P></p>

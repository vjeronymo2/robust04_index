			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / CAA raps government stance on Dan-Air THE GOVERNMENT damaged the UK's ability to stop anti-competitive airline mergers in the European Community by allowing British Airways to take over its rival Dan-Air last year, Mr Christopher Chataway, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, said yesterday. Mr Chataway, a former Conservative minister, said the deal should have been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. He added: 'The approval will not make it easier for the UK to argue for a strong competition policy within the EC.' BA said yesterday: 'If the merger had not been approved when it was Dan-Air would have disappeared overnight. We do not believe refusing this merger would have been in the best interests of the travelling public, Dan-Air or its staff.' The Department of Trade and Industry said ministers had noted 'competition concerns' at the time but that 'factors in the public interest' won the day. Mr Chataway, presenting the CAA's annual report, also warned the Treasury that cutting the CAA's borrowing powers would hit investment in air traffic control and could increase delays to passengers in the UK's crowded airports. As a public body the CAA borrows from the Treasury. It borrowed Pounds 56m last year, below its ceiling of Pounds 65.5m, and fears that the ceiling will be reduced as a result. 'It is absolutely essential that we are able to borrow significantly. If we don't, we can easily see a return to the delays of the late 1980s,' said Mr Chataway. The CAA annual report says that improvements in air traffic control led last year to a sharp fall in airport waiting times. Average delays on outbound flights from UK airports in May and June this year were just seven minutes, compared with 14 minutes in May and June 1992. The average delay on domestic flights in the same period was also seven minutes - down from 20 minutes. Early evening UK-bound flights from Belgium and Germany were subject to delays of up to two hours early last year. This had been cut to 30 minutes. Mr Chataway added that the single market had heightened concern about the charges made to cover the costs of safety regulations in the EC. It was only in the UK that the full costs were recovered from the industry. He added: 'To avoid damaging distortions, we must press for early implementation of a common funding policy throughout the EC for safety regulation.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Good Morning From Mexico" newscast] </F>   [Text] Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and  reconciliation in Chiapas, has said in Mexico City that no date  has been set to begin the talks with the Zapatist National  Liberation Army [EZLN]. In a communique, he noted that he has  yet to receive a firm notification concerning the place and date  of the meeting. He insisted that written communication between  the EZLN and the peace commissioner is the only valid source of  notification, adding that, because of the importance of the  meeting, it is imperative to maintain a single source of  notification. In this way, he was denying reports that the  dialogue would take place on Saturday [5 February]. Here is a  report from Jaime Guerrero:    [Begin recording] [Guerrero] Chiapas and its images of war  have been viewed around the world, and nobody wants this to  happen again. Reports indicate the peace process in the  country's poorest state is clearly advancing toward  reconciliation. On Thursday, Camacho Solis left Los Pinos  Presidential Residence after meeting with President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari for 90 minutes.    Although the two sides have yet to sit down at the  bargaining  table, Camacho has been in contact with the Zapatists for a  month. He told reporters that he believes the EZLN has assumed a  responsible attitude.    [Camacho] This is why we have been able to advance in the  peace process. I also want to say -- indeed, I think this is an  important point -- that I found a responsible attitude on the  part of the EZLN. With each and every message, we have received  a corresponding response.    [Guerrero] When asked about the interventionist attitude of  U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli and his virtual impact on the  negotiations, Camacho replied:    [Camacho] This is a matter we, the Mexican people, are going  to resolve. That is the position of the EZLN and the  government. This is the position of all political forces.    [Guerrero] And so, the process continues. Camacho Solis said  there have been private communications on several points,  including the one dealing with General Absalom Castellanos. The  peace commissioner told the press that until now he has not made  a statement that has not been in line with the facts. He showed  an optimistic outlook, but he warned there is still a risk that  the talks with the EZLN will reach an impasse -- a situation  that would bring about negative consequences.

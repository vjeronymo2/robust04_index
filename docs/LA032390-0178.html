			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. WINS BIG TOKYO CONCESSIONS ON SALE OF SUPERCOMPUTERS  </P> <P> Negotiators today reported the first breakthrough in the long list of  contentious trade disputes with Japan -- an agreement designed to open the  Japanese market to American-made supercomputers.  </P> <P> Officials at the U.S. Trade Office said negotiators from both sides  </P> <P> bargained late into the night Thursday, hammering out details of the proposal.  </P> <P> The announcement represented the first breakthrough on a host of contentious  trade disputes between the two countries.  </P> <P> The dispute over sales of supercomputers centered around American demands that  the Japanese remove various restrictions that have effectively barred U.S.  companies from selling supercomputers to Japanese universities and government  agencies.  </P> <P> "If implemented, we think this will give us full and effective access to the  Japanese government market," said Timothy O'Leary, an official at the U.S.  Trade Office.  </P> <P> Under the agreement reached during two days of talks in Washington, the  Japanese promised to open up the procurement process for supercomputers to  foreign firms and to base government decisions on purchases on quality as well  as price.  </P> <P> The market for supercomputers was one of three areas targeted last year when  the Bush Administration put Japan on a "hit list" of countries with the most  onerous barriers to the sale of American products. Talks have also been  proceeding on the two other products on the list -- U.S. satellites and lumber  products. But negotiators on those issues have reported that both sides remain  far apart on American demands to open up those markets.  </P> <P> Still, there have been reports from Tokyo that Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki  Kaifu is preparing an array of trade concessions in these areas as well.  </P> <P> Kaifu and President Bush met last month in California for a hastily arranged  summit meeting where both leaders pledged to make greater efforts to reduce  America's huge $49-billion trade deficit with Japan.  </P> <P> Access to the government supercomputer market has long been a point of  contention between the two countries. U.S. firms, in particular Cray Research  Inc., have dominated the market for the sophisticated machines around the world  but have been unable to sell their products to the Japanese government.  </P> <P> U.S. negotiators estimate that the potential for sales to the Japanese  government is about $130 million annually.  </P> <P> Dennis McGrath, a spokesman for Cray, said his company will withhold its  comment until reviewing the details of the agreement.  </P> <P> "We hope this is more than just a process thing, but something that will  translate into sales in the marketplace," McGrath said.  </P> <P> The Japanese are under pressure to make concessions on satellites,  supercomputers and wood products before a June 16 deadline, at which time the  Bush Administration will have the authority to retaliate by imposing higher  tariffs on Japanese products.  </P> <P> The talks on specific industries are being conducted under a section of the  1988 trade law known as Super 301. The Administration is also conducting  discussions on broader structural impediments.  </P></p>

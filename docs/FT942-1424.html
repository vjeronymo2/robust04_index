			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Unit trust draft changes published Changes making the regulatory regime for unit trusts simpler and more flexible could be in place by September, after draft rules were published yesterday by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog. The rules relate only to the less controversial proposals for deregulation in the unit trust industry, however. They do not deal with the issue of moving from a system of 'dual pricing' to one of single pricing even though this has been the subject of growing consensus within the industry. An increasing number of unit trust managers believe that the pricing system, under which investors buy units at an 'offer' price and sell at a lower 'bid' price, is a barrier to selling unit trusts, especially outside the UK. Pressure for single pricing is expected to intensify with the introduction into the UK of open-ended investment companies, a form of pooled investment already common in other European countries and in North America, perhaps as early as next year. Single pricing and the question of allowing performance-related fees for geared futures and options funds will be addressed separately in a further consultation paper from the board later this year. Among the most important issues covered in the rules which will be implemented more quickly is the proposal that the board's lists of approved securities and derivatives markets should be replaced with a duty on the managers to ensure that the markets where they invest meet certain criteria. The change would allow unit trusts to invest in a much wider range of emerging markets. Exit fees will also be allowed for all types of funds, and newspapers will no longer have to print routinely the cancellation price of unit trusts. The cancellation price, which is the minimum bid price, applies when the fund is shrinking and its manager is forced to sell investments. A paper from the Treasury on the introduction into the UK of the open-ended investment company is expected within the next few months.</p>

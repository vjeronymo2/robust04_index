This proposal would reduce the number of annual requests for temporary final rules for regattas and marine parades and codifying these marine events in the Code of Federal Regulation would streamline the implementation process. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before November 7, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments should be mailed to the Commander, Eighth Coast Guard District (dl) (CGD 08&hyph;94&hyph;019), 501 Magazine St., New Orleans, LA 70130&hyph;3396, or may be delivered to room 1311 of the Hale Boggs Federal Building at the same address between 8 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays.

This rulemaking would eliminate the need to prepare annual temporary final rules for those annual marine events that have few or no changes from year to year. If this rule is adopted, the rules would be effective at the same time each year without need for temporary rules. The Coast Guard would issue event information in the Local Notice to Mariners. This would streamline the marine event process for those regattas and marine events that have very little annual variation and would significantly reduce the Coast Guard's administrative burden for managing these type events. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The marine events requiring this regulation are regattas and marine parades that occur annually in the Eighth District of the United States Coast Guard with little or no variation in location, time frame, and sponsors. Table 1 delineates the events, their sponsors, dates, and locations. Each event occurs annually on or about the date given. The course will be patrolled by patrol vessels. While viewing the event at any point outside the regulated area is not prohibited, spectators will be encouraged to congregate within areas designated by the sponsor. Non-participating vessels will be permitted to transit the area at  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NO WAKE SPEED <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at the discretion of the Coast Guard Patrol Commander. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

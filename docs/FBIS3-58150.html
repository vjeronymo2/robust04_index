			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F> correspondent Gordon Brewer in Brussels on 7 January; from the  "Newsnight" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Brewer] Why is there such reluctance to set a  timetable for bringing East European countries into the alliance?    [Woerner] The reason is very simple. You are confronted with  two historic tasks. One, which is always forgotten, is the main  historic objective of building a new comprehensive Euro-Atlantic  security structure that will include Russia, not exclude it.  That is in the interests of all European nations, especially  the nations of Central and East Europe. The second historic  task is to anchor those who belong to the West, the new  democracies, firmly in the structures of the West.    [Brewer] So it's your hope that the Partnerships for Peace  can be a prelude to NATO membership and not a substitute for it?    [Woerner] That is not my hope, that is my certitude for some  of them. Some of them may and will become members -- at least  that's my expectation. Others will use the Partnership for  Peace just to improve cooperation with us.    [Brewer] Have you had a rough time with the British, French,  and Americans? I mean after all you were much keener on this  idea than they were.    [Woerner] I would not call it a rough time, rather a very  interesting time. Well this is an alliance of several,  important nations. This is a very important question, one of  the most important ones with very, very complicated conclusions  and consequences, so obviously you need a certain type of  discussion to harmonize your views and to come to a consensus.  I think we will reach it clearly at the summit; we have  prepared it very carefully.    [Brewer] If we are to concentrate on being friends with the  Russians as well, what is the point of having NATO?    [Woerner] NATO is the only remaining real element of global  stability today. The transatlantic axis that links the two most  important power centers of the West -- North America and West  Europe -- is rightly seen not only by our member nations but  also by others as the core of any future security structure. If  you separate North America from Europe you will create a lot of  additional dangers.    [Brewer] What are you going to say to the East Europeans  after the summit when they say to you: Look, thank you very  much, but we are frightened of resurgent Russian nationalism.  We have got Mr. Zhirinovskiy saying he is going to invade us in  10 minutes if he can get away with it. We need not all these  fine words, we need Article V, we need a cast-iron guarantee  that our security lies with Europe.    [Woerner] The first thing I would say to them is the closer  you move to NATO the more secure you will be. The second is  that there is not this alternative between guarantee and vacuum;  that's the wrong alternative. The third is if you cooperate  closely with NATO, whatever happens in Russia your security is  inseparably linked to ours, so if there would be anybody who  would think it appropriate to attack or invade those countries,  he would still have to calculate NATO reactions.</p>

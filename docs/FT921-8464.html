			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / (CORRECTED) Spar withdraws Italian wines Correction (published 12th February 1992) appended to this article. SPAR, the grocery chain, yesterday withdrew two own-label brands of Italian wine from its shelves after contamination fears. The Valpolicella and Soave wines came from the same supplier as Pinot Grigio and Merlot wines recalled by Marks and Spencer after fungicide was found in the drinks. Gateway, the food retailer, said it had withdrawn one of its Italian white wines, Pinot Bianco del Zenato, which came from the same Italian supplier. Correction (published 12th February 1992). IN some editions of yesterday's issue, it was stated that Gateway, the supermarket chain, had withdrawn from sale one of its Italian white wines, Pinot Bianco del Zenato. Gateway says that this was an error in its press release and the wine withdrawn was in fact Pinot Bianco del Veneto. No Zenato wines are involved in the recently reported withdrawals of wines feared to be contaminated with fungicides.</p>

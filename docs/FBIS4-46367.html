			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, 4 Jun (SANA)--Iranian Foreign Minister  Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati and his delegation today left Damascus  following a two-day visit to Syria.    He was seen off at Damascus International Airport by Foreign  Minister Faruq al-Shar', senior Foreign Ministry staff, the  Iranian ambassador in Damascus, and the embassy staff.    Dr. Velayati made a statement to a SANA correspondent in  which he said: My visit to Damascus was very positive and  cordial. I had the honor to meet President Hafiz al-Asad and  convey to him a message from Hashemi-Rafsanjani, president of  the Islamic Republic of Iran. Discussion during the meeting  also revolved around bilateral ties, the situation in the  region, the recent Nonaligned Movement meeting in Cairo, and the  developments that occurred within the Nonaligned Movement and  its very positive attitude toward the Lebanese and Bosnian  issues.    Dr. Velayati noted that the discussion also revolved around  the savage Israeli aggression against Lebanon and the Lebanese  citizens. He said: We stressed Syria's and Iran's support for  Lebanon -- government and people -- and for its steadfastness in  the face of these aggressions.</p>

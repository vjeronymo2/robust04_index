Last Tuesday  and Wednesday the city of Zahedan witnessed an all-out war.    A group of armed men who were apparently protesting the  destruction of a Sunni mosque in Mashhad began demonstrating  against the regime in a mosque in the center of Zahedan.  JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI's correspondent reports that they tore Islamic  Republic flags and chanted slogans against the leaders of the  Islamic government.    At the same time, revolution guards and policemen, who had  prepared the city for a celebration of the anniversary of  Ayatollah Khomeyni's arrival in Iran, fired on the demonstrators  and received return fire from them.    For about half a day Khayyam Street in the center of the  city  of Zahedan and the surrounding areas became a complete war zone  and the scene of heavy fighting.    Several residents of the city told news correspondents that  the windows of their homes had been broken by bullets.    IRNA gave no further details, but it insisted that the  demonstrators are counterrevolutionaries and that these  incidents mostly take place on the days of the anniversary of  the revolution, and it added: The hezbollah nation resisted the  counterrevolutionaries, and despite the situation that  developed, the ceremonies were held. Figures on the numbers  killed and wounded have not yet been published.    Reliable reports from the province of Khuzestan also tell of  an atmosphere of unrest that is worrisome for the regime. Last  week a group making contact with news agencies and Iranian and  foreign publications reported mass arrests of their friends and  associates. On the other hand, the Islamic Republic Government  published a statement according to which national and army  officials have the direct permission of the president of the  republic to leave the country at any time. The issuance of such  an order by the government, in view of the existing  circumstances in Iran, indicates various kinds of problems.    Based on reports received from Iran, the unrest in Zahedan  began when a report was received from Mashhad that the regime  intended to destroy the Sunni mosque in Mashhad. The protest  against this began initially with a gathering that took  political sanctuary in Zahedan's Maki Mosque, and then it led to  a demonstration where attacks were made against the decorations,  lamps, and placards, which were made to mark the beginning of  the Ten Days of Dawn celebration. In this attack two  revolutionary guardsmen were killed and several of them were  wounded.    According to the newsletter of the expatriate organization  HEZB-E MELLAT-E IRAN, Mowlavi 'Abdolhamid, Friday Imam of  Zahedan, is one of the wounded. His wounds are said to be  "severe."    Talks with Mowlavi 'Abdolhamid by the Islamic Republic's  representatives, who had come from Tehran to calm the unrest,  ended with no result.    In the midst of this, 'Ali Khamene'i, commander in chief of  the armed forces, appointed 'Ali Mohammad Basharati to replace  him for three years on the police force so the regime will be  better able to resist uprisings. The Islamic government also  staged a demonstration on its own behalf in Zahedan. In this  demonstration the regime's mercenaries chanted slogans in favor  of the government and against what they called  counterrevolutionaries.</p>

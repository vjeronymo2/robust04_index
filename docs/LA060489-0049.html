			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHARING CREDITS  </P> <P> Leon Whiteson's recent story ("Chairs on Exhibit: The Bottom Line," May 15)  kindly described me as the designer of the Evolutionary Chair, which was part  of the recent "Chair as Art" display at the Gallery of Art on Main Street in  Santa Monica. To be fair, my colleagues at Gwynne Pugh and Associates -- Gwynne  Pugh and James Dove -- also should receive the credit due them for their work  on that piece.  </P> <P> LARRY SCARPA  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Emission Limits for Finishing Operations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There are four methods of complying with the finishing material emission limits in the proposed rule as outlined in Tables 3 and 5. These include an averaging approach, the use of specific compliant materials, the use of a control device, or some combination of compliant materials and a control device. There are also special compliance provisions for sources using a compliant coatings approach that apply coatings using continuous coaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An owner or operator that chooses the averaging approach can demonstrate initial compliance by recording the HAP and solids content, as reported on the certified product data sheet (CPDS), for each finishing material and solvent used by the facility in finishing operations and the quantity of each solvent and finishing material that is used. A CPDS is documentation furnished by coating suppliers or an outside laboratory that provides the HAP and solids content of the finishing material (or adhesives or solvent), as determined using the EPA Methods 311 and 24, respectively. The EPA Method 311, which is used to determine the HAP content of a coating or solvent, is being proposed with this rule. Currently, the method is only applicable for volatile HAP's. A modified version of the test method is being developed for determining the HAP content of coatings in which the HAP is used as a reactive diluent or the HAP is formed and emitted during the curing process. After it is completed, the modified version of the method should be used for these coatings. The owner or operator must then calculate the average kg VHAP/kg solids (lb VHAP/lb solids) for all finishing materials, as applied, used at the facility using Equation 1 of &sect;63.804(a)(1) of the proposed rule. Initial compliance is demonstrated if, over the first month after the compliance date, E (the average emission limitation achieved by the emission points participating in the averaging approach) is less than or equal to 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids) for existing sources or 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids) for new sources. Continuous compliance is demonstrated by performing the same averaging calculation over each and every subsequent monthly period. A violation of the monthly average would be considered a violation for each operating day of the month, unless the affected source can demonstrate that the violation of the monthly average can be attributed to a particular day or days during the month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An owner or operator that uses compliant finishing materials can demonstrate initial and on-going compliance with the limits for affected stains, washcoats, sealers, topcoats, basecoats, and enamels by recording the HAP and solids content, as reported in the CPDS, for each affected stain, washcoat, sealer, topcoat, basecoat, and enamel used by the facility. The owner or operator must then calculate the kg VHAP/kg solids (lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, for each of these materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> TRIUMPHANT HOMECOMING FOR KATE TAMARKIN AT MEADOWS  </P> <P> If conducting is still one of the last male bastions, Kate Tamarkin is sure to  help storm the ramparts.  </P> <P> Saturday night, she led the Pacific Symphony in its third summer concert at the  Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. It was a triumphant homecoming for the Laguna  Beach native after 10 years of studies and engagements away from the West  Coast.  </P> <P> From the opening strains of Berlioz's "Roman Carnival" Overture to the finale  of Stravinsky's 1919 "Firebird" Suite, Tamarkin demanded precision, and her  players responded with clean, balanced lines.  </P> <P> At times when passion might have ruled, Tamarkin's interpretations did not  stress overt sensuality. In the Berlioz piece, the amorous melody -- engagingly  introduced by Leanne Becknell on English horn -- emphasized an easily unfolding  grace. Even Stravinsky did not tempt Tamarkin; in "The Princesses' Round,"  woodwinds and horn passed plaintive lines among themselves in unhurried and  shimmeringly clear ensembles.  </P> <P> But logic and clarity do not preclude excitement. Under Tamarkin's direction  the orchestra made sense out of the wilder sections of "Firebird" -- the  Infernal Dance and the Finale -- but biting rhythmic propulsion insured  electrifying energy as well.  </P> <P> While the Pacific Symphony's guest conductor may have sidestepped chances to  tug at the heartstrings, violinist Elmar Oliveira ventured to leave no heart  untouched.  </P> <P> True, Mendelssohn's E-minor Concerto is so popular that it is by now hard to  bring fresh ideas to this much-programmed piece. Instead, Oliveira succumbed to  the siren of overly serious hokem, seizing every sigh with a loving caress in  the opening movement, saved only by the performer's ability to impart a sense  of intensity to his work.  </P> <P> Even intensity could not save the second movement. Oliveira brought a serious  but unenlightening approach to the Andante, ultimately failing to find a  definitive direction.  </P> <P> He did, however, find his footing in a rather fast final movement, which does  not require profound interpretive perspicacity -- nimbleness and a knack for  fun will do. Oliveira provided ample gaiety. And Tamarkin led his orchestral  partners with a clarity that characterized the evening.  </P> <P> Attendance on this evening was reportedly 1,500 greater than at the third  concert of last summer's series. If the screams that greeted Tamarkin's  entrance were any indication, at least some of the 6,587 had come to offer a  welcome to a returning friend.  </P></p>

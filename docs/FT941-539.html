			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Deutsche Bahn fined Ecu11m: Brussels accuses German rail monopoly of abusing its position The German state rail company, Deutsche Bahn, is to be fined Ecu11m (Pounds 8.3m) by the European Commission for using cut-price rail tariffs to encourage freight traffic to use the German port of Hamburg. The Commission said the fines, the largest levied on a rail group to date, had been imposed because Deutsche Bahn had abused its monopoly position, distorting the market by discouraging traffic away from Belgian and Dutch ports. Deutsche Bahn yesterday refused to indicate whether it would accept the ruling, insisting that it had not yet received the details of the decision. However, company officials indicated that the decision, taken at a meeting of the Commission yesterday, had come as a suprise, and suggested that the company might appeal against it. 'We were not expecting a fine this large. We were not expecting a fine at all,' said Mr Ulrich Kurth, Deutsche Bahn's representative in Brussels. Commission officials said the size of the fine reflected the fact that the infringement had occurred over a 'considerable period', with the full knowledge of the management. The decision follows an 18-month investigation into the rail route, which concluded that the price charged by Deutsche Bahn for container freight from Rotterdam to Germany was often 44 per per cent higher than the price charged on trains from Hamburg to Germany. In some cases, the Commission added, the price differential was as much as 77 per cent, even though the fiercer competition on these western routes should have made these prices lower. As a result, it concluded, ports like Rotterdam and Antwerp had been significantly disadvantaged compared to Hamburg, and freight had been encouraged to travel by road rather than rail. 'These practices have appreciably restricted competition, firstly between the railway companies and the combined-transport operators serving the various routes, and, secondly, between the German ports and other ports in the Community,' the Commission said. According to officials the large fine reflects the increasingly tough line the Commission is seeking to take against transport monopolies in the European Union, particularly in the area of combined-transport operators. The last fine in the rail sector occurred 18 months ago, when the International Union of Railways, a worldwide association of railway companies, was fined Ecu1m for restricting the sale of tickets. But in the past two years the Commission has stepped up its warnings to other operators, including British Rail and other potential cross-Channel operators, against adopting any practices which could be construed as anti-competitive.</p>

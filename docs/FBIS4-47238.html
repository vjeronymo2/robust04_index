			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Kim, KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA: "In the Unity </F> of Speech and the Press"]    [Text] The printing industry of Kazakhstan has ended up a  captive of the severance of economic relations. Its life depends  100 percent on imported equipment, binding materials, ink,  paper, and other raw materials. The problems of this industry  are now shared by all Central Asian republics of the former  Union.    The leaders of the press systems of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan,  Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan decided that a way to  overcome the crisis should be sought jointly. Last year, they  established an interstate regional commission for the issues of  printing, the press, and book publishing on the initiative of  A.S. Sarsenbayev, Kazakhstan Republic minister of the press and  mass information. The commission was headed by Yanvarbek  Tlevlenov, director of the Dauir republic newspaper and magazine  publishing house.    The results of one year of joint work were summed up in  Almaty at a regular conference of the ranking leaders of the  systems of the press and mass information of the Central Asian  states and Kazakhstan. A KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent  asked [first initial illegible] U. Sandybayev, a Kazakhstan  Republic deputy minister for press and mass information, to  discuss the activities of the interstate regional commission.    "During this period, the working group of the commission  held  conferences in Tashkent, Ashgabat, Dushanbe, and Bishkek. The  potential of each region from the standpoint of organizing its  own production of import-substituting materials with the  existing raw-material and technical resources was evaluated. We  are quite in a position to manage ourselves in the publishing  business.    "Thus, Uzbekistan is prepared to establish, of course with  support from neighbors, the production of PVA [polyvinylacetate]  glue, which is indispensable in book publishing. The Uzbek  Varnish and Paint Plant can master the joint production of  printer's inks, binding materials, and bookbinder's cloth.    "The issue of paper is also being resolved. Only two  specialized enterprises that manufacture cardboard and  writing-wrapping paper from imported raw materials and waste  paper operate in the Central Asian region; these are the Uzbek  Uzbum Joint-Stock Company and the TsKZ [pulp-and-cardboard  plant] in Kzyl-Orda. Given the current state of affairs, it is  necessary to support them not only through steady waste paper  deliveries but also through funding from the budget. Following a  partial retooling of the Kzyl-Orda TsKZ they would be able to  establish the production of writing and printing grades of paper  there.    "Representatives of Kazakhstan proposed another way to solve  this problem. There are Chinese technologies for boiling pulp  out of cereal straw and manufacturing various grades of paper  with the pulp. Specialists from the Kazakhstan Ministry of the  Press and Mass Information and the Kzyl-Orda TsKZ have already  visited such operating enterprises in the PRC. Chinese experts  have managed to familiarize themselves with our conditions and  potential. It was resolved that the construction of several  pulp-boiling plants in the vicinity of the breadbaskets of  Kazakhstan is feasible.    "The Tajik regional commission submitted interesting  information. Experiments aimed at producing paper by the  unconventional method of 'wood molding' with the use of a  completely new principle of polymerization in the electrical  field are underway in Tajikistan. Wood of all types is suitable  for manufacturing such paper. The Tajikistan Government is  financing this project. In addition, they are working on  producing rolled aluminum and PVA glue at one of the local  plants.    Turkmenistan is also making its contribution to the common  cause. Jointly with the Turkmensnab, the printing industry is  "pushing through" spare quotas for alumina, sulfur, soot,  silicates, and other raw materials necessary to manufacture  printing supplies.    Deliveries of spare parts, modules, and assemblies for  printing equipment have become a headache to all enterprises of  the industry. At present, general combined requests for the  assortment of spare parts are being drawn up. The plan is to  manufacture the spare parts at heavy machine building plants in  Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The Tashkent State Design and  Scientific Research Institute for the Integrated Design of  Printing Industry Enterprises, the sole specialized design  institute in the region, has become involved in solving the  issue of a shortage of offset plates. Technical calculations  have indicated that the most advantageous scenario calls for  establishing a joint-stock company for the production of  bimetallic offset plates in Karagandy at the facilities of local  enterprises. The contract of incorporation has already been  signed; preparatory work is already underway.    "However, the development of the industry is naturally  impossible without the participation of other printing industry  representatives of the once united state. For this reason, the  Kazakhstan Ministry of the Press and Mass Information appealed  to our Commonwealth colleagues for pooling our efforts in  solving our common problems.    "Prospects have been mapped out, and the outcome of a  well-conceived breakthrough toward cooperation as equals on the  printing-industry market of the CIS will now depend on  coordination and mutual understanding."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, June 22 (XINHUA) -- China's main grain and  cotton producer, Hubei Province, has stepped up efforts to  construct agricultural production bases.    It has invested nearly 500 million yuan (about 62 million  U.S. dollars) in building the bases since 1985.    The bases are now playing an important role in leading and  promoting local agricultural production.    The province has built 29 grain production bases, covering  50  percent of its farmland and accounting for 64 percent of the  total grain output.    Some 14 high-quality cotton bases and 81 farm technology  promotion centers have also been built in the province.    Hubei has obtained loans from international organizations  totalling 12.1 million U.S. dollars and 250 million Japanese yen  to carry out agricultural development projects in the Wuling  mountains and western Hubei.    A loan amounting to 48 million yuan from the World Bank has  also been used to improve soil in the province.</p>

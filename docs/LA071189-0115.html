			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO CO. JOINS DRIVE TO HALT TRABUCO STADIUM  </P> <P> Plans for a long-awaited stadium for Mission Viejo's Trabuco Hills High School  -- which now shares a football stadium with three other high schools -- may  again be delayed because the Mission Viejo Co. has joined forces with neighbors  who do not want the complex near their homes.  </P> <P> Despite objections from a number of residents, trustees for the Saddleback  Valley Unified School District approved plans in February to build a 5,000-seat  stadium at the southwestern edge of the high school campus on Cordova Road near  Los Alisos Boulevard.  </P> <P> Neighbors complained that the visitors' bleachers would be 28 feet from  back-yard fences of some homes, District Supt. Peter Hartman said, and that the  games would generate too much noise and traffic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Impact Report Requested  </P> <P> On Friday, the Mission Viejo Co. took a legal step to try to halt the plans.  The company filed a writ of mandate in Orange County Superior Court, asking for  a court order that would force the district to file an environmental impact  report on a stadium.  </P> <P> The stadium is part of a larger sports complex for the high school that will  include tennis courts, an all-weather track, a swimming pool and an auxiliary  gymnasium.  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills High now plays its home football games at Mission Viejo High  School, about five miles away; that facility serves all four district high  schools.  </P> <P> Because the school district is its own legal entity, it is not required to  obtain approval from the city for its stadium plans, Mission Viejo city planner  Chuck Wilson said.  </P> <P> The district filed a declaration with the state that the proposed project did  not require an environmental report because it would not greatly disrupt the  neighborhood.  </P> <P> But residents and the Mission Viejo Co. disagreed, contending that the new  stadium will create traffic jams and parking problems in the neighborhood and  that the lights and noise during night games will disrupt the area's quiet.  </P> <P> The district's plans originally called for adding just 38 stadium parking  spaces to the school's current 405 slots. Bill Bonsall, one of the residents  who is leading opposition to the stadium site, said that number is not nearly  enough to handle game crowds.  </P> <P> The district at one point had proposed asking students to ride shuttle buses  from other locations to the games.  </P> <P> "That's a dream," Bonsall said.  </P> <P> He emphasized that neighbors are not opposed to the idea of a stadium and they  just want to make sure that the district provides adequate parking, or that it  builds the stadium somewhere else, even on another part of the campus.  </P> <P> The deadline to file a protest to the district's declaration was July 8,  Mission Viejo Co. spokeswoman Wendy Wetzel said.  </P> <P> "We are not opposed to the stadium," Wetzel said. "We just wanted to stop the  clock.  </P> <P> "We are saying there have been some violations of (environmental impact)  guidelines. We are saying, let's go back and do it right."  </P> <P> She added that the lawsuit is unrelated to a Mission Viejo Co. proposal to  build a movie complex in the same neighborhood, which will go before the city  Planning Commission soon for approval.  </P> <P> Supt. Hartman said he is surprised by the Mission Viejo Co.'s move, because it  was the company that built and designed the city, even determining where the  high school would be located. The company also graded the existing football  field -- the site for the proposed stadium.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Being Considered for Years  </P> <P> Hartman said he is also irked by residents coming around only in the last few  months to complain about a plan that has been under consideration for years.  </P> <P> "For these people to be claiming they didn't know about it is just absurd,  absurd," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: British Steel cannot confirm sale of plants to Vallourec BRITISH STEEL reacted last night to speculation about the future of its seamless tube business by saying it could not confirm that there was any intention to sell its two Lanarkshire plants to Vallourec of France, writes Andrew Baxter. The steelmaker was responding to reports that it was in talks to sell the Clydesdale and Imperial plants, which employ about 400 people, to the French steel tubes producer. There has been speculation for some time over British Steel's intentions in the seamless tube business, which according to some estimates suffers from excess production capacity of as much as 50 per cent worldwide. It is understood that British Steel has had talks with Vallourec, but that it has also been in contact with other seamless tube producers. British Steel shut its outdated, high-cost rotary forge - used for making the tubes - at Clydesdale two years ago, and now imports 'green' or unfinished tubes from Vallourec and other suppliers. It retains heat treatment equipment at Clydesdale, while the Imperial plant finishes and threads the pipes, and also produces a sophisticated internal coupling for the tubes under licence from Vallourec. The tubes are used principally for 'downhole' and other applications in the North Sea.</p>

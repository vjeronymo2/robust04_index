			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL SPILL: 'THERE WAS NO EXCUSE'  </P> <P> Those of us who remember George Bush touring Boston Harbor with so much fanfare  last year during the campaign are, to some extent, disappointed in the lack of  enthusiasm on his part to personally survey the results of a failed  environmental policy, which now fouls the waters of Prince William Sound.  </P> <P> Nobody can deny that the environment is one area that suffers the most from the  Administration's laissez-faire attitude and that we cannot depend on large  corporations to police themselves in the exploitation of our natural resources,  to protect the air, water and the land that belongs to us all.  </P> <P> We cannot afford any more oil spills or an Administration that abdicates its  responsibility to protect the environment under siege by corporate plunderers.  I don't know if we can wait four years for a strong and forceful leader to  rescue this kinder, gentler nation from benign neglect.  </P> <P> LEOPOLD de VOGEL  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Russian 'blue chips' in search for pioneers  -International offerings When JSC Rosneftegazstroy (RNGS), a Russian oil and gas construction company, announced last week that it is seeking to raise Dollars 25.5m by selling 3.7 per cent of its shares to international investors, the news did not grab headlines. However, in a week in which managers of five 'self-styled' blue chip Russian companies came to London to present their businesses to potential international investors, it provided another reminder of Russia's status as an increasingly fashionable emerging market. In spite of huge risks, including widespread crime and a primitive stock market, over Dollars 500m a month in overseas money is flowing into Russian companies, attracted by returns in some cases of several hundred per cent a year. Several funds, most of them launched this year, allow institutions to buy into Russian companies, often through the over-the-counter market (which accounts for the bulk of stock market trades). These have helped crystallise investor interest. Baring Asset Management hopes to launch a fund of not less than Dollars 100m later this month, following the example of companies such as Framlington, which raised Dollars 66m with its Framlington Russian Investment Fund last December, and Fleming, which launched its Dollars 55m Fleming Russia Securities Fund last month. Hong Kong-based Regent Fund Management, which launched its Dollars 20m White Tiger Investment Company last month, is one a number of other fund managers keen on Russia. The company announcing its capital-raising plans this week, RNGS, is following in the footsteps of Gazprom, the largest gas producer in Russia. The government two months ago appointed Kleinwort Benson to sell up to 9 per cent of Gazprom's shares to overseas investors, either through a private placement or international issue. RNGS, the legal successor to the Soviet Ministry for Oil and Gas Construction, has permission ultimately to sell 10 per cent of its shares. Desperate for capital, many Russian companies could follow suit. Many of the biggest are now beginning to organise their accounts and other operations more efficiently. Ms Beth Hebert, fund manager for the Fleming Russia Securities Fund, said last week's 'blue chip' roadshow in London signalled a sea change in attitudes in Russian business. 'It is not very often you get a chance to hear directly from these companies. It is quite a change from where we were a few months ago when people didn't even return phone calls,' she said. CA, the Moscow-based brokerage which organised the meeting, said a number of Russian companies are preparing to issue global depositary receipts from January. Ms Danielle Downing, a director of CA, said she expects Russian banks, which are more accustomed to producing audited accounts and have relatively strong balance sheets, to be among the first categories of companies to issue GDRs. Later, Russia's huge utilities and energy companies could follow. Possible candidates include United Energy System of Russia, one of the companies in London last week, and Lukoil, the country's biggest oil company. GDR issues may increase the acceptability of Russia to a wider spectrum of investors, but mainstream investors are likely to remain on the sidelines for sometime. Mr Jim Mellon, managing director of Regent, is bullish but warns: 'This is absolute pioneer stuff. There are bound to be disasters on the way.'</p>

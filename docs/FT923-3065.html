			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Ulster electricity sell-off postponed THE completion of the privatisation of Northern Ireland's electricity industry was postponed last night In a surprise announcement, Mr Robert Atkins, Ulster's economy minister, said several outstanding matters needed to be resolved before the sell-off. Mr Atkins said: 'The most important of these relates to the funding of the proposed interconnector to Scotland and an application which the government has made to the European Commission for assistance towards its costs. 'The government strongly supports the application and hopes for its success but recognises the need for the commission to undertake a thorough evaluation of it. Consequently, although one option for the flotation of Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) was November 1992, it will not be possible to complete the sale this autumn. Once the outstanding matters have been resolved, the sale will take place as soon as possible, dependent on a suitable slot in the government's overall privatisation programme.' NIE and ScottishPower reached agreement on the Pounds 200m interconnector project earlier this year and it is thought the government is seeking about Pounds 70m from the commission towards the cost of construction. The first part of the sell-off took place in April when Ulster's four power stations went into private hands. British Gas bought the biggest station, Ballylumford near Larne, East Antrim; Nigen, an American-Belgian consortium, acquired Kilroot station, near Carrickfergus, East Antrim, and Belfast West station. A management-employee buy-out team bought the Coolkeeragh plant at Londonderry. The sales grossed about Pounds 300m for the Treasury. It had been anticipated that the transmission, distribution and supply business would be floated in November, raising a further Pounds 350m for the government. Advertisements have been running almost nightly on Ulster Television promoting the image of NIE, and the postponement has come as a shock.</p>

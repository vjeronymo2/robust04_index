			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Copyright plans alarm film world THE UK television and film industry has expressed its 'grave concern' to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, over European Commission copyright pro-posals. British broadcasters say plans from Brussels to harmonise copyright throughout the Community 'would wholly undermine the copyright system which governs audio-visual production in the UK'. A proposed directive would provide for 'equitable remuneration' for any actor appearing in a film or television programme being offered for video rental. All actors involved in a production would have a right to authorise or prohibit the renting of audiovisual works. The Commission originally sought to extend the controversial rights to all forms of distribution and reproduction, but that has been dropped. 'These provisions would be applied retrospectively with alarming implications for owners of film and programme libraries,' the letter warns. It is signed by senior executives from the BBC; ITV; Channel 4; Pact, the independent producers alliance; British Screen Finance; and by Mr David Puttnam and Sir Richard Attenborough, the film producers. The broadcasters and film makers believe the Commission has pursued its objectives without thinking of the implications for the UK industry or 'considered the damaging effect on European production and the benefits it will give to competitors outside the EC'. They want the British government to intervene when the issue comes before the Council of Ministers. Mr Clive Leach, chairman of ITV's European committee, said: 'Potentially this directive is a dagger pointed at the heart of European programme production. It will hamper investment in programmes and put us at a competitive disadvantage with America and Australia.' The directive would cover all works in copyright on July 1 1994, but will only be retrospective where artists have made a request to that effect before January 1997. The system of 'equitable remuneration' is due to begin in July 1997. Critics believe tens of thousands of contracts might have to be renegotiated.</p>

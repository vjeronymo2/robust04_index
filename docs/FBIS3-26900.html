They should choose the forms and areas of  cooperation they agree on and start cooperation in various  activities related to offshore oil resources as soon as  possible." This was the strong wish expressed by the members of  the delegation of the China Technology Service Association  during their mainland trip. The association's primary member is  the Taiwan China Petroleum Company.    Chen Bingqian, vice president of the China National Offshore  Oil Corporation, told the delegation that for many years the  mainland has hoped that Taiwan's petroleum industry would  participate in the mainland's offshore oil prospecting and  exploitation activities. He also praised the delegation's trip  as a good beginning for and a successful step toward cooperation  in oil resources between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.    The delegation is visiting at the invitation of the China  National Offshore Oil Corporation. It arrived in Beijing on 6  January and will return to Taiwan on 5 February.</p>

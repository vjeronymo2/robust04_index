			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Lloyds Chemists sees advance SHARES in Lloyds Chemists jumped 18 per cent to 235p yesterday following an optimistic trading statement from Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman and chief executive. Mr Lloyd said the board was prompted to make the announcement in the face of the sharp decline in the share price over the past month. The price has fallen steadily since June 17, when shares traded at 351p. The chairman said business remained resilient despite difficult conditions. For the present year like-for-like sales were 9 per cent ahead in the chemists division, 6 per cent in Drugstores, and 5 per cent for Holland &amp; Barrett, the healthfood retailer. In light of this, the board expected to increase the final final dividend by 33 per cent to 4p for the year to June 30, making a total of 5.55p. He warned, however, that pre-tax profits in the current year would be some Pounds 5m to Pounds 8m lower, due to the NHS decision to cut the cost of generic drugs. He added that Lloyds aimed to mitigate the decline through increased margins on own label products and over-the-counter sales. Mr Lloyd reassured investors that profits should be in line with expectations, unless the the NHS decided to backdate reimbursement for generic drugs to April 1. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 33m and Pounds 35m.</p>

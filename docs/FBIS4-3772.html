			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Hong Kong Deputies to NPC, Members of </F> CPPCC National Committee, Hong Kong Affairs Advisers, and  Members of Preparatory Working Committee Invited To Visit PLA  Training Camp in Guangdong"]    [Text] The Chinese Government will arrange the visit of  nearly 200 Hong Kong deputies to the National People's Congress  [NPC], members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC] National Committee, Hong Kong affairs  advisers, and members of the Preparatory Working Committee to  Guangzhou in order to inspect the training and study in People's  Liberation Army [PLA] units. Those being invited to visit the  barracks said that this would enable Hong Kong people to  increase their understanding of the PLA.    Some members of the Preparatory Working Committee last year  expressed their hope to inspecting the training of the PLA  troops. Yesterday, the Hong Kong NPC deputies, CPPCC National  Committee members, Hong Kong affairs advisers, and Preparatory  Working Committee members were notified by the XINHUA Hong Kong  Branch that a visit would be arranged to the PLA troops'  military training in Guangzhou on 30 April. According to the  arrangement, the visiting delegation will travel to Guangzhou by  train on the morning of 30 April. They will inspect the  training of the PLA troops that afternoon and will see dancing  and singing performances put on by the PLA units. Next day,  they will see the military performances and will then return to  Hong Kong in the afternoon. The delegation will be received by  the Guangzhou Military Region. This is aimed at enabling the  visitors to better understand the training, living, and study  conditions of the PLA troops.    Some people being invited on this visit said that it would  be  a good opportunity to come into direct contact with the PLA  personnel and this will be a good beginning for Hong Kong people  to have a better understanding of the PLA so that they can  dispel their misgivings.    Cheng Yiu-tong, a deputy to the NPC, said that Hong Kong  people did not know much about the PLA troops. This time, the  visit arranged by the Chinese Government will increase the  transparency of things and the authorities are also showing an  open-minded attitude. This will help Hong Kong people to better  understand about the lives of the troops, remove their  misgivings about the troops to be stationed in Hong Kong after  1997, and gradually establish their trust in the troops.    Liu Yiu-chu, another deputy to the NPC, said that between  now  and 1997, it is necessary to cause Hong Kong people and the PLA  personnel to have closer contacts and exchange opinions so that  the military personnel will better understand the mentality and  values of Hong Kong people as well as the legal system and  procedures in Hong Kong. This will ensure that the troops will  properly abide by the local laws after they are sent to Hong  Kong.    Some members of the Preparatory Working Committee believe  that Xu Huizi, deputy general chief of staff of the PLA, may  also participate in this activity. Xu once indicated that,  after 1997, the troops stationed in Hong Kong will be dispatched  from the Guangzhou Military Region. At present, the PLA troops  are receiving training in Guangzhou. They also study English,  Hong Kong laws, and the lifestyle in Hong Kong.</p>

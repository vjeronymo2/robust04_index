			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "L.B.": "Spain, EIB's Chief Recipient in </F> 1993"]    [Excerpt] Brussels -- During 1993, Spain was the chief  recipient of European Investment Bank [EIB] loans, totaling ECU4  billion (581 billion pesetas), earmarked for infrastructures and  industrial investments, representing 22.6 percent of the total  loans made within the European Union [EU]. The second recipient  is Italy, which took up 19 percent of the investments. EIB  investments outside the EU represent 9.6 percent of the  mobilized total.    The increase in EIB investments in Spain was 45 percent for  the year, thus overtaking the traditional chief recipient  country, which used to be Italy.    If it is estimated that EIB loans provide on average 30  percent of the amount invested in each project; the money  mobilized represents 14 percent of the investment in Spain in  1993. The EIB's investment decisions depend on the applications  and management ability of the states, which have to submit  coherent plans, well supported by profitability and  environmental impact studies.    The 1993 fiscal year was very good for the EIB, according to  its executives, who presented a balance sheet recording a 15  percent increase over the previous year and a ECU19.6 billion  (over 3.1 trillion pesetas) grand total of loans.    According to its president, Brian Unwin, the EIB "has played  a key role in the Community's economic recovery program,  especially with respect to financing the trans-European  networks."  <H5>  Unwarranted Accusations </H5>   The non-Community countries, primarily in North Africa and  Central and East Europe, took up ECU1.9 billion (300 billion  pesetas). Despite this, Brian Unwin stated that the  Mediterranean countries received over twice what was lent in the  previous year, and so it is unwarranted to accuse the bank of  paying greater attention to the East than to the south.    Half of the EIB's loans to Spain consisted of investments in  transport, prominent among which are the Madrid to Seville  high-speed train, the Bilbao to Santander line, the subway  systems of Bilbao, Madrid, and Valencia, two sections of  expressway in Barcelona, local roads in several provinces, new  terminals, the enlargement of airports in Palma, Madrid, and  Barcelona, and the modernization of the ports of Barcelona,  Bilbao, and Valencia. Some 15 percent of the loans were for  water supply and treatment. [passage omitted]</p>

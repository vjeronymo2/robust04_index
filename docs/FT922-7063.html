			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / 'The prime minister must be the final judge': Code of conduct for members of the government Warning on conflicts between private investments and public duties THE GOVERNMENT yester-day issued the guidelines on conduct that are given to each minister on taking office. On investments, the document urges ministers to 'order their affairs so that no conflict arises or is thought to arise between their private interests and their public duties'. Where there is doubt about an interest, 'it will almost always be better to relinquish or dispose of the interest, but in such cases the prime minister must be the final judge'. The document shows that Westminster and the City are miles apart in their approach to handling the many potential conflicts of interest that arise between private investments and public duties. City institutions generally take a permissive attitude: directors and other senior staff are allowed to own shares in companies they advise, for instance. Yet any dealings have to be disclosed internally - and many houses operate a policy of allowing staff to trade only with prior approval from a central compliance officer. Ministers are subjected to one general rule - that they avoid all conflicts of interest. Investments that could give rise to conflicts, or perception of conflicts, should be disposed of. Such guidance looks idealistic. 'It would be nice if you could see all conflicts in advance,' says Mr Colin Condron, compliance officer at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment bank. He suggested that one route for ministers might be to ban investments in equities, or restrict them to investment trusts. Alternatively, ministers could be required to put their shares into 'blind' trusts, under which they are not given any information about their investments - one of the suggestions in the document for ministers who have a wide range of investments. Even that may not save ministers from embarrassment: 2 1/2 years ago, Mr Cecil Parkinson, then transport secretary, was forced to issue a denial that he had been involved in insider dealing after share trans-actions undertaken by brokers WI Carr in the name of his nominee account. The official guidelines to ministers say they should declare to colleagues any private interest if they have to discuss public business in any way affecting it. They should also 'remain entirely detached from consideration of that business'. There is no formal restriction - other than the normal rules on MPs' interests, on former ministers taking up posts or other private-sector interests - 'although they should naturally avoid any course which would reflect adversely on their or the government's reputation for integrity or the confidentiality of its proceedings'. On taking up office, the document says, ministers should give up any other public appointment. Directorships: Ministers must resign all directorships when they take up office, the document says. The exceptions are directorships in private companies established in connection with private family estates  - and charitable organisations, unless there is a possible conflict of interest. Partners in professional firms should cease any role in day-to-day management of the firm's affairs, but need not dissolve their partnership or allow their annual practising certificate to lapse. 'It is not possible to lay down precise rules applicable to every case,' the document says. 'Ministers in doubt about their personal position should consult the prime minister.' Investments: Ministers cannot be expected to dispose of all investments. But if a minister holds a controlling interest in any company, the considerations are similar to those governing the holding of directorships. The document points out that an investment in concerns closely associated with a minister's department may create the danger of an actual or apparent conflict of interest arising from exercise of powers or other influence in a way that affects the value of the investment or from dealings where there may be reasonable suspicion that the minister has special knowledge. Ministers called upon to exercise any power or discretion or other influence that could give rise to an actual or apparent conflict of interest should delegate to another minister, and should take no part in the preparation or reaching of any relevant decisions. Ministers are bound by the provisions of the Companies Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985 in relation to the use or transmission of unpublished price-sensitive information obtained by virtue of their ministerial office. Ministers are also urged to avoid speculative investments about which they have, or may be thought to have, early or confidential information likely to affect the price. Ministers 'will wish to consider whether or not investments of their (minor) children and their spouse should be treated similarly to their own'. The document stresses that it is for ministers to judge what action they need to take in respect of investments, but they should record any action in a minute to the permanent secretary of the department. Membership of Lloyd's: The prime minister, the chancellor of the exchequer, the trade and industry secretary - and DTI and Treasury ministers responsible for matters relating to Lloyd's - should not be underwriting members of Lloyd's. Any such minister who has been an underwriting member should not exercise statutory powers affecting Lloyd's - or any syndicates, brokers or agents with which he or she is connected - until all syndicate years for which he or she was an underwriting member have been closed or until he or she has reinsured all liabilities in such a way that he or she has no further interest in their performance. A law officer who is an underwriting member of Lloyd's, or who still has open syndicate commitments in respect of past membership, should not tender advice on the formulation, application or enforcement of legislation relating to Lloyd's. It is 'inappropriate' for other ministers who are members of Lloyd's to take an active part in the management of the affairs of syndicates of which they are members. Ministers who are Lloyd's Names may be required to suspend underwriting risks in any area in which their departments have responsibility. Every minister is required on appointment to a first or subsequent ministerial office to obtain the prime minister's permission before continuing a connection with Lloyd's, however nominal. Any minister wishing to establish any such connection during his term of appointment should likewise obtain the prime minister's permission to do so. The secretary of the cabinet is required to keep a list of ministers who are members of Lloyd's. Cabinet business: Cabinet and ministerial-committee business is defined as consisting mainly of matters 'which significantly engage the collective responsibility of the government because they raise major issues of policy or because they are of critical importance to the public' and questions on which there is an unresolved argument between departments. Chairmen of ministerial committees are urged to limit references to the cabinet. The only automatic right of appeal is if Treasury ministers are unwilling to accept expenditure as a charge on the reserve. The document says the internal process through which a decision has been made should not be disclosed. Decisions reached by the cabinet or ministerial committees are binding on all members of the government. Ministers and the law officers: It will 'normally be appropriate to consult the law officers' in cases where: The legal consequences of action by the government might have important repercussions in the foreign, European Community or domestic field. A departmental legal adviser is in doubt concerning the legality, constitutional propriety or vires of proposed legislation or administrative action. There is a particular legal difficulty that may raise political aspects of policy. Two or more departments disagree on legal questions. By convention, written opinions of the law officers, unlike other ministerial papers, are generally made available to succeeding administrations. Opinions of or advice from the law officers must not be disclosed outside government without their authority. Accountability: Each minister is responsible to parliament for the conduct of his or her department. Public appointments: In considering candidates for public appointments, ministers should pay particular attention to securing, on merit, proper representation of women and members of ethnic minorities on public bodies. Acceptance of gifts and services: It is 'a well established and recognised rule' that no minister should accept gifts or services from anyone that would, or might appear to, place him or her under an obligation. The same principle applies if gifts etc are offered to a member of their family.</p>

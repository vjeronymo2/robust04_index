			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Maria Myles] </F>   [Text] Strasbourg, 12 Apr (CNA)--The head of the Turkish  parliamentary delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of  the Council of Europe (COE), Kemal Mimaroglu of the True Path  Party, told CNA that he envisages the current structure of  Cyprus being maintained as part of a Cyprus solution.    In an exclusive interview with CNA, he said "We must keep  the  actual structures of the Turkish and Greek sides."    He advocated "equal rights and equal representation  according  to the population."    To a remark by CNA that the 18 percent of the population of  Cyprus cannot have the 50 percent representation, Mimaroglu said  he could not give any figures.    Asked if he would recommend to the Turkish Cypriots to  return  to their seats in the legal House of Representatives, the  Turkish MP said "As it is now the actual structure of northern  and southern Cyprus cannot be made into one. It is not possible  to make it to one."    Advocating the making of a state in Cyprus for the two  communities, he said it had to maintain "completely the actual  structures of both sides."    He recommended negotiations under U.N. auspices and remarked  "We would like to see the two sides to have equal rights without  any discussion."    Mimaroglu made these statements to CNA after a press  conference he organised for a four-member delegation of  so-called Turkish Cypriot MP's.    At the press conference, the "MP's" set out their views and  claimed President Kliridhis had shifted from the original text  of the U.N. package of CBM's.    The "speaker" of "Turkish Cypriot Assembly" Ajarkan charged  that the U.N. had amended their original proposals to appease  President Kliridhis' demands.    Asked by CNA whether the Turkish Cypriot side was at odds  with the U.N., Ajarkan repeated the view that Denktas had  accepted in principle the CBM's but these were altered and  accused the U.N. for making repeated errors since 1964.</p>

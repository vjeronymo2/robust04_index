			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Dialogue between former KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov and </F> ZAVTRA Editor in Chief Aleksandr Prokhanov; place and date not  given: "Vladimir Kryuchkov: `National Security Is at Zero  Point'"]    [Text] [Prokhanov] Vladimir Aleksandrovich, in my  perception you are one of the last Soviet statesmen for whom the  collapse of the Soviet Union was a personal tragedy. At the  stages immediately preceding the destruction of the great power,  you began to actively and openly voice your position. In August  1991 you undertook a last desperate attempt to avert this  disintegration--an unsuccessful attempt, for which you paid with  a year and a half of incarceration, suffering, humiliation, and  political ostracism.    You must sense the existence of a certain design aimed at  the  destruction of the Soviet Union. There are conspiracy models, a  plot theory circulating in our patriotic circles. In part, it  appeals to me, although I understand very well that it is  difficult, for instance, to draw up a blueprint of a superplot  sometime at the beginning of our century and then consistently,  methodically implement it. Of course, there was a general trend  of efforts aimed at the destruction of the Soviet Union, and  within it there existed numerous doctrines, micro-projects, and  merely operations of our opponents. Some were successful; others  collapsed after encountering our ability to defend ourselves.    Speaking in the language of mythology rather than  intelligence or political science: There existed a certain  design for destroying the USSR. It included such tasks as, for  instance, squeezing the Soviet Union out of global zones of  confrontation: Africa, Asia. It contained a score of programs  aimed at weakening our geopolitical belts in Central and East  Europe. It definitely included the weakening of our military  potential, removing parity status through unilateral  disarmament, and absolute military collapse. It also had built  into it the destruction of state structures, in particular the  military.    Very little is known about the Soviet Union's withdrawal  from  East Europe, how the communist pro-Soviet regimes collapsed in  Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, and about the unification  of Germany. Its unification was accompanied by propaganda  slogans based on so-called "universal human values." In my  opinion, however, unification in Germany more than anything else  potentially holds a tremendous danger for the Europe of the 21st  century, including Russia. Did Gorbachev and the State Security  Committee take into account the potential consequences of this  unification; and generally, how did the Soviet Union leave East  Europe?    [Kryuchkov] Looking at the conspiracy model you described,  in  reality everything was simpler and at the same time more  complex. More complex in the sense that we did not sort out  right away the deep-seated internal and external factors that  led our country to tragedy. And simpler because plans to destroy  our Union have indeed been developed and implemented, because  the West saw a danger to itself in the existence of such a  powerful state.    Strictly speaking, the West did not conceal these plans.  Moreover, there are our own, domestic figures who only recently  were bragging that they had something to do with it, and that  they contributed to what has happened. Seeing the latest events  in the country, they became less vocal, though, because now the  moment of reckoning is coming. I think the time will still come  when these people will be held to answer.    I remember my conversation with former CIA Director Gates,  which took place in Moscow in 1990. He said then: "Mr.  Kryuchkov, would you like me to give you a very interesting  report, from which you will learn what will be happening in your  country in the year 2000, at the point of transition to another  century?" I said: "Of course." He promised to send me the  materials, and I promised in return to put on paper my  perception of global problems. He never sent the materials, but,  as I learned later, among other things the report said that in a  year or two the Soviet Union would no longer exist.    When the head of state security gets this kind of  information  firsthand, it tells you a lot. Our intelligence officers also  reported that it was commonly expected in the West that the plan  to break up the Soviet state would succeed in the near future.  And our own analytical evaluations as well led us to sad  conclusions. As KGB chairman (and before that, chief of foreign  intelligence for almost 15 years), I openly told Gorbachev in  1989, 1990, and 1991 of the impending danger.    The trouble was that this man never told the truth. He  hedged, dodged, and agreed: "Yes, yes." But no measures were  taken, and everything was sliding into an abyss. Moreover, some  of his actions did not fit with the notion of actions expected  of a statesman, whose responsibility it was to take care of  society and to try to forestall tragedy. The country was going  through a succession of failures, but instead of holding the  defense, and occasionally going on the offensive, all we did was  retreat, retreat...    The events that took place in the heart of Europe at the end  of 1989 are something we will long remember. Even in the West  the reaction to them was not at all uniform. In December 1989,  President of France Mitterrand came to the GDR on an official  three-day visit. And this at a time when the GDR already was  falling apart; groups of youth from West Germany were attacking  the building of the Ministry of State Security, and rallies had  been held in some cities for the unification of West and East  Germany.    Of course, Mitterrand was well informed of the current  events, but he wanted to demonstrate his goodwill stance toward  the German Democratic Republic. The point is that neither France  nor England were ready to see the GDR absorbed by West Germany.  They thought it would be a slow process, within the framework of  general European integration, in a form that would not affect  its future in any way. Because both France and England know what  a powerful unified Germany means...    I cannot say that the processes were totally unexpected for  us. The unexpected part was only that they rolled in so swiftly  and that the leadership of the Soviet Union completely resigned  themselves to it. I do not want to say that I was not related to  it at all. I raised these questions. If you dig into documents  you will find very alarming KGB memoranda addressed to  Gorbachev, in which we warned of what could happen.    As to Gorbachev, they valued him tremendously in Germany; he  was later declared a "No. 1 German" in West Germany. By the way,  Helmut Kohl said these notable words at the time: Germans should  not miss the chance of unification, and that chance is a result  of the fact that Gorbachev is at the helm of the Soviet Union.    You know, this was not just surrendering positions--it was a  real capitulation that happens only in the most serious defeat.  We fled not only from the GDR but also from other countries,  without a thought about our short-term interests. We welcomed  German unification--in reality, the absorption of the  GDR--without attaching any conditions to it. We abandoned our  property; we abandoned our friends, who had been with us for 40  years, on whom we drew for support and who helped us; because it  is hard to tell who gave more over the last few years: we to the  GDR or the GDR to us.    Then came the arrests of intelligence officers and  statesmen.  Erich Milke, minister of security and Hero of the Soviet Union,  is in jail now--a man who put his entire life on the altar of  internationalism, the altar of Soviet-German friendship. Some  other friends from the Ministry of State Security are in jail on  charges of horrendous crimes; and in general, many GDR statesmen  are in prison for allegedly committing crimes against Germany.  While all they did was carry out their duties as citizens of the  completely independent state of the GDR--recognized in the world  and, among others, at the United Nations... I think this is not  the end of it all; there will be more. Because Germany already  has revised the outcome of a world war once, and it cost us  alone 27 million human lives...    The story of the GDR is an ignominious page in our history,  a  shameful page, possibly with far-reaching consequences. If we  continue to remain so unwise, this may do tremendous damage to  our vital interests. You know how we lost many friends in  Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and many other places...    I am not saying that Germany will definitely go in a  direction fatefully detrimental for us. This depends on many  factors. But if we continue to remain in our current state,  whether we want it or not this will whet the appetite of other  countries. And we should not expect altruism in this respect.    [Prokhanov] It so happened that I went to Germany the day an  aircraft carrying the ill Honecker was leaving for the Soviet  Union from the same airport. He was coming to our country for  treatment, but in reality he was flying there to a future of  captivity, disgrace, humiliation, and arrest, perhaps knowing  deep in his heart that this is exactly what awaited him.  Gorbachev betrayed his trust--as he did with other allies,  effectively surrendering them to enemies and tormentors.    This is what I am thinking about, though. In 1945, when the  Russian Army entered Berlin and Europe was still smoldering in  the ashes of war, Stalin, together with the other leaders of  victorious countries, carved up Europe, established borders, and  accomplished a change of a social system in the countries of  East Europe. What immense, if perhaps tragic for the population,  measures were implemented across the entire enormous expanse  from the Baltics to the Black Sea! A geopolitical design was  implemented which, as rumor goes, had existed even before the  war in the mind of Tarle, who read Stalin his treatises, his  essays on a pan-Slavic union in Europe by the end of the 20th  century...    What I am saying is that after the war a superorganizational  design was implemented, the result of which was the emergence of  a pro-Soviet Europe. So why have all these efforts--military,  economic, geopolitical--been nullified overnight? After all,  there was already an entire generation of Czechs, Poles, and  Germans with values and a psychology that the West Germans, for  instance, still cannot grind out...    One would think that such failure can be sustained only as a  result of a strike, a crushing military defeat--of the kind that  happened, for instance, to the Germans in 1945. We were fleeing  from there as if we were under the fire of nuclear cannons and a  strategic bombers' strike! As it turned out, however, it all  happened after one or two trips by Gorbachev--one to Reykjavik,  another to Malta. Somebody said a few words to somebody;  somebody promised something to somebody; somebody shook  somebody's hand in the quiet of an office; guarantees were  given; perhaps an immense amount of money was paid, some immense  promises made to Gorbachev...    Why did one word of Gorbachev's all of a sudden prove  stronger than the entire huge mega-machinery of the Soviet  presence in Europe? What was it that they whispered to him,  promised him? For me, as a writer, this is a mystery and a  subject for a plot. What do you think?    [Kryuchkov] There is one factor I would like to start with  in  answering. As you know, in 1990-1991 the system of governing our  country, the decisionmaking mechanism, was changed. When we had  Article 6 of the old Constitution, which formalized the leading  role of the party, the most important issues, including those of  foreign policy, were decided exclusively in the CPSU Central  Committee Politburo. When we rejected the leading role of the  party, we needed to replace the Politburo with another organ  rather than leaving complete control over everything to one  person--the president, no matter how much of a genius he might  be. And Gorbachev was not such a person anyway. This gave  Gorbachev, Shevardnadze, Yakovlev, and other persons the  opportunity to make decisions without the support of legal norms  and collective will.    At the end of the war, when we were drained of our  lifeblood,  had lost tens of millions of people, East Europe, changed from a  territory hostile to us to a friendly one. And when the  processes of forming states with a new sociopolitical system  began, there was no opposition. In the years following the war  we quickly restored the ruined economy. This was a brilliant  victory, perhaps as great in significance as the victory in the  Great Patriotic War. In 1948-1949 we already reached the prewar  level, and in 1950-1951 we began to bring on line plants, entire  industrial complexes, electric power stations. The nation  returned to life. We again became a great power the world had to  reckon with. This said that the socialist system had not  exhausted its possibilities but had just begun to approach them.  We took the road that promised peace in Europe, and people  understood this very well.    I think that by all these deeds and accomplishments we built  at the time a very serious margin of security for many decades  and made good use of this margin. Our state had a huge safety  margin. Our gold bullion alone amounted to 2,500 tonnes in 1953.  Ask how much gold we have now. You will get an answer that is  simply demeaning for us.    We should look for answers to far-reaching questions in two  directions. First, in our system, in our governing mechanism,  the national leadership--that is, objective things. Second, we  should give subjective factors their due. First and foremost the  procedures for electing our presidents, evaluation of the  possibility or impossibility of placing authority in their  hands. This is a very important issue, and many countries have  long insured themselves against all sorts of flukes. We,  unfortunately, left a multitude of loopholes for these  accidental things, and will pay for this more than once.    [Prokhanov] Being a writer and a free artist, by a certain  logic I found myself plunged into a journalistic battle when an  all-out campaign began against the Soviet Army. I was amazed at  how an army that has established control over half the world, is  capable of sending aircraft carrier groups into every ocean and  sending global control orbital stations into space, found itself  defenseless against those who were destroying it in front of our  very eyes! I remember: All of a sudden a theory was advanced  that the Soviet Army is a source of thermonuclear threat, and  the entire population was horrified by the possibility of the  start of World War III, while the military was seen as the devil  incarnate. I remember how it came out that the army was being  called an army of parasites; when all our economic troubles, the  insufficient percentage of protein in our nutrition, were being  blamed on it: That it had allegedly exhausted our economy and  eaten up our development potential. The military was accused of  cruelty, of propagating ruthless, antihumane, almost brutal  customs...    I jumped into this battle, tried to explain that the  military  is the concentrate of statehood, the guarantor of world  stability, and if we have no world wars it is only because the  Soviet Army is strong. I tried to show that a Soviet officer,  with his ethics based on sacrifice and service to the people, is  the standard of public service to the country... A lot insults  were heaped at me at the time.    One of the latest phases associated with the collapse of the  Soviet Army were the so-called "set-ups." The army was sent into  zones of internal interethnic conflicts, in particular, Baku,  Tbilisi, Vilnius, while at the same time a certain dual policy  was conducted.    One originated at the center, in particular, from Aleksandr  Yakovlev, and encouraged in every way nationalist movements in  the republics; people's fronts were springing up; our party  leadership secretly met with their leaders and coddled them in  every way. These people's fronts were a force that strived to  seize power from the republic parties, from the republic  leadership, and very serious conflicts were arising on these  grounds.    Another one was when the same center sent troops into the  zone of conflict to suppress this unrest. First a wound was  inflamed; then the steel probe of the army was sent, the wound  was stirred up even more, and the result was a nationalist  explosion. Use of force is very traumatic for the population; it  incites them. An entire nation would rise up against the central  military leadership. Then the military was called back and,  having first established order, it withdrew in humiliation.    The reputation of the military both in the republics and the  Union was dropping to zero; commissions were set up, like  Sobchak's, or the one with the participation of the writer  Vasilyev. The military was traumatized, it was demoralized, and  the winners were regionalism and separatism.    Could you, as a person associated with intelligence,  security, get a feel of all these mechanisms at the time? What  was your perception of all these conflicts: Tbilisi, Baku,  Vilnius? Who was the "architect" of this tragedy?    [Kryuchkov] I remember very well how you fought for our  military. I greatly appreciated your efforts then, and remember  them now with gratitude.    In 1990 Academician Arbatov began to say that our military  budget considerably exceeded that of the United States. This was  an outright lie. The U.S. budget at the time exceeded $300  billion, while ours was 70 billion rubles [R], but even then the  dollar and the ruble were not comparable in weight. The attacks  on the military pursued a single purpose: to knock out one of  the most important pillars of the state. Of course, not  everything was ideal in our military--there were a lot of  shortcomings...    At the same time, the military-industrial complex already in  1990 produced up to 100 percent of the output of certain  categories of civilian products, in particular, television sets  and washing machines; that is, even then it was not a burden to  the state. In 1990 the Soviet Union accounted for more than  one-third of global arms sales. Currently the United States'  share is 38 percent, while quite recently it was only 18  percent. See who we have surrendered to?!    Attacks on our military were being conducted in all  directions, and I think that those who set as their goal to  destroy it have achieved this to a considerable extent. In the  level of combat readiness our current armed forces are hardly  capable of deflecting any aggression. This is very serious.    This "setting up" of the military began under Khrushchev.  Remember the Novocherkassk events? Later, whenever a difficult  situation arose, military units were moved to forward positions.    In 1988-1989 events were brewing in the Caucasus, and again  military units were activated there. Then came Karabakh,  Lithuania, Baku, and so on.    In Tbilisi, for instance, the army was cleverly set up in  the  interests of certain circles. Georgian forces were fighting for  power. In order to avoid doing this themselves, they drew the  armed forces into the conflict. I am fully convinced that this  was not done without the knowledge of the highest leadership of  the party and the state.    In January 1991 the situation in Lithuania heated up so  much,  taking such an unpredictable turn, that it came to direct  clashes on a massive scale. The forces that came to power took a  position against the constitution of the USSR of the time and of  the republic itself, and took a course on secession from the  Union in a way not envisaged by the law. And the forces that  wanted to prevent the violation of the constitution, that  supported the Union, were subjected to direct persecution and  repression. They had a moral right to defend themselves. Then  the military units stationed in Lithuania decided to ensure  minimal order, to forestall potential bloodshed. They were  carrying out only protective functions.    I remember very well the materials of the investigation. It  followed from them that the casualties were killed and wounded  not by the military but by other persons who were in the crowd,  who were provoking the unrest, which was used by the reactionary  forces in the republic as a pretext to start more active actions  and as a result achieve their goals.    The subsequent development of events in Lithuania fully  confirmed this. I think that A. Yakovlev's trips to these  republics at the time also played their role. Every time they  were followed by an explosion of actions against the center,  against the constitutional order. It is apparent that his hand  showed in this, too.    I once wrote in one of my articles about the actions of  certain individuals who were beginning to destroy our  Fatherland, and I will not take back a single word. I think that  in terms of destructive force, in terms of exerting a corrupting  influence on many aspects of our life, the main credit should go  to A. Yakovlev. I cannot tell what drove him in the beginning:  strictly personal traits, vanity, or something else, but in any  case many of his actions were not in any sense in the interests  of our state.    [Prokhanov] I think that the history of the disintegration  of  the Soviet Union and the current post-Soviet history are replete  with mystery. History in general is a hierarchy of mysteries,  most of which never come to the surface. Among the mysteries of  the last decade is mentioned, for instance, the disappearance of  the so-called party--essentially, state--gold. It is believed  that there is still information on the highest leadership of the  Soviet Union kept in secret safes that tells of their  recruitment and their connections with secret, closed Western  organizations.    One such version, circulating to a very limited extent in  intellectual circles and very cautiously mentioned at seminars  and symposiums, concerns a certain German project nurtured in  the Soviet leadership, involving an infusion of a large quantity  of capital into West Germany and concealing this capital from  the public. This capital allegedly was accumulated by German  business and controlled by people from the Soviet Union for the  contingency of post-Soviet history, when it is to be returned  here, to our space, to nurture a new authority, a new generation  of statesmen on the basis of a Russian-German alliance.    Allegedly, already then a certain convergence of economies,  of future financial systems, and future policy had begun. And  one can see a trend toward rapprochement with Germany in today's  convulsive political process. Among patriots, for instance, some  are anti-German, while the others are pro-German. For instance,  Zhirinovskiy openly proclaims a Russian-German alliance. Behind  all these statements--speeches, hints, innuendoes--one can  detect the formula of that early Soviet-German project.    Do you know anything about this, have you heard about it?    [Kryuchkov] I think your question is based to a certain  extent on reality, but this is also a fruit of mythology. The  actions of U.S. politicians are driven by one set of interests;  our politicians are guided by other interests--if they are  pro-Soviet, of course; the French have their own, the Chinese  and Japanese--their own... These interests engender both certain  alliances of forces, and their lobbying. Under Stalin, any  lobbying was out of question. Sometime in the 1960's, however,  under Khrushchev, we gradually began to practice a rather broad  system of lobbying.    It is time to tentatively identify our lobbying groups,  without bringing up actual names at this point. I think that we  have a pro-German lobby, a pro-American, pro-Chinese,  pro-Japanese, and pro-European one; then there are branches of  the above that do not play a significant role.    [Prokhanov] The only lobby we do not have is a pro-Russian  one.    [Kryuchkov] Speaking of what you have in mind, I think that  such a pro-Russian lobby is undergoing a revival today; it is  getting stronger and broader. I believe that in a very near  future it will proclaim itself loudly.    Our lobbying does not operate by the same rules as in the  West. The pro-Japanese lobby in the United States, for instance,  spends enormous sums of money, makes major investments in  economic sectors that are interesting and profitable for Japan.  Our lobbies operate gratis. I am deeply convinced that the  Germans, Americans, and others do not invest billions in  lobbying in order to realize their ideas. On the contrary, they  are pumping money out of our country. Because the aid that goes  to Russia and some CIS countries--if one can call these crumbs  aid--is generated through the theft taking place in our country.  Tens of billions flow abroad, and at best only a few million  come back.    I have heard of this Soviet-German myth, and I am convinced  that all this is not true. The Germans may, of course, spend  some money to support the German communities in our state, to  develop some or other sectors in our industry, to set up some  training. But there is not and will not be powerful support for  our pro-German lobby or billions in investment.    Where have our reserves and wealth disappeared? A very  simple  thing is happening in this respect: At some stage we engaged in  self-consumption. We permitted industrial production to decline,  permitted inflation. Since the 1990's corruption has been  spreading rapidly. In the past we had a foreign trade monopoly;  today this would be our salvation. So why is our oil today sold  by private individuals? Should not the state be doing this? What  is happening is real squandering, real theft...    As to the party money, I will tell you: Had there been, let  us say, massive embezzlement of party money, a massive outflow  of the party gold to a foreign country, I can assure you that  the KGB certainly would have heard something about it.    [Prokhanov] In your communications you constantly  contemplate  the problems of security, formulating its concept in classic  form, creating a hierarchy of different levels of security,  including cultural and intellectual. Its foundation, however, is  still geopolitical security, the balance of world powers. Russia  cannot be considered today a certain subject in a geopolitically  finished form--this is meaningless. Today's Russia cannot  formulate its security without measuring itself against,  identifying itself with, neighboring Ukraine. It cannot  formulate its security without the sense of its presence in  Kazakhstan all the way to the Chinese border, without a  perception of its historical and geopolitical unity with  Belarus, which pushes the border of Russia's defense to the  Polish border.    What is your opinion of Russia's strategic interests?    [Kryuchkov] To my great regret, I have come to the  conviction  that today's Russia is essentially not vital as a state. We have  never been in such a grave situation with respect to security.  We are currently vulnerable literally from all sides.    Take our borders. Finland, the Baltics, Poland, Hungary,  Romania, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, China, Japan, the United  States... It so happens that our borders have become  disputable--at ,least we hear such voices from the other side of  our borders. Before 1985 nobody raised such issues. The Soviet  Union was a mighty superpower. Now all of a sudden everybody has  simultaneously started voicing claims on our territories; even  the Baltic countries have raised this issue. It has reached the  point of direct provocations at borders.    When there was a great Soviet Union, we could security  defend  one-sixth of the world's territory. First, our population  comprised almost 300 million; second, we had strong industry and  science. Our positions in East Europe, Asia, Africa, and some  Latin American countries permitted us to be certain of our  security. Nobody touched us. I think we could be "busy" with  peaceful labor for another 50 years. Generally speaking, nothing  and nobody threatened us. Now the situation has changed.    Look to the east. Japan lays claim to Kuril Minor range.  This  is a serious claim, and the Japanese stand firm on it. They do  not say that they will resolve this issue by force. But under  certain circumstances the situation may become very unfavorable  for us, and we will be helpless to do anything.    We have reasonably good relations with China now. But China  has never said that it does not have any territorial claims  against us. Moreover, not the entire border is marked.  Therefore, while giving due credit to the sensible policy of the  current leadership of China, can we be sure that its next  generation will hold the same course?    Take the West. I think that the Germans would be well served  if they do not forget the lessons of history and remember  Bismarck, who understood the significance of Russia for Germany  and nothing cast a shadow on our relations. But there also were  two world wars. History has a peculiar trait--it repeats itself.  If certain forces in Germany return to a militarist policy, is  there someone to keep them from taking ill-considered steps?  Moreover, there may be some who are interested in channeling  Germany in a certain direction. I cannot understand the United  States and the British, who are aware of this danger but so far  remain silent.    Our south also is very dangerous. We had strong positions in  Afghanistan, but the situation has changed. There are countries  with which we absolutely have to be friends. I mean India--our  natural geopolitical ally, which has a stake in good relations  with us. There is a large group of countries in Asia which we  can regard with great optimism. These are so-called minor  countries that already play an important role--South Korea,  Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines...    We had strong positions in Africa, and some used to say:  What  are we doing; why are we there? But let us think about it once  again. Our expenditures there were minimal, while we did derive  a certain profit. In addition, this was where the struggle was  conducted for political positions at our remote outposts. Now we  are approachable--almost to the heart of Russia...    We also had good relations developing with a number of Latin  American countries. We had active military cooperation with  Peru, and due to this factor alone we were receiving up to $1  billion of net profit. And generally, Latin America is a very  promising continent from the standpoint of our geopolitical  situation.    Unless there is sharp progress in the very near future in  relations with CIS countries, unless we take the road of close  integration, the situation will become very difficult for all of  us. Still, I am an optimist and I believe that this process will  begin, and Russia, together with parts of the former Soviet  Union, will create a society, a state entity, that will ensure  our collective security.    There is currently a certain imbalance in the world: Some  countries are coming to the forefront, some are receding, but  sooner or later everything will stabilize. We would be  ill-advised to believe that all of this will happen on its own.  Nothing of the sort! Without human will, without the will of the  leadership of certain countries, this is not going to happen.    [Prokhanov] And what about such a problem for Russia--and  many other countries as well--as the Jewish problem? The Jewish  factor played an enormous role in foreign and domestic policy in  the former Soviet Union and in today's Russia. At certain times  it went under the surface, took on a coded form, and then at  some point it would suddenly become a priority, and entire  political groups mulled over it. Sometimes the Jewish problem  held the threat of a global catastrophe--as it did during the  Arab-Israeli wars in the Near East.    Today the Jewish problem is delineated by an internal drama,  the Russian-Jewish conflict at ideological, cultural, and ethnic  level, as well as the drama of the Russian choice in the Near  East. Traditional groups of Arab countries still see us as a  potential ally who betrayed them at a crucial moment. Israel, on  the other hand, is the strategic ally of the United States, with  which today's Russia has established long-term relations of  partnership. This mysterious triangle, or if you wish, polygon,  today grips human passions and destinies. Enormous energies are  being burned in this regard, and completely unproductively.    How do you see the Russian-Jewish issue, the political  factor  of Russia and Israel in the context of 20th century history?    [Kryuchkov] This question does have peculiar aspects. The  explanation to them is in the history of the Jewish people,  their difficult road in the struggle for survival. For thousands  of years Jews were a relatively small nation in a far from  friendly environment. They not only survived, but increased  their numbers and in the end achieved the formation of an  independent state. In a historical sense, Russia has long been a  motherland for a considerable number of Jews. According to the  1897 census, half the world population of Jews lived within the  borders of tsarist Russia.    Over the last couple of decades not everything was smooth in  relations between the Soviet Union and Israel. Problems arose  with respect to Jewish emigration, and this gave rise to  arguments, confrontation, and misunderstanding. Currently this  problem has been removed. And I do not see any other problems  that could somehow seriously damage Russo-Israeli relations.    At the same time I believe that a society cannot consider  itself healthy if it produces, for instance, anti-Georgian,  anti-Ukrainian, anti-Belarusian, or anti-Jewish attitudes. But  this is a two-edged process.    Over the past few years we have had no direct anti-Jewish  manifestations. I remember that when I was KGB chairman we  received warnings of potential anti-Jewish pogroms. We checked  them out and never found anything to them. Apparently what we  are dealing with is not some anti-Jewish manifestations but  simply disagreement with some or other aspects of Israeli policy  toward, for instance, Arab countries. In my opinion, it has not  been optimal. Lately, history has demonstrated that there are  healthy forces in Israel; there are smart people who understand  that it is necessary to move into a broad front of development  of Arab-Israeli relations. And this viewpoint now prevails.    I do not think that Jews in the Soviet Union are in a  position of an oppressed ethnic group. Nothing of the kind. They  hold decent positions in all spheres of administration,  industry, agriculture, medicine, science, etc. Moreover, I think  that there are certain extremes in this, too, but this is  happening for the reason of certain special traits of their  character and partly because of the complacency of Russians.    I think that some persons of Jewish nationality are making a  serious mistake. They frequently go too far in labeling some or  other political figure an anti-Semite. This is not always so.  For instance, speaking against certain aspects of Tel Aviv's  policy does not mean one is an anti-Semite. Speaking against  certain actions of persons of Jewish nationality here does not  mean one is an anti-Semite, either. In the same way one can  speak against Kazakhs, Ukrainians, Belarusians, but this does  not mean that this person is anti-Kazakh, anti-Ukrainian, or  anti-Belarusian.    I think that the process of creating a better atmosphere for  the development of relations between Russia and Israel must  proceed from both sides. Israel and Russia have serious reasons  to speak of the compatibility of certain interests in the  geopolitical structure of the world. And in this respect we  absolutely cannot orient ourselves toward individual persons of  Jewish nationality. I, for one, will never judge the position of  all Jews by the actions and deeds of, for instance, Minkin,  Plutnik, and some others.    This is far from full compatibility, of course, but it would  not be in the interests of either country to disregard it.    [Prokhanov] I propose that we come down from geopolitical  heights back to our sinful earth.    On one hand, it seems to me that the current regime, having  gone through phases of crises, in a way has suddenly come to its  senses and begun to take steps towards stabilization in Russia.  Attempts are being made to stabilize the sociopsychological  atmosphere by all these charters of reconciliation, through  state regulation of the economy. There are attempts to stabilize  the situation at the border. There is talk about military  development, increasing military orders. We, people of the  opposition, should appraise all this positively. Hurt and  insulted, remembering all the wounds and traumas dealt us by the  regime, we still should not reject outright all these actions  aimed at stabilization.    On the other hand, against this background, which to a large  extent is only being proclaimed, we see again some steps towards  destroying the remnants of Russian statehood. This involves the  system of security, everything that used to be called the  ministry of security and now has become the Federal  Counterintelligence Service. People come to me from these  agencies, people who have left, been fired, have fled, been  thrown out--they are horrified at what is being done to this  last bulwark of Russia's security.    What is your opinion of what is happening in your former  domain, the Committee for State Security, and what this organism  is being turned into? What does this mean for the state and the  country?    [Kryuchkov] Yeltsin's latest steps, aimed at reaching an  accord, were manifested impulsively earlier as well, in the form  of occasionally dropped phrases, because you cannot keep  threatening and act only by enforcement methods. I think the  explanation is simple: The regime has found itself in a very  difficult situation; many see it as hopeless, and therefore they  undertook such steps in the interests of survival.    But I also think that those to whom this accord is being  offered would be wrong not to use this opportunity to ease the  hardship of life for our people. It is another matter what the  proposal will be. We have to look at it.    Problems related to state security are closer to me. I could  anticipate and have anticipated many things, but what has  happened in our Fatherland has exceeded my worst expectations.  In August 1991 the first reorganization of the KGB took place;  at the end of 1991--the second; then the third... I have lost  count. We need to organize not just reliable security but also  make it economical. Everything that is being done currently is  not economical. Because these organizations have not become  smaller numerically--they have simply been dispersed into  different corners. There is no system now in dealing with  security problems, and this is impermissible. There are  apparently considerable means allocated to it, considering the  disastrous state of the country, but the entire system of  security--and this is the tragedy--is subordinated not to the  interests of the state but those of a certain individual. How  long can this go on? A year, two, three... Sooner or later it  will all collapse anyway. Intelligence has been separated;  counterintelligence, communications, protective units, technical  services, border troops have been taken out of the total  structure of security; that is, everything is fragmented.    Until August 1991 everything was a single mechanism; we were  at a level necessary to deal with problems of security  associated with the country as a whole. Now this does not exist.  We know that thousands of skilled personnel have left the  organs; new ones have come, poorly trained--they have different  selection criteria there now: apparently loyalty toward the  regime rather than professional skills. In the past the most  important thing for us was attitude towards the Motherland, this  was a sacred notion. In the past, we had duty--another sacred  notion. Now everything has shifted and lost shape. The system of  security--broken up, dismembered, drained of its lifeblood,  stripped of cadres--is unable to deal with the tasks it is  facing. Those who will inherit this component of our statehood,  or rather its bits and pieces, will find themselves in a very  difficult situation.    How do we solve security problems? We have to work on this  fast, because intelligence operations against our country  continue, the drug business is growing, international organized  crime is active, smuggling is running wild, our secrets are  swimming away... There are some secrets that are worth billions  of dollars, and they are being taken from us almost for free.  While the organs, drained and destroyed, are expected to fight  all this.    [Prokhanov] The country is living through, as we say, a  systemic crisis. This is the crisis of the socium in all its  manifestations. Among the directions in which it is developing  there is a power dimension. We are living through a crisis of  authority. In normal constitutional societies this is resolved  by changing the cabinet, leadership, course. The losing team  gives way to another one through constitutional forms.    In our country this is apparently precluded. All crises  since  1991 have been resolved by methods of force. I have a feeling  that this power crisis, as it grows rather than diminishes, must  produce a cascade of similar power catastrophes. It is not  accidental that the whole society was traumatized by rumors of a  state coup. Society did not treat it as another canard because  the idea of coups is hanging in the air. We are waiting for them  and practically inviting them.    Does your experience, your intuition, tell you that these  coups are becoming a norm in our troubled times?    [Kryuchkov] I think we are dealing here with a very  troublesome phenomenon which perhaps no other country has had to  face. Efforts are being made to make our public, our people, get  used to everything that is unusual in normal life, even  unnatural, impermissible. For instance, a change in a social  system occurs either as a result of a revolution or with the  consent of the entire nation. In our country one sociopolitical  system has been changed or is about to be changed without asking  anyone. Moreover, we had a referendum on 17 March; we had a  Union--they simply broke it up. Also, without asking anyone.  Force is being used in dangerous dimensions. Last year will go  down in history by its October tragedy, during which hundreds of  totally innocent people died. We had one coup, then a second, a  third... Now there is talk of the probability of another coup.  One gets the impression that there is a group of people trying  to find a way out of the crisis by the same method of force.    I do not think that Yeltsin necessarily is the source; there  are other people. They want us to get used to the idea that an  enforcement structures' strike against the forces that allegedly  are plotting a coup is a logical thing to do. This is the most  dangerous method of resolving the problems we now face. And at  the same time they exhort us to reach a peaceful accord...    I would like very much for Russia to get rid of such  cataclysms, and look for a constructive way out of the crisis  situation. But I am afraid that interested forces may provoke an  attack against those who do indeed stand for order.</p>

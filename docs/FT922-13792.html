			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Clayform Clayform Properties blamed the continuing recession in the property and retail sectors for another loss as a further fall in values necessitated exceptional provisions against the group's development portfolio. For the year to end-December, the property developer and shoe retailing group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 20.6m (Pounds 39.1m)on increased sales of Pounds 91.5m (Pounds 83.9m). Exceptional items of Pounds 9m (Pounds 31.5m) related to write-downs on development sites. Net assets per share declined to 137p (201p). Borrowings were almost halved to Pounds 58m (Pounds 108.5m). During the past year 44 investments were sold realising Pounds 55m compared to their 1990 valuation of Pounds 58.1m. Although sales of developments proved more difficult to achieve than investments, Pounds 25.8m was realised during the year. The remaining portfolio was valued at Pounds 49.1m, a 7.9 per cent fall. Losses per share were 46.7p (101p). The final dividend is again passed leaving shareholders without a pay-out compared to a total of 2p in 1990.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / International Company News: Foster's faces asset write-down FOSTER'S Brewing Group, Australia's biggest brewer, yesterday warned that difficult economic conditions may force it to write down the value of its remaining non-core assets. Foster's foreshadowed the move in response to a query from the Australian Stock Exchange about fluctuations in the group's share price, which fell from ADollars 1.92 on Monday to a low of ADollars 1.77 on Thursday. The group said it could not explain the fall, and assured the exchange that no important announcements were about to be made which might have leaked out. However, Foster's said 'adjustments' to the carrying value of its assets might have to be made 'in view of the uncertain and difficult economic conditions prevailing, particularly in the Australian property market'. The group wrote off ADollars 1.58bn (USDollars 1.19bn) in abnormal and extraordinary losses in 1989/90, leading to a loss of ADollars 1.26bn. It wrote off ADollars 277m in the following year, when the loss contracted to ADollars 43m, and a further ADollars 120m in the first half of the current year. Foster's has been disposing of non-brewing assets since 1990, under a recovery programme intended to re-establish the group as a pure brewing business. However, it has been unable to dispose of non-core assets with a book value of ADollars 2.8bn, including finance assets valued at ADollars 1.6bn and agribusiness and pastoral assets valued at more than ADollars 600m. Analysts said much of the uncertainty in the group's shares was caused by the financial instability of International Brewing Holdings (IBH), a private company controlled by Mr John Elliott, which owns 38 per cent of Foster's. IBH is due to submit a refinancing plan to its bankers later this month, and could be placed in liquidation later this year if no agreement is reached.</p>

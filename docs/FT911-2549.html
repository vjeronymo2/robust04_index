			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / British Gas accepts tough price controls from Ofgas BRITISH GAS agreed yesterday to tough controls which will keep price rises for supplies to 17m households well below the rate of inflation for five years. The company also agreed to meet new service standards, accepting that it could be forced to cut prices if it fails to meet targets. The controls, drawn up by the Office of Gas Supply (Ofgas), the gas industry regulator, limit the amount by which prices to domestic customers can rise in relation to inflation for five years, starting next April. If inflation is low, consumers could even see a cut in gas prices. The new regime will put pressure on British Gas to cut costs internally and could result in a round of job cuts. The complex price formula means that British Gas can raise prices by 5 percentage points less thanthe annual rate of inflation as opposed to 2 percentage points below inflation under its current formula. The new price regime also puts a ceiling for the first time on the cost of North Sea gas price rises that British Gas can passon to consumers. This is intended to give the company an incentive for negotiating cheaper gas supplies and for running its own fields as efficiently as possible. Its supplies could include imports if this is agreed by the government. It has taken British Gas 10 weeks to decide whether to accept the proposals, and the company said yesterday the targets will be tough to meet. 'It was not an easy decision,' said Mr Bob Evans, British Gas chairman, 'but we are confident we can continue to generate a satisfactory rate of return and profitability.' The alternative to accepting the proposals would have been an embarrassing clash with the regulator and an inquiry into the issue by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. For the first time, the new price formula links efficiency targets to public standards of service in response to consumers' concerns that cost cuts should not be achieved by reducing the quality of service. Ofgas will monitor British Gas's response time, for example, to gas leaks, and if it consistently fails to meet the standards set, it can be referred to the MMC which could impose further price cuts as a penalty. In an attempt to encourage energy efficiency, the new formula allows British Gas to add on the cost of energy saving measures to consumer prices. This will offset the costof helping consumers to put conservation measures into place. Mr James McKinnon, the director-general of Ofgas, called the package a fair and reasonableone, that will mean 'better value for money with tougher price controls, guaranteed standards of service and pressure on British Gas to perform more efficiently than ever before.'

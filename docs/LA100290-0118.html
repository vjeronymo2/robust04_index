			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUSSEIN FREES 9 HOSTAGES IN BID TO COURT FRANCE  </P> <P> President Saddam Hussein freed nine French hostages Monday in a move widely  interpreted as another step in his search for a soft spot in the international  stranglehold on Iraq.  </P> <P> The hostage announcement came less than 24 hours after Hussein announced plans  to contact the government of French President Francois Mitterrand in an effort  to negotiate an end to the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> In Paris, France promptly rejected Hussein's peace feeler, which was  accompanied by word that he intends to stand fast in Kuwait, which Iraq invaded  on Aug. 2 and has since annexed.  </P> <P> None of the nine Frenchmen freed Monday were among about 90 French citizens  held hostage at strategic locations as part of Iraq's so-called human shield  against attack. And none was either ill or infirm. All nine had been included  in a list delivered to Iraqi leaders last week by the Franco-Iraqi Assn.  </P> <P> "They are people who have problems with their family, with their relatives or  with their work," said Gilles Muneir, the association's general secretary, who  arrived in Baghdad 10 days ago hoping to arrange the French hostages' freedom.  About 350 French nationals are believed to still be in Kuwait and Iraq.  </P> <P> Muneir said he was not surprised by Hussein's announcement, which marks the  first time the Iraqi president has released any of his Western and Japanese  adult male hostages.  </P> <P> "Today is the birthday of the Prophet Mohammed, which is a traditional occasion  for such things," Muneir said. "But I was surprised by the number. I thought  they would release only four. Jesse Jackson (the American political leader)  asked for many to be released, and he got only 12."  </P> <P> Muneir said Hussein made the gesture "to show that, on the Iraqi side, they  want to have a dialogue with France."  </P> <P> Asked whether the gesture was important in a larger, political context, Muneir  replied: "It is important for the nine people, to begin with. It's a sign of  good will, but it's also a response to Mitterrand's proposal in the United  Nations." In a speech last week to the U.N. General Assembly, Mitterrand said  that if Iraq frees all foreign hostages and agrees to withdraw from Kuwait,  then "everything becomes possible" through negotiations.  </P> <P> Western and Asian diplomats in Baghdad described the release of the French  hostages as a transparent attempt by Hussein to court France, which -- as Iraqi  officials have said privately -- Hussein views as one of the weaker links in  the international force blockading his country.  </P> <P> In the Western diplomatic corps, there was widespread agreement that the  gesture will yield little.  </P> <P> "These are only small gestures that won't amount to much," said a senior  Western diplomat who represents a country with many civilians being held here  against their will.  </P> <P> "The Iraqis don't want to accept that they are up against a formidable,  collective international agreement. They don't appreciate the gravity of the  situation or how annoyed people are getting with them."  </P> <P> At last official count, the Iraqis were holding 93 Americans at strategic  sites, in addition to nearly 1,000 other American men who are not permitted to  leave Iraq and Kuwait. At least 220 Britons have also been detained, along with  more than 100 Japanese and 77 Germans.  </P> <P> In recent episodes of the brief nightly television feature called "Guest News,"  some of the detained hostages say they are eating well, living in adequate  quarters and keeping generally fit. Nonetheless, many are reportedly being put  to work by the Iraqis at the sites where they are held under military guard.  </P> <P> In one such interview Saturday night, a Briton in a T-shirt and spectacles  identified as Glenn Winwood looked into the camera and said: "We get plenty of  food. The accommodations are good. Our 'hosts' have been pretty good. We play  volleyball against them -- and beat 'em."  </P> <P> However lighthearted, such sentiments are looked on here as an indicator of  what an Asian diplomat called an almost universal susceptibility on the hostage  issue among the nations directly involved in the gulf crisis.  </P> <P> Referring to Hussein's gesture to the French, this diplomat said: "He's looking  for soft spots anywhere, and there are many. He knows that (in these  circumstances) governments fall and reputations go up and down."  </P> <P> Increasingly, he said, the Third World nations struggling to bring home their  thousands of stranded, impoverished contract workers are questioning the West's  motives in assembling a military force in the gulf. Many influential analysts  in Asia, he said, believe that Hussein has been getting the best of it in the  war of words.  </P> <P> "It's a cold-blooded, ruthless game," he said, "but that's the way (Hussein) is  playing it. And he's playing it very well. He is saying, 'I am willing to talk  to anyone unconditionally,' and we have a feeling that the West is playing into  his hands. For the past two months, it's been all reaction, no initiative."  </P> <P> It was a view echoed by Muneir, who plans to escort the nine freed hostages  back to France today and start a campaign to get the French to pull out of the  naval force deployed in the gulf, based in part on Hussein's "humanitarian"  moves.  </P> <P> When reminded that Hussein still holds hundreds of foreigners at places that  may be bombed or shelled and that thousands of others are prevented from  leaving Iraq, Muneir replied:  </P> <P> "There is hope. The Iraqis have a lot of friends in the world. If every friend  comes here and takes one of their countrymen out, they will all be gone very  soon."  </P></p>

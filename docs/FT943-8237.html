			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Observer: Fourth grace Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries of Scotland, was back-pedalling hard yesterday, following a gaffe that may nullify his efforts to stop Canova's statue, the Three Graces, going to the Getty Museum. He publicly apologised for saying that John Paul Getty II's crucial promise of Pounds 1m for the appeal was motivated by the fact that father and son had never got on. 'Clifford looks as though he's snatched the cup from his own lips,' said a sympathetic but appalled figure in the art world yesterday. Others may be less forgiving. Clifford, 48, who can be rather pompous, is boundlessly energetic. In his 10 years at Edinburgh he's shaken up the National Gallery - redecorating it in ruby, gilt and damask - and put its attendants into a tartan of his own design. And the row over the choice of Glasgow for a gallery of Scottish art was partly the fault of the gallery's trustees, chaired by merchant banker Angus Grossart. But at the height of that controversy Clifford did not help matters. He disparagingly described Scottish art thus: 'At times it's very good, at times it's bloody awful.' That went down poorly with the stalwarts of the Scottish art world, who dislike Clifford's grand manner, English blood and upper-class accent. Clifford probably doesn't have much time for them, either.</p>

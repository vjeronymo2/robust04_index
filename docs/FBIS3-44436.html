In the preface of the  National People's Congress' (NPC) Work Bulletin, published on  Saturday, the former national parliament head Qiao Shi said  legislators faced an arduous task. He said the development of a  socialist democracy and legal system should be greatly  strengthened to meet the needs of economic reform.    Mr. Qiao, who is a Politburo Standing Committee member,  underlined the significance of the formulation of economic laws.  "(We should) strive for the establishment of a legal framework  for a socialist market economy in the next few years," he said.    The bimonthly was published by the NPC Standing Committee's  General Office.    Mr. Qiao said the slowness of implementing laws as well as  violations in the past should be eliminated. The former NPC  head said supervision of the executive branches should be  improved. Mr. Qiao vowed to exercise the NPC's power entitled  under China's Constitution to increase its say over national  policies.    Though officially the highest organ of power, the NPC has  more been seen as a rubberstamp parliament.    Mr. Qiao, who was replaced as NPC head last year, is keen on  elevating the status of the NPC, partly to increase his power in  the communist leadership. Legislators, he said, should build  closer ties with the people to identify and listen to their  problems and aspirations. "We have to be honest and have  self-discipline and to whole-heartedly serve the people," Mr.  Qiao said.</p>

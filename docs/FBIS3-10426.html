Mexico had wanted to sign an agreement with all of the  Central American countries, but the pressure exerted by both  President Salinas and President Calderon -- both of whom were  eager to sign a bilateral agreement of such great significance  for their countries -- was decisive.    This agreement is undoubtedly one of President Calderon's  personal victories, and it will represent great benefits for  Costa Rica's development, particularly because it strengthens  our independence vis-a-vis the unionist pressure by the  remaining Central American countries.</p>

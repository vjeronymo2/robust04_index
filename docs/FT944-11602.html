			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Slovakia curbs sell-offs Slovakia's parliament has voted to cancel all privatisation contracts involving direct sales of shares in state companies to private investors agreed since September 6. The move could herald another round of tit-for-tat investigations of corruption in the country's fragile privatisation drive. It came as Mr Jozef Moravck, the prime minister, tendered his government's resignation following a general election five weeks ago. He agreed to stay on as caretaker until a new government is formed. The privatisation vote affects only a relatively few contracts signed during election campaigning, in which the government agreed to sell stakes in state companies directly to mainly local investors. It does not affect a more wide-ranging sell-off involving the use of coupons which Slovak citizens can exchange for Kcs60bn (Pounds 1.1bn) of shares in other state companies, which is currently being administered. However, observers in Bratislava fear it could start another wave of investigations into political favouritism in privatisation, similar to one carried out by Mr Moravck's government when it assumed office in March, and cause fresh delays to a programme beset by political controversy.</p>

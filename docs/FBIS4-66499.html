			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed letter to President Zeroual: "Avoiding Drift"] </F>   [Excerpt] Mr. President:    On this date, 8 March, on the eve of aid, we are greatly  distressed to see our country sinking into chaos. Our distress  increases with every passing day before the resurgence of  hideous terrorist acts, the assassination of Algeria's most  promising children. These ignoble acts have become even more  prevalent since the enacting of conciliatory measures and the  calls for dialogue with those who are digging the grave of a  modern and republican Algeria: those who want to seize power,  all power, to impose on us their vision of a fundamentalist  society and engulf the country in fire and blood.    Far from helping to extricate our country from the crisis,  these measures and these appeals have succeeded only in  confusing the women and men who are struggling to create a  resolutely modern society and whose hopes must not be  disappointed. These measures have succeeded only in encouraging  the enemies of Algeria to deepen the climate of terror and  insecurity.    Mr. President, the "cult of bloodshed" continues to drain  Algeria's lifeblood and mutilate its families. In their  organized and murderous insanity, the forces of terrorism are  attacking the children, the womenfolk, who have always been  singled out as special targets by totalitarian fundamentalism.  Mr. President, in every way from the infamous Family Code to  physical liquidation--and including intimidation, threats, rape,  and abduction--flesh-and-blood women are being subjected to the  horrors of a diabolic cycle of barbarism.    Mr. President, women refuse to be sacrificed yet again on  the  altar of a suicidal policy or a pact with the devil. The real  interlocutors in a dialogue about the future of modern Algeria  should be the women and men who believe in it, who are fighting  with their bare hands to keep this country from falling under  the sway of an Islamist dictatorship.

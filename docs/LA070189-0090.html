			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NFL'S OWNERS IN RIFT?;  </P> <P> THEY MAY SPLIT OVER COMMITTEE'S CHOICE OF FINKS  </P> <P> A fight between the National Football League's two principal factions is likely  Thursday if an NFL committee persists in its plans to recommend a new  commissioner at that time, a club owner said Friday.  </P> <P> Hugh Culverhouse, president of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said that many of the  league's newer owners are bitter over two of this week's developments:  </P> <P>  -- The selection committee's unanimous endorsement of Jim Finks, general  manager of the New Orleans Saints, to succeed Pete Rozelle.  </P> <P>  -- The plan to round up NFL owners on less than a week's notice for a special  meeting to choose the commissioner Thursday in Chicago.  </P> <P> "I'm outraged that they would unanimously recommend Jim Finks," Culverhouse  said. "They said they would present three or four names -- and they come up  with one man.  </P> <P> "Secondly, it's an outrage to call a league meeting for July 6 on six days'  notice. That's two days after a four-day holiday -- a holiday for which many  people made travel plans long ago.  </P> <P> "Personally, I'm leaving as planned for South America tomorrow. Other (owners)  are overseas or out of town. It's inexcusable for them to call (a meeting) at  this time.  </P> <P> "This is probably the most important NFL meeting any of us will ever attend --  after all, we're selecting a commissioner -- and they call it on unbelievably  short notice. That's arrogance."  </P> <P> Other owners made similar points but asked not to be quoted.  </P> <P> The co-chairmen of the selection committee, Lamar Hunt of the Kansas City  Chiefs and Wellington Mara of the New York Giants, were unavailable, as was  Finks.  </P> <P> All were observing a long weekend over one of the few national holidays  available to pro football people, who, Culverhouse noted, play games during  many of the other holiday periods.  </P> <P> Unable to reach the chairmen, Culverhouse, saying he was speaking for several  of the newer owners, wired both Mara and Hunt to express discontent.  </P> <P> " 'I urge you to reconsider your plans,' " he said.  </P> <P> Finks has been called the favorite of the NFL's old guard.  </P> <P> The other faction is largely made up of owners who have come into the NFL in  recent years. Eight clubs have changed hands in just the 1980s -- Denver,  Philadelphia, San Diego, New Orleans, Seattle, Minnesota, New England and  Dallas.  </P> <P> The presidents of these teams, who paid up to $100 million apiece for  franchises, say their problems are much different from the problems of the  old-guard owners, some of whom paid little or nothing for their franchises in a  different era.  </P> <P> The newer group is concerned that Finks or any other old-guard choice might  ignore them and their large debt structures.  </P> <P> If Finks is the only candidate endorsed, they said they'll nominate a candidate  of their own at the Chicago meeting, precipitating a fight.  </P> <P> It takes 19 of 28 owners' votes to elect.  </P> <P> "When the (selection) committee was named at the spring meeting (in March),  they said they'd come up with several (candidates) for us to (consider),"  Culverhouse said. "That's what we want."  </P> <P> Asked what he expects if Finks' name is the only one presented, Culverhouse  said: "The (old guard) will be in deep trouble."  </P> <P> It's a sore point because, to begin with, the new owners' faction was bitter  that none of them was named to the selection committee.  </P> <P> "That committee represents one point of view," said Norman Braman, owner of the  Philadelphia Eagles.  </P> <P> In addition to Hunt and Mara, the selection group includes Art Modell of  Cleveland, Ralph Wilson of Buffalo, Dan Rooney of Pittsburgh and Robert Parins  of Green Bay.  </P> <P> "When the committee was named, I was afraid of something like this," a younger  owner said.  </P> <P> Culverhouse said: "I think they should postpone the meeting for a week or  schedule it to coincide with a (special Chicago) meeting already scheduled for  July 18."  </P> <P> Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie, set to leave for Europe Sunday, said his plans  were now unsettled.  </P></p>

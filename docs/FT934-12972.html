			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: SIB changes rules MODEST changes to the unit trust industry were proposed by the Securities and Investments Board, the UK's main regulator, this week, writes Philip Coggan. The main one is that funds will be allowed to charge exit fees when investors sell their holdings. Since such fees usually trail off over the years, this should benefit long term investors. SIB did not, however, come down in favour of single pricing, the system used commonly outside the UK, and which is simpler for investors to understand. Many in the industry feel single pricing would penalise existing investors, since new ones would not always pay the full cost of creating units. The existing dual pricing system will be maintained, but open-ended investment companies, set to be introduced in 1995, will have just one price. Another change is abolishing the restricted list of overseas markets, which made it difficult for emerging markets trust managers. In future, managers would have only to select liquid and well regulated markets.</p>

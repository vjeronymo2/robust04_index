			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: S Jerome loses Pounds 1m but looks for upturn The continuing depressed textiles market, together with unexpected costs on a number of contracts within the electronics division, pushed S Jerome &amp; Sons into losses of Pounds 1.15m in 1991. Turnover at Pounds 37.2m was little changed from the previous year's Pounds 37.8m, when pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 100,000. Mr Alan Jerome, chairman, said there was some evidence that a slow recovery was in progress in the area of textiles. There is no final dividend, leaving the total at 1p (2.6p). The directors hope to return to both interim and final payments this year.</p>

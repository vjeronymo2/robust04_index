			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> They Got the Beat -- Again: The Go-Go's are reuniting, at least for one  performance. The five members of the Los Angeles all-female rock band are  holding a press conference (along with Jane Fonda) Thursday at the Bel Age  Hotel in West Hollywood to announce that they'll play March 28 at the Universal  Amphitheatre, headlining a benefit concert for the California Environmental  Protection Initiative.  </P> <P> No other Go-Go's projects are planned at this time. The group, which in 1982  hit No. 1 with the debut "Beauty and the Beat" album and No. 2 with the song  "We Got the Beat," broke up in 1985. All five have pursued other musical  endeavors, though only lead singer Belinda Carlisle has had consistent chart  success. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

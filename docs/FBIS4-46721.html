			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Algirdas Brazauskas, President of Lithuania, </F> by Boris Pyadyshev, editor-in-chief of MEZHDUNARODNAYA ZHIZN,  time and occasion not given]    [Text] The President of Lithuania does not have an  official residence. Part of the Seimas building is rented for  the head of state.    Brazauskas has spent more than one year in this office.  He arrived here when he was elected chairman of the Presidium of  the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR in January 1990. After  the elections in the fall of 1992 Brazauskas became chairman of  the Seimas and acting President of the Lithuanian Republic,  which brought him back to this office. On 14 February 1993,  receiving 60 percent of the votes in the election, Brazauskas  took the post of President of Lithuania.    [Pyadyshev] Russia's relations with the Baltic republics are  far from happy. Against this general background there is more  tranquility and realism in Russian-Lithuanian affairs. The  fundamental issues of mutual relations were already settled last  year.    The surface layer of Russian-Lithuanian relations is,  however, fragile. There was a recent flare-up because of delay  in implementation of the agreement on trade and economic  relations. You, Mr. President, are complaining that you have  been unsuccessful in trying to get a call through to the  Kremlin. You sent a message to the Russian President about this.  Your displeasure flowed over into your speech in the  parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.    [Brazauskas] The evening before my visit to Strasbourg,  where  I spoke in the parliament of the Council of Europe, I talked by  telephone with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. It was a  constructive conversation. I also exchanged messages with  President Boris Yeltsin. I think that there are possibilities of  eliminating those difficulties in our relations that have  appeared recently.    Overall the present state of relations between Lithuania and  Russia, despite the existing difficulties, can be described as  good. They are developing in the direction outlined by the 29  July 1991 treaty and the 30 August 1993 Joint Declaration of the  Presidents of Russia and Lithuania.    The visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to  Lithuania, during which a whole package of 10 agreements was  signed, was also very important. One of the main agreements was  the trade and economic agreement on most favored nation status.  Unfortunately, it has not gone into effect yet. Lithuania has  fulfilled its treaty obligations; now it is Russia's turn. It is  mutually disadvantageous and unprofitable that, even though the  treaty has been signed, the name of Lithuania is not found in  the long list of more than 130 countries with which Russia  carries on free trade and trade on a most favored nation basis.  In my opinion, there is no future in that kind of economic  pressure.    [Pyadyshev] Moscow has its own reason for this. You were  exactly right that the agreements signed constitute a package  and thus should be realized as a package, in an integrated  manner. As I understand it, what they are waiting for from the  Lithuanian side is a solution to issues related to the vitality  of Kaliningrad Oblast, above all the question of transit travel.    [Brazauskas] It is natural that Russia wants to serve some  of  its interests related to Kaliningrad Oblast by collaboration  with Lithuania. This includes the movement of people and transit  shipment of various goods and freight across Lithuanian  territory. In addition, most of the electricity and food  consumed in the oblast is produced in Lithuania. We both have an  interest in formalizing these and other areas of collaboration  in agreements and treaties. Thus, many of the 10  Lithuanian-Russian agreements signed on 18 November 1993  concerned Kaliningrad Oblast directly.    In Lithuania you hear arguments about the future status of  Kaliningrad Oblast and revision of the decisions of the Potsdam  Conference fairly often in the press and even in the statements  of some political figures. They question Russian sovereignty  over Kaliningrad Oblast and clearly go beyond scholarly debate.  I can assure you that this is not the position of Lithuania.    However, we are not indifferent to the future political and  economic development of the oblast. I will not deny that we  would like it better if Russia developed this oblast in the  direction of Hong Kong (a free trade-economic zone), and not  like, for example, Gibraltar (a military fortress). We are happy  that at present, despite the well-known troubles with placement  of Russian troops being withdrawn from Europe, both Moscow and  Kaliningrad are more inclined to the first alternative.    Polish President Lech Walesa recently visited Vilnius. He  and  I exchanged opinions about transit traffic to Kaliningrad  Oblast; by land, of course, it goes either through Lithuania or  through Poland. Our opinion was the same: if transit traffic is  carried on in conformity with the laws of the sovereign  countries, following international rules, and if it is  economically beneficial, it can only be welcomed and will prove  advantageous to the corresponding countries. But if we are  talking about uncontrolled transit traffic, about some kind of  corridors (for understandable reasons this word sounds harsh to  the ears of our Polish partners), that is an entirely different  matter. That is unacceptable.    [Pyadyshev] Most of the people in Russia think that in  Lithuania, unlike the situation in some other countries, there  are basically no problems on the state and political levels with  ensuring the rights of the Russian-speaking population.    [Brazauskas] Yes, the postwar demographic, social, and  economic development, finally, plus the historical tolerance in  Lithuanian society, have not created ethnic problems in  Lithuania. We have been able to move to so-called positive  discrimination in relation to ethnic minorities in some fields.  This means that more favorable conditions are created for the  ethnic minorities than for the main people. We intend to hold to  this policy in the future as well.    We have the following demographic ratio: 80 percent  Lithuanians and 9 percent Russians. We do not see any problems.  And what is being done in Latvia and Estonia? I simply cannot  justify the fact that such unacceptable measures for our  democratic world are being adopted there. But on the other hand,  why can't we understand this attitude, when only about half the  people left are Latvians? In general, the question arises: What  is an ethnic minority?    [Pyadyshev] All states, large and small, are equal before  God  and before the U.N. Charter. But we must take account of the  historical fate of each country, its geopolitical status...    [Brazauskas] The history of the Lithuanian state is very  complex, especially the last 200 years since the third partition  of the Rzeczpospolita [Republic] in 1795. Lithuania was a part  of that state, and after that it belonged to Russia. Before this  there were quite complex relations with Poland, with which  Lithuania lived in union for some 200 years. Almost two  centuries as part of the tsarist empire, then the Soviet Union,  with the exception of 20 years. This left its mark.    I remember, not in reproach of course, Mikhail Sergeyevich  Gorbachev, who once said to me: "Listen, what is this  independence to you? What do you need it for? You've lived  together with this large, great country, and you'll keep on  living that way."    What does this tell us? Even people on such a high level,  educated, enormously experienced, have difficulty understanding  the mood and spirit of the people. Lithuania is a small country.  We have 3 million Lithuanians in the country, and another 1  million abroad. But our national spirit is not disappearing; it  assists the state formation of this small people to endure its  trials.    In no way do we support national states as pure-blooded  states. We have many nationalities; that is how history  developed. We find a common language with them. There are  misunderstandings, of course, but they are the kind that can be  resolved by normal methods and means. I cannot say that we are  on the frontier. Of course, dealings with Holland, Belgium, and  Austria are a different matter. Relations there have been  developing for hundreds of years.    We are aware of the attention we are receiving, especially  from small states, for example Denmark and the other  Scandinavian countries. Of course, we do not wait with  outstretched hands for someone to rescue us, to prop up our  life. We figure to satisfy 2-5 percent of our needs with  assistance. Everything else we must do ourselves.    [Pyadyshev] After a certain period of silence the United  States and other Western countries have returned to their former  arguments about Russia's imperial ambitions, by which they mean  the interests of present-day Russia in the regions of the former  Soviet Union. One wonders: What is news about that, that Russia  really has its own interests in territories with which it was  joined in the USSR and in which many connecting lines have  remained--economic, political, cultural, and ethnic? It would be  strange if people were talking about the absence of such  interests. Moreover, some are saying, with good grounds, that a  risky situation would be created if Russia were to renounce its  special interests in these regions.    [Brazauskas] I agree with you that there are such interests.  But when a high-ranking Russian official states that the Baltic  countries are the near abroad, that is a different matter. You  cannot stop and leave the field open for each person to  speculate and interpret these interests in his own way. But the  way you put it, I agree.    Lithuania also has interests in Russia. And they are not at  all aggressive. Normal neighborly relations in a very broad  spectrum. Mr. Viktor Chernomyrdin, Mr. Andrey Kozyrev, and Mr.  Pavel Grachev have also sat at this table. In my opinion we  found a common language. We found agreement and discussed  matters.    Of course, over 50 years the economic integration was  enormous, and a policy of deep specialization, large-scale  construction projects, and large enterprises was followed. We  continue to feel this today. Those kinds of interests I  understand.    But you know, when a high official talks about permanent  interests in the Baltic region it leads me to various thoughts.  There are people who are using this for their own ends. The  discussion here must, of course, be carried through to the end.    [Pyadyshev] Apparently you have in mind the RF minister of  foreign affairs' speech at a meeting at the ministry. An uproar  began after that, but explanations were later given.    [Brazauskas] When things are explained "later," it often  fails to achieve the desired end...    [Pyadyshev] It was clarified that the journalist who  attended  the meeting had presented the minister's words inaccurately.    [Brazauskas] Judge for yourself, we get information, perhaps  distorted, but we cannot check it for ourselves. This phrase is  used about us, the "near abroad." Basically, what does this  mean, the near abroad? What is understood by this?    [Pyadyshev] I assure you that the Baltic region was not  included in the near abroad at that meeting--and I attended  it--or anywhere else. This term encompasses a very definite  group of countries, which constitute the CIS...    But let us turn to another subject. You mentioned Mikhail  Sergeyevich Gorbachev. How did your relations with him take  shape when you were first secretary of the Central Committee of  the Lithuanian Communist Party?    [Brazauskas] I am not the judge, of course, but it is my  personal impression that he gave in to a rock-hard politburo.  And did not undertake to restructure our life. Something was  always holding him back. But life was already demanding a new  approach, new solutions within the state, and a certain freedom  in the activity of public and even party organizations. Where  did it begin among us? As first secretary I made a firm demand  that party organizations be given autonomy. But the Central  Committee, especially the organizational department, was still  filled with people who longed for the old days, Razumov,  Razumovskiy, Yegor Kuzmich.    They always said that the politburo was a monolith, a  monolith. But this monolith fell into pieces. If we had gone to  a multiparty system it would not have been so dramatic. When our  first rally was organized a shout went up to expel certain  people from the party. Pugo gave me a list then of 10 people who  had expressed their opinions. They sent a commission and  terrorized us for a whole month. "Why aren't you responding  according to the party line?" But how can you say that when life  has completely changed? The party leadership did not see this  or, possibly, certain people saw it but were afraid to say it.  Finally we expelled ourselves, and then after that they expelled  us at the politburo.    Incidentally, have you read my book "Divorce Lithuanian  Style"? In it I tried to present the events of that period as  fully as possible.    [Pyadyshev] How do you see the results of the Brazauskas  presidency by the time it concludes?    [Brazauskas] I have only been president for a year, and of  course, it is very difficult to guess far into the future. Today  we can only engage in fantasy. If we are able to preserve a  consistently working government we will achieve tangible  results. Instability of the executive power produces poor  results. That is my goal. Of course, we cannot avoid the  replacement of certain ministers. But under our Constitution if  more than half of them are replaced then the parliament must  give the government a vote of confidence. We will have to do  that, and we will do it. Therefore I attach great importance to  the work of the government and to work with the government. With  the Cabinet of Ministers. We have very close  ties--consultations, discussions of particular issues. The prime  minister visits me 4-5 times a week. I drop in to his office.  That is a mandatory condition. But I never work for them and I  do not issue any ukases, although I do have certain powers.</p>

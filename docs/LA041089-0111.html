			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> PRO-CHOICE BACKERS LOBBY CONGRESS  </P> <P> Abortion rights activists lobbied on Capitol Hill today as their leaders  predicted that the massive turnout for their march will leave a strong  impression on the Supreme Court.  </P> <P> Hundreds of activists who took part in Sunday's march got some quick lessons in  congressional lobbying and then made their way to the offices of their local  representative or senator to press their case.  </P> <P> While law enforcement authorities estimated the Sunday rally crowd at 300,000,  Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority, said the  turnout was more than 600,000. Either way, the turnout was higher than the  90,000 people who gathered for a March, 1986, abortion rights rally in  Washington and the number that the rally's organizers had predicted.  </P></p>

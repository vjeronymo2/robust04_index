			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Heineken buys holding in popular Polish brewer Heineken, the Dutch brewing group, has agreed to pay Fl 77m for 24.9 per cent of Zywiec, one of Poland's best-known breweries with an 8 per cent share of the local market. Heineken said it was not planning to increase further its holding in Zywiec, which last year reported net profits of 155.7bn zlotys (Dollars 7m). Yesterday, the stock exchange suspended trading in Zywiec shares to give investors time to digest the news about the capital injection. The company is presently capitalised at 5,800bn zlotys. The Dutch brewer's planned partnership with Zywiec comes soon after Brau Und Brunnen, the big German brewer, announced it controlled 25 per cent of Okocim, another listed Polish brewery. Heineken is taking its stake through an issue of new shares. Zywiec, advised by Schroders, is to propose the share issue to a March 28 meeting of shareholders, which include Invesco's CEAM investment fund.</p>

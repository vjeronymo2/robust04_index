			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bangkok -- Fiscal Policy Office Director General  Somchai Ruchuphan yesterday denied U.S. allegations accusing the  Thai tax system of not meeting international standards, and said  the U.S. itself has used the same tax methods Thailand uses on  certain products.    The director, in response to U.S. condemnation of the tax  system in Thailand, said Thai tax calculation is based on the  quantity and price of goods purchased, much the same as in many  foreign countries. However, according to the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), taxes must be levied as a  percentage of the value of the goods.    Thailand uses this method because tax on some kinds of  products can not be easily calculated. For example, the Customs  Department sometimes fails to receive the correct prices of  import products from the importers.    A product may be priced at 1,500 baht, but the information  given to the department claims that the price is only 1,000  baht. The system of Thai taxation has been quite effective for  the most part, Somchai said, but he admitted there is still room  for improvement.    Economics Business Department Director General Kroekkrai  Chiraphaet reaffirmed Somchai's statement and said the United  States, along with several other foreign countries, is  responsible for accusing Thailand of violating tax regulations  as well as making some changes to its collection system which  was supposedly agreed upon in the GATT. The accusations are not  entirely true, he said.</p>

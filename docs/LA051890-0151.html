			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION 3-A SOFTBALL PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> South Torrance 1, Capistrano Valley 0 -- South Torrance only had two hits, but  it did have a hometown wind in its favor.  </P> <P> South Torrance's Gillian Boxx hit a lazy fly to right field that looked to be  the final out of the sixth inning. But the ball sailed away from Capistrano  Valley's Shelly Smith and popped out of her glove for an error, scoring Angela  Bean from second base.  </P> <P> Throughout the game, a strong breeze blew from the West. South Torrance right  fielder Tammy Hertica also made an error on a windblown fly ball, but the  mistake didn't cost the Spartans.  </P> <P> "Right field can be a killer in this ballpark," South Torrance Coach Larry Lent  said. "It didn't hurt us any today, but it hurt them, and that was the  difference in the game."  </P> <P> It also gave South Torrance its first playoff victory in softball in 33 years.  The Spartans (18-3) tied West Torrance for the Ocean League championship, but  went into the playoffs as the league's No. 2 entry after losing a coin flip.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley, the fourth-place team from the South Coast League, entered  the playoffs as an at-large team and finished the season at 15-11.  </P> <P> For three innings, Capistrano Valley freshman Daniela Hugelshofer kept South  Torrance off-balance. She allowed only one hit before giving way to senior  Jennifer Smith (10-10), who struck out four in three innings.  </P> <P> Smith gave up only one hit, an infield chopper between the pitcher and first  base by Bean in the sixth. Bean advanced to second on Monica Emmrich's  groundout, then Boxx, South Torrance's best hitter at .529, hit the fly ball  that won the game.  </P> <P> Senior Julie DeJaifre (6-1) went the distance for South Torrance, allowing only  Hugelshofer's hit down the first-base line in the fourth. DeJaifre, who missed  six weeks of the regular season with a broken bone in her left foot, struck out  two.  </P> <P> South Torrance will play either Bellflower (22-6) or Covina (14-5) in the  second round Tuesday.

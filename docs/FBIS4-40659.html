			<p>BFN     [Text] A massive meeting organized by the Attan public  movement was held yesterday in Almaty in front of the Chinese  Embassy to Kazakhstan. The participants of the meeting were  protesting against nuclear tests held at the Lop Nur testing  site, which is located only 300 km away from the Kazakh border.  Multiethnic participants of the meeting expressed support for a  statement released by the Kazakh Foreign Ministry in connection  with the explosion at Lop Nur.    Kazakhstanis are especially concerned about these tests  because they have suffered for over 40 years from the tests at  the Semipalatinsk site and are worried about the fate of their  future generations. The Kazakh people, who have contributed so  much to the closure of the Semipalatinsk site, are protesting  together with the peoples of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, who also  border on China. There are no borders to protect us against  nuclear radiation and its consequences. The meeting and rally,  which began yesterday in front of the Chinese Embassy, will  finish on 29 August in New York in front of the UN headquarters.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Fed chief responds to G30 derivatives report MR David Mullins, vice-chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, yesterday told international swap and derivatives dealers that proper supervision of the derivatives industry would require far more than the status quo. His was the first official reaction by the US central bank to the Group of 30 report on derivatives issued in London last week. Mr Mullins, speaking to the International Swap and Derivatives Association meeting in New York, said: 'The report's statement that the existing regulatory framework is adequate does not appear to be derived from or supported by an extensive analysis of the full range of public policy issues associated with derivatives activities.' He added that while the G30 report helped to clarify understanding of the new financial instruments, their complexity and diversity made their measurement and control more important than was the case with traditional shares and bonds. Systemic risks from derivatives were often overstated, he said, but the report did not offer insights that would 'alter estimates of the probability of a systemic disturbance or of its potential costs.' Mr Mullins criticised the G30 for not addressing the need to follow-up its recommendations to derivatives practitioners.</p>

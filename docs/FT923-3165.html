			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Angola's poll THE VISION of a stable and thriving post-apartheid southern Africa is being tested in Angola, and the outcome is in the balance. Can the ruling MPLA and its main challenger, Unita, settle their differences through the ballot box at the end of this month, or will old enmities prevail? The stakes are high. A successful transition to democracy will help unlock the potential of one of Africa's most richly endowed countries, which in association with South Africa could provide the economic boost the region badly needs. Pretoria is Luanda's natural trading partner, notwithstanding the irony that Angola's oil - over 500,000 barrels a day - will be paying for the rehabilitation of an economy that South Africa helped destroy. Failure will not only destroy this vision and dash hopes for the recovery of a country battered by a 16-year civil war. The consequences of an unstable Angola permeate the region, whether as refugees, traffic in arms or the continued closure of the Benguela railway, once the main outlet to the sea for Zaire and Zambia. The omens are mixed as the country enters the last phase of a process which began with a UN monitored ceasefire 16 months ago. Banditry by demobilised soldiers, unrest in the oil enclave of Cabinda, and increasing tension between the two armies all threaten a fragile peace. An encouraging development was last week's news that both President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader, intend to form broad based administrations irrespective of their margin of victory. But this assurance may not be enough to contain tensions that could derail a process that has been flawed from the start. It has always been apparent that the UN mission was given inadequate resources for its task of monitoring the ceasefire and the demobilisation of two rival armies, and deciding whether the elections are free and fair. In contrast with the UN role during Namibia's transition to independence, it does not have to organise the poll. But the contrast between the Namibian operation, with 6,000 UN personnel in a country with a good infrastructure and only 1m people, and what is expected from a 600-strong UN team in a country shattered by war and with 10m citizens, is a sorry one. The difficulties are compounded by Angola's weak bureaucracy and mutual distrust between MPLA and Unita, which has left vital features of the transition behind schedule. Demobilisation of the two armies is incomplete, as is the creation of a new national army. Nor is it certain that the government can arrange the efficient distribution and collection of ballot boxes, any more than that the UN team has the resources with which to make a definitive pronouncement on the exercise. Angola's hazardous transition may well succeed, but it will be due as much to good fortune as good judgment.</p>

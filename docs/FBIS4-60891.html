			<p>BFN     [Text] The president has issued a decree approving a  program to conduct complex political and legal research in  1994-95 on ways and forms of strengthening the Russian state.  The program has been developed by workers of the Institute of  State and Law of the Russian Academy of Sciences.    Boris Yeltsin has also sanctioned the main directions of  this  research. They include six sections, of which the priority one  is the development of the legal system of the Russian Federation  after the adoption of the new constitution. In particular, an  idea has been advanced concerning the setting up of a unified  humanitarian space over the territory of the former Soviet  Union, which will guarantee protection of the rights of the  Russophone population in the former Soviet republics and will  help settle the issue of forced emigration.</p>

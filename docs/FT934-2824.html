			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Widney A return to profit in the second half left Widney, a maker of windows and water treatment, power transmission and electronic equipment, with a reduced loss of Pounds 150,000 for the year to October 2. The improvement, from a Pounds 371,000 deficit previously, was achieved on sales of Pounds 22m (Pounds 19.3m). The sales figure included a Pounds 1.16m contribution from SPC International, acquired in August. Mr David Cassidy, chairman and chief executive, said the group would have reported a small profit were it not for the effects of receivership at two customers - Leyland Daf and Swan Hunter. Interests costs were reduced to Pounds 546,000 (Pounds 823,000) aided by lower interest rates and reduced borrowings. The period ended with gearing of 60 per cent (277 per cent). Losses per share were halved to 0.49p.</p>

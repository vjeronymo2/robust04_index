			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (22): Culture on a grand scale  -The arts scene / Paris has long been a lively centre for the world's academics, artists, writers, architects, musicians and film makers IT was back in the year 1102 that Paris first won its laurels as the cultural capital of Europe thanks to Abelard, the learned logician, who left the stuffy old cathedral school of Notre Dame to set up his own school on the Montaigne Sainte-Genevieve. Other freethinkers followed Abelard's lead. Medieval Paris became the 'New Athens,' a hubbub of learning, with scholars and teachers flocking to the city first from France, and then from all over Europe. Paris has been a centre for the world's academics, artists, writers, architects, musicians and film makers ever since. From time to time other cities have tried to usurp its position. New York ousted it in the 1940s as the centre of the modern art movement, just as Milan did in the 1970s for architecture. But the sheer scale and range of Paris' artistic activities means that it has always played a special role in the cultural sphere. In recent years the Paris arts scene has experienced an extraordinary burst of energy, fuelled by the support of the socialist government which, under Jack Lang, its long-serving arts minister and a close associate of President Mitterrand, has invested heavily in the arts. Jack Lang sees the investment in the arts not only as a lynchpin of the government's attempts to safeguard France's cultural heritage, but also as an economic catalyst, to boost tourism and create jobs within the arts industry. Critically he has persuaded the president, and rest of the French government, to agree. During Jack Lang's nine years at the arts ministry, 'l'epoque Lang,' as Liberation calls it, the proportion of the national budget allocated to the arts has more than doubled to just under 1 per cent, or FFr13bn. A large chunk of this money has been lavished on Paris. At a time when many of London's main monuments are shrouded by protective plastic and the British government dithers over whether or not it can afford to restore them, the French capital has been engaged in an unprecedentedly ambitious programme of architectural construction and renovation. The Grands Projets, which President Mitterrand has presented as a testimony to the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution - but his critics see as megalomaniacal monuments to himself - have left Paris with a new opera house at Bastille, a science museum at La Villette, an Arabic cultural centre beside the Seine, a triumphal arch at La Defense and a glacial pyramid in the middle of the Louvre museum. Add to this the opening of the Musee D'Orsay, the Louvre restoration scheme, the Jeu de Paume's metamorphosis into a contemporary arts museum, the renovation of the Tuileries and Palais Royal gardens, the regilding of all the prominent statues in the city and you get some idea of the scale of Jack Lang's legacy to the French capital. These programmes have been accompanied by a lower profile, but no less influential, policy of arts subsidy. The French government's film funding strategy has turned Paris into the centre of European cinema. A number of large French companies, the Canal Plus television group and the Bouygues construction empire, have set up film production subsidiaries. This has created a sprawling satellite sector of film lawyers, set designers, distributors, make-up artists and agents, all based in Paris, to service the cinema industry. Sometimes it seems as though nothing escapes the eagle-eyed arts minister. One group of self-avowedly avant garde artists, who were working from the derelict L'Hopital Ephemere in the groovy Pigalle district were startled to see their alternative credentials shattered when they became the recipients of an unsolicited subsidy from Mr Lang. L'Epoque Lang has not been universally successful. The opera is a constant bone of contention. The opulent old Paris Opera house had lost its stature in the musical world long before President Mitterrand and his energetic arts minister arrived on the scene. The FFr700m new Opera de Bastille was their solution. It was to be a 'people's opera' with a state-of-the-art auditorium, cheap seats and wonderful music. Instead, the Opera de Bastille has been plagued by the same union problems - and the same customer complaints about high prices and intermittent strikes - as the old opera house. It has also been clouded by controversy over the firing four years ago of Daniel Barenboim, its first artistic director, and more recently the resignation of Philippe Belaval as director general following a tragic accident in Seville when a set collapsed killing one member of the chorus and injuring 30 others. Meanwhile the old opera house has been reduced to staging ballet and occasional showings of vintage Hollywood musicals. Jack Lang's critics have revelled in the melodramas of the opera world. They see the flamboyant arts minister, with his penchant for graffiti art and Thierry Mugler suits, as the epitome of the sybaritic socialists, la gauche caviare, who have swept to power in the Mitterrand era. They also see him as a presidential poodle and a fritterer of public funds. Chief among the critics is Jacques Chirac, one-time prime minister, would-be president and now mayor of Paris. The battles between the arts minister, in his meticulously restored offices in the heart of the lovely Palais Royal, and the mayor of Paris, in his Disneyesque headquarters at Hotel de Ville, have added a definite frisson to the Paris arts scene of the 1980s and early 1990s. The latest row is over the new Bibliotheque de France, the national library otherwise known as the Tres Grande Bibliotheque, now being built with government money on a patch of land owned by the Continued on next page Lively arts scene Continued from previous page city council near Gare d'Austerlitz. Jacques Chirac has done everything he can to stop the project. He has criticised the design, a series of glazed glass towers conceived by the 39-year-old architect, Dominique Perrault. He has even threatened to take back the land. The Tres Grande Bibliotheque is going ahead, albeit with a modified design, thanks to the constant complaints of the Paris mayor and the 200 academics who petitioned President Mitterrand claiming that the original building would have toasted France's academic treasures. The battles between the mayor and the arts minister almost always make entertaining spectator sport. They also work to the art lover's advantage in that one of Jacques Chirac's main tactics - vocal though he has been in attacking Jack Lang's alleged extravagance - is to invest in the city of Paris' own ambitious arts schemes. One of the best examples is in modern art, where the city council has spent heavily to turn its Art Deco edifice, the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (MAM), at Iena, into a serious competitor to the government-funded Centre Georges Pompidou. Four years ago MAM appointed a new director, Suzanne Page, who has turned the museum into one of Europe's liveliest contemporary art centres by concentrating on the recent work, notably conceptual art, that the more conventional Pompidou curators ignored. MAM has since become an unquestionable success with Jacques Chirac and the city council basking in its reflected glory. Meanwhile Jack Lang, always anxious to preserve his reputation as France's grooviest politician, has decided that Paris did not have enough space for contemporary art. He has turned the Jeu de Paume - originally the royal tennis court in the Tuileries Gardens and later the shabby, but evocative Impressionist museum - into a new contemporary art gallery. The Jeu de Paume has since shown a series of sensational exhibitions. The MAM programme is as innovative as ever and the Pompidou Centre has drafted in a new director, Dominique Bozo, with a brief to liven it up. There is more modern art to see, and more galleries to visit, in Paris than ever before. Long may hostilities go on.</p>

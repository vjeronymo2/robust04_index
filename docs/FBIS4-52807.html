			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Weekly news conference by President Fidel V. Ramos with </F> domestic correspondents at Malacanang Palace in Manila -- live;  passages within slantlines in Tagalog]    [Text] [Press Secretary Jesus Sison] Hi, Mr. President.  This afternoon, we have the officers of the National Press Club  and the new officers of the Philippine Press Institute [PPI].  They will take their oath before you later after the press  conference.    [Ramos] Good afternoon officials of the National Press Club.  Would you rather have the press con [conference] first or would  you rather have the induction and the inauguration ahead?  [response from the correspondents] Press con /first/, so you  are first and foremost journalist and reporters.    Yes, in connection with my directive to the acting secretary  of the Department of Interior and Local Government yesterday to  go as deeply and as comprehensively as possible into the  killings arising out of the /village/ elections. And when I  wrote that directive yesterday, there were 26 that have been  reported killed already including two Comelec [Commission on  Elections] officials, and today the report is 30.    I wanted to make sure that these killings and its incident  of  violence would be thoroughly investigated so that we could get  to the truth of the matter. And for the investigators, the  police in collaboration with the Comelec, the DND [Department of  National Defense], AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines], and  the Department of Justice and NBI [National Bureau of  Investigation] would be able to build up its case that would  lead to a successful prosecution and the conviction of the  guilty as maybe warranted by the evidence.    I think it's about time that we reverse this culture of  violence connected with elections. And that in our country as  in any other democratic representative country, that people  don't have to kill or get killed in order to succeed into a  political office. We have many bitter lessons of the past which  I suppose were part of our maturing into what we are now -- a  functioning democracy -- based on people power, based on the  decision of the majority of the electorate. And after many  years of bloodletting, I think that situation should now be  reversed, and present ourselves to the world as a mature, as a  democratic, and as a peaceful society. And I would like to  reiterate that message in the presence of the leaders of media  who are here for a very special occasion. Okay?    [Sison] Questions? The members of the officers of the  National Press Club and PPI may ask questions. [Laughter from  Ramos]    [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, good afternoon Sir.    [Ramos] Good afternoon.    [Unidentified correspondent] The NDF [National Democratic  Front] has threatened to pull out from the peace process. Can  we get your response about this, sir?    [Ramos] Well, so what's new? This isn't the first time they  threatened to pull out of the peace process. But we have bent  backwards to make sure that every opportunity is given to our  long lost brothers and sisters who have (?thread) themselves out  of the mainstream of our law-abiding society. And that  opportunity is still there, the door is still open. And we are  saying that many from the hills are taking advantage of our  peace process and availing of our national reconciliation and  development program so that they could again lead useful,  productive, and join in the development of our country.  [sentence as heard]    [Unidentified correspondent] Follow-up, sir. When will be  the peace talks to resume between the MNLF [Moro National  Liberation Front] and the government?    [Ramos] We are awaiting word from the Indonesian Government  because during the month of April when the talks, the second  round of talks were scheduled, we were told that they had  several state visitors. And that, maybe the month of May, or a  little afterwards would be a better time. In any case, that is  still very open.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, the new  value-added tax [VAT] law removes the exemption previously  granted to the book and newspaper publishing industry. Now,  with the additional imposition of the 10 percent tax on the  newspaper industry in particular would just cause many  newspapers to go (?under), to close shop. Is it possible under  the terms of the law to ...for the president to suspend the  effectivity of this particular provision?    [Ramos] We are studying right now the implementation of the  expanded VAT law precisely in regard to deferments in general  because the original VAT and this amendment to the VAT in effect  removed from our revenue books some 75 or 80 impositions. And  so, if you take action on one side, there is a counteraction or  a possible negative effect on the other. But I think you should  be assured that this expanded VAT law was studied over a very  long period, over several months in both chambers including in  the two panels of the house and the Senate in the conference  committee. And the president has no choice in that case except  to approve or veto. This is not like the General Appropriations  Act where the president can line veto certain items. So, all of  this is still under close study in regard to the so-called  deferments.    [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you, Mr. President.    [Ellen Tordesillas] Sir, this morning you met with the Papal  Nuncio and I understand he delivered a letter from Pope John  Paul II. May we know what was the message from the Pope?    [Ramos] Well, at the moment that is still confidential. But  it is connected with our support for family planning, which was  discussed in the preliminary meeting at the United Nations in  New York, to which meeting we sent a delegation headed by  Secretary Flavier.    On the other hand, the Papal Nuncio also came and I think  this is the most important message for all Filipinos, to assure  us that the Pope is coming in January 1995 as scheduled in spite  of his injury from which he is now fast recovering according to  Archbishop Morene, the Papal Nuncio. And I understand that from  Archbishop Morene that the Pope is now back at work. So these  are very reassuring words for all of us. In fact I have just  received from the central committee of the Philippine  Preparatory Commission of the Catholic Bishops that there is  already out in circulation this brochure [brochure shown to  media people] which says the Pope in Manila 1995, and it says  here, the Pope is coming to Manila to see you, to see all of us.    [Ellen] Sir, is this letter express concern over the  ...[pause] your government's population program? [sentence as  heard]    [Ramos] No.    [Ellen) Sir, thank you.    [Correspondent identified only as Jake] Sir, just a  follow-up  question on the peace process. Attorney Veria, the spokesman of  your party is seeking [changes thought] is recommending the  release of Miss Tiamzon.    [Ramos] I think he was just expressing his opinion as a  member of one of our peace panels. But, uh,...the PNP  [Philippine National Police] should be given an opportunity to  follow-up this case to its logical conclusion because after all  we are merely following judicial processes under the rules of  court.    [Jake] How do you find such opinion?    [Ramos] Pardon?    [Jake] How do you find the...do you think it's worth  [question interrupted by Ramos]...?    [Ramos] As I said, that is his opinion, perhaps in his  personal capacity as a member of one of the peace panels but not  as a Lakas [Lakas ng Bansa -- Power of the Nation] spokesman.    [Jake] Thank you, sir.    [Ramos] After all, as president, and as president of all  Filipinos, I need not follow the party line. But that is not  the party line, I assure you.    [Correspondent identified only as Bobby] Good afternoon, Mr.  President.    [Ramos] Good afternoon.    [Bobby] Yesterday you issued a directive to Customs  Commissioner Parayno to follow-up the investigation on a certain  Michael Que who was name-dropping at the airport last Friday  after bringing in 1 million pesos worth of watches. There have  been similar cases in the past of people dropping your name or  any other government officials. How would you deal with such  people and the officials helping them?    [Ramos] Well, the policy is there that I will not allow any  such poseurs or influence peddlers to be using my name or that  of the first lady or even that of the rest of the first family.  But I'm still awaiting the report of the customs commissioner  on this because we don't really know the circumstances, so we've  asked them to look at this matter.    [Bobby] What about the other cases in the past, sir, when  there were some people dropping your name, particularly at the  airport?    [Ramos] First, there were investigations that were  conducted.  In the case that I recall in which an influence peddler was  trying to pose as a party leader using an old campaign calendar  that we were circulating during the campaign period with my  signature on it, he was upon the investigation, found out to be  using that for nefarious purposes. So the police took action.    [Bobby] Thank you, sir.    [Correspondent identified only as Mike] Good afternoon, Mr.  President.    [Ramos] Good afternoon.    [Mike] How would you assess the ongoing peace initiative of  government at this point in time?    [Ramos] We have taken a new initiative in the issuance of  proclamation 347 and proclamation 348, which, as you already  know were issued in late March, 25 March, to be submitted to  Congress for ratification. And to their credit, Congress --  both houses -- are thoroughly engaged in consultations even in  the countryside on the part of Senator Biazon to determine the  people's reactions to these, including from among the possible  beneficiaries. And we continue to work closely with those  committees of Congress in order to maximize the chances of  ratification. In general, that's the situation.    On the three fronts, the talks -- whether formal on the part  of the military rebels and regard to the MNLF [Moro National  Liberation Front] -- are continuing. Now, in regard to the CPP-  NPA-NDF [Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army-  National Democratic Front], we're still at the exploratory talks  stage. But as I said we have kept the door open to give  everybody the maximum opportunity to dialogue with the  government.    [Mike] Sir, don't you think that the continued detention of  Wilma Tiamzon will not hamper the peace initiative with the  communist rebels?    [Ramos] Well, as I said, we must follow judicial processes.  So, this states the government must hear to the law. The  government must adhere to the judicial process that is there.  After all, according to the police, there are existing warrants  that must be served.    [Mike] Thank you, Sir.    [Correspondent identified only as Manny] Good afternoon, Mr.  President.    [Ramos] Good afternoon.    [Manny) A top official of the House of Representatives said  last week that the passage of the five landmark measures  including the restructuring of the value-added tax would lead  the freedom of this country from the influence of the IMF in  three years time. Mr. President do you have, uh, do you agree  with this assessment?    [Ramos] Well, there are still certain legislative actions to  be taken. One of them is the proposed liberalization of the  banking industry in the Philippines. This is one of the  structural reforms that has to be put in place before we can  really be considered by the international community as open,  liberalized, and competitive with a level playing field for the  economy to flourish. But I would like to make clear again,  because we discussed this during previous meetings, that what we  are doing is not because of any IMF imposition. We are doing  this because this is what we see as the right direction for the  Philippine economy, for the political leadership to take.    You will recall that the VAT law, for instance, originated  back from the President Cory Administration. And the real VAT  law was initiated as early as the first session of the 8th  Congress in 1987 that became a law in 1988. And the economic  stabilization program, into which we are still up to now, was  initiated also about three years ago during the Cory  Administration. But we have to see through all of these steps.  So that we become really an open economy, not inward and  protected, and import-looking kind of an economy. Because  obviously the answer to the expansion of our economy and the  sustained prosperity of our people in the future is to be into  the export mode.    The economy must be export-led and investment-led, and  tourism- led, instead of us importing all the time goods from  other countries. So, this entire program that we are into would  lead to sustainable development. But we must finish all of the  various components of the structure so that we will be on a  sustainable mode, otherwise, we will have this cycle of boom and  bust, or up and down, or advance and retreat, as we experienced  during the past several decades. But now we have the  opportunity to do it. That's why we are pushing, and pushing  together with the leaders of Congress and the leaders of the  private sector. So that what we have been aspiring for for many  years will finally happen.    [Manny] On another subject Mr. President. The first  quarter of this year has seen the rise in heinous crimes in the  city of Manila, including murders and bank robberies. Would you  favor Mr. President a more police visibility, like fielding more  police foot patrols and conducting saturation drives in  crime-ridden areas?    [Ramos] Well, the answer is really a much more comprehensive  package of actions than just what you are suggesting, although  that is part of it. We have thoroughly discussed this with the  law enforcement authorities during our recent national summit on  peace and order at Camp Crame. The formula really involves the  five pillars of the so-called criminal justice system: the  police, the prosecution, the judiciary, the corrections, meaning  the penology and Bureau of Prisons people. And the fifth is the  community -- led by the governors and the mayors in their  respective jurisdictions -- plus, the very dedicated  participation of the concerned citizenry. So that is what it  will take. But in regard to the current situation, as I already  reported here, we have asked the Department of Interior and  Local Government, which has jurisdiction over the police and  local government units to take the lead and to be more thorough  and to be more dedicated in getting into the investigation of  all of the /village/ election-related violence.    Well, that is also true for the thorough investigation of  the  recent killing of Major Zarcal, of the Philippine National  Police. And we must get to the bottom of that, we must get to  the truth of the matter because, after all, Zarcal is one of  their own. And they are now challenged to come up with a  solution of the case and the apprehension of the killers, and  for those killers to be brought before the bar of justice. But  as I said, the entire anti-crime and peace and order effort  requires the interaction and close collaboration of all of these  five pillars of our criminal justice system.    [Manny] Thank you, Mr. President.    [Correspondent identified only as Jun] Good afternoon, Mr.  President. This is a follow-up question to that of Mr. Yambot on  the recently approved expanded value added tax. This concerns  Mr. President the economics of media especially the struggling  community press.    For the first time, Mr. President in all these years,  newspapers will be taxed for the first time and that the  broadcast will be taxed for the second time. If you will allow  me to trace, Mr. President, the history, until the third to the  last regime, all newspapers and radio broadcasting stations were  exempted from any tax. During the second to the last regime,  the newspapers were left untaxed but the broadcasting stations  were taxed. Now, Mr. President, I wonder if you will allow  under your regime, both electronics and the print media to be  taxed.    [Ramos] As I said, I did not pass those laws, and I do not  have the power of sectional or partial veto on these laws. But  I'll be happy to receive your position from the various sectors  of media.    By the way, there is a very revealing feature story authored  by Senator Herrera -- the author on the part of the Senate -- of  this expanded VAT law which explains what this law is all about.  And I would suggest, before we start getting too unhappy or  demoralized, that we refer to study this. It's a primer really,  where he explains the facts and the myths about the VAT law, and  there are nine particular issues that he deals with very, very  thoroughly, and very objectively in my view. And so I would  suggest that that would be a good reading for all of you. But  at the same time, as I said, I would welcome your suggestions  and proposals because after all, what Congress has put in place,  they can also amend. That's all there is to it. But the  executive cannot do something beyond what is in the law.    [Jun] Mr. President, section 17 of the law provides,  empowers the president to exclude some sectors.    [Ramos] That's what I said in answer to Danny Yambot here,  and that's why I'm saying that we welcome your suggestions so  that we can input whatever your opinions are. It will be  studied that one maybe.    [Jun] Thank you, Mr. President.    [Ramos] Thank you.    [Correspondent identified only as Vivian] Sir, a while ago  you mentioned the killing of Police Major Zarcal. The ABB [Alex  Boncayao Brigade] said its objective is to make government look  helpless and ineffective in the face of crime and corruption as  evidenced by their assassination of Zarcal and their threats to  kidnap some government officials and make them publicly confess  their corruption. What can you say about this, sir?    [Ramos] You know, the police's progress reports indicate  that  it is not necessarily the ABB that did the killing. That is not  yet a conclusion on the part of the police, they are looking at  other angles. Now, as to the ABB making all of these threats,  well again, this is not new. They have been making all kinds of  threats in the past. And they have always wanted to disrupt our  society and the well being and peace of mind of our people. But  again as I said in my remarks in regard to fighting crime and  fighting lawlessness in our society, we must continue to be  united in our actions and in our vigilance so that we can  finally project to the world and to our own people that ours is  a peaceful and law-abiding society, and not otherwise.    [Unidentified correspondent] Good afternoon, Mr. President.    [Ramos] Good afternoon.    [Unidentified correspondent] Yesterday or the other day, the  Miss Universe candidates came to see you and again in around  town. The game around town Mr. President is picking out at least  three to five winners. May we know your choice?    [Ramos] You know, in my welcome remarks to the Miss  Universe delegates, they are called delegates not contestants,  because they are considered as ambassadors of goodwill. I said  that I have retired from beauty judging back in 1973 because in  that one time that I was invited to be a judge to a Miss  Philippines contest, our choice, Margie Moran became Miss  Universe that same year. So, after that I retired already from  beauty judging. I said because I have a 20/20 vision and a  1,000 percent batting average. So this time I pass, I pass.    [Unidentified correspondent] Good afternoon, Your  Excellency.  It seems that the Indonesians are unhappy over the reports that  the Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor is going to be held in  Manila and there is a threat that the peace talks in Jakarta  might be jeopardized. May we know your comment on this, Mr.  President?    [Ramos] I would like you to know that there are certain  things here that must be understood. Number one, we have been  very concerned about this meeting which will be held in Manila.  But this was upon the initiative of a private group over which  the government has no control. And there have been  consultations between the Philippine Government and the  Indonesian Government at the highest levels. In fact, for your  information, I tasked Vice President Estrada, who is now in  South Africa to attend the inauguration of President Mandela, to  confer with Foreign Minister Ali Alatas of Indonesia about this  matter, and for Vice President Estrada to explain to the foreign  minister of Indonesia that while we are concerned about the  possible effect on Philippine-Indonesian relations of the  hosting by a private group in the Philippines of this meeting,  that it would be unconstitutional on our part to prevent such a  meeting from taking place in the Philippines.    Secondly, however, I asked the vice president also to convey  to our Indonesian friends through Foreign Minister Alatas that  we feel that the strength of Philippine-Indonesia bilateral  relations, as well as our relations as member nations under the  brotherhood of ASEAN, is strong enough to withstand any such  irritations as this may cause.    Now, I would like to add to all of that. That the  Philippines considers that East Timor is and remains a part of  Indonesia as its 37th province. This is the position we took a  long time ago. I also would like to take the opportunity to  again express our appreciation for the full and unstated support  that Indonesia has been giving to our peace process, which have  been most helpful in putting together the MNLF [Moro National  Liberation Front] under Chairman Misuari and our Republic of the  Philippines panel under Chairman Ambassador Yan. And that we  will continue to be committed to maintaining those deep and  strong ties with Indonesia.    [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you, Mr. President.    [Ramos] Now, let me add that there is a newspaper report. I  think in one of the radio and TV stations and then entered in  one of the evening paper last night, that a certain Carlos Forte  is inviting Jose Maria Sison to come to the Philippines to join  in that conference. And according to this report, they are to  undertake some kind of a revolution. Well, that is one thing  that we will not allow in the Philippines. Certainly we will  prevent any such happening in the Philippines, meaning, for the  two of them to get together in the Philippines to plant a  revolution. But in any case that report still has to be  verified. But it did come across my desk this morning and so  I'm making that comment in relation to your question.    [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you, Sir.    [Unidentified correspondent] /Good afternoon, beloved  president/. Sir, you did a lot of good changes in the previous  sad experience of our country. /Through this village election  held in your administration,/ will there be really a change,  especially in our electoral processes, that there will be no  more vote buying which has happened this previous /village/  election which lots of people fear might happen during the  upcoming election.    [Ramos] /That's what I've said just a while ago/ and I'm  glad you asked this question because my answer a while ago was:  I hope we change our political culture, of depending on the gun  and together with that would be goons and gold, because those  are our perennial diseases in elections -- guns, goons, and gold.    We have to reverse that culture because we are now supposed  to be a mature and functioning democracy that was created out of  people power during the EDSA [Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]  revolution of February 1986. And the whole world has been  admiring this Philippine style of democracy. But there are  other aspects of it that we must correct and change, and this  matter of the use of force and money and economic or political  influence where they should not be applied should also be  changed.    So, I'm hopeful that we improve step by step. I consider  these /village/ elections to be an improvement in that direction  towards change. But we must get away from this belief that it  is going to be the strongman, the warlord, the guy with the most  money that always wins elections in our society.    [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, I just want to get your  reaction, I do not create factionalism in our profession. But  there is this news that came out that there is this 100,000  pesos that Malacanang has distributed during this previous  /village/ election which I really hate to hear because I know  your administration, sir.    [Ramos] Thank you for again coming up with a question that  has to be clarified. First of all, I deny any participation and  I also deny for all of Malacanang. In regard to an alleged  100,000 pesos fund given to the congressmen, the congressmen  have their own funds in the House of Representatives also  appropriated by Congress. We are accountable for the funds that  are appropriated for us. So, why should I risk the good name  and the prestige of Malacanang by disbursing funds just like  that, for an election where there is supposed to be no  partisanship, no expenditure by anybody outside of the  /village/, other than what the Comelec [Commission on Elections]  has to spend for.    [Joel Paredes] Good afternoon, sir. Sir, will the border  agreement with Malaysia by January 1995 affect the Philippines'  claim to Sabah?    [Ramos] Will you say that question again please?    [Paredes] Sir, will the border agreement with Malaysia by  January 1995 affect the Philippines' claim to Sabah?    [Ramos] The border patrol agreement is still really in the  process of negotiation, but we hope it will be agreed to as soon  as possible. But that is just a border agreement. It also  includes a joint patrol agreement in order that smuggling,  illegal entry, drug trafficking, the trafficking of guns as well  as wanted persons will be better controlled by both parties. As  I mentioned to you in a previous press con, and I think you are  also the one that asked the question, and my answer is still the  same. We have pushed the Sabah claim in the back burners so to  speak. And we are dealing right now with immediate problems of  labor, illegal entry, border problems so that we can facilitate  trade between our two countries especially at the border areas.    [Paredes] Sir, but will the Philippines still pursue its  claim later, in the near future?    [Ramos] We have not abandoned the claim. But as I said, at  the moment, we are attending to more pressing issues that will  lead to the economic and social and political benefit of both  countries.    [Unidentified correspondent] Good afternoon Mr. President  and  congratulations for your improved vision after that meeting with  Miss Universe contestants. Anyway, Mr. President, in the  presence of the gods of Philippine media, let me ask this  question. Mr. President what is your perception or assessment  of government and Philippine media relations, and your  suggestions as to how this can be improved for the interest of  the country, of course without waiving media's right,  adversarial function as watchdog of Philippine society?    [Ramos] I think we are agreed that government relations with  media and my own personal presidential relations with media are  very good, but they could be better.    Did you not attend the gridiron put up by the National Press  Club? As I said, we should have this gridiron once a month so  that we will have a more frequent exposure to freedom of the  press Ramos style. But levity aside, I welcome all of my  encounters and opportunities to dialogue with media because  that's the way government also has to operate. Government must  be able to signal the correct messages to the public through  media. And in this role, media to me is one of the most  important pillars of our democracy, and one should not be  isolated from the other. That's why I make it a point to always  bring representatives of the Malacanang press corp as well as  the gods of media with me when I make my trips; whether in  country or abroad, even under water, they are invited to come  with me.    [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you Mr. President and  thank you for your donations to the National Press Club.    [Unidentified correspondent] My question Mr. President is of  regional concern in Mindanao, because I come from Davao. On my  way here last night, Father Barcelon who works in Cagayan says  that there's a feeling that this East ASEAN thing, the growth  polygon that's pushing in Mindanao which you have started going  on is confined in Davao and that some regional centers there in  Region IX and Region X feel that it's Davao getting all the  action. And we noted that this month, we were told that you are  going again to Davao three times, this month. And that might  send wrong signal again to the other centers in Mindanao. What  are really your plans Mr. President for Mindanao?    [Ramos] Well, I hope you do not see yourselves again in  Mindanao as being a bunch of cities and provinces. We are  looking at Mindanao. We are looking at the southern Philippines  in fact, and that includes Cebu now and parts of Palawan as  within this East ASEAN growth area. But we have to start  somewhere and we have to make sure that when we start this, that  is going to be very viable and is going to take off and is going  to spark into the other parts of Mindanao and also other parts  of the Philippines.    So, (?Mr.) Fr. Barcelon, for your prestigious media network,  that we are really looking first at the corridor between Davao  and General Santos City. But that there is a flagship project  in each of the five regions in Mindanao and that includes the  ARMM [Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao] and the flagship  project there is the completion, the concreting of the Marawi to  Cotabato City highway, to which we have assigned elements of two  engineering brigades of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.  And there in Northern Mindanao we have the (PHIVIDEC)  [expansion unknown] Cagayan de Oro to Iligan corridor and this  is already a well discussed development area for which we have  already approved the master plan presented by the group chaired  by Mayor Magtahas of Cagayan de Oro. And the opportunities for  opening up that area are ongoing like the privatization of the  National Steel Corporation in Iligan, concurrently with the  studying of the proposals by the (PHIVIDEC) and by the National  Steel Corp. and the National Development Corporation of the  integrated steel mill in Cagayan de Oro for which we have  already reserved some 500 hectares within the (PHIVIDEC)  industrial state.    Of course, there are also plans for Zamboanga that is the  western side of the E-A-G-A and there are already a lot of  interaction taking place between the business groups as well as  officials. And there are also plans for other key centers even  if they are not regional centers.    [Ramos] So, I would hope that again, let us not let our  envy overcome us because what is needed here is support, mutual  support and synergy, what we are doing for Region X.    The power plants are there. On the part of the private  sector, the (Tomin) series in Iligan, that's about 100 megawatts  with an investment of $100 million. And on the part of the  government, Napocor [National Power Corporation], the  100-megawatt power barge in Nasipit, Agusan del Norte, Region X,  but that serves all of Mindanao.    So, don't worry, it's coming. But it will come to you if you  go for it. Instead of waiting for the ripe guavas to fall on top  of our head, we have to go and grab the opportunities.    Now, one reason why I am going to Davao on three successive  weekends is, first, I have not visited Davao Oriental. I have  visited Cagayan de Oro and Misamis Oriental maybe four times  since I became president, as well as other parts of Region X. I  have not visited Davao del Sur, and I have not visited Davao del  Norte, because there is one for the three separate regions that  I am going there. So, please don't be envious of that because I  visit these places on a need basis.</p>

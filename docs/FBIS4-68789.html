			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Pestrukhina: "The Poor Have Outplayed the </F> Rich"; first paragraph MOSCOW NEWS comment]    [Text] The report by the Central Election Committee (CEC)  on spending financial resources during the December election  campaign submitted to the Duma has attracted much less attention  than expected. The deputies managed without parliamentary  discussions, the press, too, commented on the document rather  sparingly. What did the financial inspection reveal?    A total of 144 billion rubles were allocated from the budget  for the organization and holding of parliamentary elections and  the referendum. The actual expenses composed somewhat less than  112.3 billion.    The table compiled after the results of the report reveals  the exorbitant gap in the expenses on the election campaign  between the associations of democratic and opposition flanks.  Since the presentation of Vladimir Isakov who divided the sums  mentioned in the column of expenses, the average "cost" of one  deputy was deduced. As we can see from the table the lowest was  in the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) (1.7 million  rubles), the highest--in Russia's Choice (47.9 million rubles).

This statement  may be disregarded, but it is impossible to disregard the fact  that the entire opposition flank in their reports did not exceed  the limits of 100 million rubles--the amount allocated to all  election associations from the state budget. The election  campaign, however, was financed through a minimum of four  channels.    First--the election fund, to the account of which the  budgetary 100 million rubles are being transferred and (under  the law) sponsors' contributions are received. This is the  official channel that can be checked. But nothing prevents the  election associations from keeping, on the account of the fund,  exactly as much money, as was allocated by the state--not more.  Because the sponsors, if they are of foreign origin, may use  another way--settle the accounts of elections associations, for  which the latter are not obliged to report back to the CEC. The  third source of financing are the accounts of parties and  organizations making a part of the election association, the CEC  is not obliged to check them (and did not check). Finally, the  fourth source is what we call "black cash." These receipts are  not subject to any verification and, therefore, as though do not  exist at all.    It was the duty of election associations to report only on  the expenses from election funds (they are precisely given in  the table), and the duty of the Central Election Committee--only  to check these reports. However, the CEC went further and tried  to investigate the second channel. According to the statement by  Tamara Petronavicius, head of the financial department,  inquiries were made to TV and radio companies, leading  printshops and even banks. All the non-state organizations  preferred to keep mum (the law does not commit one to grant such  information) but the state TV and radio companies responded to  the inquiry.    As it was to be expected, the services by sponsors who  directly settled the accounts of election associations were  enjoyed by all. Thus, the firm Premier paid 33 million rubles  for radio broadcasts of Russia's Choice, the Mars company--62  million rubles for the TV publicity of the Democratic Party of  Russia (DPR), and the Sokol leisure center--almost 75 million  for the TV programs of the LDPR. However, the receipts "from  additional sources" revealed by the CEC, proved to be  unimportant, which shows the high professionalism of the  "bookkeepers" of the election associations: expenses which can  be easily checked (first of all for TV and radio broadcasts)  were paid mainly from election funds. The sponsors' non-cash  funds, according to experts, could be used to pay for printed  matter, to lease premises, and other verifiable expenses.    Naturally, there are no documentary proofs on the use of  "black cash." Of course, it is possible that the services of,  say, "collectors of signatures" were paid under the item "Other  expenses," and five blocs--Russia's Choice, PRUA, Civic-Union,  Russian Democratic Reform Movement (RDRM) and the LDPR did not  pay a kopek to their canvassers. However, even the CEC won't  take the risk of maintaining that what the reports represented  were exhaustive data. Confidential sources close to the election  headquarters of Choice and PRUA assure that the real expenses of  these blocs are 3-4 times more than those published. It would be  no exaggeration to assume that the expenses of other  participants in the election campaign must be assessed in a  similar proportion.    According to official reports, the sponsors of Russia's  Choice are leading banks and trade corporations specializing in  export-import operations (the banks Stolichny Olbi-Diplomat and  others). Similar structures back up Grigory Yavlinsky. The  Centrist blocs "milked" former state enterprises and concerns  (now formally non-state) thanks to extensive contacts among the  directors. Even after inspection, the sources financing the LDPR  remain a mystery: the "exposed" official sponsors are small, not  serious firms, the other hypotheses published in various  publications were not confirmed by any documents. Only  communists and agrarians used their electorate for financial  support: the former drew, as they put it, the party money--the  fees of half a million members, the latter relied on the funds  of transformed, but actually kept collective and state farms.    It may be assumed that in the future, too, democratic blocs  may count on strong financial "rears" and economic advantages  over their opponents. But for success at the elections, as this  past December has shown, big capitals are not enough.  Significant in this sense is the disastrous failure of  "centrists." The associations Civic Union and New Names that  enjoined the covert support of Premier Chernomyrdin (New Names  was financed by Gazprom) were not short of means. Despite this,  they did not gain a single mandate.    The financial report of the CEC presented democrats with yet  another unpleasant surprise. Only three associations--Russia's  Choice, Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc and Civic Union--were  officially exposed as receiving donations from firms with  foreign capital. It is noteworthy that in the report ascribed to  the sponsors "of mixed blood" are the firms not only with  British, American and other capital, but also the joint-stock  company Aircraft industry (a former USSR Chief Directorate), as  well as the joint-stock company Metalkhim (both financed the  Civic Union): about 5% of the stocks of the first company  belong to enterprises from the ex-Soviet republics, of the  second, even less--only 2%.    According to Tamara Petronavicius, the operating legislation  does not always help to determine what firms must be considered  as "with foreign participation."    The CEC has prepared proposals for the new election law. It  is suggested that hence the participants in elections must  transfer all sponsor means to the accounts of election funds and  only through this official channel all the payments must be  effected. However, this demand can hardly be fulfilled: it is  impossible to check everything that is printed in thousands of  small printshops or on the duplicating machines of hundreds of  thousands of organizations in different regions of the country.  Just as it is impossible to keep an eye on all the broadcasts of  private radio companies and cable TV channels...    The obvious "approximation" of the financial report of the  CEC explains the fact that it was taken by the Council of the  Duma "into consideration." Most likely, the work of legislators  will end on this point: the "poor" have outplayed the "rich" on  all matters, including commercial, and both participated in the  game according to the same rules and, therefore, are equally  convinced that it is hopeless and dangerous to get at the roots  of things.</p>

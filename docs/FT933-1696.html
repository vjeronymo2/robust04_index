			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Leaked letters a new obstacle to BAe-Taiwan aircraft deal MR JOHN CAHILL, the chairman of British Aerospace, is expected to meet Taiwanese government ministers today and discuss the latest obstacle to progress on a joint venture to build regional jet aircraft. Opposition politicians in Taiwan have leaked letters from Mr Cahill to Mr Chiang Ping-kun, minister of economic affairs, in an attempt to show that the deal is politically rather than commercially motivated. Mr Cahill is due to meet both the vice-premier and Mr Chiang, whose ministry is sponsoring Avro Aerospace International, the joint venture between BAe and Taiwan Aerospace (TAC). The leaked letters from Mr Cahill to Mr Chiang are dated August 13 and 16. They threatened to abandon the joint venture if its funding problems were not resolved. One suggested that the Taiwanese government should 'simply . . . have instructed the (state-run) Chiao Tung Bank to provide (the) working capital needed.' Mr Cahill suggested in the letters that both TAC and the Chiao Tung Bank were 'not proceeding in good faith' and threatened to call a press conference to call the deal off. The problem of financing the deal was resolved a fortnight later after further negotiations in Taipei. The venture is part of BAe's efforts to improve its profitability. The RJ series of regional jet passenger aircraft, which would be built partly in Taiwan, loses money for BAe. The venture would also provide a route for Taiwan to enter the passenger aircraft industry. Members of Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive party have long been critical of the project, saying that its risks had been understated and its benefits to Taiwan industry exaggerated. The renewed political opposition to the deal based on the leaked letters can only have a limited effect on the progress of the joint venture. The deal can go ahead without the explicit approval of lawmakers. But opponents can delay it and at worst vote to force the cabinet to end its support for the project or re-evaluate it. This is only the latest in a series of hurdles raised by Taiwan banks involved in financing the project. Although the financing structure was agreed on August 27, subsequent talks in London on the transfer of manufacturing and product development were not conclusive. BAe says a final agreement will not be signed until the end of the year at the earliest.</p>

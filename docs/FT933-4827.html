			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Hard slog to make the marriage work: The merger of Renault and Volvo can only succeed if market share rises and costs fall The intensity of the struggle for survival in the global auto industry is forcing Renault and Volvo to abandon the luxury of their protracted engagement. The marriage knot must now be tied - for better or for worse. By the time the merger is completed on January 1 1994 to form Europe's second-largest and the world's sixth-biggest auto maker (by production volume), the courtship will already have lasted for nearly four years. The sensitivities of the two sets of parents, the French state and Volvo's Swedish shareholders, could no longer be allowed to block an outright merger, if the savings of union were not to be frittered away in the cumbersome bureaucracy of Franco-Swedish joint corporate committees, which have increasingly run the alliance in the past three years. The economic environment in which Renault and Volvo are operating has become harsher since the groups signed a letter of intent in February 1990 to enter a far-reaching partnership cemented with minority cross-shareholdings. Now there can be no more half measures. Volvo has spent two of the last three years in loss, and while Renault achieved an impressive financial recovery in 1991 and 1992, this year its profits have begun to melt away again in the face of the precipitous decline in the west European markets. Volvo has struggled back into the black in the first six months of 1993 but only after three years of painful restructuring that has included a cut of nearly a fifth in the workforce of its car operations, the planned closure of two car plants in Sweden and the closure of a truck plant in the US. For its part, Renault has suffered an 87 per cent year-on-year drop in pre-tax profits in the first six months of this year after being in loss in the final quarter of 1992. In the first half of this year the Volkswagen group, Ford of Europe and Fiat Auto were all in loss, and PSA Peugeot-Citroen, Renault's arch domestic rival, is also forecast to report a loss. Renault's relative success in the past three years and Volvo's deep problems are reflected in shareholding arrangements agreed yesterday. What began in 1990 as a 50-50 alliance between would-be equals, has emerged as a 65-35 per cent arrangement in Renault's favour. 'The shareholding arrangement of the new group corresponds to the relative worth of each partner as valued today,' said Renault. (While all of Renault is included within the merged Renault-Volvo, it must be remembered, the group includes only Volvo's automotive operations. The Volvo parent company retains separately its marine and aero engine and food processing businesses and its pharmaceutical interests.) 'If you want to win you must go faster,' said Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman and chief executive of Renault, who will now become chief executive of Renault-Volvo. 'The advantage of a complete merger is simplicity and speed. Agreement between two companies does not go as fast as managing a single group. Speed is of the essence, we must go beyond the limits of the co-operation to date.' Renault and Volvo claimed yesterday that the merger could generate savings of about FFr30bn (Pounds 3.4bn) before the year 2000 as costs are shared over a larger volume of production. 'The potential savings resulting from a merger are significantly greater than what could be achieved within the present alliance,' the companies said. Adding to the financial and industrial muscle of the new group is the way Renault and Volvo largely complement each other in the car market. Renault, the volume carmaker whose Clio model was Europe's best-selling small car last year, is strongest in southern Europe, but with a growing presence in Germany and the UK. Renault is the leader in the European light commercial vehicle market, where Volvo is absent. The Swedish group, primarily a maker of large, executive cars, is more focused on northern Europe, and has held on to a significant presence - by European standards - in the North American car market, where Renault has been absent since it sold its troubled stake in American Motors to Chrysler in 1987. It is a different story in the heavy commercial vehicle industry, where Volvo and Renault compete directly both in Europe and in North America. Together they will represent the world's third-largest truckmaker (above 6 tonnes gross vehicle weight) behind Mercedes-Benz of Germany and Isuzu of Japan, the second-largest heavy truckmaker (above 15 tonnes) and the second-largest bus and coach maker behind Mercedes-Benz. Whatever the muscle of the new group, however, the merger will only succeed if one plus one can equal more than two in market share and less than two in costs. The obstacles in the way of successful rationalisation remain formidable, and the benefits will not be won easily. 'Management literature is full of warnings against big mergers,' admitted Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, chairman of Volvo who will also chair the supervisory board of Renault-Volvo Automotive. 'There are mergers that have turned sour, but there are many examples of success too. Being aware of the dangers, we can avoid many of the pitfalls. 'A major strength is that we have worked together in the alliance. It is a learning experience that few other corporations have had.' The big economies of scale will only be gained when the merged Renault-Volvo has succeeded in rationalising and integrating the respective car and truck ranges of the two companies. The group will try to ensure that its public face to the customers is little changed. It will fight intensely to keep the Renault and Volvo marques distinct to protect the value of the names. Showrooms and dealer networks will remain apart and the design and engineering departments will aim to make the products look different. Under the metal skin of the products and behind the showroom facade all must change radically, however, as Renault-Volvo products seek to use as many common components as possible, to use common suppliers, common product platforms, common logistics, transport and computer systems, common media-buying for advertising and common offices for marketing and distribution. Changing product generations can take more than a decade to complete. Volvo is at the start of the launch of a heavy truck range, which has taken seven years and an investment of SKr6.5bn to develop. The existing heavy truck range was launched in 1977, and the new one will not be replaced until well into the next decade. It took the Peugeot group more than a decade to rationalise and integrate its Peugeot and Citroen ranges to the point where today they all have common platforms, engines and gearboxes, while maintaining a separate market identity. Moreover, in the past three years of alliance, Renault and Volvo have already discovered that it has been more difficult to win synergy gains from the previously rival truck operations than from the more complementary car businesses. It is in trucks and buses that the biggest rationalisation gains could probably be found, but it is here that the turf wars are already most fierce. The existing alliance was ill-suited to end such in-fighting with its ungainly structure of endless committees from the joint policy general committee (JPGC) to the joint car technical co-ordination committee (JCTCC), the joint truck technical co-ordination committee (JTTCC) and the Economic Interest Groupings (EIGs) for purchasing and quality. The unified management will have to move quickly - but with great delicacy - to break this structure and create a common culture. At least when Peugeot and Citroen were merged there was a common language. Now the comrmon language of the group will be foreign to both, namely English. Some 90 per cent of Renault language training is now being devoted to English 'to help improve communications between the two companies'. The cultural divide is so thorny that another Renault-Volvo co-ordination effort is already trying to cope with the problem of summer holidays. Volvo closes in July and Renault in August. As Renault-Volvo Automotive fights to survive in the global auto industry of the next century, the devil will be in the detail as the partners try to make their marriage last.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [James Blitz and Ivor Owen report: "Hurd Restresses Stance </F> on EU Votes"]    [Text] Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday  sought to reassure Conservatives that he would not strike an  agreement on a new European Union [EU] voting system that would  dilute British interests.    Addressing Conservatives in Poole last night, Mr Hurd said  there was no guarantee that Britain would reach agreement with  its EU partners on a new voting system when foreign ministers  resumed talks on the issue next week.    "If we are to move forward as a Union of 16, it should be on  the basis of as widespread consent as possible," he said. "That  is the best way to avoid conflict and bickering on a permanent  basis."    He said that the British public wanted the government to  exercise judgment in the interests both of Britain and Europe.    EU member states propose that the threshold for the  "blocking  minority" should rise from 23 to 27 votes when four new  countries enter the Union next year. Britain and Spain are  opposing this, although both are being offered a compromise that  would allow a minority of states to see a two-month delay in  decisions.    Meanwhile, pressure intensified on the government yesterday  to accept that its citizens should have a continuing right to  initiate individual cases in the European Court of Human Rights.    Mr Richard Alexander, Conservative MP for Newark, in a  Commons debate on the Council of Europe, warned that Britain's  reputation would be damaged if the government tried to insist  that it should remain a conditional right subject to review at  five-yearly intervals.    He said that Turkey, whose record on human rights would not  commend itself to the British people, was the only country to  have adopted a similar attitude.    Mr Mark Lennox-Boyd, Foreign Office junior minister, said  the  UK government was still considering a suggestion that the right  should be made mandatory.</p>

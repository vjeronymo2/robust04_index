			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Hafnia to sell UK unit HAFNIA, the troubled Danish insurance company, is negotiating the sale of Prolific, its UK life insurance subsidiary, to Scottish Provident, the mutually-owned life insurance company. The sale would be the most significant disposal by Hafnia since the company suspended payments to creditors in August. Hafnia bought Prolific for Pounds 90.6m (Dollars 137.7m) in 1989. Analysts estimate the market value of Prolific to be between Pounds 20m and Pounds 65m. Paribas is handling the sale for Hafnia. Hafnia said it was also making progress in the sale of its Danish insurance and banking interests. At least three companies were said to be interested. Morgan Stanley, the US securities house, is handling the transaction. The company is seeking bidders for Economic, its UK general insurance company; Holnia, a Swedish insurance subsidiary; and C and V, a Swiss bank, and other assets.</p>

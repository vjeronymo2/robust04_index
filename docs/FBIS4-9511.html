			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Brigita Schmognerova, deputy prime minister </F> for the economy, by Ivan Stulajter; place and date not given:  "We Must Proceed in a Manner Ensuring That Extremism Does Not  Prevail"]    [Text] [Stulajter] It seems that Slovakia is  significantly nearer to receiving a stand-by loan from the  International Monetary Fund (IMF). In your opinion, what was  the difference between the negotiations conducted with the IMF  by Vladimir Meciar's government and the negotiations carried out  a few days ago by Jozef Moravcik's government?    [Schmognerova] In the way the negotiations were conducted.  When I was appointed, I was in the United States and I had the  opportunity to speak with senior officials from the World Bank  and the IMF. The upshot of this was that, immediately following  our request, missions from these institutions came to Slovakia.  As opposed to the previous negotiations, the government  submitted its own concept for economic policy. Apart from this,  we submitted an analysis of the risks facing the state budget  and also an analysis of the measures for counteracting these  risks. In the past, the approach at the negotiations was that  the IMF drew up the basis for a memorandum on economic policy  and the government then approved it. Our approach was much more  active.    [Stulajter] Were there any differences between the IMF and  government representatives?    [Schmognerova] Not in the aims we are pursuing. The IMF had  pointed out in the past that transformation is slowing down  significantly. Then, there was no certitude that the loan would  be paid. We announced unequivocally that the transformation  process will be speeded up.    [Stulajter] This is true, but the former government also --  in its declarations -- expressed its support for transformation.  Deeds are important. What will the government's first steps be  to improve its credibility vis-a-vis the IMF?    [Schmognerova] Before the end of the month, the government  will submit to the National Council of the Slovak Republic draft  laws on value-added tax, consumer tax, and child allowances.    [Stulajter] The draft law on value-added tax will obviously  proceed from the addendum to the memorandum on the government's  economic policy, which talked about amalgamating the rates for  this tax...    [Schmognerova] This step has been prepared for a long time;  the difference, however, will be that the rates will not be  amalgamated, but that some items from the 6.0-percent tax  bracket will be regrouped into the 25-percent bracket. It  should transpire that the government will have the possibility  to determine by law which products will be burdened by the  higher rate. It will be far more flexible this way.    [Stulajter] Can you tell us which products will not be  affected by the higher value-added tax?    [Schmognerova] Basic foodstuffs and medicines.    [Stulajter] By how much will the state budget's revenue be  increased?    [Schmognerova] It could amount to around 3.0 billion  korunas.    [Stulajter] What about the child allowances?    [Schmognerova] The child allowances should be more targeted,  depending on the minimum subsistence multiple. However, no  decision has yet been made on the size of this multiple.  Unfortunately, at the moment, there is no supplementary social  system on whose basis we could categorize the claims for payment  of these benefits. If we were to take twice the minimum  subsistence level as the borderline for being able to claim  family allowances, then child allowances would be paid to almost  88 percent of families. If there were a supplementary social  system, this percentage could be lower. If there were social  difficulties in families that lost their claim to these  allowances, this situation could be remedied by a form of  targeted assistance, for example, by various social stipends to  support education in high schools and universities and so on.    [Stulajter] Will budget savings be the outcome of targeting  the payment of child allowances?    [Schmognerova] This is our aim; however, it will not be  achieved since there are no supplementary systems. In any case,  this is the first step toward transforming the social sphere.    [Stulajter] In connection with minimizing the budget risks,  the government says in its policy statement that it wants to  concentrate on unfreezing outstanding claims and on reducing tax  and customs evasion...    [Schmognerova] These are measures intended to give one-off  assistance to the state budget. Tax collection can only be  improved to a certain extent, then the efficiency of the  appropriate measures becomes depleted. In principle, the same  applies to unfreezing outstanding claims; but, this is  implemented over a longer time frame. The decisive thing in  this regard, however, is whether the decline in the economy has  been halted or at least slowed down considerably.    [Stulajter] This is in fact an issue associated with the  development of the gross domestic product. In this context,  what do you intend to concentrate on?    [Schmognerova] Definitely on developing the private sector,  on small and medium-size enterprise, on halting the decline in  the enterprise sphere, and on exports.    [Stulajter] As far as exports are concerned, what kind of  pro-export measures can the government take?    [Schmognerova] We would like to expand activities associated  with providing insurance and possible credit for exports, as  long as the resources are found. It will be necessary to  improve the information available to our entrepreneurial sphere  on the possibilities for exporting. In this context, the  government has made it its goal to conclude bilateral agreements  to create a good foundation for conducting trade.    [Stulajter] How do you intend to proceed with regard to  Russia?    [Schmognerova] I discussed this with the Russian  Federation's ambassador. The question of a link to the gas  pipeline that will lead from Russia across Poland is still open.  There is great interest in this project and there will be a  certain amount of competition among the interested parties. The  Russian side would be glad if Slovakia were to hold its ground  in this competition. At the moment, we are looking very  intensely at the options for financing this project. The  options are also being outlined for Russian help in completing  the Mochovce nuclear power plant.    [Stulajter] Why would the Russian side be pleased if  Slovakia were to hold its ground in this competition?    [Schmognerova] This is what the ambassador said.    [Stulajter] A link to the gas pipeline is one issue, another  is Slovak exports to the Russian market...    [Schmognerova] The demand for agricultural products has  declined and, for this reason, our export potential is limited.  In addition, what we are able export comes up against strong  competition from the European Union where foodstuffs are heavily  subsidized. The situation is similar with regard to exports of  engineering equipment. Western exporters receive very  advantageous export credits, which Slovakia cannot afford.  Despite this, Slovak enterprises should try harder to penetrate  into this territory. It is often emphasized that Russian  enterprises have payment problems; this is only part of the  truth, however. There are also solvent partners there and it is  necessary to make contact with them.    [Stulajter] The issue of the insufficient ability of Slovak  products to compete on world markets is closely associated with  the lack of foreign capital, which would bring advanced  technology and know-how. What can the government do to increase  the flow of foreign capital to Slovakia?    [Schmognerova] The entry of foreign capital, compared with  the Czech Republic or Hungary, is rather minimal. For example,  in 1993, the growth of foreign capital in the Czech Republic was  four times higher than in Slovakia during the same period.  Moreover, we also included capital from the Czech lands in  foreign capital. Everyone knows this, but somehow does not  think it through. If the political situation here is not stable  and predictable, "decent" capital will rarely come here.  Foreign investors are alarmed by the confrontational statements  with regard to the Hungarian minority and the extensive  personnel changes throughout the state administration following  the government changeover.    [Stulajter] The issue does not merely involve the  replacement of civil servants, but the way it is being done.    [Schmognerova] Yes, it involves the overall style.    [Stulajter] What is your opinion of creating advantages for  foreign capital by means of various kinds of tax relief?    [Schmognerova] I would not overestimate this. If there is  political instability in a country, tax holidays mean little to  foreign investors. After all, what guarantees do they have that  they will not be canceled?    [Stulajter] That was direct investments; what is your view  of the entry of foreign capital into privatization? Some  warnings are being issued about selling off national property  cheaply, about the Slovak market being bought out.    [Schmognerova] We certainly have to be careful. However,  the risks will be reduced in the sense that we will base our  decisions on the advice of well-known and reputable consultancy  companies and privatization will take place in the form of  competitions. I want to emphasize that we are very interested  in foreign investors who have development plans and know-how.  However, we are not interested in laundering dirty money.    [Stulajter] Has there in fact been money laundering?    [Schmognerova] Yes, several cases are being investigated.    [Stulajter] The government has conceived a very broad  program. It is even being said that some of its intentions go  beyond its six- month mandate. On the other hand, who continues  this program after the elections is important. If we had  thought in 1990, 1991, and also partly in 1992 that the  initiated reforms were irreversible, then the government of V.  Meciar -- to say the least -- cast doubts on this conviction of  irreversibility. This is a political commitment for the parties  that currently make up the coalition.    [Schmognerova] Naturally, each of these parties has the  ambition to continue this program after the elections. As an  economist, I am very well aware of how much time has been  wasted. I entered the government knowing that I did not want  there to be any more wasted time. I realize that if, after the  elections, those political forces that were in power previously  get into government once more, then the reforms would again be  slowed down considerably or even halted. Therefore, the present  government has to try to find a way of establishing development  tendencies in the economy and, at the same time, of not  forfeiting the people's trust.    [Stulajter] Fine, but there is a real possibility that  those forces you mentioned will return. The government is now  faced with the task of bringing Slovakia's economic -- and  social -- life out of the considerable influence of the state,  where political power is concentrated most intensively. Quite  simply, it is vital not to give the state a chance to turn into  a dictatorship...    [Schmognerova] I do not think we are able to "catch" all the  risks. Incidentally, there is a risk of undemocratic  development in every society. Take a look at history. There  were states that had very advanced democratic institutions, but  change still occurred in them. From the point of view of the  current government, it is important that the measures in  economic and social policy are such that no prerequisites are  created in Slovakia for a victory by extremists.    [Stulajter] In this context, however, the government will  win the citizens' trust by means of visible acts carried out in  the present as measures that will bear fruit at some distant and  unspecified future time. After all, who else here cares about  the future?    [Schmognerova] We are working on using the foreign aid that  was and is earmarked for Slovakia. I received an analysis drawn  up by the Foreign Ministry on the utilization of foreign aid in  the second half of 1993. You would be surprised at the amount  of money we had at our disposal and how little of it was used.  At the same time, these are not loans.    [Stulajter] In view of the fact that you only have six  months, and to make sure that the government's work bears  visible fruit now, it is perhaps necessary to ask: What do we  not want to do? Not because the government would lack  sufficient will, but because not very much can be done in such a  short period and the government may pay dearly for a too  widespread span of activities.    [Schmognerova] I have not thought about it like that; but I  will contemplate it. I know one thing, however. The government  will not prevent the liquidation of inefficient and heavily  loss- making state enterprises. It will only prevent this in  cases where -- from the point of view of employment in the  region -- it would involve a major enterprise. Such a measure  will only be taken when alternative employment has been found.</p>

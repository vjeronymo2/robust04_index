			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Donors set to agree on unused tied aid AID donors are expected this week to agree on how to deal with the tied-aid overhang (unused credit lines) resulting from the recent ban on using tied credits for projects in better-off developing countries. Staff at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) say just four of its 24 members have so far given details of the overhang, but this should not prevent agreement on 'transition rules' for dealing with it. They do not yet know how big the overhang is, but have asked member governments to supply details of unused lines of tied aid by March 15. Transition rules will vary according to the intention of the creditor government when bilateral credits were agreed. It is likely credits linked to specific projects will be given the go-ahead. Credits not assigned will 'expire' if unused after an agreed time. The OECD has striven to ban the use of aid for commercially viable projects, and for projects in wealthier developing countries. On February 15, rules for such a ban came into force, with members able to limit abuse by vetting each other's aid projects. It is hoped the ban will let aid funds be channelled to development projects genuinely unable to attract commercial funding, ensuring aid funds are additional to, rather than competing against, commercial loans for potentially profitable projects. Controversy erupted two weeks before the ban came into force when Spain launched large lines of export credit to Mexico and Venezuela, countries that two weeks ago became ineligible for tied-aid funding. These credits were among the five biggest concessional credits the OECD ever recorded. They will be included in the overhang, as will all other recently-agreed credits. All will be subject to transitional arrangements.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Banesto investors approve rescue The contest for control of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), the troubled Spanish bank, this week opens in earnest following approval by shareholders of a Bank of Spain-sponsored rescue plan. At a general meeting on Saturday, minority shareholders protested angrily against the Bank of Spain's intervention and the writing-down of their shares, but failed to muster enough support to mount a legal challenge against the plan. With some 73 per cent of votes delegated in advance to the provisional Banesto board, the meeting produced overwhelming support for the rescue package. Under the plan, Spain's Deposit Guarantee Fund will contribute Pta285bn (Pounds 1.4bn), lend Pta315bn for four years interest-free and subscribe to Pta180bn of new capital which it will then sell to a bank or group of banks. The meeting also voted for joint legal action against the previous Banesto board, dismissed by the Bank of Spain three months ago. Mr Alfredo Saenz, the current chairman, has a month to present the action, which will seek damages for acts undertaken in breach of the law or the statutes, or without proper diligence. JP Morgan, the US bank which was represented on the former board by Mr Robert Mendoza, one of its vice-presidents, delegated its vote to back the rescue plan but opposed the legal action. Mr Mario Conde, the ousted chairman, stayed away from the meeting, which heard 15 separate proposals for legal proceedings against the former administrators. The way is now cleared for bidding to buy the controlling interest from the Deposit Guarantee Fund. Three banks - Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Banco Santander and Argentaria - are in the running for a deal which would give any of them a dominant position in the Spanish banking sector. A price of Pta100m has been set for the documentation in order to restrict it to serious bidders. The winning bank must keep at least 30 per cent for four years.</p>

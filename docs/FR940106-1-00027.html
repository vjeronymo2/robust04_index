Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on a proposed rule, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified in the ``Dates'' section of this preamble, and if we proceed with the final rule, we will respond to the comments in the preamble to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Regulatory Impact Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In calendar year 1989, over 21,200 individuals were certified by their physicians as having an irreversible, permanent kidney impairment, and obtained Medicare entitlement solely on the basis of this certification. In 1990, that number was 22,800. As reported in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease's U.S. Renal Data System Annual Data Report, approximately 1 percent of individuals receiving dialysis treatments during these years were able to terminate their course of dialysis treatment because kidney function returned. This figure is consistent with data that we maintain on the number of individuals whose Medicare eligibility terminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We analyzed the Medicare payment records of beneficiaries whose sole reason for Medicare entitlement was ESRD, and who discontinued dialysis (and thus, Medicare eligibility) within 2 years after enrollment. Our records indicate that 70 percent of the individuals incurred annual costs of less than $10,000, with an annual mean cost per beneficiary to the Medicare program of approximately $8,000. This is significantly below the average annual cost to the Medicare program of $40,000 for a patient receiving regular dialysis treatments. Because these beneficiaries were able to discontinue dialysis after incurring only limited medical costs, we believe that most of these patients may have been incorrectly certified as having ESRD, which requires long-term maintenance dialysis or a kidney transplant. Although the number of individuals who may have been incorrectly certified was less than 250 per year, they accounted for nearly $2 million in annual Medicare program expenditures. These expenditures were unintended because the disease did not reach ``end-stage'' in these individuals. As a result of this proposed revision, we estimate the projected savings to the Medicare program for the next 5 calendar years to be as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 5,L2,i1,5,5,5,5,5 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=96 g=1 f=1 --> [Millions of Dollars] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 11994 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 11995 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 11996 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 11997 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 11998 <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> 2.8  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 3.1  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 3.4  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 3.8  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 4.2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With regard to the portion of this proposed rule concerning resumption or continuation of entitlement after a terminating event, we have no reason to believe, based on 13 years' experience, that more than one or two people would have had their entitlement resumed earlier under the proposed revised regulation relating to that issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, we consider all physicians and dialysis facilities to be small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

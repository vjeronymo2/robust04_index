			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> REPAIRS MADE TO EWING'S KNEE  </P> <P> Patrick Ewing, who led the New York Knicks to their first Atlantic Division  title in almost two decades, underwent an arthroscopic procedure on his right  knee today.  </P> <P> Dr. Norman Scott, who operated on the knee five years ago, said no new damage  was found and the 7-foot center will be ready for next season. He said the  procedure was similar to the one performed on point guard Mark Jackson that  sidelined him for just three weeks during the season. Scott said that in  addition to examining the knee, he removed some loose articular cartilage.  </P> <P> "Since we had operated on the knee five years ago, we wanted to look at it  again," Scott said. "A full and complete recovery is expected."  </P></p>

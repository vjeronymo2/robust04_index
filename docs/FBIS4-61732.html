			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Iulian Chifu: "Mircea Snegur and Igor Smirnov </F> Agreed To Convert Ilie Ilascu's Death Penalty Into 20 Years of  Imprisonment"]    [Text] On Wednesday, 4 May, sources at the parliament in  Chisinau revealed to EVENIMENTUL ZILEI that during President  Mircea Snegur's 28 April meeting in Tiraspol with the separatist  Dniester leader Igor Smirnov, they have approached the issue of  the political prisoners [held in the self-styled Dniester  Republic], as well as the issue of the death penalty passed on  Ilie Ilascu. The two political leaders agreed to convert his  death penalty into 20 years of imprisonment.    The same sources revealed that Nicolae Andronic, the  chairman  of the [Moldovan] parliamentary commission in charge of having  the Tiraspol political prisoners freed and restoring the rights  of deputy Ilie Ilascu, was not allowed to attend the  negotiations by the Dniester party, because of Andronic's  inflexible stance regarding the unconditioned release of the six  political prisoners.</p>

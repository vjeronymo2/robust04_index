			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 24 Apr (EFE) -- Today General Alfredo  Rodriguez labeled as "impertinent" the attitude of the  International Red Cross in areas of conflict, adding that Red  Cross meddling in the region where the military have launched a  counterterrorist offensive is jeopardizing operations.    Gen. Rodriguez, who is leading the counterterrorist  offensive  launched against the Shining Path on 5 April in the jungle area  of Leoncio Prado Province, explained that the Army has been  supplying local information to the Red Cross, but "we have  detected certain things that don't seem to be quite all right."    As an example of such things, the general wondered how the  International Red Cross knew where the troops would go in.    "I am not making any charges, because I have no hard  evidence, but they do go in, they talk to subversive leaders,  and come back with information," Gen. Rodriguez said, according  to local Sunday newspapers.    The general made this statement to the Congressional Human  Rights Committee and to Attorney General Blanca Nelida Colan in  Tingo Maria, capital of Leoncio Prado Province, where the  offensive is taking place.    Rodriguez added that according to his sources, International  Red Cross personnel ask Shining Path militants whether their  leaders have talked to them about the Red Cross, and whether  they have told them that "we can help you."    Rodriguez indicated that information was being "distorted"  with a view to make the Army appear to be the "bad guys," adding  that the International Red Cross should "redesign its policy."    He also objected to the International Red Cross attitude  toward arrested Shining Path members who are brought in for  questioning. According to the general, Red Cross personnel  insist on being allowed to talk to them as soon as they are  arrested, without waiting for the 15-day period legally allotted  for the investigation.    The general explained that although the invitation to the  Red  Cross to visit the area of conflict in Leoncio Prado is still  open, Army patrols will have to accompany Red Cross personnel  because the place is dangerous.</p>

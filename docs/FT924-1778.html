			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: Hostile reaction to Black plan to raise Fairfax stake AN ATTEMPT by Mr Conrad Black's UK Daily Telegraph group to raise its stake in Australia's Fairfax newspaper group from 14.33 per cent to 25 per cent appears likely to fail following a hostile reaction from members of the government. The government said yesterday that the Telegraph had made a formal application to the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) for a relaxation of the existing 15 per cent ceiling on its Fairfax shareholding. The application accords with Mr Black's intentions when Fairfax was acquired last year by the Tourang consortium, led by the Telegraph. However, it appears to have rekindled political opposition to foreign media holdings. Mr Barry Jones, president of the governing Labor Party, said Mr Black's move could even trigger an attempt by Labor's federal parliamentary caucus to tighten existing rules on foreign ownership of newspapers. The Telegraph's application is likely to be considered sympathetically by the FIRB, which investigates all proposals by overseas companies to acquire more than 15 per cent of Australian companies. The FIRB has adopted a relaxed approach to inward investment in recent years and has approved about 95 per cent of applications since Labor was elected in 1983. But decisions by the FIRB have to be approved by Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, who is subject to binding resolutions by the parliamentary caucus. The Telegraph wanted a 20 per cent stake in Fairfax when the group was acquired by Tourang, but was limited to 15 per cent by the caucus, which put a ceiling of 20 per cent on total foreign ownership. This included a 5 per cent stake held by Hellman and Friedman, the US investment bank. The rest of the shares are owned by Australian institutions and private shareholders. Mr Black has previously indicated that the Telegraph's hopes of increasing its stake in Fairfax were supported by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, and other senior ministers. However, Mr Keating's office denied that any guarantees of support had been given to Mr Black. Officials also suggested that the government was not keen to have the foreign ownership issue aired in the run-up to next year's election.</p>

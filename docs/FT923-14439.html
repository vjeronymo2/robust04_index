			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Sanyo sues in row with US chip maker SANYO ELECTRIC, the Japanese electronics company, has filed anti-trust and breach of contract suits in the US against Texas Instruments (TI), the US semiconductor maker, in an increasingly bitter dispute which followed the breakdown of year-long negotiations over a semiconductor cross licence agreement. Sanyo also launched a vituperative attack against TI, accusing it of negotiating in bad faith and attempting to 'coerce' Sanyo into 'paying for a patent that we neither want nor need'. The dispute is the most bitter yet in a series of cross-Pacific patent disagreements involving hundreds of millions of dollars of royalty payments. TI, and other US companies, have been increasingly aggressive in seeking to enforce patent rights in the courts. Mr Hiroshi Yoshie, Sanyo managing director, said: 'We are extremely disappointed with TI's behaviour in this matter, not only with regard to their attempt to use their asserted market leverage. . . . to coerce our company. . . . but in the total lack of integrity which they demonstrated in our negotiations.' Texas Instruments had no immediate comment on the substance of Sanyo's allegations. However, Mr Norman Neureiter, vice president of TI Asia, said in Tokyo: 'We question whether Sanyo's cause is really being well-served by such intemperate and one might even say, nasty, language.' TI filed a patent infringement suit against Sanyo on June 26, and sought a declaratory judgment from the court that the conduct of the company's negotiations with Sanyo did not constitute a misuse of patents or anti-trust violation. Sanyo, for its part, said in a complaint filed at the US district court in California, that it wished to sign an agreement excluding TI's Kilby patent  -named for the inventor of the semiconductor, Mr Jack Kilby - which covers basic semiconductor technology in Japan. However, TI would agree to this only by charging an 'exorbitant multi-million dollar penalty payment for the 'privilege' of excluding the Kilby. . . . patent.' Sanyo says this constituted an abuse of monopoly power which violated US anti-trust law. It is seeking treble damages under US law and injunctive relief. TI believes the broadly-worded Kilby patent applies to all semiconductor devices produced in Japan. Sanyo, however, says the Kilby patent 'covers an outdated technology that is not valuable to Sanyo because it is not a practical, competitively viable design for products that will compete in today's semiconductor market.' Sanyo warned TI in April that it would take legal action but on June 24 said it would hold back pending a further meeting with the US company. According to Sanyo, TI agreed to meet on July 16, but then filed suit against Sanyo in a Texas court on June 26. 'TI deliberately deceived Sanyo in order to lure Sanyo into not seeking judicial relief from TI's anti-trust violations and related conduct, in an effort to obtain some tactical litigation or negotiation advantage.' Sanyo says this violated contractual provisions in the former cross-licence agreement requiring TI to negotiate in good faith. Texas Instruments and Fujitsu, the Japanese computer company, are currently seeking a determination by the Japanese court as to whether TI's Kilby patent applies to products made by Fujitsu. The two companies nonetheless reached agreement on other patent licences. TI has reached comprehensive semiconductor cross-licence agreements, covering the Kilby patent, with 14 other Japanese companies.</p>

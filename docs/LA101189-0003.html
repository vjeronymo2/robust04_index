			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SEWAGE CAPACITY PUTS POWAY HOMES ON HOLD  </P> <P> Poway City Council members voted unanimously Tuesday night to impose a year's  moratorium on all residential and public construction projects, citing the lack  of sewage capacity.  </P> <P> City Manager James Bowersox said all sewage capacity in these categories has  been committed to approved projects or to projects with completed applications.  </P> <P> The moratorium will not affect the city's South Poway industrial development,  where capacity still exists.  </P> <P> Bowersox said that additional capacity is not available from the city of San  Diego and the metropolitan sewage system.  </P> <P> No opposition was voiced at Tuesday's session, the first of two to be held  before the moratorium takes effect Nov. 18.  </P> <P> The yearlong moratorium on residential, public and semi-public construction  projects could be lifted early if San Diego allots more of its sewage capacity  to Poway or Poway reallocates its existing capacity.  </P> <P> Residential projects already approved by the city will not be affected, city  officials said, but new residential projects will be put on hold until the city  receives more sewage capacity.  </P> <P> Poway imposed a similar building moratorium in March, 1987, but lifted it seven  months later when San Diego approved an increase in the city's capacity from 4  million gallons a day to 5 million gallons.  </P> <P> The additional capacity was rationed according to a system approved by the  Poway City Council. City Manager Jim Bowersox said last week that the city  would have run out of capacity by Nov. 1 if the moratorium had not been  imposed.  </P> <P> Commercial and industrial projects in the city will not be affected by the  moratorium because sewage capacity is available for those uses, Assistant City  Planner James Lyon said.  </P> <P> Poway is planning to build a waste-water reclamation plant to reduce the waste  going into the metropolitan system, allowing resumption of residential building  when sewage capacity becomes available.  </P> <P> Stephen Streeter, assistant city planning director, said the plant, to be built  near Interstate 15 south of Poway Road, will not be operating for at least four  years.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Poway officials plan to seek more capacity from San Diego and  to initiate several studies aimed at freeing up permits for residential and  public projects, Streeter said.  </P></p>

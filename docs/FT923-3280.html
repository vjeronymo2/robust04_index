			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Graduates face grants shortage THOUSANDS of qualified science and engineering graduates including hundreds with first-class degrees are unable to secure state funding for postgraduate work in the coming academic year. According to this week's Times Higher Education Supplement, more than 8,000 applications have been lodged for 5,000 studentships offered by the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC). More than 400 students with first-class degrees will not secure SERC funding. The Natural Environment Research Council will be able to fund only 5,000 of 7,800 applicants. Applications for taught master's courses and research programmes have increased significantly this year. It is more than a reflection of the recession, as the proportion of graduates remaining at university to take higher degrees has been rising steadily in recent years. University statistics released this week indicate that more than a quarter of the graduates from older universities are staying on to undertake further research. State funding for taught courses and research studentships has remained broadly static, however.</p>

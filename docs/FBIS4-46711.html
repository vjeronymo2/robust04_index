			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Basayev: "Will the `Teziyev Affair' Turn </F> Into a Corruption Trial?"]    [Text] The chronology of events is true and, very important  for the investigation, is on record in the "For Official Use  Only" reports of MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] officers who  worked in the conflict zone before temporary administrations  were formed on the territory of the North Ossetian SSR [Soviet  Socialist Republic] and Ingush Republic.    On 9 June 1992 a crowd of refugees from South Ossetia  surrounded the residential settlement and military base "Philipp  Holzmann," which was being built at the ninth kilometer of the  Vladikavkaz-Beslan highway for military units being withdrawn  from Germany. Military guards opened fire to kill, but were  immediately overrun by the mob. On that day 12 122-mm  self-propelled artillery systems (SAS) were taken from the  military base and driven under the Ossetian flag through  Vladikavkaz.    At night the situation in the North Ossetian capital was to  all practical purposes not under the control of the authorities  and law enforcement organs. On 10 June South Ossetians seized  the Vladikavkaz garrison's central base, from which ammunition  for SAS and submachine guns were carried away in KamAZ trucks.  No one even attempted to stop this deadly convoy on its way to  South Ossetia. During that time a nonstop rally was being held  in the city, the participants demanding the resignation of North  Ossetia Supreme Soviet Chairman Galazov, Prime Minister  Khetagurov, and Minister of Internal Affairs Kantemirov...    It was at this time that the head of the South Ossetian  Government, Oleg Teziyev, was arrested on the territory of North  Ossetia--to be precise, on the Vladikavkaz-Alagir highway. A  spetznaz group blocked the Mercedes and captured together with  Teziyev a bodyguard and two Russians. The latter did not have a  chance to make use of submachine guns and a TT handgun.  Literally several hours before the capture of the South Ossetian  prime minister some local residents had been arrested in  Prigorodnyy Rayon; in the trunk of their car was an AKM  [modified Kalashnikov automatic rifle] and a suitcase full of  money. At the very first interrogation the arrested testified  that they had just bought the weapon from Teziyev; a serial  number check showed that the AKM was from consignments stolen  from the warehouse at the "Philipp Holzmann" base. Thus, the  North Ossetian (that is, Russian) procuracy initiated criminal  proceedings against Oleg Teziyev, on charges of organizing an  armed attack on a military installation and illegal arms trading.    Teziyev and his companions were kept in a Vladikavkaz  preliminary investigative facility for more than a day. During  that time practically all North Ossetia's highest officials  experienced pressure from the southerners. A group was already  being readied in Tkshinvali which was supposed, according to one  of its members, to "smash this Vladikavkaz--and Galazov with  it--into pieces." Then Teziyev was let go, with an apology.    Now he is under arrest again.    An entrepreneur from North Ossetia, Oleg Teziyev got the job  of head of South Ossetia's government almost by accident. It  appears that the People's Front of South Ossetia's design was to  bring a northerner into this job during one of the hardest times  for South Ossetia and, thus making a national hero out of him,  return him later to Vladikavkaz, this time as a potential leader  of North Ossetia. According to confidential information, the job  of South Ossetian prime minister was first offered to Sergey  Tabolov, director of North Ossetian Humanitarian Sciences  Research Institute, but he refused. After which somehow Oleg  Teziyev came on the scene on his own.    Despite a certain popularity the energetic prime minister  enjoyed in South Ossetia, to a large extent he remained an  outsider in Tskhinvali. He got practically all his connections  and contacts from National Front leader Alan Chochiyev. It was  also the latter who recommended to Teziyev his closest aides and  advisers--for instance, Minister of Defense Valeriy Khubulov,  OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachments] commander Vadim  Gazzayev, and others. Later, however, it somehow was forgotten  that the initiative for all these government appointments and  parceling out some or other authority came from Alan Chochiyev  rather than Oleg Teziyev, who during this period became easy  prey for the National Front's personnel policy.    In Tskhinvali, Teziyev was mostly engaged in arms purchases  and arming South Ossetian armed formations. In this respect he  managed to establish within a short period of time relations  with the Russian military, including with those who make the  principal political decisions. Seriously speaking, the South  Ossetian "victory" in the war with Georgia was the result of  Teziyev and his retinue's unprecedented activism. Over a very  short period of time South Ossetia received enough arms to  withstand a Georgian offensive.    After the cessation of military operations in South Ossetia,  Teziyev's activities practically fully shifted to Moscow. A  system of commercial enterprises was set up in the Russian  capital, financed illegally with the money South Ossetia  received as a result of division of the all-Union budget. The  plan was for these structures to supply South Ossetia with all  it needed: arms, foodstuffs, basic necessities, and cash  (banking operations with South Ossetia had been suspended, and  therefore people in Tskhinvali had not been paid wages for  months--there was no cash in rubles, and Georgia had dropped out  of the ruble zone). These commercial structures were headed by  Moscow Ossetians--mainly relatives of National Front leader Alan  Chochiyev. In setting up and financing these operations,  Teziyev, acting on behalf of the Alagir company, trusted  Chochiyev's proteges enough not to ask for receipts; later this  led to an endless series of score-settling involving  professional "enforcers."    Teziyev's absence from Tskhinvali and his operations with  large amounts of money created a situation where some field  commanders began to demand guarantees that Teziyev would in fact  work in their interests. Teziyev offered as a guarantee of his  "loyalty" his older son Teymuraz, who was placed to serve in the  Tskhinvali OMON on the promise of this unit's commander, Vadim  Gazzayev, to take care of the junior's safety. In reality,  Teymuraz Teziyev was a hostage, and the degree of his safety was  defined not by Gazzayev but by the National Guard commander Alan  Dzhioyev, nicknamed "Parpat." It was he who later took Teziyev  Jr. in his car out of the OMON base and demanded from the prime  minister billions in cash in exchange for his son (this  information was supplied by the prime minister's former aide,  Ye. Krutikov).    Teziyev's son was let go for a ransom of a hard-to-pronounce  amount. Most of the participants in this drama are no longer  alive: Vadim Gazzayev was killed on the doorstep of his house by  a gang of marauders, and Alan Dzhioyev was shot to death at the  OMON base by its new commander, Siukayev. Nevertheless, this  story, which has been kept secret for a long time, demonstrates  very well the degree of criminality of the military and  political leadership of South Ossetia. Field commanders, most of  whom engage without any qualms whatsoever in drug trafficking in  Georgia, racketeering in North Ossetia and Moscow, kidnapping,  and reselling stolen cars, openly extorted money from Teziyev.  He became nearly the sole channel for the flow of arms and cash  for some armed formation in South Ossetia.    Oleg Teziyev moved to Moscow for good in the spring of 1993,  together with his close associates (among them, those known to  the investigation are Aleksey Tkachuk, a former officer of the  Pskov Airborne Troops Division [PATD] and the commandant of the  city of Tskhinvali, and Tskhinvali resident Atsamaz Alborov). In  addition to commercial activities, they were buying arms from  PATD officers and, through the same criminal group (about 30  persons), smuggling arms from Estonia. The scale of activities  of South Ossetian arms traders is evidenced by the fact that  heavy armaments were being sold to Teziyev almost openly--in  Saransk and Syzran the South Ossetian prime minister managed to  buy several dozen units of armored equipment, and in Pskov  negotiations were underway regarding purchases of "Igla"  air-defense systems (the Soviet equivalent of the "Stinger").  Sales of a considerable quantity of armored equipment and arms  to South Ossetia had been authorized by major political figures  in Moscow, which gives the investigation the flavor of an  impending scandal: The Teziyev affair may become the largest  trial on corruption and illegal financial machinations on the  part of some high-ranking officers of the General Staff, the  Airborne Troops command, and members of the president of  Russia's staff.    Oleg Teziyev and Aleksey Tkachuk, who was arrested in  Aprelevka in suburban Moscow, also are being charged with  racketeering. This charge came as a result of score-settling  among Moscow commercial operators of Ossetian descent, whose  companies were illegally financed by Teziyev. Some of them (for  instance, Valeriy Kaytulov, head of the Kadeshk and Bezopasnost  companies, who currently lives in Toronto) accused Teziyev and  his retinue of racketeering and officially asked for MVD  assistance after they had been forced to "account" for their  activities to Oleg Teziyev, who had financed them. A tense  situation also developed around Alan Chochiyev, former leader of  the National Front of South Ossetia, who, in his own words,  "withdrew from politics and learned to make money in Moscow."  There is information that it is he--the former ideologist of  South Ossetian independence--who had initiated a number of  illegal financial operations which nearly bankrupted Teziyev and  brought considerable profit to commercial operators--Chochiyev's  relatives. At this point the investigation believes that  Chochiyev is in the United States.    Oleg Teziyev was probably the key figure in the course of  military operations in the fall of 1992 in North Ossetia's  Prigorodnyy Rayon. Several days before the bloody deportation of  Ingush from Prigorodnyy Rayon, then Prime Minister of South  Ossetia Sergey Khetagurov and Aleksandr Dzasokhov went by  helicopter to Tskhinvali and talked to Teziyev about "protecting  Ossetia from Ingush." The South Ossetian brigade was  distinguished by exceptional cruelty, which had developed in  southerners over the years of bloody war of attrition with  Georgia, marauding and plunder in Ingush villages. Actually,  their northern brothers also got a taste of it... They were  commanded by the same Alan Dzhioyev ("Parpat") and Minister of  Defense Valeriy Khebelov. Oleg Teziyev was in Vladikavkaz, where  he was "working" with Russia's representatives, in particular,  Georgiy Khizha, who later stated that he was not aware of a  single instance of marauding on the part of South Ossetian  volunteers."    At the same time Oleg Teziyev represented a serious danger  for the North Ossetian government which disliked him.  Vladikavkaz permitted the southerners to carry out the "march of  foreign-made cars"--a mass transfer into South Ossetia of cars  commandeered in Prigorodnyy Rayon, while Galazov at the meeting  of the North Ossetian Supreme Soviet thanked the southerners for  "brotherly help." Teziyev personally, however, remained  dangerous as a man who quite easily could lay claim to high  positions in the government of North Ossetia.    There are several versions regarding Oleg Teziyev's current  arrest. In reality people of his rank or caliber almost never  get investigated or arrested--the sponsors and the unique  connections that permit them to conduct extremely risky and  profitable operations with arms and illegal financing of  commercial structures are just too strong. According to one,  Oleg Teziyev was "surrendered" by Moscow businessmen of Ossetian  descent who held a grudge against him. In particular,  information that enabled the investigation to charge Teziyev  with racketeering and illegal financing of commercial  organizations was found during a search of the premises of the  Kadeshk and Bezopasnost companies in the area of the  Aviamotornaya subway station. According to another, Teziyev's  arrest was the result of a battle in the Russian Government  between several groups oriented in their activities on the  shadow economy side of Russia's Caucasus policy. It is  anticipated that the "Teziyev affair" will lead the  investigation to high-ranking members of the president's staff  and the government, against whom actually this whole game is  being played. According to still another version, Teziyev's  arrest was almost an accident, a corollary to improper behavior  on the part of Aleksey Tkachuk; this explanation is hardly  worthy of attention, however.    One way or another an end has been put to the activities of  a  criminal group engaged in illegal arms sales, racketeering, and  financing of commercial enterprises (including a number of banks  in Moscow and Vladikavkaz), creating illegal armed formations,  and organizing mass disorder.    FROM THE EDITORS: Mountain people have this saying:  "When a man rushes too fast toward the smell of shishkebab, he  may find upon arrival that the smell comes from donkeys being  branded..." In the Caucasus, wisdom and criminal lack of  restraint have existed side by side since time immemorial. This  may perhaps be why it became a suitable location of action for  "script writers"--the powers that be--writing cynical and  frightening scenarios of interethnic and other armed conflicts.  Because for centuries war has been a method of political  struggle and material enrichment. A. Basayev's article is an  attempt to "figure out" the authors through the performers. We  are ready to provide the same opportunity to those who have in  their possession information and their own vision of the  situation in other "hot spots" of the former USSR. Because we  are dealing with an already-established blueprint for committing  crimes against humanity. And it appears that this blueprint  works without fail in Georgia, Abkhazia, the south of Russia,  Tajikistan. Without fail--and with impunity.</p>

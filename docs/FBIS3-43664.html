			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The political situation is still at an impasse in  Zaire. The radical opposition, which supports Prime Minister  Etienne Tshisekedi, is refusing to sign agreements negotiated  since 10 December. Talks were adjourned last month; the parties  of the presidential tendency refused to accept Mr Tshisekedi as  legal prime minister. Marshal Mobutu then issued an ultimatum  to the opposition, which expires today at midnight. Here is the  reaction of Joseph Olengakoye, the envoy of Prime Minister  Tshisekedi. At the moment he is visiting Paris.    [Begin recording] [Olengakoye] We have noted that Mr. Mobutu  is aware of the problem and has issued an ultimatum because the  impasse in Zaire is related to Mr. Mobutu's own will. He has  given himself an ultimatum. I can tell you sincerely that,  having arrived at the expiry of Mr. Mobutu's ultimatum, if he  does not find a solution that meets the aspirations of our  people, there will be incalculable consequences, and we will  attack democratically on all fronts.    [Reporter Dupont] What else can you do?    [Olengakoye] The people will demonstrate, and Mr. Mobutu  will  rule over corpses.    [Dupont] The UN secretary general has put foward a new  proposal to the Zairean president. Do you think this proposal  could unblock the situation?    [Olengakoye] I think that the proposal is to ask Mr. Mobutu  to give in to the will of the majority, the will of our people.  We have the consequences of 30 years. If we are where we are  today, it is because Mr. Mobutu has not managed to govern this  people. This means that our people are determined to find a  solution according to what they think [as heard], and this is  not what Mr. Mobutu thinks.

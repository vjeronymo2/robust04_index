			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Yeltsin at end of political life, says chief rival PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia is 'part of the old era' as surely as is the Russian parliament whose defeat he is now overseeing, according to Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, foremost of the declared challengers for the presidential elections. 'He is preparing the way for the next generation of politicians - but he himself is at the end of his political life,' said Mr Yavlinsky, the prominent economist who last month emerged as Russia's 'most trusted' politician in a nationwide opinion poll. His remarks came as the parliament's resistance to its abolition seemed to be weakening under an onslaught of decrees and orders from Mr Yeltsin designed to bring it into line. Mr Yavlinsky, 41, whose popularity does not seem to have been dented by the events of recent days, declared himself a presidential candidate some months ago, and has since been selling himself as a reformer, but of a new political generation. In an interview with the Financial Times at the end of last week, the challenger said that in speeding the end of the old regime, President Yeltsin was also hastening his own demise. Just as former Soviet president Mr Mikhail Gorbachev brought about the end of communism and fell with it, so Mr Yeltsin was opening the door for a new wave of political figures in belatedly pushing through constitutional reform. Though other candidates have yet to come forward, Mr Yavlinsky's popularity, based on a demotic style and a refusal to be aligned with any one group, gives him an impressive lead. He cites an opinion poll conducted in St Petersburg the day after Mr Yeltsin dissolved parliament and convened elections to a bicameral assembly in December. The poll shows him enjoying the support of 21.7 per cent, ahead of Mr Yeltsin with just 19.7 per cent, and vice-president Alexander Rutskoi - installed last week as president by parliament - in third place with 10.7 per cent. Although he agrees the results are 'very preliminary', he says they show 'that people are sick and tired of this confrontation between parliament and the president'. As well as being the only declared opposition candidate with a firm grasp of market economics, he has done more than any other Russian politician to develop a coherent vision of the future. His message to the electorate is based on three promises: the construction of a genuine federal state, the protection of private property and a sound currency. Rebellion starts to fade, Page 4</p>

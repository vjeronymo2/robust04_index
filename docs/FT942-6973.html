			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Confucius reigns in Taiwan Sir, In 'Changing cultures of capitalism' (May 23), Samuel Brittan endorses the assertion that 'few Taiwanese entrepreneurs are steeped in the Confucian classics'. I beg to differ. On my first day of company visits in Taiwan, as a member of a party of foreign investors, I met the chairman of Tatung Co  - one of Taiwan's largest and most progressive corporations. He opened the proceedings by presenting each of us with a copy of the Analects of Confucius - with each tract set out in English and Japanese as well as the original Chinese. This was presented as the best introduction on how to conduct business in Taiwan. It has certainly been invaluable to me in providing insights into economic life in Taipei. Tatung also endows its own high school and university. Many local investment analysts and economists - whose London counterparts have been termed 'teenage scribblers' - have impressed me with their knowledge of the Analects.

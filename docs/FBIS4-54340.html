			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 27 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has signed an  accord on implementing International Energy Agency (IEA)  programs for cooperation in solar power generation system and  demand management technology, the Ministry of Trade, Industry  and Energy announced Friday.    Korea's admission to these programs is likely to help  promote  the development of related domestic technology and information  exchanges on utilizing solar power and restricting energy  demand, the ministry said.    Currently, Korea participates in four other programs of the  international organization -- exchanges of information on energy  technology, exchanges of technical information on greenhouse  gases, propagation and analysis of proven energy technology, and  research and development of heating-cooling systems.</p>

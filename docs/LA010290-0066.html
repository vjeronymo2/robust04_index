			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAMIR FIRM AS COALITION TEETERS;  </P> <P> ISRAEL: HAWKISH PRIME MINISTER REFUSES TO BUDGE ON HIS FIRING OF SCIENCE  MINISTER EZER WEIZMAN.  </P> <P> Efforts to find a compromise that would keep Israel's divided government intact  were deadlocked Monday, and officials close to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir  said that he is determined to assert his authority over dovish ministers in the  teetering coalition.  </P> <P> "The prime minister is standing firm," said Yosef Ben-Aharon, a top aide to  Shamir.  </P> <P> Shamir, who heads the rightist Likud Party, fired Science Minister Ezer  Weizman, from the center-left Labor Party, for making direct and indirect  contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization and discussing peace  proposals with the group. The Sunday dismissal set off the government crisis.  </P> <P> However, there were wire service reports early today that President Chaim  Herzog had stepped into the crisis and suggested a compromise that might defuse  the issue. They quoted Israel Television as saying that, in a private meeting  with Shamir, Herzog said the crisis calls for a "proper legal inquiry" and that  Weizeman should be allowed to keep his Cabinet post until the inquiry is  completed.  </P> <P> Labor wants Weizman reinstated. Both parties were busily courting minor  political groups in order to build a narrow coalition should the coalition  shatter. But Labor, the junior partner in the national unity government, is  also looking for a compromise. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Labor said he  views "the continuation of the national unity government as the need of the  hour."  </P> <P> However, Israel Television said that Shimon Peres, vice prime minister and  Labor Party leader, quickly rejected the Herzog proposal, saying the damage had  already been done.  </P> <P> One solution under discussion is to remove Weizman from the policy-making Inner  Cabinet, which is made up of six members each from Labor and Likud. Yitzhak  Peretz, leader of the small, religious Shas party who is trying to mediate a  compromise, reported no headway Monday. "It is hard to say I see a way out,"  Peretz said.  </P> <P> Under government rules, the dismissal of Weizman, a flamboyant former fighter  pilot and defense minister, is set to become final today. A vote of confidence  in the government has been scheduled later in the week -- not because of  Weizman and the PLO but because religious parties object to government  authorization of a protest rally last week on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath.  </P> <P> He's Sending Messages  </P> <P> Likud officials said that, by firing Weizman, the prime minister is sending out  a variety of messages, not only to political rivals at home but to Washington.  </P> <P> First, he is trying to re-establish his own authority, which he saw as being  eroded by Weizman's contacts with the PLO, government spokesman Yosef Olmert  said. The Labor Party, led by Finance Minister Shimon Peres, has been trying to  pull Shamir toward compromise on the issue of giving up the occupied West Bank  and Gaza Strip in return for peace with rebellious Palestinians.  </P> <P> "Shamir is saying, 'I'm the boss,' in case anyone forgot," Olmert declared.  </P> <P> Shamir was also shoring up his hold on the Likud, where he was under attack for  being soft on talks with the PLO, Olmert added.  </P> <P> The message for Washington arises from Shamir's perception that the Bush  Administration intends to try to corner him into talks with the PLO. Shamir  opposes PLO participation in peace talks because he views the group's demand  for an independent Palestinian state as a means of setting up a hostile base  next door to Israel.  </P> <P> "If people in Washington think the prime minister wants a fig leaf to talk with  the PLO, I can say that this prime minister does not play with fig leaves,"  Olmert said.  </P> <P> Israel is engaged in laborious talks with the Bush Administration over plans to  negotiate with a Palestinian peace delegation. The PLO has been responding to  the American overtures for talks through Egyptian mediation. Under a plan  authored by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the United States, Egypt and  Israel have agreed to meet in the coming weeks to discuss the formation of a  Palestinian negotiating team.  </P> <P> Weizman expressed pleasure at being the center of a political storm. On Israel  Radio, he stated flatly that he hopes the coalition will fall over his ouster.  Weizman is a proponent of Israeli-PLO talks.  </P> <P> Weizman was a key participant in the crafting of the 1979 Camp David peace  treaty between Israel and Egypt. The experience converted him from a hawk -- he  belonged to the Likud at the time -- to a dove.  </P> <P> Reports of Weizman's PLO connection center on an Israeli Arab physician named  Ahmed Tibi, whose name had surfaced publicly in efforts to contact the PLO over  missing Israeli prisoners in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Weizman told a Labor Party caucus Monday that not long ago he received a phone  call from Tibi who was visiting Tunis, the headquarters of the PLO. Tibi asked  him if the PLO should accept the Baker plan for peace talks. Weizman put Tibi  on hold and phoned an unnamed Israeli official.  </P> <P> He went back to Tibi and advised the PLO to accept U.S. plans to hold talks and  if it had reservations, to put them in the form of conditions that could then  be negotiated.  </P> <P> The PLO has accepted Baker's plan in principle but is demanding that it select  the Palestinian panel.  </P> <P> Shamir learned of Weizman's activities from the Shin Bet, Israel's domestic  intelligence service, officials in the prime minister's office said. It was not  clear whether the agency was spying on Weizman -- that would require  authorization from Shamir himself.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Stand-Off Over Kashmir"] </F>   [Text] Not entirely contrary to expectations, the round of  secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan over Kashmir  has ended without any breakthrough over the issue. Pakistan was  not interested in a gradualist approach favoured by India that  sought to focus attention on what are issues more amenable to a  solution, such as Siachen and Waller barrage, etc. The  contention here could well be that such an approach is an  unaffordable luxury given the high level of on-going repression  in the Kashmir valley by Indian forces numbering over half a  million. A concession in the context of Siachen, for instance,  could easily be used as a ploy by India to reassure interational  opinion while seeking to consolidate its hold on Kashmir through  brutal force. The talks have failed to register progress but  Pakistan has shown some flexibility by choosing not to rule out  completely the option of continuing to use the mode of bilateral  dialogue for finding a solution to the issue. It has, however,  introduced a note of firmness by linking the posssibility of  holding another round of bilateral negotiations with India to  visible and concrete improvement of conditions on the ground,  such as a reduction in Indian troop strength in the Valley,  release of the large number of Kashmiri leaders jailed by India,  etc. It is unfortunate that India has held on to its rigid  position on Kashmir thereby reducing virtually to nought the  effect of its earlier more accommodative stance illustrated by  agreeing to place Kashmir as a separate item on the agenda of  Pak-India talks. This, in turn, left Pakistan with no option  but to stick closely to the previously stated position on  Kashmir and other related issues.    As for the criticism emanating from opposition quarters to  the effect that Pakistan would have been better off not acceding  to India's request to withdraw the proposed resolution it was to  present before the UN General Assembly condemning it for gross  violation of human rights in Kashmir, it appears motivated once  again by a desire to score points, notwithstanding the sensitive  nature of the issue. Quite apart from the fact that Pakistan  has reserved its right to take up the matter at the United  Nations at any time it deems appropriate, it must be kept in  mind that the proposed resolution on human rights violations in  Kashmir being passed in the General Assembly would not, in any  way, have been binding on India. The idea was to bring the  issue into focus and make that country a subject of moral  censure by the international community. It can certainly be  argued that in following the path that Pakistan has,  international attention has, indeed, been focused on Kashmir and  India has been shown up as not being entirely sincere in its  desire to find a solution to the Kashmir issue. While India has  thereby been put on the defensive, Pakistan is in a position to  say to the international community, including the Security  Council members, that it had bent backwards to accommodate India  and if the talks have not yielded positive results, it should be  clear where the fault lies.</p>

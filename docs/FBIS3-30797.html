			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Belgrade Television RTB Network in  Serbo-Croatian dedicates its 8 February edition of the  "Aktuelnosti" current affairs program, broadcast at 1938 GMT, to  the explosion that killed 68 and injured 200 people at a  Sarajevo market on 5 February. The anchor man in the Belgrade  Television studio is Milorad Komrakov.    He is joined by the following guests: Captain 1st Class  Dusan Jelusic, Yugoslav Army expert on mortar ammunition;  Lieutenant Zoran Stankovic, Yugoslav Army pathology expert;  military commentator Petar Knezevic; and machine engineer  Colonel Milan Rundic, explosives expert.    Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic of Srpska, and  General Major Milan Gvero, assistant commander of the General  Staff of the Army of the republic of Srpska, join in the program  live from the Pale television studio.    At the beginning the program replays the footage of the  Sarajevo massacre, which is followed by reportage rounding up  all major massacres that have taken place in Sarajevo from the  beginning of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Komrakov then asks Radovan Karadzic to explain the contents  of his letter to U.S. President Clinton and Russian President  Yeltsin in which he claims that "a great and feeble deception  took place at the Sarajevo market" as well as the findings on  which he bases his conclusions. Karadzic replies:    "We base such conclusions on the findings that we are mostly  receiving from the Croatian side in Sarajevo, on the analyses of  our experts, on simple examination of the footage taken by the  Muslim side, and on statements given by the Muslim listeners to  Radio Hayatt, which are recorded and undisputable. Namely, if  one looks carefully at the footage, one sees clearly that there  are very few goods on the market and that very few market stalls  have goods. One must try to imagine that in such a small place  at least 300 people were caught in this explosion, and it must  be assumed that there might have been another 300 who were not  effected. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible to imagine and  justify the presence of some 300 to 600 people in such a poor  market. Furthermore, we have some reports from the Muslim side,  which I hope we will be able to hear tonight, that no noise  characteristic of a mortar bomb was heard, and the Muslim  witnesses have also said so. There have been some reports that  there were not many people there at all. We have reports, and  this can also be concluded from this television footage, that  the bodies of people who had died much earlier were also used.  Now we can see on the film something that resembles a stuffed  mannequin, plastic or made of fabric. There are also  indications of plastic mannequins.    "In short, an enormous deception has taken place. Something  tragic happened at that market, that is for sure. However,  whether so many people died, whether the bomb arrived from  elsewhere, or whether an explosive device exploded on the site,  all this gives rise to great suspicion. Furthermore, it can be  clearly concluded that this was stage-managed -- just look how  much this resembles a mannequin -- and that these were  concoctions that should shock the world, that is to say, turn  the world against us."    Karadzic also says that "the Muslim side has rejected any  sort of joint investigation by a joint commission, that is to  say, any sort of international investigation." "We demanded  that Russia and the United States not to allow their policies to  be ruled by such a fake," Karadzic says, "and we demanded an  international expert examination of this and any other case."  "The fate of the nation and the fate of peace in the region is  at stake," he exclaims, "and not a single serious country in the  world should allow itself to rely on the Muslim sources alone."    The program then broadcasts a roundup report on ways in  which  foreign media have reported on the same event.    Afterward Komrakov asks Karadzic to comment on the "warning  to the Bosnian Serbs to remove the artillery positioned around  Sarajevo or face the risk of NATO air strikes," and the  statements by "U.S. and Russian representatives."    Karadzic replies that "Russia has a balanced and correct  attitude toward the crisis." "It is clear," he goes on, "that  any sort of involvement in a civil war would really mean the  proliferation of the war and would be completely unjustified.  Anyone who would attack us would become our enemy and our  attitude toward the enemy would, naturally, be defined on the  basis of a natural right of any nation to defend itself.  Unfortunately, in the United States many circles are completely  uninformed. Sarajevo is not surrounded, it is a divided town.  We have a part of Sarajevo that we will not give to anyone. We  are willing to negotiate on how much of Sarajevo will be Serbian  and how much Muslim. However, the idea of abandoning a town  populated by 200,000 Serbs is out of the question. We can  agree, within a peace plan and possibly under the UN  administration of Sarajevo, to reduce and remove our artillery.  However, how far do they think we should move artillery when  artillery has various ranges? We will not move our artillery  out of the borders of our republic."    Speaking further about the attitude of the international  community toward the Bosnian Serbs, Karadzic says: "We are  absolutely sure that governments and their secret services know  the truth. They have known it since the very beginning when  they started destroying Yugoslavia." According to him, "they  knew that a war would break out in Bosnia-Herzegovina and did  not hurry with this war until the war in Croatia had ended."  "They planned to finish with Bosnia by the end of May 1992,  when it would have been Kosovo's turn, perhaps even that of  Sandzak and Vojvodina. However, their scenario was thwarted,  because the Serbs in Bosnia held out much longer than  anticipated."    "The governments that know the real truth," Karadzic  continues, "the governments that make decisions, will opt for  peace at a moment when the advantages of a war will disappear."  He goes on to say that "one can already see that numerous  European countries that used to favor war no longer favor it,  that is, the war has started to cause damage to them. When this  will also be the case with Germany and the United States, peace  will come very quickly. Namely, it is clear that the Muslim  leadership listens obediently to its patrons and masters."    "The fact is," Karadzic remarks, "that the United States  managed to compromise and upset Europe to the utmost with  Bosnia-Herzegovina. I still do not see any readiness on their  part to drop the possibility of arbitrating in the region and,  perhaps, strengthening their presence in the region, on the  assumption that Russia will recover some day and there will be a  need to monitor it from close up."    General Gvero is then asked to comment on the 5 February  massacre. "We know our units and what orders they have," he  says, "and they obey our orders. We are sure that, on that  date, there were no activities, just as during a period prior to  that, against the part of Sarajevo controlled by the Muslims."    As he says, for this reason, the Serbian side proposed the  formation of a "mixed, neutral commission" immediately after the  explosion. "Speaking of the truth, we know the truth as well as  all the people of good intentions. The truth is that a Serbian  hand did not do this and this is a criminal fabrication of an  event," Gvero assures.    When Gvero was asked about the alleged evidence held by the  Bosnian Serbs that "a foreign intelligence service was directly  involved" in the planning of this massacre, as well as "a group  of Muslims from the former Bosnia-Herzegovina active in the  Islamic lobby in the United States," Gvero replies that the  Serbian side has been monitoring very carefully everything that  was happening "before and after this event." He confirms that  they "hold certain information of various origins, which is in  the process of being checked." Gvero reminds that a Turkish  official at the beginning of January announced that "something  that will make the world speechless" will happen in Sarajevo,  which he finds indicative. However, as he says, "until we hold  firmer, more definitive proof that can be verified, we would not  like to make public statements." He says that this massacre  must be "thoroughly investigated" to prevent similar such events  happening in the future.    At the end, Karadzic says that "the international community  must soon change its attitude toward the warring sides. Their  attitude must be perfectly balanced. They must lift the  sanctions against the Serbs for the Muslims to realize that this  game is over and sign the peace plan. If the international  community really wants to proliferate and intensify the  conflict, then it will believe the Muslim fabrication, or some  country will order it."    Komrakov here thanks Karadzic, who must leave the studio due  to "pressing duties," for his participation in the program.    After Karadzic leaves Studio Pale, the program returns to  Studio Belgrade, where studio announcer Milorad Komrakov begins  interviewing his guests.    First, Komrakov turns to 1st Class Captain Dusan Jelusic, an  expert on mortars in the Yugoslav Army, and asks him to give his  expert opinion. Jelusic says that it is impossible for a mortar  shell to disintegrate into so much shrapnel, yet not damage any  of the market stalls.    After Jelusic, Komrakov turns to explosives expert Milan  Rundic, who proceeds to give vital statistics of a type of mine  that could have been used, but says that even if the mine or  shell had exploded under ideal conditions, it could not have  caused as many casualties. He then proceeds to give a lot of  scientific details and to explain the diagram he has drawn of  how the shrapnel disperses after the initial detonation.    Komrakov then introduces archive footage of site of massacre  shot by an unidentified foreign television crew, which shows a  man, allegedly a Bosnian official, who is taking measurements.  When asked to explain what he is doing, he answers that he is  investigating and cannot give any more details. Following this,  Komrakov introduces an excerpt from a phone-in program of Radio  Hayat. In the program, listeners phone in and urge citizens to  take up arms and advocate the killing of all Serbs. Some also  advocate killing all the Croats in addition to the Serbs. Only  one listener says that it is not normal to call for such  violence.    Following this, Komrakov turns to military-political  commentator Petar Knezevic, who says that the 5 February  massacre was evidently a terrorist act. Asked to assess the  seriousness of air strikes, Knezevic says that air strikes would  not give the desired results and that in his opinion, the allies  will not go ahead with their threats.    Komrakov now turns to Dr. Zoran Stanojevic, army forensic  pathologist, and asks him to assess the investigation carried  out at the site. Stanojevic says that in order get real  results, the investigators should not concentrate as much on the  site of the explosion but rather on the bodies of the deceased.  He maintains that no proper autopsies were performed and that  the time of death was not established. Otherwise, claims  Stanojevic, had proper autopsies been carried out, it would have  been established that some of the bodies had been dead for some  time before they were brought over to the market. He offers to  take his team and go to Sarajevo to perform the autopsies in the  presence of experts from all sides involved.    After this, Komrakov thanks his guests and reads a TANJUG  report that arrived in the editorial room some time earlier,  which says that the shell that landed on Markale market was  launched from Bosnian Army positions some 2 km away. With this,  he thanks the viewers for watching the program and wishes them  goodnight.</p>

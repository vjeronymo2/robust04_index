			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Greece privatises Eleusis shipyards GREECE'S state-owned Commercial Bank has agreed to sell Eleusis shipyards, the country's second largest ship repair and construction facility, to a group of London-based Greek shipowners for Dollars 60m. The group, led by Mr Constantine Peratikos, will pay only Dollars 12m in cash, but will assume some of the yard's liabilities, estimated to be more than Dr60bn (Dollars 307m), according to the bank. Commercial Bank holds a 63 per cent stake in Eleusis shipyards, with the remainder held by other companies in the bank's holding group and the state-owned Hellenic Industrial Development Bank. Mr Peratikos, chairman of Pegasus Ocean Services, controls a fleet of 22 vessels, most of which are Greek-registered. The shipyard sale marks the second major disposal under the government's privatisation programme. It follows the sale last month of Heracles Cement to a joint venture led by Calcestruzzi of Italy, part of the Ferruzzii group, for Dollars 124m. Despite having a strong order book, which included building landing craft for the Greek navy and heavy cranes for Salonica Port Authority in northern Greece, Eleusis shipyards posted operating losses of Dr6.4bn (Dollars 32.8m) on turnover of Dr10.8bn in 1990. However, Commercial Bank wrote off a large proportion of accumulated losses at the end of 1991, with government approval, in preparation for selling the yard. Greece undertook to sell or close down its four shipyards, all state-owned, by mid-1992 to comply with European Community regulations on ending subsidies to the shipbuilding industry. Eleusis is the first yard to be sold. Another, Halkis shipyards, has been leased to an Athens-based Greek shipowner, while liquidation procedures are underway at the Neorion and Scaramanga yards.</p>

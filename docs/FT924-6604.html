			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Blue Circle cement cuts please City - Capacity to be cut by a sixth in response to fall in demand BLUE CIRCLE Industries warned yesterday that the cost of closing down a sixth of its UK cement capacity would reduce its operating profits this year by Pounds 58m. More than 500 jobs are to be axed. However, the company repeated its pledge to maintain total dividends at 11.25p for the year to December 31. The move, in response to a big fall in demand for cement from the construction industry, was welcomed by brokers and the shares rose 2p to close at 177p. The group said that the Pounds 58m closure provisions and a Pounds 20m UK property loss this year would be offset at the operating profit level by net sale proceeds of Pounds 44m, mostly from the disposal of the South African building materials business. Previously the sale proceeds would have been included below the line. Blue Circle said that the changed treatment was required under the new FRS 3 accounting standard introduced by the Accounting Standards Board at end of last month. Brokers, following the announcement, reduced their forecasts for pre-tax profits this year from between Pounds 100m and Pounds 115m to between Pounds 60m and Pounds 80m. Mr Keith Orrell-Jones, managing director, said the company planned to reduce its UK cement manufacturing capacity by 1.2m tonnes to 6.7m tonnes. It intends to close one kiln and mothball another at its Northfleet Works in Kent. This would leave just one kiln working at the plant compared with six kilns 20 years ago. The company is also closing 13 of its 23 UK cement distribution depots. It said that a total of 550 jobs would be lost, representing about a fifth of its current UK cement workforce. Most of the jobs were expected to go through compulsory redundancy and would affect management as well as blue collar staff. Approaching half of the provision would be used to meet redundancy costs. Blue Circle, which produces about half of all the cement sold in the UK, blamed the recession in the construction industry for the cutbacks. Mr Orrell-Jones said that construction output would not climb back to previous levels even when the market recovered. Annual sales by UK cement manufacturers since 1989 had fallen by a third from 17.5m tonnes to a little less than 12m tonnes this year. This compared with an industry capacity, before the latest reduction, of more than 14m tonnes. Mr Orrell-Jones said that the benefits of the rationalisation would start to show through in improved profits within a year of it being implemented. See Lex</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Turkey plans rise in state sell-offs TURKEY'S coalition government has tried to dispel doubts about its commitment to privatisation by announcing plans to raise Tl 5,000bn (Pounds 523m) this year through the sale of its minority stakes in private sector companies. The sum is twice the figure realised by the outgoing Motherland party administration in 1991 through similar sales. The announcement by Mr Cavit Caglar, the state minister in charge, was greeted with interest from bankers. Mr Caglar said the block sale of minority shares in 28 companies would be completed this year. Separate preparations were also being made to sell 11 state-owned cement companies. The statement, however, does little to resolve the issue of the future of the 120 companies where the government is the majority partner. These include the power utility Tek, the state railways, and the national coal company. Turkey's state companies are said to account for 25 per cent of manufacturing capacity and half of total fixed investment. Losses in 1991 are estimated at Tl 13,000bn, equivalent to half of the government budget deficit which is running at around 11 per cent of GNP. The government is due to present its new economic programme to parliament on Thursday. The business lobby Tusiad this week urged the government to take strong action to stem the losses. 'It is a fact that some of the state enterprises can neither be privatised nor revived. There is no other solution than closing them down,' said Mr Bulent Eczacibasi, Tusiad chairman.</p>

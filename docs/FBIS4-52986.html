			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 11 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- Kim  Chong-su, chairman of the Association of Koreans in Japan for  Peaceful Reunification, published a statement Wednesday, in  which he branded the criminal acts of the South Korean  authorities in opposing the proposed convocation of national  conference and rushing headlong towards war against the fellow  countrymen as a challenge to the entire nation desirous of  reconciliation, unity and reunification and a full disclosure of  their color as flunkeyist traitors seeking only confrontation  and division and war against the North.    "If the South Korean authorities have the intention to  achieve peaceful reunification," he said, "they must no more do  acts upsetting the expectation of the entire fellow countrymen  for a convocation of national conference."    "They must also stop at once the criminal war moves intended  to annihilate the fellow countrymen in league with outside  forces", he demanded.</p>

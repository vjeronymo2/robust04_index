			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Minorco buys 4% of Metall Mining MINORCO, the offshore investment arm of South Africa's Anglo American Corporation, is to tighten its mining links with Metallgesellschaft by taking a small stake in the German metal group's fast-growing international mining subsidiary. Minorco has agreed to buy 3.1m shares, equal to a 4 per cent stake, in Toronto-based Metall Mining, in which Metallgesellschaft has a 68 per cent interest. The deal is worth about CDollars 31m (USDollars 23.2m) at current market prices. Dr Heinz Schimmelbusch, Metallgesellschaft chairman, yesterday expressed the hope that the deal would be the first step towards a long-term alliance between the two groups. Dr Schimmelbusch said that he viewed Minorco's involvement in Metall as an opportunity for future co-operation. 'We interpret it as a sign that the friendly fleets have established contact, and that they intend to keep fending off common enemies,' he said. Each company will have a window on the other's projects through the planned appointment of Mr Hank Slack, Minorco's president, to Metall's board. Minorco and Metallgesellschaft are partners in the Navachab open-pit gold mine in Namibia, and have indirect links in other international mining ventures. Metall last week announced plans to shift its gold mining assets into a new privately-owned company, to be owned jointly with Australia's Poseidon Gold, in which Minorco is an indirect shareholder. Minorco has narrowed its focus on natural resource investments. Under a restructuring announced last month, it is taking control of Anglo American's non-diamond investments outside Africa - notably Anglo's unquoted mining investments in South America. Metall expanded its copper interests last month by acquiring Metallgesellschaft's European copper smelting assets. But low copper prices led the Canadian company to put off plans last week for a CDollars 170m public share issue, which would have helped finance the purchase. Metall issued 15.9m shares to Metallgesellschaft in exchange for the copper assets, raising the German company's stake to 68 per cent from 60.5 per cent.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / US business investment 'to rise 8.9%' US businesses plan to increase spending on plant and equipment by 8.9 per cent in real terms this year after an 8.6 per cent increase last year, the Commerce Department said yesterday. The official survey of investment intentions supports anecdotal evidence that US business confidence has risen to the point where many companies are planning to build new plants or extend old facilities. Since existing capacity is largely utilised, investment in new capacity is widely seen as a prerequisite for continued non-inflationary growth. Yesterday's survey follows reports of a slight weakening in retail spending and home sales in recent weeks, partly as a result of increases in short and long-term interest rates. However, it indicates only a marginal scaling back of capital spending plans from earlier this year, suggesting that the tighter monetary policy is not deterring productive investment significantly. Rather than losing momentum, the US recovery seems to be entering a more mature phase in which business investment and exports take up the running from personal consumption and housing. The survey points to encouraging inflation trends in capital goods. The average price of plant and equipment is expected to fall by 0.6 per cent this year. The report shows across-the-board strength in capital spending, with declines this year in only a few sectors. The outlook is most buoyant in manufactured durable goods, where investment is expected to rise 10.8 per cent in cash terms this year. The strongest industries are blast furnaces and steelworks (up 37.5 per cent from 1993), motor vehicles (up 28.3 per cent) and electrical machinery (up 12.1 per cent). Figures for sectors are not adjusted for inflation. Manufacturers of non-durable goods, by contrast, are planning to increase capital spending by only 3.7 per cent from 1993. Relatively strong sectors include rubber (up 9.3 per cent), chemicals (7.9 per cent) and textiles (7.4 per cent.) Investment in non-manufacturing is projected to rise 8.8 per cent this year.</p>

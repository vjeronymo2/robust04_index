			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISCOUNT RATE INCREASE JOLTS STOCK MARKET; DOW FALLS 43  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve Board's hike in the discount rate jarred the stock market  Friday, slicing 43.92 points from the Dow Jones industrial average and closing  out the market's worst week since August.  </P> <P> Selling gathered momentum through the session as some investors fretted that  the half-point rise in the discount rate wouldn't be sufficient to halt  inflation and others worried that future rate increases might finally choke off  the long economic expansion.  </P> <P> It was the market's second sharp fall in three sessions, leaving the Dow off  79.28 points, or about 3.4%, for the week, closing at 2,245.54. The Dow lost  42.50 points on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The market's recent slide has eaten up a good chunk of the gains that stocks  achieved in January. The widely watched Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index  had gained about 5.6% in value from Jan. 1 through the trading Thursday, but it  lost about 2% of that in Friday's slide, said James D. Wright, chief investment  officer at Banc One Asset Management in Columbus, Ohio.  </P> <P> "It was steady pounding, across the board," he said.  </P> <P> Still, a number of analysts said Friday's tumble could have been worse,  considering the week's difficult economic news. And they saw much bullish  sentiment remaining in the market.  </P> <P> They cited the general strength of corporate earnings and the momentum of a  national economy that has been virtually unaffected by the interest rate  increases.  </P> <P> "This is the sort of knee-jerk reaction the market frequently has to interest  rate moves, but we think it may come out of it strongly," Wright said.  </P> <P> Edward J. Nicoski, market analyst with the Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood  brokerage in Minneapolis, said his firm has recently advised clients to put up  to one-quarter of their portfolios in cash. Only last month, Piper Jaffray was  recommending that clients put 100% of their assets in the stock market, he  said.  </P> <P> Nicoski said the firm is concerned that the market has hit a "violent air  pocket" because of worries about inflation and how well the Fed will be able to  handle it as it simultaneously struggles to remedy the thrift crisis.  </P> <P> "This air pocket may last longer than some people anticipated," he said. "But  in a few weeks, we may be out of it and heading back north."  </P> <P> Eugene J. Peroni, market analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia,  said he expected that the Dow would fall to about 2,100 from the post-crash  high of 2,347.14 that it reached Feb. 7. But after a weak period that may last  through March, the bull market will re-emerge, he predicted.  </P> <P> Peroni pointed out that recently there has been a change in how the market has  reacted to interest rate hikes. The market absorbed news of rate hikes with  "reckless abandon" last year as it recovered from the October, 1987, crash and  was buoyed by strong corporate earnings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Honeymoon May Be Over  </P> <P> "The market's now reacting more violently to rate rises than it has in some  time," he said.  </P> <P> Investors had long expected a rise in the discount rate, which was lifted to 7%  from 6.5%, and initially Friday there was little reaction to the Fed's  announcement. But the selling increased with computer-assisted trading, which  continued fitfully through the session.  </P> <P> Overall, volume was moderate, with 160.68 million shares traded on the New York  Stock Exchange, compared to 150.37 million Thursday. Declining issues  outnumbered gainers by a 7-to-2 margin.  </P> <P> The S&amp;P 500 index fell 4.92 to 287.13, as the NYSE composite index lost  2.37 to 161.72. The average share price was off 49 cents on the New York Stock  Exchange.  </P> <P> Peroni said the Senate Armed Service Committee's negative vote on John Tower's  nomination to be defense secretary might have been a "secondary factor" in the  day's trading. "A lot of people in the market have focused on their hopes for  this Administration, and it looks like the honeymoon may be ending."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Housing Issues Off  </P> <P> The stock selloff was felt across most sectors. Among the blue chips,  International Business Machines fell 2 1/4 to 121 1/8, American Telephone &amp;  Telegraph lost 3/4 to 29 3/4, Eastman Kodak skidded 1 1/2 to 46 5/8 and  Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing slid 1 5/8 to 65.  </P> <P> Bethlehem Steel gave up 1 1/8 to 25, Merck lost 1 1/8 to 62 3/8 and Du Pont  fell 2 1/8 to 95.  </P> <P> Companies in the housing and auto industries, always hurt in rate rises, were  hit hard. General Motors was off 2 1/2 to 84 1/4, Ford tumbled 1 3/8 to 51 3/4  and Chrysler gave up 1/2 to 25 3/4.  </P> <P> U.S. Home fell 1/4 to 1 7/8, Kaufman &amp; Broad Home slid 1/4 to 15 3/4 and  Centex gave up 3/8 to 27 7/8.  </P> <P> Among the gainers, Emhart jumped 7 1/8 to 39 7/8, substantially above the $35 a  share offered by Topper L.P., a partnership consisting of the Fisher real  estate family and oil heir Gordon Getty.  </P> <P> In the airline industry, UAL fell 2 3/4 to 125 1/4, AMR lost 1 1/8 to 59 7/8,  Southwest Airlines eased 3/8 to 23 3/8 and Delta was unchanged at 56 3/4.  </P> <P> The airline sector's big gainer was NWA, which has been the subject of takeover  speculation. Its shares rose 3 5/8 to 72 3/8.  </P> <P> Among issues on the American Stock Exchange, New World Entertainment was up 1/2  to 5 1/2 on news that it will be acquired by Pathe Entertainment.  </P> <P> California Energy dropped 3 7/8 to 16 7/8. The Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.  investment firm issued a recommendation to sell the stock, saying there were  "numerous claims" on the revenue from its main geothermal project.  </P> <P> In London, the Financial Times 100-share index ended the day 2.9 points, or  0.1%, higher at 2,019.5. The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed Friday for the  funeral of Emperor Hirohito.  </P></p>

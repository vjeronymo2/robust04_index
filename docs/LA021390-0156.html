			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STING, SPRINGSTEEN, HENLEY JAM FOR RAIN FORESTS  </P> <P> Some Hollywood heavies paid $5,000 to hear Sting perform on the same stage as  Bruce Springsteen and Don Henley. Others in the know forked out just $10 -- and  they got to see the music giants jam together.  </P> <P> After a pricey Beverly Hills back-yard benefit that raised more than $1 million  to save Amazon rain forests Monday night, Sting, Springsteen and Henley  gathered at the China Club in Hollywood, publicist Joe D'Ambrosio said.  </P> <P> In the audience of about 400 during the 45-minute performance were basketball  legend Wilt Chamberlain, raunchy comedian Sam Kinison, actors Richard Grieco,  Corey Haim and Ed Begley Jr., and Julian Lennon.  </P> <P> Other notables included Brian Setzer, singer Michael Damien, actor Esai  Morales, Patti Scialfa and California Angels rookie pitching sensation Jim  Abbott.  </P> <P> The recording superstars took the stage during the club's twice-weekly Pro-Am  Invitational Jam. Unlike the earlier benefit show, the club show featured all  three on stage together, along with Herbie Hancock, Branford Marsalis, Bruce  Hornsby and Joe Walsh.  </P> <P> Springsteen sang "(I'm Gonna Wait) Till the Midnight Hour," Sting sang "Ain't  No Sunshine" and "I Been Down So Long," while all three took a turn leading a  rendition of "Round and Round."  </P> <P> Tickets at the exclusive benefit for the Rainforest Foundation, attended by  industry figures like Disney's Michael Eisner and celebrities like Barbra  Streisand, went for between $5,000 and $500 apiece.  </P> <P> The cover charge at the club known for its big-name celebrity walk-ons was $10,  with no drink minimum.  </P></p>

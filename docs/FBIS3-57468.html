A Place Will Be Found in the Bloc for Many, But Not  for Russia"]    [Text] Vilnius -- "NATO cannot now accept states which are  not in complete accord," the well-known Ukrainian writer Dmitro  Pavlychko, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament's Commission for  Foreign Affairs, has stated. "Hence, in my view, we should  first undergo schooling in accord all together, not separately.  We must create complete harmony in East and Central Europe."    Dmitro Pavlychko made this statement during his tour of  Baltic countries, where he held talks with the heads of the  Lithuanian and Latvian parliaments and leaders of committees and  commissions, ministers, and opposition leaders in those  countries. His tour, the mass media reported, had one aim: the  creation of a Baltic-Black Sea alliance or, to be more precise,  joint work on the juridical basis for such an alliance.  Lithuania and the other Baltic countries, Pavlychko believes,  need to look south and break out of the circle to which they  have been assigned.    So an effort is clearly being made to create a Baltic-Black  Sea alliance. What role in this is allotted to Russia -- a  state which has outlets to the Baltic and the Black Sea?  Ukrainian parliamentarians expressed no opinion on this  question. But it was answered back in December at the "Baltic  Cooperation and Security" conference by former Estonian Defense  Minister Juri Luik (now foreign minister). Expressing his  support for the creation of a unified security concept for the  Baltic countries, Luik called for the formation of a  military-political alliance of the Baltic states without the  participation of Russia, but involving Ukraine.</p>

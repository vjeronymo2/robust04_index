			<p>CSO     [Text] About 48 hours after decisively declaring that  satellite dishes are "illegal" in Iran and ordering the police  to collect them, the minister of the interior did a 180-degree  turn and said the government still has not made a final decision  on this matter and that until this decision has been made no one  has the right to make trouble for the owners of these antennas.    Our sources report from Tehran that government agents  secretly took aerial photographs from the rooftops of Tehran.  After seeing these photographs the leaders of the Islamic  Republic realized that there are too many of these antennas for  the police to be able to collect them.    Prior to this, the chief of the Police Antismuggling Office  threatened owners and importers of this type of antenna "in  whatever rank or position they may hold" with "legal" penalties.    The reactions, however, especially from the Majles, were  very  instructive for the minister of the interior. One deputy accused  him of "speaking rashly" and another, noting the 12 years of  fruitless struggle against videos, said efforts to collect  satellite dishes will not serve the goal of "fighting the  cultural invasion."    Various sources estimate the number of satellite dishes in  Tehran at between 200,000 and 300,000, and at up to 450,000  throughout Iran.    In an interview with the publication TEHRAN TIMES, 'Ali  Mohammad Basharati retracted his harsh words about collecting  the satellite dishes and said: Antennas that receive satellite  television programming are not illegal, but the government has  decided to discuss them in the next month. Therefore, the use of  satellite dishes must be approved by the government.    Basharati discussed the things the press wrote about his  remarks on collecting these antennas. He added: A commission to  include representatives of the Islamic Propaganda Organization  and the minister of culture and guidance will set the laws and  regulations on the use of satellite dishes. In this interview,  Basharati also announced: Until the Council of Ministers makes  its announcement and a statement is issued by the Ministry of  the Interior on this matter, no one has the right to collect  satellite dishes. If someone goes to homes for this purpose, the  home owner should report him to the nearest police station. The  TEHRAN TIMES wrote that after the minister of the interior  announced his opinion that satellite dishes were illegal, it  created the worry that there might be trouble for those who use  these antennas. The minister of the interior said: The subject  of satellite dishes is being studied. It will take a month to  get a conclusion from the research that will lead to a decision.  The Council of Ministers will announce the final decision.    The TEHRAN TIMES writes: Satellite dishes have been  installed  extensively on the rooftops in Tehran in the last two years. The  minister of the interior said: The Council of Ministers is  making a decision on the laws and regulations for the use of  satellite dishes, and the Ministry of the Interior will have the  responsibility of enforcing them.    Last week 'Ali Mohammad Basharati said: No law is needed to  collect satellite dishes. The Ministry of the Interior views  them as a form of corruption, like other kinds of pollution and  the cultural invasion. Therefore, it will not wait for a law to  be approved to collect them from the rooftops. After Basharati's  remarks, and in view of the past experiences with assaults on  homes by thugs and ruffians, the trouble the revolution guards  and committees caused with their intrusions into the homes of  Iranians since the beginning of the revolution and the repeated  thefts and killings committed by people bearing membership cards  in revolution groups, Rafsanjani and others asked him to retract  what he said.    Following the minister of the interior's remarks about  collecting the satellite dishes, in some cities, including  Shiraz, revolution guards and irresponsible individuals went  into homes on their own initiative and took the antennas. The  next day the confiscated antennas turned up in the markets and  were sold at lower prices to others.    After the statements by the minister of the interior on his  own initiative about the satellite dishes, and before he  retracted his remarks, the general manager of the Police  Antismuggling Office announced at a press conference that  satellite dishes are a smuggled item and that their owners would  be dealt with as smugglers. He said a project called the "Kusar  Project" was being prepared under which "an extensive campaign  against various kinds of smuggling deals" will begin.    He said since goods that are not listed on the nation's  import and export guidelines are considered smuggled goods,  satellite dishes, which mostly come into Iran through the  northern ports of the Persian Gulf, are subject to this  prohibition. "Satellite dishes throughout the country are  considered smuggled goods and will be confiscated."    Citing the minister of the interior, he also said: "The  minister of the interior, in comments published in the  newspapers...said there has been no change in his views as  minister of the interior and those of the government concerning  the collection of satellite dishes."    However, after the minister of the interior did a 180-degree  turn in less than 48 hours, Morteza Nabavi, an influential  Majles deputy and editor of the newspaper RESALAT, said in a  Majles speech that although viewing some of the programming  broadcast by satellite has "bad effects," a "reactionary  approach" should not be taken. He called upon the minister of  the interior to "speak more deliberately." Addressing the  minister of the interior, he said if there is "order with regard  to the satellite dishes, there will be no need to collect them."  It would have been better, before announcing the decision to  collect the satellite dishes, if the minister of the interior  had "weighed all the aspects of the matter."    Hojjat ol-Eslam Zadsar, Majles deputy from Jiroft, said  concerning this: "Collecting these receivers will solve nothing.  It will only have minor short-term effects." He added: "The  foreign invasion must not instill fear," because "the religious  beliefs of the people will prevent them from dominating us."    It is still not clear whether the minister of the interior  said these things on his own initiative or after discussing the  matter with the Council of Ministers.    On the other hand, the Majles has also gotten into the fray.  It has announced that a law is needed to collect satellite  dishes. Therefore, the law must be approved by the Majles and a  government edict on this matter is not sufficient.    KEYHAN's sources report from Tehran that after the remarks  by  the minister of the interior, the government ordered that  precise aerial photographs be taken from the rooftops of Tehran.  These photographs showed that there are too many of these  antennas for the police to be able to collect them.    Various sources estimate the number of satellite dishes in  Tehran at between 200,000 and 300,000, and at up to 450,000  throughout Iran.</p>

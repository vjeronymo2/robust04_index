			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 11 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  and Russia have reached agreement in principle on a wide-ranging  new trade, partnership and cooperation agreement, an EU  spokesman said here Wednesday [11 May].    He said the accord had been reached by EU Trade Commissioner  Sir Leon Brittan and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr  Shokin.    It must still be ratified by the Russian Government and by  the EU Council of Foreign Ministers which will discuss the  proposed accord at a meeting here Monday.    "The agreement is very ambitious," the spokesman said,  adding  that it was much better than a trade accord signed with the old  Soviet Union in 1989 and could be formally signed within a few  months.    The accord offers Russia the prospect of a free trade area  with the EU sometime after 1997 if Moscow has made satisfactory  progress towards a market economy by then.    It would immediately give Russia better access for its  products to the EU market, lead to the abolition of many quotas  and boost trade in such services as civil engineering,  consultancies and telecommunications.    The agreement includes regular economic and political  dialogue and meetings at presidential level twice a year.    One clause states that respect for democratic principles and  human rights is an essential element of the partnership.    The EU spokesman said the two sides had overcome two  obstacles -- banking regulations and trade in nuclear fuel --  which had held up the accord for about a year.    He said Moscow had pledged to exempt five western banks --  two Dutch, two French and one German -- from a recent decree  that foreign banks could not accept deposits from Russians.    The five banks were set up in Russia before the decree was  announced by President Boris Yeltsin last November. The  spokesman said the restriction would fall away altogether in  1995.    Moscow also pledged to moderate its exports of nuclear  fuels,  while the EU will retain the right to act against sudden surges  of the nuclear imports from Russia until the issue is reviewed  in 1997.    France has opposed inclusion of the nuclear fuel issue in  the  accord because it wants to protect its own nuclear industry from  cut-price Russian competition.</p>

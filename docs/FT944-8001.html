			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Poor case against soft commission Sir, Lex's comments on soft commission (November 17) were ill-considered. There is no case against soft commission that is not also an argument against all forms of commission and, while payment for services via commission leads to abuse, it certainly need not. Payment for research has traditionally been made through commissions. Forcing these payments to be restricted to houses which offer dealing services as well as research will reduce the ease of entry and restrict competition. Measures that contribute to reduced competition are clearly in the interests of integrated securities businesses and it is fair to point out that Mercury Asset Management is part of a large integrated securities business. It is important that commissions payments of all kinds should not be abused, but it is equally important that abuses should not arise through fund management companies being owned by broker/dealers. The regulations designed to achieve these ends should not, however, serve only to reduce competition. The Financial Times does not normally support anti-competitive measures and it is sad to see Lex doing so. Andrew Smithers, Smithers &amp; Co, 20 St Dunstan's Hill, London EC3R 8HY</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian People's Rukh leader, Vyacheslav  Chornovil, suggested that the new Ukrainian parliament would not  be better than the previous one. He emphasized that the Rukh  must join with the national democratic forces and people who did  not call for an empire and whose activities were aimed at  strengthening Ukraine's statehood.    Chornovil said two people had very much wanted to gain from  these elections. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk would gain  if the elections failed and former Supreme Soviet speaker Ivan  Plyushch could have extended the powers of former deputies if  the elections failed. Everything was arranged in order that the  elections be invalid, Chornovil suggested. He added that these  plans had been broken by the Ukrainian people.    When asked whether he will run for president, Chornovil  pointed out that it could not be discussed since the president's  powers had not as yet been defined.    Meanwhile, a member of the former Supreme Soviet's  presidium,  Les Tanyuk, said at a press conference in Kiev that the  Communist majority in the new parliament did not mean their  complete victory. Tanyuk believes that leftist politicians, most  of who are about 60 years old, will not be capable of  influencing decisionmaking in the parliament. "The victory of  Communists does not signify a victory of the Communist idea,"  Tanyuk stressed.    When commenting on the early results of the parliamentary  elections, a leader of the Inter-Regional Reform Bloc, former  deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, Vladimir  Grinev, emphasized that nothing unexpected had happened.  "Certainly, it will be difficult with the Communists. However,  we have lived with them for all our life, we can live with them  a little more," he said. Grinev said his movement could join  with the left in the parliament on some issues.    Grinev told INTERFAX-Ukraine that he had not as yet decided  whether he would run for the coming presidential elections in  Ukraine. He remarked that it was necessary to analyze the  results of the elections to the Supreme Soviet.    Grinev said he could decide on his participation in the  presidential elections on 12 April after his meeting with  ex-premier Leonid Kuchma in Kiev. Kuchma is also leader of the  Inter-Regional Reform Bloc.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Personal View: The spectre at the fast Pollution and depletion were part of the green 'new consciousness' of the 1960s. In the oil-shocked 1970s and the individualist 1980s, they increasingly lost their political salience. Yet in the interim, resource degradation had speeded up so that in the 1990s there are renewed concerns, this time including ozone destruction and global warming. Why? The answer was not even on the agenda of the UN Environment Conference in Rio de Janeiro. It is quite simple. Since 1978, several leading governments in rich countries have increasingly moved (a) to squeeze out inflation, (b) to abandon fiscal policy as a means to that end, and therefore - especially because direct control of the money supply has proved unfeasible - (c) to rely increasingly on forcing up real interest rates. Dramatically rising rates in 1977-79, sustained ever since, have increased the incentives - to families, businesses and governments - to use up natural resources now, and to ignore the consequences later. These same high interest rates, too, have drained the cash with which governments might otherwise have protected resources for the future. Long-term interest rates in real terms, that is, net of expected inflation, are a classic market signal. They tell every householder and every business the market value of resources now, compared to several years hence. The arithmetic of the signalling is fierce. Suppose an Indian farmer has two ways to farm. The extractive path gets a high return for 15 years, but then the land is exhausted and useless. The sustainable path gets a lower return, for ever. If the farmer faces a high real rate of long-term interest, say 5 per cent, extractive farming looks attractive. Even if it is only twice as profitable each year - for 15 years - as sustainable farming for ever, the incentive is to extract now. If the real long-term rate of interest is lower, say 2 per cent, extractive farming for just 15 years has far less appeal. It has to be almost four times as profitable each year - while it lasts - to be preferred. Farmers facing low interest rates usually choose sustainable paths. Poor countries are tiny players in international capital markets. They must accept interest rates as they are made in New York, Frankfurt and Tokyo. Prime, real long-term rates in the 1950s and the 1960s stood at some 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent. Since 1978 they have hovered between 4 per cent and 5 per cent, and the World Bank predicts they will climb even higher. Its prophecy, made in May 1991, looks like being fulfilled. Even though nominal rates have fallen in the US, Japan, and parts of western Europe, this has been more than matched by the fall in inflation, actual and expected. These rises in real interest rates have been amplified for developing countries. Western banks pushed most of their Third World loans from fixed to variable rates in the late 1970s; later, the dwind-ling creditworthiness of many borrowing governments meant they had to pay steadily widening premiums. Final borrowers - smallholders and urban businesses in India and Kenya - faced even wider margins via conditions on aid which forced down domestic interest rate subsidies. The exploding interest rate told the borrower that - whatever the rich world's lobbies and leaders may say - the markets value the long-term survival of rainforest or ozone, and even of poor rural people's water and fuel, at almost zero. Even for Third World governments that wanted to provide resources or subsidies for conservation, rising interest rates drained their ability to do so. In 1972, interest payments - at home as well as abroad - comprised 5.6 per cent of spending, including net lending, by central governments in non-oil developing countries; by 1988, they had reached 18.7 per cent. Malthusian pessimists warn that extra people will eventually degrade the world's resources and thus destroy themselves. The market case against such pessimism, however, is powerful. It states that, as resources threaten to run out, their price increases, so that families, businesses and governments are stimulated to conserve, replace, or even discover new deposits of them. But the developed world, by forcing up real interest rates to unprecedented peacetime levels for 14 years, has broken the transmission, from demographic challenge to conservationist response. Participants at Rio warned of impending famine, dearth, and depletion. The rate of interest is our spectre at their fast. If OECD countries choose to squeeze out inflation, they can do so. But if they persist in doing so by means of sky-high real rates of interest, they will increasingly encourage production techniques which deplete resources and cause pollution. The grandchildren of those who live by the market, as well as their new converts in the developing world, may then die by the market.

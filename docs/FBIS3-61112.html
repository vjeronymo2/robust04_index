			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Taras Stetskiv by Viktoriya Andreyeva; place </F> and date not given: "Quo Vadis?..."]    [Text] It is this question that I would like to put to  sober-minded politicians endeavoring to run for a new parliament  to be elected in accordance with an inept, regressive law.    Romanticism is played out. And small joys have sped off  together with it to some warm parts of recollections of the  "dawn of democracy." Remember? There really is a choice (that  is, choosing from several), and there they are, in the highest  legislative body--our people (whoever is against "them" is a  priori one of ours)--they are speaking, and no one is sending  them down for doing so....    The delights of the barbarian who has seen a telephone are  fewish today. I call at the election headquarters of New  Wave--an interparty independent association of professionals, as  this group calls itself--that has just opened in Lvov. I see the  faces of people whom I have reason to consider intelligent and  decent, and I estimate that many of them have a chance of  negotiating the election marathon successfully.    And then? After two years of what is considered de jure  independence, merely obtaining a platform for the declaration of  one's views in order subsequently to lose round after round,  bearing part of the responsibility for senseless decisions,  murderous for the state, is negligibly little. It is precisely  this, however, that is before one's eyes and in one's  recollections. And here once again, people are arguing until  they are hoarse about programs, rejoicing in the grains of  rationality in them. Grains doomed to fall on a land scorched by  "Sovietness"? Or perhaps I am wrong, and it is simply the dark,  cold December with prices inducing the temperatures of galloping  tuberculosis that has bestowed the pessimism?    We are talking with Taras Stetskiv, a deputy at this time,  one of those prepared to set out on the coming election voyage  from New Wave.    [Andreyeva] A somewhat naive question, perhaps, but how many  "head," how many persons, with whom reform steps could be  defended were there in this Supreme Council?    [Stetskiv] No more than 60. I refer to those who not only  employed slogans of independence and market reforms, but also  knew how to do so.    [Andreyeva] Once again it is ridiculous, most likely, to  speak about an arithmetical quantity, but how many bills that  may be considered reform, progressive bills, were adopted by the  Supreme Council?    [Stetskiv] Of the more than 120 bills that were adopted  altogether, 25-30 may be deemed to afford scope for market  reforms. And, despite their incomplete nature, it should be  acknowledged that under Ukraine's conditions they afforded an  opportunity for something to be done. The laws on privatization  and securities and the stock exchange, concerning credit unions  and stock companies and the amendments to the land code that  legalized private property. All this, given the good will of  parliament and, most important, given the good political will of  the government, afforded an opportunity (not the best, but  normal conditions) for the development of market reforms.    [Andreyeva] Something as ephemeral and nonmaterial as this  good will itself was lacking, it has to be thought....    [Stetskiv] The trouble is that this, in principle, very  small  legal foundation was not realized in the least. The government  sought in the laws not what opens the way to reforms, but what  affords an opportunity to block them.    [Andreyeva] So the blame for our situation today lies with  the government (more precisely, the governments). And the  Supreme Council?    [Stetskiv] To blame, without any doubt. Another example of  such a quantity of inconsistent steps is hardly to be found in  contemporary history among the European revolutions that ousted  communism. One market law would be adopted, the next,  antimarket. One declares privatization by way of auction, a  second determines the path of privatization via leasing. This is  an indicator of the lack of professionalism of the Supreme  Council and the absence of a conceptually defined path. Thus,  not a single consistent reform action has been implemented in  the two years of independence in Ukraine.    [Andreyeva] Consequently, the real use factor of the group  of  reformers within parliament is about zero. We will not today, if  you do not mind, speak about the propaganda effect. We will  recall the bitter pictures of defeats: All arguments are  exhausted, and the majority--the reliable "voting machine"--has  once again ridden roughshod over the shoots of what is new. Nor  do we have far to go--I recall the face of Sergey Holovatyy as  he came into the corridor following the adoption of the latest  retrograde article of the Election Act....    [Stetskiv] Yes, this was a defeat. It showed once again that  there can be no accords or preliminary gentlemen's agreements  with the communist majority: It has broken them all.    [Andreyeva] When cursing this act and harvesting its fruit,  people will say: "Parliament adopted this." Consequently, part  of the responsibility is borne by everyone.    [Stetskiv] No. As far as the Election Act is concerned, the  democratic part of parliament, the People's Council, ceased  taking part in the voting after the adoption of the notorious  Article 24.    [Andreyeva] But the act has been adopted....    [Stetskiv] Yes, the act has been adopted, and, as in any  state based on the rule of law, we will submit to it and run in  accordance with it.    [Andreyeva] And on what part of the progressively thinking,  reform-minded members of the new parliament can we count?    [Stetskiv] This might seem somewhat romantic, but on  one-third, about 130-150 persons, I believe.    [Andreyeva] Your forecast is quite optimistic; on what do  you  base this optimism?    [Stetskiv] On a particular analysis. First, I can in  descending order of chances, so to speak, name the three main  forces that will play a part at these elections: the "power  party," the corps of directors, and the interests of private  business. Second, even at the most critical moments of its  existence, society does not elect a large percentage of  marginals of both a communist and nationalist persuasion.  Marginals are of no benefit to any of the above-mentioned three  forces, and they will all try to promote those of a more or less  centrist frame of mind. Only the corps of directors and the  power party will rely on people whose thinking tilts in the  direction of the preservation of state property, and private  property will support those who are more explicitly oriented  toward capitalism. Thus the center, constituting the main part,  will be divided into two groups.    [Andreyeva] We have already had something similar. If it is  considered that private business is weaker than the other forces  mentioned, the groups will be unequal. The difference in  interests has already produced an inconsistency, which we spoke  of earlier, which has jerked society around. Are you, who put  yourself among the reformers, not afraid of once again being in  the obscure minority?    [Stetskiv] This cannot be ruled out. But it seems to me that  the new parliament will be, if not by much, better. It is worth  going to the polls, worth voting, even for this. If we elect no  one, we will get dictatorship. As regards obscure opposition. It  seems to me that the confrontation in the new parliament will  differ from the confrontation in the previous one: In the  present one the contradictions of the opposition and the  majority have been of an ideological nature; in the next one,  they will assume an economic nature.    [Andreyeva] It is hard to believe that things will get  easier  thanks to a change in the nature of the confrontation, and in  such a vital direction, what is more.    [Stetskiv] The point is that the contradictions will not be  implacable. The struggle will be conducted over the pace and  direction of the reforms. After all, even the body of state  directors understands that it is no longer possible to preserve  everything as it is. The contradiction will be between the  supporters of a quiet drift in the direction of capitalism, into  which it is desirable for them to ride, high up on their  sluggish camel, and the supporters of this form or the other of  shock therapy capable of producing a visible result.    [Andreyeva] Nonetheless, the last question from a pessimist,  of whose role today, judging by my frame of mind, I will not  manage to rid myself. What if there is once again a blank  confrontation? The nerves of the members of the opposition at  the microphones, the withdrawals and arrivals, sundry demarches  (there is nothing left, after all), and the next day we read the  text of the latest law, pushing the country toward ruin? What,  in your view, should be the actions of people today heading for  parliament with the best of intentions?    [Stetskiv] If it is like this, the sole opportunity for the  market opposition is to put the emphasis on the presidential  elections. To try to realize the alternative of a decisive  reformer president. If this is unsuccessful, there will be  distressing times for Ukraine.</p>

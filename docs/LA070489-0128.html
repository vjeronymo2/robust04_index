			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REVENGE QUICK FOR ANGELS;  </P> <P> JEFFCOAT EXITS EARLY THIS TIME ; ABBOTT GETS 5-2 VICTORY  </P> <P> On a night when Devon White, the man who never met an outside pitch he didn't  like, set a personal best with three walks in three at-bats, the Angels learned  again that good things come to those who wait.  </P> <P> Shut out on five hits by the Texas Rangers' Mike Jeffcoat last month in  Arlington, the Angels returned home Monday night for a rematch with the  Rangers' left-hander -- and scored a knockout in the third inning.  </P> <P> Turning three walks and two hits into three quick runs, the Angels disposed of  Jeffcoat after only eight outs, wading through four Texas relief pitchers en  route to a 5-2 victory before 29,614 at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> Angel rookie Jim Abbott (7-5) got the victory, limiting the Rangers to one run  through seven innings before balking home a second run in the top of the  eighth.  </P> <P> Abbott struck out six, including second baseman Jeff Kunkel three times.  </P> <P> Jeffcoat (4-2) extended his scoreless streak against the Angels to 11 innings  before breaking down in a hurry in the third, turning a 1-0 Texas lead into a  3-1 deficit.  </P> <P> Dick Schofield opened the inning by drawing a walk and one out later, White did  the same. Wally Joyner followed with an opposite-field double into the  left-field corner, scoring both Schofield and White.  </P> <P> Joyner then took third on a single by Brian Downing and scored on a passed ball  by Ranger catcher Jim Sundberg. When Jeffcoat issued a two-out walk to Tony  Armas, Texas Manager Bobby Valentine decided he'd seen enough.  </P> <P> In came Cecilio Guante, beginning a parade of pitchers out of the Ranger  bullpen. Before the evening was through, the Angels would also become  acquainted with Drew Hall, Kenny Rogers and Gary Mielke, adding two  ninth-inning runs against Rogers and Mielke.  </P> <P> That broke the game open for Abbott, who limited Texas to five hits in his  eight innings. Brian Harvey worked the ninth, allowing a hit and a walk before  closing out his 11th save.  </P> <P> Abbott fell behind in the top of the third when he gave up a two-out walk to  Sundberg and successive singles to Sammy Sosa and Scott Fletcher. Fletcher's  hit scored Sundberg and the Rangers led, 3-1.  </P> <P> But the Angels countered with their three-run outburst in bottom of the inning,  giving Abbott an advantage he would protect until the eighth. Abbott yielded a  fourth-inning double to Pete Incaviglia and a sixth-inning single to Ruben  Sierra, but no Ranger reached third base thereafter.  </P> <P> Abbott also had three consecutive strikeouts, fanning Steve Buechele to end the  fourth inning before opening the fifth with strikeouts of Kunkel and Sundberg.  </P> <P> Abbott completed a 1-2-3 seventh inning, striking out Kunkel and Sundberg  again, before having a bit of trouble in the eighth.  </P> <P> With one out, Sosa doubled into the gap in right-center and took third on an  infield out. From there, Sosa scored when Abbott unleashed a high fastball that  nicked catcher Lance Parrish's glove and was ruled a passed ball.  </P> <P> Finally, Abbott ended the inning by retiring Rafael Palmeiro on a ground ball.  </P> <P> The Angels, held scoreless by Hall and Rogers through the eighth inning,  finally got to Rogers in the ninth.  </P> <P> Downing drew a leadoff walk and was singled to second by Chili Davis, prompting  Valentine to change pitchers again and bring on Mielke. Mielke got Tony Armas  to line into a double play -- catching Davis off first base -- but surrendered  a double to deep center field by Parrish, the ball sailing well over the head  of Sosa.  </P> <P> Downing scored on the hit and Parrish soon followed suit, coming home on a  single to left by Glenn Hoffman, who was starting in place of injured third  baseman Jack Howell.  </P> <P> Harvey replaced Abbott in the top of the ninth and, as is his custon of late,  proceeded to make things more interesting than Angel Manager Doug Rader would  have liked. With one out, Harvey gave up a single to Franco and a and a walk to  Incaviglia to bring the tying run to home plate.  </P> <P> Thad Bosley, the first of two pinch-hitters employed by Valentine, grounded to  first to move the runners up 90 feet. Rick Leach, batting for Kunkel, then  struck out, finally bringing an end to Harvey's 11th save of the season.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Tony Armas was back in right field Monday night because Claudell Washington  remained in Inglewood's Centinela Hospital Medical Center for treatment of his  inflamed left shin. Washington is receiving intravenous antibiotics for a  condition that has been diagnosed as cellulitis and tendinitis. According to  Angel trainer Rick Smith, the injury is similar to the shin infection that  knocked Wally Joyner out of the final four games of the 1986 American League  playoffs. One difference, though: Washington's condition was apparently brought  on by a brush with poison oak. Said Smith: "His kids got into some poison oak  and during the last home stand, Claudell was rolling around with them and  playing with them. A couple of days later, his thighs started itching. He was  scratching them so hard, there were almost claw marks. Then, there was swelling  in the shin. That might have been how the cellulitis got started." Washington  is expected to be released from the hospital today but Smith said the  outfielder might not be ready to play again "until the weekend or the Thursday  after the All-Star break."  </P></p>

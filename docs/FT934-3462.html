			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (20): Plums are tastier than lemons - Hands off that Bimbo? Charles Batchelor compiles a buy-out-speak primer Management buy-outs combine the expertise of the corporate financier with those of the venture capitalist, and the industry makes use of technical terms from both sectors. Some of the more colourful terminology imported from the US by the venture capital community has been lost as the industry has become more established in Europe. But managers contemplating a buy-out may still be confused by some of the jargon. Bimbo: A somewhat controversial term to describe a deal involving both existing and outside managers: a buy-in/management buy-out (or Bimbo). About half of all deals take this form. Bought deal: When a deal maker provides all of the finance needed for a buy-out deal, and then sells on or syndicates part of the funding to other investors later. Done by the larger providers of finance when speed or confidentiality are particularly important for the deal to succeed. Bridge financing: Short-term funding provided when a company is about to raise a new round of equity, or is about to go public. Business plan: The document put together by managers to justify their application for finance. Should contain summaries of past and projected profit-and-loss accounts, balance sheets and cash flows. Also details of products and services, markets, future strategy, and profiles of the managers. A warning, however: don't get too carried away. Most financiers will not go beyond the two-page executive summary. Caps, collars and cylinders: Clauses in buy-out deals which limit the extent to which the interest rate charged on borrowed funds can rise or fall. A safeguard against borrowing costs rising to the point where they endanger the company. Such agreements usually have a limited life of one or two years. The longer the period of cover, the more expensive the collar or cap. Carried interest: A stake, typically 20 per cent, taken in the investee company by the venture capital or buy-out fund managers. Can be in the form of options. Deal flow: The rate at which investment propositions come to the deal-maker or financier. Many claim to select only one deal in 50, though deal-flow numbers are treated by some as a sort of virility symbol. Development Capital: Later-stage finance for more established companies which are profitable or nearly profitable. Less risky generally than early stage finance. Due diligence: Detailed analysis and appraisal of the background of the entrepreneur and his business plan. Earn out: Either a formula for relating the final purchase price of a company to actual future earnings, or a means of encouraging management to perform by payment on the basis of future performance (see also ratchet). Employee buy-out: A deal involving not just the top management but also all, or a large number of, the more junior employees of the organisation. The difficulty of involving large numbers of employees without disclosing a deal prematurely has meant that relatively few of these deals have been done. Some managers get round this by staging a buy-out and then involve other staff at a later stage. Employee share ownership plan (Esop): A trust which is established to acquire shares in a company for subsequent allocation to employees over a number of years. Exit: The point at which the financier sells his holding in the buy-out company, either through a trade sale to a larger company, by the management buying out the other investors to assume complete control, or by a stock market flotation. It is essential the managers and their financial backers agree from the outset on the exit strategy. Gearing, or leverage: The ratio of debt to equity in a company's capital structure. Intermediate forms of capital, such as redeemable preference shares and convertible loans, can complicate the calculations and mean a variety of different ratios may be applied to the same company. Hands on / hands off: The degree to which an investor in a buy-out becomes involved in its management. A hands-on investor would normally nominate a non-executive director to the board, and might commit some of its other executives to help out if the company ran into difficulties. Hands-off investors would have very little, or no, active involvement in the company. Internal Rate of Return (IRR): Different investors work this out in different ways, but the term generally refers to annual compound rate of return to the investor over a given period. Returns normally include dividend distributions and profits from either disposals or a fair valuation of the buy-out company. Junior debt: Unsecured loans which rank after secured or senior debt for repayment in the event of a default (See also: Senior debt). Junk bonds: High yielding, unsecured debt used in US buy-outs. Since the debt is in the form of a bond certificate, it can be bought and sold more easily than the mezzanine loans (qv) used to finance UK buy-outs. Lead investor: Venture capitalist or other deal-maker with the largest share in the syndicated investment. He usually initiates the deal, and takes a hands-on role on behalf of the other partners. Lemons and Plums: Bad deals and good. Bad investments usually go wrong before the good ones produce a profit: the lemons ripen before the plums. Leveraged buy-out: Similar to a management buy-out, though usually applied to US deals where the transaction will have been initiated by a financial group rather than the management. The name refers to the high level of borrowing which the company takes on, using the assets being purchased as leverage. When British buy-outs seemed to be going the way of their US counterparts, with large, highly speculative deals being put together by City financiers, the term started to be applied to UK buy-outs. Nowadays, the idea of high levels of leverage is a distant memory. Living dead: Companies which are just about trading profitably but are unlikely to do really well. A slightly dated term used about investments the deal-makers prefer to forget. Lock-out agreement: An agreement to give the buy-out team time to negotiate the purchase of their company free of pressure from other bidders. Management buy-in: An offshoot of the management buy-out industry. The purchase of a business by one or more outside managers with the help of a group of financial backers. The term was applied indiscriminately in the late 1980s to any bid involving a well-known City figure, on the grounds that a buy-in sounded more constructive than the hostile takeovers they usually were. Buy-ins are now seen as being considerably riskier than buy-outs, because they involve an outside management team which does not know the company as well. Many deals are neither pure buy-ins nor buy-outs but bimbos (qv). Management buy-out: The purchase of a business by its existing management with the help of a group of financial backers. The managers put up a relatively small amount of the total finance but usually gain a disproportionately large share of the equity. Buy-outs are funded largely by loans secured on the assets of the company itself. Mezzanine finance: Loans, usually unsecured, which rank after secured or senior debt but before equity in the event of the company failing. To compensate for the greater risk, they typically carry interest one to three percentage points above secured loans, and often carry an equity 'kicker' to give the lender a stake in the equity. Newco: The buy-out is usually carried out through a newly created company normally referred to as Newco. Preferred ordinary shares: Refers to the ordinary shares taken up by outside investors in a buy-out. They rank ahead of the plain ordinary shares owned by the management in terms of dividends and the pay-out in the event of a winding-up. Ratchet: An incentive arrangement whereby the managers get a bigger share of the equity if the venture performs well. Sometimes managers forfeit shares if they do particularly badly (see also Earn-out). Second-round financing: Sometimes needed to help buy-outs which have run short of funds. Or it may be a sign that the business has done well and is raising new money for further investments. Senior debt: Secured debt which ranks first in terms of repayments in the event of a default (See also: Junior debt). Slippage: This is what happens when the buy-out company starts to eat up more cash than expected, because development costs exceed budget or sales grow too slowly. Syndicated investment: An investment which is too large and risky to be handled by one investor and which needs to be shared among several partners. Fewer deals are syndicated in present market conditions; while syndicates also involve fewer participants. This is partly because the smaller deals do not require so many players; but it also means that, if trouble arises, fewer people have to be consulted to sort out the mess. Vendor finance: Finance provided by the vendor in the form of either a deferred payment or a retained minority stake in the bought-out company, usually in the form of loan notes. It allows the vendor to share in the profits of the company if it does well, and can also be used to boost the sale price, thereby impressing the vendor's shareholders. Venture capitalist: Deal-maker who provides funds and advice to entrepreneurs, either starting a business from scratch or staging a management buy-out.</p>

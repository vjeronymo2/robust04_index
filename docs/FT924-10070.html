			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / US and EC in last-ditch talks to end farm trade deadlock US AND European Community farm trade negotiators extended last-ditch discussions in Chicago yesterday aimed at settling a long-standing dispute over the EC's farm subsidy regime. Neither side would indicate whether a breakthrough was in sight but, after more than 10 hours of talks, which stretched into the night and forced US officials to cancel electioneering plans, hopes rose that progress was being made. At the outset of the talks between Mr Ed Madigan, the US agriculture secretary, and Mr Ray MacSharry, his EC counterpart, the EC reiterated that any deal would have to protect the reform of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) agreed in May. Mr Roger Runningen, the US agriculture department spokesman, said the fact that the talks had been extended was 'an indication that both sides are willing to go on to try and strike an agreement'. Although no substantially new proposals were put forward, both sides continued to exchange new formulas designed to place enforceable limits on the EC's subsidised oilseed production, which remains the thorniest issue separating the two sides. 'It could evolve into a framework but I'm not going to go that far,' Mr Runningen said. A senior EC negotiator said that, leaving aside agreement on oilseeds, 'we could settle the Uruguay Round in five minutes'. The farm trade impasse has for two years blocked progress towards agreement on the ambitious Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation. It has also threatened to boil over into outright trade war, with the US calling for sanctions against the EC for its oilseeds subsidy regime, which they say causes losses of Dollars 1bn a year for US oilseed farmers. US trade officials confirmed yesterday that punitive tariffs  - mostly aimed at France, Europe's leading farm exporter  - would be presented tomorrow at a meeting in Geneva of the council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) if no settlement is found in Chicago. met for more than three hours on Sunday, and had resumed on Monday morning. Contrary to original plans, talks continued into dinner, with the two farm representatives devoting almost all of that time to the controversial oil seeds dispute. The US has pressed the Europeans to reduce their subsidised oilseed output from more than 12m tonnes to 9m or less. Soyabean farmers want a further rollback to around 7.5m tonnes, and say the problem will remain so long as EC farmers receive subsidies that are dependent on planting new crops. The EC, which says its CAP reforms can cut output to 9.5m tonnes, insists that the US should not call for any further reforms than those assured under the CAP.</p>

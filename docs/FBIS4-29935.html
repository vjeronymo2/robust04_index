			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Telephone Message to South Korean `Prime Minister'" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- Kang Song-san, premier  of the DPRK Administration Council, sent a telephone message  today to South Korean "Prime Minister" Yi Yong-tok regarding a  preliminary contact for North-South top-level talks.    The message says:    It is a policy we have consistently maintained from long ago  to remove distrust and confrontation between the North and the  South and open a new phase of national reunification  independently and peacefully without dependence on outside  forces through top-level talks.    The acute situation prevailing in the country makes it all  the more urgent for both the North and the South to hold  top-level talks.    I think it lucky that at such a time your side expressed its  readiness to hold top-level talks with us. I have been  authorized to notify you that we welcome and agree to your  side's proposal to hold a preliminary contact for the  North-South top-level talks.    The holding of the top-level talks between the sides will be  a historical event bringing joy of national reconciliation and  unity to our 70 million fellow countrymen and giving a new hope  of peace and independent and peaceful reunification of the  country.    Our side will send a three-member delegation headed by an  official of vice-premier level and four suite members to your  side's portion of Panmunjom at 10:00 [0100 GMT] June 28  (Tuesday) in order to successfully arrange the North-South  top-level talks on which the concern and expectations of the  people at home and abroad are being focused.</p>

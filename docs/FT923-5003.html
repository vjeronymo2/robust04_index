			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind Senior's rise to Pounds 10m ACQUISITIONS formed the basis for progress at Senior Engineering Group in the half year to June 30. Pre-tax profits rose 14 per cent, from Pounds 8.77m to Pounds 10m, on sales of Pounds 158m (Pounds 142m). Mr Donald McFarlane, chairman, said: 'We have remained resilient within a recession engulfing the engineering industry because we have a group of businesses spread over different countries which can weather different economic cycles.' About 40 per cent of pre-tax profits are earned overseas. Flexonics, a US flexible hose and expansion-joint company acquired earlier this year and Nordklima, a German air handling manufacturer bought last year, were mainly responsible for the profit increase. Existing businesses reported small rises. Mr McFarlane said construction services companies, which supply ducting and ventilation systems to large projects, would produce good profits for the year, although slightly down from its record increase in 1991. The engineering products division, which makes rigid and flexible tubes, was hit by reduced demand. Sales in some areas declined by between 15 and 18 per cent. The group has acquired the trade and assets of Le Bas Tube, a steel-tube stockholder, for Pounds 350,000. Control engineering, established last year to refocus the former mining equipment companies, continued to suffer from the contraction of the UK coal industry. Thermal engineering companies produced better results in the US, offsetting reduced contributions from the UK power industry. Mr McFarlane said: 'We will continue to expand through selective acquisitions. Each one is planned with the precision of a rifle shot.' Borrowings stand at Pounds 8m, representing gearing of 8 per cent. Earnings per share, adjusted for the effects of the rights issue in February, were 3.07p (3.02p). The interim dividend is held at 1.2p.</p>

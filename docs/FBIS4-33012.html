			<p>BFN     [Text] Admiral Henrique Goulart Fortuna yesterday announced  his presidential candidacy for the PSC [Social Christian Party].  His platform should please the military, in light of his  proposal to increase federal budget allocations for the Armed  Forces from 2.7 percent to 5 percent.    The 60-year-old admiral served as commander of the War  College from 1991 until his retirement in 1993. He joined the  PSC in January with the intention of running for a federal  deputy seat. Because it has become impossible for the PSC to  nominate Senator Jose Sarney (Brazilian Democratic Movement  Party) as its presidential candidate, the PSC has decided to  promote Goulart Fortuna's candidacy.    Goulart Fortuna said: "The PSC national board has entrusted  me with this mission, and I have accepted."</p>

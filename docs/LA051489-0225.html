			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGIONAL BASEBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> RANCHO SANTIAGO PITCHERS FEEL CHIPPER;  </P> <P> HARD-WORKING NAVARRETTE STRIKES OUT NINE, BEATS ORANGE COAST  </P> <P> Much has been made about the number of innings Rancho Santiago College starting  pitchers Jack Bailey and Willie Navarrette have worked this season.  </P> <P> Both had pitched more than 130 innings before the Southern California Regional  playoffs started Thursday.  </P> <P> But at least for now, the Tired Theory can be put to rest. Saturday, Navarrette  pitched a complete-game seven-hitter to lead Rancho Santiago to a 2-1 victory  over Orange Coast in a second-round playoff game in front of about 350  spectators at Rancho Santiago.  </P> <P> Bailey pitched six strong innings as the Dons pounded East Los Angeles, 15-3,  in the first round Thursday.  </P> <P> Navarrette, who had pitched poorly in his past two starts, was working on eight  days rest Saturday and was sharp. He struck out nine and walked one.  </P> <P> The extra rest came because of the built-in four-day break between the end of  the conference season and the beginning of the playoffs.  </P> <P> "I wanted to come out here and prove I wasn't tired," said Navarrette, a  sophomore left-hander. "We didn't throw at all for four days, and I felt strong  after that."  </P> <P> Although OCC hit several balls hard, a second-inning home run by Scott Talanoa  accounted for the Pirates' only run. It was Talanoa's state-leading 17th home  run this season but also his last. The loss ends the season for OCC (31-11-1).  </P> <P> "We hit a lot of 'at-em' balls," OCC Coach Mike Mayne said. "We hit the ball  better than one run, but Willie did a good job. He's tough to score on."  </P> <P> It was the 18th home run Navarrette (11-4) has given up this season and the  seventh in his past three starts for Rancho Santiago (29-15).  </P> <P> "I throw the split finger (fastball) a lot, and when you make a mistake with  it, it just hangs there," Navarrette said. "What I can I say? I've been the  victim of the home-run ball this season."  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago will now advance to the double-elimination third round and play  Cypress at 11 a.m. at Rancho Santiago Friday.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago tied it, 1-1, in the third with some help from the OCC defense.  Joey Townsend lined a single into left center and went to second when OCC left  fielder Craig Nixon and center fielder Jason Young collided. Nixon was charged  with an error.  </P> <P> Louie Maldonado then bunted for a single.  </P> <P> With runners on first and third, Danny Ontiveros grounded into a double play,  but Townsend scored.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago got the final run on a solo home run by John McTaggart in the  fourth. OCC pitcher John Douris (7-4) had gotten ahead in the count, no balls  and two strikes. But after a ball, Douris got a pitch in the middle of the  plate, and McTaggart rammed it over the left-field wall for his 11th home run  of the season and second of the playoffs.  </P> <P> OCC's top three hitters -- Hector Santa Cruz, Nixon and Young -- had only one  hit among them in 16 at-bats. Young hit a two-out single in the eighth.  Navarrette then walked Talanoa on four pitches but got Marty Cordova to ground  into a force play to end the inning.  </P> <P> Navarrette hit Darrell Conner with one out in the ninth and fell behind  pinch-hitter Pete McKeller, three balls and no strikes, but came back to get a  strikeout. Mike Kelly then hit a fly ball into right-center field, but  Ontiveros made a sliding catch for the final out.  </P> <P> "Willie was close to coming out (in the ninth)," Rancho Santiago Coach Don  Sneddon said. "We had (Jack) Bailey ready. It would have been a real tough  decision but Willie hung in there like he has all season."  </P></p>

Addressing several thousand  delegates at the Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] special general  conference in Ulundi on Saturday [29 January], Mr Felgate said  the latest proposals were "a total insult to our intelligence".    The proposals were tabled on Thursday and observers believed  they may go some way to addressing the constitutional demands of  the Freedom Alliance, which includes the IFP. They are due to  come under discussion at extended bilateral talks in Pretoria on  Monday.    But, Mr Felagate was emphatic: "Negotiations will deliver  nothing to the IFP." He said while the latest ANC proposals  went some way in addressing a few IFP demands, they, however,  "put us in a worse position than we were the previous week". He  did not elaborate.    Ongoing negotiations with the government and ANC would not  deliver, said Mr Felgate, adding that should the IFP contest  elections, it would do so on an unfair footing. He came out  strongly aginst elections under the interim constitution and  urged delegates to take a final decision on the IFP's stance on  the April poll at the conference.    Earlier, while voicing his rejection of the April elections,  IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said the conference could  also decide to mandate the IFP Central Committee to take a final  decision later. Mr Felgate, however, said it would be a "fateful  error if the conference doesn't come to a conclusion simply  because there will be more 'bullshit' talked in Pretoria on  Monday".    The IFP's position on the April poll is expected to become  clearer on Sunday after debate during a closed session on  Saturday afternoon.</p>

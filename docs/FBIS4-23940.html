			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Barnaby Philips in Maputo] </F>   [Text] In Mozambique, the Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation  Front] government and the former Renamo [Mozambique National  Resistance] rebels have overcome a major obstacle to the holding  of elections in October. The two sides have been quarreling  over the size of the Frelimo army. The government declared  64,000 men in its forces, a figure that surprised both Renamo  and the UN peacekeeping mission, as they had been working under  the assumed figure of 76,000 men for Frelimo. Renamo cried foul  and accused the government of secretly withdrawing thousands of  soldiers from the current demobilization process. But, as  Barnaby Philips reports from Maputo, the two rivals have now  patched up their differences.    [Begin Philips recording] Last night Renamo signed an  agreement accepting that the government's army does in fact  number only 64,000 men. Renamo's grudging acceptance of the  downward-revised figure came with one condition, that they would  be no final confirmation of the government's military strength  until a further inspection has taken place in the near future,  but it seems the hurdle has been overcome much to the relief of  the United Nations.    In Maputo last week Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama said the  issue was worrying and serious and reminded him of the run-up to  Angola's ill-fated elections. The government has escaped only  with a degree of embarrassment about not appearing to know how  many soldiers it possesses. It is assumed that the  discrepancies in numbers were due to inefficiency and corruption  in the Ministry of Defense.    Meanwhile, attention is now focussed on the ongoing voter  registration process approaching its third week. All has not  gone smoothly. Registration teams complain of a lack of  transport. Many remote areas have still not been reached, but  across the country, Mozambicans are registering with enthusiasm.    Last week I traveled across the central Province of  Inhambane. In tiny villages long queues had built up outside  registration posts. One elderly man clutched his voter's card  with joy. I asked him who he was going to vote for? Politics  is like marriage, he told me. You stick with an old partner  even when times are bad. So, I will stay with Frelimo. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / People: Fraser to coax investors to Britain The Invest in Britain Bureau, now a separate division within the UK's department of trade and industry responsible for internationally marketing Britain as an investment opportunity, has created a new post of chief executive. Andy Fraser, 43, will be the first incumbent, as from July 4. Fraser's background is solidly within the world of international advertising. Born in Kuala Lumpur, since April 1992 he has been managing director of CDP Europe, the advertising agency now 43 per cent-owned by the Japanese agency Dentsu. Before that he was executive vice president and director of business development for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising worldwide. He spent 1976-80 in Thailand, where he was managing director for McCann-Erickson. A graduate of Sussex University, where his degree was in English and American studies, Fraser's first job in advertising was with Young and Rubicam, which he joined in 1972 in London. In the past financial year more than 300 foreign projects worth an estimated Pounds 1.3bn and generating more than 56,000 jobs have been attracted into the UK via the operations of the IBB, which is the UK government's main inward investment promotions agency. By tempting a well-paid and successful marketing executive from the private sector to take up this new post, the DTI appears to be signalling a determination to make the IBB, which was first set up in 1977, a more flourishing, outward-bound entity. Three core tasks await Fraser: furthering the cross-fertilisation between the DTI and business, both British and foreign; stimulating greater inward investment by a more vigorous marketing campaign which preaches the virtues of the UK's economic base; and establishing the IBB firmly in the minds of would-be investors as the first stop for advice and assistance. The current director of the IBB, Christopher Priston, who has been a civil servant since 1973 after working for Fisons, Courtaulds and others, will become deputy chief executive.</p>

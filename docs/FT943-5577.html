			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Mexico high-level drug claim denied The office of Mexico's attorney-general has dismissed allegations by one of its former high-ranking employees that senior government and party officials are involved with drug traffickers. Mr Eduardo Valle, until earlier this year a senior aide in the office, has alleged that a cabinet minister has links with the powerful Gulf of Mexico drug cartel. Mr Valle's accusations appear to be based on at least one meeting which the minister is known to have had with a 31-year-old Mexican woman. Some investigators see an involvement by Mr Juan Garca Abrego, one of the most powerful of Mexico's drug barons. Mr Valle, who resigned from the attorney-general's office after claiming that his efforts to investigate the cartel were being blocked by other police officials, has further alleged that the security team of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's presidential candidate who was assassinated this year, had been infiltrated by the Gulf cartel. Mr Valle believes that the cartel may have ordered the assassination. Mr Valle has also criticised the new attorney-general for appointing drug enforcement agents who, in Mr Valle's opinion, are protectors of drug traffickers. The attorney-general's office interviewed Mr Valle last week in Washington, where he is now living. It then stated there was a 'lack of evidence to determine any responsibility of public servants mentioned by Mr Eduardo Valle in whatever activity connected with the so-called Gulf Cartel.' It said there was no evidence to suggest Mr Colosio's security team had been infiltrated by drug traffickers. Mr Valle had been hired by Mr Jorge Carpizo, a former attorney-general and now the interior minister. Mr Valle is a former leftist student leader and politician, and officials have sought to discredit him as unreliable and possibly unstable. His accusations have generated wide publicity in Mexico's independent press but state-controlled radio and television have been instructed to keep him off the air. A prominent radio host was recently fired for interviewing Mr Valle.</p>

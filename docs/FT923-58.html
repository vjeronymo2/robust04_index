			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper smelters 'face stiff competition' COPPER SMELTERS face a difficult time in the second half of the 1990s because of substantial growth in solvent-extraction, electrowinning (SX-EW) technology which does away with the smelting process, suggests the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy group. 'The smelting industry may be faced with an unappetising choice between radical pruning or persistently poor market conditions,' said Mr Stephen Briggs, author of an MMRS report on the market for custom copper concentrates. The report suggests that in the next five years there will be an increase of more than 20 per cent in total mine production potential and smelter capacity growth. However, more than half of mine capacity growth will come from SX-EW operations. The near doubling of SX-EW's share of total mine capacity and the widespread desire of mining companies to have their own smelting capability will narrow the base of the custom mining sector even though the range of custom smelters will not diminish. 'If the copper market is to be balanced and concentrates (an intermediate material used to feed smelters) are to be available, primary smelter capacity utilisation rates will be forced to drop - and sharply so by the mid-1990s. This will have profound consequences for the custom concentrate market,' said Mr Briggs. Treatment charges for copper concentrates 'will be forced back in favour of miners over the next five years, either to choke off some of the growth in smelter capacity or to reflect increasingly tight concentrate supplies.'

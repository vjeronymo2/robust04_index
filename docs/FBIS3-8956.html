			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 15 (CTK) -- The former Slovak  opposition has decided on the complete composition of the new  Slovak government, premier-designate Jozef Moravcik said this  evening at the end of talks between representatives of the  parties which decided the fall of Meciar's cabinet. Tomorrow  morning Moravcik will hand President Michal Kovac a proposal for  the composition of the new government.    "However, we are expecting the deciding word from President  Kovac," Moravcik said, adding that he did not foresee any  problems, because the composition of the government had been  consulted with the president at intervals.    "Personnel changes are continuing in the ministries, the  committees are sitting which write off property, and  privatization (approved by Meciar's cabinet) is continuing,"  said Roman Kovac, leading representative of the Democratic Union  of Slovakia, and formerly deputy premier in Vladimir Meciar's  government until he (and Moravcik) resigned several weeks ago.    He said that this situation was "unbearable," and that when  President Kovac appointed the new government on Wednesday [16  March], its first interest would be to concern itself with the  situation and carefully look into the legality of these steps.    At the last session of Meciar's government, privatization  projects were approved for the Piestany spa and the prospering  Chemosvit Svit company, and the "privatization" of pharmacies  and other property continued, Kovac added.    Moravcik said that representatives of the parties which  decided on the fall of Meciar's cabinet and established the new  government had decided on an early election date for the end of  September and the beginning of October.    If the new coalition is unable to push through new elections  through a constitutional law, Moravcik said, it will try and  establish an autumn date through calling a referendum by  parliamentary decree.    Meciar is pressing for a June election date, which the  hitherto opposition has rejected. Negotiations between Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) leaders and those of the  Democratic Left Party (SDL, which has taken part in composing  the new government) took place today but without success.</p>

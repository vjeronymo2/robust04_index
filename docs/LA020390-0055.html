			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HISTORY VIEWED FROM HOSPITAL;  </P> <P> HORSE RACING: MICHELLE ARMSTRONG WILL HAVE TO WATCH TELEVISION FROM HER BED TO  SEE BILL SHOEMAKER'S FINAL RIDE.  </P> <P> The last time Michelle Armstrong saw Bill Shoemaker, she got his autograph.  </P> <P> Today, when Shoemaker, 58, appears at Santa Anita for the last ride of his  career, 15-year-old Michelle will see him again.  </P> <P> But she'll have to settle for watching television, which is carrying a delayed  showing of the Legend's Last Ride Handicap.  </P> <P> Michelle Armstrong is a patient at the City of Hope Hospital in Duarte, where  she underwent surgery two weeks ago for a bone-marrow transplant in her battle  with leukemia.  </P> <P> Michelle, who has a Peruvian Paso filly that was a gift from Stuart Hamblen,  the late singing cowboy, composer and trainer, has the same hope as Shoemaker.  They would both like to be successful trainers some day. Michelle has had that  ambition since she was 12.  </P> <P> Since Michelle learned she had cancer, she has been befriended by a wide  segment of the racing community.  </P> <P> She has gone to the Kentucky Derby twice and the Belmont Stakes. She has met  trainers Wayne Lukas, Charlie Whittingham and Louie Roussel, and jockeys Gary  Stevens and Eddie Delahoussaye.  </P> <P> She saw Stevens win the Kentucky Derby with Lukas' Winning Colors, watched  Whittingham's Derby victory with Sunday Silence and saw Delahoussaye win the  Belmont on Roussel's Risen Star.  </P> <P> At the Belmont, Michelle didn't know what to do, because she liked both Winning  Colors and Risen Star, having met their trainers and jockeys. She had her  mother, Karen, bet both horses. It's not a smart way to play the races, but  it's a way to satisfy your heart.  </P> <P> Roussel invited Michelle to the winner's circle after Risen Star's victory.  Roussel especially identified with Michelle because he had once suffered from  cancer.  </P> <P> Michelle will have mixed emotions about Shoemaker's last ride today, because  Stevens and Delahoussaye are also in the race.  </P> <P> Michelle, who lives in Klamath Falls, Ore., met Shoemaker at Portland Meadows  in December.  </P> <P> "He didn't say very much, but he was nice and autographed a poster and a sweat  shirt for me," Michelle said from her hospital bed this week.  </P> <P> Michelle found out a lot later than many people that Shoemaker is aptly called  Silent Shoe.  </P> <P> Karen Armstrong has written a poem in honor of Shoemaker's retirement:  </P> <P>  Of all the jockeys throughout time, there are really few  </P> <P>  Who stand out in racing history like the one they call the Shoe.  </P> <P>  When riding any of his mounts, he never asks too much;  </P> <P>  A jockey with such balance, and gentleness of touch.  </P> <P>  A career that spans six decades would be pretty hard to beat;  </P> <P>  It takes a really mighty man to accomplish such a feat!  </P> <P>  In February of 1990, the world will watch with pride  </P> <P>  As the great Shoe climbs up in the irons to make his final ride.  </P> <P>  The cheers for Willie Shoemaker will be ringing in our ears,  </P> <P>  And some will probably find it hard to stop the tears.  </P> <P>  So thanks for all the memories, Shoe . . . for each and every thrill.  </P> <P>  May God watch over and keep you safe, all America loves you, Bill!  </P> <P>  Both Cassie, her 13-year-old sister, and Booter, a 6-year-old brother, were  eligible to be Michelle Armstrong's donor for the transplant.  </P> <P> Cassie became the donor. After the surgery, she was asked if she felt sore.  </P> <P> "It feels like I've been riding on the bus all day," Cassie Armstrong said.  </P></p>

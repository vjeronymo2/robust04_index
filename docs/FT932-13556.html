			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (17): To make reforms you need money - Roger Matthews and Mark Nicholson interviewed President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo recently How much of a threat to the government and country do you consider the recent violence from extremists? From what I read in the western media, if I did not live here, I would say the country is collapsing. Look, the problem we have, I consider, is very normal. It is not a threat to the regime, as mentioned by the Iranians and their followers. The nature of the Egyptians is completely different from the Iranians. When I read the newspapers outside, I feel you are all living in another atmosphere. These bombings are happening everywhere. How many bombs occur in London in one week? It is something unusual in Egypt, which made all the media concentrate on it. But surely it is worse than it has been in the past? It is worse because these elements who are here - they use the word Islam but they have no idea about it - they are being pushed by some elements. These people were in Afghanistan. They were earning a lot of money there under the Mujahedeen. After that problem came to an end, some elements went to Pakistan, in Peshawar, where there is a collection of extremists from all countries who wanted to destabilise countries. They were persuaded by the Iranians now, and mainly the Iranians, who are giving them a small amount of money. They are pushing them to destabilise the regimes in their countries. Most of them returned from Afghanistan, from Pakistan, to Iran where they were briefed how to make problems, then to Sudan. From Sudan via Libya they started coming here. And the intelligence people here know them by name. They know their histories. We were watching them at that time. Then they started making explosions. At the beginning for us it was shocking. There has been some criticism about the vigour with which the security forces have been rooting out extremists. Do you think they have been heavy-handed? Not to that extent. The police will react and they have some criminals using machine guns against them. You are killing me. You are shooting me. You are throwing bombs against me. Do you think that the police will tell them 'hello' and give them a cup of tea and a gateau? The police at the beginning never used machine guns. But when several police were killed, they started being very conscious of defending themselves. But there is a big exaggeration about this. The extremists are much more violent than the police. Will it take long to reach another deal with the IMF and the World Bank? What progress do you expect to make on privatisation? They are discussing everything now, and I think there will be no problems. We are focusing our talks on privatisation with the World Bank. But you in Britain, did you make privatisation overnight? We are making privatisation on a gradual basis. Some argue that progress is too gradual. At the start, when we thought of privatisation, the people were furious. Because they are not used to this, they think that when this transfer of companies in the public sector to the private sector comes, they are going to lose jobs, they are going to lose money. When people have gone through the privatisation, the people will find that we are not bluffing them, and the acceleration will be much more. We have to consider the psychological aspect of the people, or we will face a setback. How important is it for the government to address the poorer areas and unemployment, as a potential breeding ground for extremism? When I took office I had lots of problems economically. We were just about to collapse. The economic problems were terrible. So we started a programme for reform, and it took a long time to convince the people. And I cannot solve all the problems at once. We have so many rural areas around Cairo, for example. And we made plans to modernise here, put in facilities and services for them, but it takes billions and billions of dollars. I have also insisted on putting factories in Upper Egypt - even though all the people in Upper Egypt want to make factories in Lower Egypt - in Alexandria and near Cairo. I am pushing them. I am making new cities in the desert in Upper Egypt. It's the best way of making sure they have some advantages, to make the factories there. In the past 10 years we have built 2m flats. These flats were not built in the previous 30 years, 40 years. We are doing the maximum. Telephones - when I took office we had only half a million lines, three hundred thousand of them were dead. If you wanted to telephone from Heliopolis to Cairo, it was quicker to get in a car, or walk. In the past 10 years we've made 2.5m lines. From anywhere in Egypt you can contact Japan, the United States, Saudi Arabia. Roads? We've built 30,000km, paved 15,000km. I'm just telling you about the problems we've met and what it cost us to solve them. I can't go through every affected area - electricity, communications, infrastructure, sewage . . . It's cost us money. To make reforms you need money. Our revenues are limited. If we had money, we could have done it before. What political lessons did you learn from the recent Algerian experience? I was expecting it before it took place. I was following the news all over the world, every day. I spoke with the former president of Algeria a year before the crisis took place, and I told him that religious problems in our part of the world are dangerous, so be careful. And I was advising him very sincerely, because I was watching everything that was happening there. Do you know what he told me? The FIS should be active. I cannot do anything. Either full democracy, full freedom, or nothing. I didn't speak any more words with him. One week before the crisis took place I was in the bookfair at a seminar. One of the journalists asked me: what do you expect in Algiers? I smelt that something was going to happen. But believe me, this will not last long. I don't think these elements will take over. The Algerians are very tough and they are trying to defeat all these things in the country, but it will take some time. There is no comparison between what happened in Algeria and in Egypt. Never think of comparing that. We have completely different characters, different thinking, completely different people. How long do you think it will take to eradicate the problem in Egypt? The problems we have here? A couple of months. We hope, I hope. You have taken steps since becoming president to liberalise political life here, with political parties and elections. Are you planning greater steps along that road? I made one step for the professional associations, to increase the base of elections. They became furious. The small groups, the religious groups in these associations. We started this law because so many university professors were criticising the law that was giving the rights to these small groups to speak in the name of thousands and thousands in the associations. Their association has 140,000 members, but those who vote for the election of the chairman? Three or four thousand. It is impossible, and these professors were furious. For me it was astonishing. I told them, do you want the government to do something for you? Why don't you go for your elections? If you want anything, the government is not going to do anything. You go to the parliament. They made a proposal to the parliament. Elections need 50 per cent turnout in the first round, then 33 per cent for the next round. It's a democratic law. Some people have called it repressive. Repressive? We would like the representatives to represent the majority. Democracy is the rule of the majority. It's not the rule of the minority. Do you have any intention of naming a vice president? First, naming the vice president does not mean he is going to be elected as president. Leave the people to say who will be the next president, not me. If I could find a figure, a political figure. It is very difficult to find the person. If I could find someone to fit the job of vice president I would be very pleased to name somebody else to help me. The problem is, we have so many good people, but the vice-president needs special qualifications. When I find somebody with these qualifications I'd love him to take the job. What would be the qualities necessary for someone to be a suitable candidate for vice president? Sincere. A hard worker. To have a conception of democracy, and not say, whenever anything happens, 'Oh, we'll put them in jail' - which is the easy way. Someone who is patient.</p>

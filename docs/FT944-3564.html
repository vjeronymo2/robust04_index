			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / PO and union clash over strike impact Post Office managers and the postal workers' union clashed last night about the impact of yesterday's 24-hour strike, which shut more than 100 main offices. Managers said the walkout was a complete flop, saying only 800 workers joined in. The Union of Communication Workers said the response was tremendous and accused the Post Office of using managers and casual workers to cover for strikers. The strike was in protest at the closure of hundreds of main offices since 1989 and their transfer to franchised stores or supermarkets. The union said yesterday that franchised post offices made more mistakes than the main offices they replaced. The UCW said a leaked document covering south-east London showed cash accounting mistakes in a franchised post office in the three months to July were 78 per cent worse than the Post Office's target. Mr Alan Johnson, general secretary of the UCW, said: 'It is ridiculous for the Post Office to claim that by shunting our post offices into the back of supermarkets, service is improved. They are misleading the public and their own documents prove it.' The union said it had overwhelming public support for the strike and for the campaign to halt closures. According to the UCW 95 per cent of those who voted to strike did not work yesterday, with the action hitting London, Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool, parts of Wales and Cornwall. The Post Office said 647 of the country's 764 main offices were open. It added that the number of main offices was almost exactly the same as four years ago, with those moving to retail outlets frequently opening longer and having better access. The union has complained about 'back-door privatisation'. It says half of the country's main post offices have closed since 1989. Mr Johnson said: 'Hundreds more will close by 1999 unless the rot is stopped. We are demanding a complete halt to all closures from today.' Collections and deliveries of Christmas post were not hit by the industrial action, which the union is threatening to repeat in the new year.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> THE GUARNERI'S 'HIGH FIDELITY';  </P> <P> ACADEMY AWARD WINNER ALLAN MILLER EXPLORES ON FILM THE 26-YEAR-OLD RELATIONSHIP  OF THE SUCCESSFUL STRING QUARTET  </P> <P> How have four top musicians managed to perform, tour and negotiate constantly  with one another for 26 consecutive years without sacrificing their  individuality or their ensemble?  </P> <P> So asks Allan Miller's film, "High Fidelity -- The Adventures of the Guarneri  String Quartet," opening at Laemmle's Monica on Wednesday for two weeks. The  85-minute documentary, which unfolds to music of Haydn, Schubert, Mozart and  others, has as much to say about relationships as it does about music.  </P> <P> From the film's opening moments on, violinists Arnold Steinhardt and John  Dalley, violist Michael Tree and cellist David Soyer show their personalities  as well as their musical prowess. In rehearsals as well as at rest, their  interaction lets the audience know both how much they respect one another and  how often they are exasperated by one another; what they don't say is often as  interesting as what they do say.  </P> <P> "There are innumerable relationships in a quartet -- each person with each  other person, two against two, three against one -- and they all switch all the  time," says Miller, an Oscar-winning filmmaker who is co-artistic director of  Symphony Space theater here. "The '60s motto was 'Let it all hang out,' and you  can't let it all hang out in the string quartet. There are certain boundaries  as to what you dare say to the other person if you want to preserve the  relationship.  </P> <P> "Although it has a musical setting, this film is about people whose  relationships are familiar to all of us. Husbands and wives, lovers, business  partners or teammates always have to be careful that they're not totally open  with each other. We're all looking for closeness, but sometimes that closeness  contains ingredients that might merely provoke distance."  </P> <P> Those sorts of issues intrigue Miller, who had been analyzing the musical  process on film as far back as "The Bolero," his Oscar-winning 1974 short  subject about Zubin Mehta and the Los Angeles Philharmonic preparing to perform  Ravel's "Bolero." His films highlight the human side of his subjects, and his  ideal audience is clearly one packed with both proven and potential music  lovers.  </P> <P> It doesn't hurt that among the hundreds of chamber groups around the country,  few are so film-worthy as the New York-based Guarneri. Not only is it the  oldest quartet around with the same personnel throughout its history, but its  members are both articulate and engaging. The quartet has been the subject of  three books and several radio and TV shows; it has even been referred to in the  Wall Street Journal as "the Grateful Dead of the classical music world."  </P> <P> Miller, 57, had wanted to do a film about a string quartet for many years when,  in 1986, his longtime producer Walter Scheuer indicated that funding for such a  film would be available. The Guarneri agreed -- Scheuer says the negotiations  lasted maybe 12 minutes -- and Miller's camera crew started trailing the  quartet on stage and off, into the recording studio and to receptions, on  planes and at the breakfast table.  </P> <P> Shot during the Guarneri's 1987-88 season, "High Fidelity" tracks the musicians  getting into cabs, receiving medals and tending their gardens. The film begins  in Baden-Baden, Germany -- where we even get to listen in as they read a  contract aloud -- and stops everywhere from a lawn party in Tampa, Fla., to an  autograph session in Prague.  </P> <P> There are some very candid moments in the film, particularly a sequence shot on  an airplane where violist Tree almost pleads with violinist Steinhardt for more  chances to play violin. Tree concedes that such segments later felt "slightly  embarrassing" but says he and his colleagues found nothing objectionable in the  film.  </P> <P> Then again, continued negotiation is fairly routine for chamber groups. A few  years ago, Chamber Music America published a monograph called "Can This  Marriage Be Saved?" Its authors, Janice Papolos and Howard Herring, surveyed  chamber groups and found, among other things, an "extremely high attrition  rate" even for very successful groups. The reason: "Most groups founder and  fall apart simply because the members can no longer live with each other."  </P> <P> The Guarneri musicians are clearly an exception. Three of the four men met as  students at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia and even lived in the  </P> <P> same boarding house for a while. Cellist David Soyer, who was already  performing professionally, caught up with them at the 1962 Marlboro Festival.  </P> <P> In 1964, the four men formed the Guarneri Quartet. Each still teaches, performs  and records without his Guarneri colleagues, and all have successful individual  careers as well.  </P> <P> "High Fidelity" opens here more than a year after its New York debut, and  Miller says only that the delay "had to do with negotiations for the right  location." After New York, where it received very good reviews, the film played  30 to 35 other cities around the country, including Chicago and Washington.  </P> <P> The film reunites the directing and producing team of "From Mao to Mozart:  Isaac Stern in China," which won an Oscar in 1981. Although he did not receive  director credit, Miller reviewed footage shot in China and worked with editor  Tom Haneke for almost a year condensing more than 200,000 feet of film into  "Mao to Mozart's" 84 minutes. Haneke also edited "High Fidelity."  </P> <P> Neither film has made any money for its producers, says arts patron Scheuer, a  businessman whose family's Four Oaks Foundation funded these and several other  film projects. But 11 years after "Mao to Mozart" was made, Scheuer says,  "hardly a week goes by that it isn't playing somewhere in France or  Switzerland, or at a benefit." Scheuer says the film has made "in excess of  $150,000" for Carnegie Hall, its predetermined profit recipient, and "another  $100,000" at fund-raisers for music conservatories in the United States and  Europe.  </P> <P> Guarneri manager Harry Beall says "High Fidelity" hasn't led to a booking  bonanza -- he says the quartet limits itself to 100 dates worldwide each year  anyway -- but that film too has been shown at conservatories and music schools  since its debut in summer, 1989. And Tree says one New York public relations  firm even showed it to key executives to illustrate effective group dynamics.  </P> <P> The Guarneri project also sparked a new and unrelated film on last year's  Czechoslovakian revolution. Writer Marie Winn, who has translated Vaclav  Havel's plays into English, is also Miller's wife and accompanied him and the  Guarneri to Prague in 1987. There she had a secret interview with Havel, Miller  says, adding that the tape of the interview was smuggled out in an instrument  case marked "Guarneri rehearsal."  </P> <P> Miller, Winn and Scheuer went back to Prague in December, 1989, a month after  the November revolution, "when things were already fairly well settled, but  still fluid" and started filming. They have made several trips since then,  filming both in Prague and around the country, as well as acquiring material  from Czech TV and underground film sources. Miller expects the film to be  finished this spring, but says events keep changing the total picture so  quickly, "the film will probably end with a question mark rather than with any  conclusive point of view."  </P> <P> The resulting film, which may be destined for either theaters or TV, will be a  personal study of five or six university students who participated in the  revolution, weaving in their pre-revolutionary lives. Tentatively titled  "Children of the Revolution," it also reflects Miller's continuing interest "in  the personal relationships of people who are working together as part of an  important group or are involved in important events together. Those are the  things which are universal -- they cross national and generational boundaries."  </P> <P> Still to come is a film about a conductor. Miller, who has an M.A. in music  from Harvard, studied conducting with Hermann Scherchen in Europe and has  worked as a free-lance conductor. He's now co-writing a screenplay for a  feature film about a conductor, he says, and has long wanted "to explore the  conductor's psychic motivation, leadership, need and total unchallenged ability  to govern, manipulate and manage so many forces."  </P> <P> Such European countries as England, France and Germany have long produced more  programs for TV about the musical process and musicians, says Miller, who has  made many documentaries for public television. "We don't do that very much in  this country. We're interested in talk shows, where we get to meet stars of  various fields in their rather stagy moments of friendliness with the  interviewer, plugging a book or a movie.  </P> <P> "But we in this country have very little contact with performers in their  'day-to-day' lives, and in their professional struggles. Most of that is  private, but some of it is not. And the part that is not offers a marvelous  avenue into not only their lives but their art."  </P></p>

Ljubodrag Stojadinovic warned  on Sunday.    Col. Stojadinovic said on a Hungarian radio programme that  the Bosnian Serbs had no reason why to join the "inconceivable  Croat-Muslim federation," which the V.J. spokesman said would  not last long.    Col. Stojadinovic said that the setting up of the federation  would mark a step backwards, that is, a return to how things  were when war broke out in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The war broke out in 1992 after the Muslim-Croat coalition  took a decision on the forcible secession of Bosnia-Herzegovina  from the then Yugoslav Federation against the wishes of the  Bosnian Serbs and contrary to the republican Constitution which  specified that all vital decisions required the consensus of all  three peoples in the republic.    The Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina proclaimed the Serb Republic  (R.S.) in 1992 on their historical and ethnic territories.    Col. Stojadinovic said that it was the duty of the V.J. to  defend the territory and air space of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia and, at the same time, carefully to follow what was  taking place in the immediate neighbourhood, particularly where  the Serb people lives.    The spokesman said that the V.J. expected the crisis in  Bosnia- Herzegovina to be resolved peacefully, but was ready for  the worst, although it felt that the R.S. and neighbouring  republic of Serb Krajina (RSK), the Serb state within the  administrative boundaries of the former Yugoslav Republic of  Croatia, could alone defend themselves.    Col. Stojadinovic repeated the official V.J. statement that  the four planes downed over Bosnia-Herzegovina early in the week  were not part of its air force and that no V.J. pilots were at  the time in the area where NATO fighter-bombers had taken action.    The incident is quite mysterious, since it occurred in an  area where the Bosnia Muslims and Croats are engaged in mutual  fighting, Col. Stojadinovic said. He said that NATO  representatives should provide the answer to the question whose  the downed planes were.    Col. Stojadinovic said there would be no danger if the  airfield near Tuzla, in north-eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, was to  be used strictly for humanitarian purposes, but specified that  there would be a real danger if the airfield was to be opened by  force.    The Bosnian Serbs and Russia reached an agreement in the  middle of the week for Russian observers to check all deliveries  arriving at the Muslim-held airfield near Tuzla.    The Serb side has insisted on the control of the air  deliveries out of fear that the airfield could be used for  illegal munitions shipments to the Bosnian Muslims.</p>

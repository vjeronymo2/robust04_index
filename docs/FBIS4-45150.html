			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Viola Herms Drath: "A Matter of Survival"] </F>   [Text] President Bill Clinton's foreign policy continues  to be somewhat vague. The non-proliferation of nuclear mass  destruction weapons, which Washington has put at the center of  its foreign policy, is increasingly ill-fated. The failed  attempt to make North Korea rejoin the NPT [Non-Proliferation  Treaty] and to include India and Pakistan in a regional  conference emphasizes the lack of concept that the current  disarmament policy suffers from.    This was expressed, amongst others, by India's Prime  Minister  Rao during his visit to Washington, when he criticized that  moral leadership is claimed by those who demand from others what  they themselves are not prepared to do.    Although the U.S. Administration is calling on the nuclear  have-nots to join a discriminating non-proliferation regime, it  is by no means planning to scrap the United States' nuclear  weapons altogether. The Geneva UN Disarmament Conference may be  seeing preliminary talks on the renunciation of the use of  nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states; however, talks on  extending the nuclear deterrent in the sense of Klaus Kinkel's  non-proliferation policy failed because the nuclear states  rejected an expansion of multilateral defense obligations.    Bilateral talks are no longer about arms testing but "only"  about deploying operative arms systems. Clinton's advisers know  very well that a nuclear condominium in South Asia and the Far  East makes non-proliferation more difficult. However, sobered  by the experience in Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti, the Pentagon is  preparing a counter proliferation initiative -- although  modestly funded at a mere $450 million -- in case the  non-proliferation talks fail. Just as Reagan's Strategic  Defense Initiative was to protect the United States from a  strategic first blow, Clinton's program of Counter Proliferation  is taking a unilateral course of its own. According to a few  critical voices in the U.S. Congress, this could lead to an  unpredictable nuclear race, as a result of which the world would  face more than the 15 states that are known as possessing  nuclear weapons today.    The annual meeting of the UN Disarmament Commission in New  York was aiming at a clear signal toward an unconditional and  unlimited extension of the NPT in April 1995. But instead,  reaching a consensus was prevented because there was no clear  definition of the objectives of disarmament. This gives rise to  the question whether the current non proliferation regime is fit  to survive. Although the nuclear states basically share the  view of non-nuclear states that non-proliferation is inseparably  linked with nuclear disarmament, the codifying of an  international agreement to eliminate nuclear weapons arsenals,  which has been demanded by several states, and the direct  coupling to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons still fail to  take place.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hoare Govett trusts merge and seek Pounds 25m The two Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index investment trusts are to merge and raise up to Pounds 25m through a conversion share issue. The moves will create a single trust with assets of about Pounds 95m. The merger is based on the argument that a larger portfolio would lead to more consistent investment performance in line with both trusts' aim of matching the Extended HGSC Index (excluding investment trusts). Lower administrative costs and greater liquidity in the shares are also expected. Participation in the C share issue is limited to existing shareholders. Commitments have already been received for 20.8m C shares at 125p. The arrangements are likely to be approved at the annual meeting of the first trust on March 23, as the merger offer has already been accepted by holders of 82 per cent of the second trust's shares.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Network of after-school clubs to be launched THE GOVERNMENT is expected next week to announce funding for a national network of children's after-school clubs and holiday playschemes to be run through the Training and Enterprise Councils. The move will be the first to be made by Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, in her role as cabinet minister with responsibility for women's issues. The policy will be aimed partly at countering criticism from the Equal Opportunities Commission and other groups that the government has failed to provide an overall childcare strategy and that out-of-school provision remains patchy and inadequate. The idea of funding the initiative through the 82 employer-led Tecs would be to draw in private sector finance. Most employers would find it impractical to run schemes themselves but may want to buy places in local after-school clubs and holiday playschemes. About 20 per cent of children of primary-school age are estimated to be 'latchkey' children, according to Kids Clubs Network, the voluntary group which campaigns for after-school provision. Ms Tess Woodcraft, Kids Clubs Network director, said there were between 400 and 500 after-school clubs in the UK, mostly run by parents on 'very tiny grants'.</p>

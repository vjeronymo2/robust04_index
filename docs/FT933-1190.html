			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (32): Success brings problems - South-East Asia / Victor Mallet doubts whether the world's healthiest economic region, performing robustly this year, can still take exports for granted as the engine of its progress LAMBASTED FOR the failure of their lending programmes in Africa, World Bank and IMF officials have an understandable habit of pointing to their present and former proteges in Asia and saying: in the right conditions, the recipe works. South-east Asia, already a byword for export-led economic growth, is performing robustly this year, in spite of the sluggish state of the region's main export markets in Europe, Japan and the US. Exports continue to increase, and debt service ratios are falling. The Asian Development Bank estimates south-east Asian debt service, as a proportion of exports, will decline to 11 per cent in 1994 from 13.3 per cent this year and 15 per cent in 1992. At the start of the decade the figure was 18.5 per cent. Growth is strong, too. Excluding China and Japan, average real gross domestic product (GDP) growth across Asia is expected to rise from 5.2 per cent in 1992 to 6 per cent this year and 6.8 per cent in 1994, according to a forecast from Merrill Lynch. The Philippines, suffering from chronic electricity shortages, is a dismal exception to the generally rosy picture, and is expected to grow by only about 2 per cent in 1993. Part of the resilience of these economies in the present global economic climate can be explained by the increase of trade within Asia, especially with China. South-east Asian countries have also become important markets in their own right, and the growth of some economies owes more to the state of the domestic market than to the performance of exports. Thailand, for example, is now a bigger market for new cars than Australia. 'In the second half of the 1980s, a third of growth was due to exports,' says Mr Narongchai Akrasanee, who heads Thailand's General Finance group. 'Now it's one tenth.' Having long ago embraced the basic tenets of capitalism and actively encouraged inward foreign investment, south-east Asian economies are becoming increasingly sophisticated. As they do so, the World Bank becomes more important as an adviser than as a lender. Local capital markets have grown rapidly and become more complex, and Thailand and Malaysia have recently established commissions to regulate the securities industry. Outward investment - with China and IndoChina as the main targets - has also become a regional phenomenon; the Singapore government, for instance, encourages its emerging multinationals to invest overseas as a way of diversifying the country's sources of income. Thailand's Charoen Pokphand group is one of the largest foreign investors in China and has stakes there in everything from motorcycle factories to feedmills. South-east Asia's dazzling GDP growth rates, however, are accompanied by several serious problems and challenges which have yet to be addressed in most of the countries concerned. Some of these worries are simply the result of competition for investment and trade from countries a few rungs lower on the economic ladder. Officials in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are concerned about falling foreign investment, which they blame on competing demands for funds from China and Vietnam. Apart from its enormous and attractive domestic market, China offers a plentiful supply of cheap if relatively unskilled workers. In Malaysia, labourers and skilled workers are in short supply and wages are rising fast; in Thailand, too, wages are rising more quickly than productivity. Ceaseless export growth can therefore no longer be taken for granted as the engine of economic progress in south-east Asia. The value of Thai exports in the first half of this year rose only 10.6 per cent over the same period in 1992, well below official predictions. A fall in agricultural exports such as rice and tapioca is partly to blame - electronics exports are still rising - but economists are now making more modest predictions for future Thai export growth. As Asian exports of various products increase year by year from the insignificant to the substantial, they typically encounter greater resistance and protectionism from the governments, industries and trade unions of importing countries, and thus become the victims of their own success - a success often based, it must be said, on the exploitation of cheap and under-age labour, unsafe factories and a willingness to violate intellectual property rights. Success creates other problems, too. Asian countries are carrying out an industrial revolution - which took decades in Europe and America - in a matter of years. From Manila and Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok, infrastructure is creaking under the strain. Power shortages have become widespread. It can be difficult to have a telephone installed and then difficult to make calls. Traffic jams are the bane of the region's capitals. Economic success has brought pollution and other environmental damage. The economic effects of infrastructure bottlenecks are hard to gauge. On the one hand, industrial investors are deterred by clogged transport and communications networks. On the other, such problems are common throughout the region; and the need for everything, from roads and sewage farms to better universities, creates business opportunities and further accelerates economic activity when construction begins. Throughout south-east Asia - with the exception of Singapore - governments are also accused of failing to invest in the secondary and tertiary education that will be vital for the region's economies in the years ahead. Nor has the new-found wealth been evenly spread. Asia's nouveaux riches pay little tax, and the rich have usually been getting richer much faster than the poor - a tendency forgotten in times of generalised prosperity, but one which may cause political instability in a recession. South-east Asia's industrialisation has depended on a marriage between cheap local labour and the money and technology of Japan and the West. As wages rise and investors turn to China, the Thais, Malaysians, Indonesians and Filipinos are beginning to ask themselves what they have to offer that cannot be found elsewhere. They have land and they have growing domestic markets, but pollution and congestion in big cities are making life grimmer for Asia's burgeoning middle class. Above all, schools and colleges are not teaching the skills that business and industry say they need. Such problems will have to be solved if the spectacular economic growth of the last decade is to be sustained into the next millennium.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  DEVELOPING ASIA: SELECTED INDICATORS*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      1990   1991   1992   1993**  1994**  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gross domestic product                         Annual % change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Deveoping Asia                        5.9    6.1    7.0    7.2     7.4 Newly industrialising economies       6.9    7.3    5.3    6.2     6.7 PRC and Mongolia                      3.9    7.5   12.8   11.0    10.0 South-east Asia                       7.7    6.3    5.8    6.5     7.1 South Asia                            5.2    2.1    4.7    5.3     6.0 Pacific Islands                      -0.4    6.3    6.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Inflation                                      % change in CPI  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Developing Asia                       7.1    8.4    6.7    6.9     6.4 Newly industrialising economies       7.0    7.6    5.9    5.4     4.9 PRC and Mongolia                      1.3    5.1    6.4    9.0     8.5 South-east Asia                       7.3    8.8    5.3    5.6     6.4 South Asia                           12.7   13.3    9.7    8.2     6.5 Pacific islands                       7.4    7.1    5.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Current account                                  Dollars bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Developing Asia                      -6.2   -5.2   -8.9  -13.4   -19.2 Newly industrialising economies      10.8    6.8    5.8    6.0     5.6 PRC and Mongolia                     11.4   13.7   10.4    5.7    -0.4 South-east Asia                     -14.9  -17.4  -14.2  -14.6   -14.3 South Asia                          -13.3   -8.0  -10.7  -10.5   -10.0 Pacific islands                      -0.1   -0.3   -0.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Debt-service ratio                     % of goods and services exports  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Developing Asia                      16.0   13.9   14.1   13.1   11.3 Newly industrialising economies      10.7    7.1   10.9   10.3    6.8 PRC and Mongolia                     11.6   12.0   11.0   10.5   10.0 South-east Asia                      18.5   15.5   15.0   13.3   11.0 South Asia                           26.0   26.0   23.7   23.5   24.6 Pacific islands                      24.8   17.9   11.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Computation of averages excludes Mongolia, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Vietnam, Bhutan and Myanmar; ** Estimates  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: AD  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

The shooting died  down later and only sporadic gunfire was to be heard in the  morning.    The violence broke out when forces loyal to opposition  leader  Bernard Kolelas launched an incursion into the Diata area, a  sector of the Makele-Kele district, which is controlled by  supporters of President Pascal Lissouba, the sources said. The  militiamen were driven back by government troops, they said, but  there were no details of casualties.    Opposition spokesman Laurent Mann gave no reason for the  sudden renewal of clashes after more than a week of calm in  Makele-Kele and Bacongo, an opposition stronghold. He said that  government forces deployed heavy weapons in Diata and aimed  shells at Bacongo. "We don't yet know how much damage the firing  has caused," he added.    Clashes between armed opposition militiamen and government  forces have killed 110 people in Brazzaville since the beginning  of December, according to hospital staff.</p>

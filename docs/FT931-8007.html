			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / US wants better deal on procurement bids EUROPEAN companies have significantly easier access to procurement contracts in the US, according to a leaked US document that could trigger a US-EC war of numbers in the battle to open up respective government procurement markets. In a document from the office of the US trade representative, the US claims bidding opportunities worth Dollars 16.8bn (Pounds 11.8bn) were offered to EC contractors under the Government Procurement Code in 1990, compared with Dollars 7.8bn in EC contracts open to US operators. The document, which highlights a wide difference between the two sides' view of what amounts to fair access, argues that procurement contracts worth a total of more than Dollars 150bn a year are open to bids from EC companies 'without any restriction'. It says that in telecommunications, foreign companies won 54 per cent of the market last year for central office telephone switches, with the EC accounting for 13 per cent - while US companies sell no switches at all in France, Germany, Belgium, Greece and Denmark and less than 5 per cent of the switches in the UK, and supply Spain, Italy and the Netherlands only through joint ventures. The document was tabled during EC-US negotiations in Washington last week aimed at settling the clash over public procurement which flared last month. The new US administration threatened to bar European companies from bidding for federal contracts in the US unless European procurement rules favouring local manufacturers were dismantled by March 22. EC negotiators said in Washington at the end of the talks that a possible solution to the dispute had been found based on 'comparable, effective and lasting access' to each other's markets. However, the leaked document illustrates that the US and the EC retain significantly different views on comparable or effective access. EC officials admitted last week that there were obstacles in the way of US companies bidding for procurement contracts in the EC. But they insisted that systemic differences made it difficult for US officials to recognise the obstacles foreign companies faced in bidding for US similar US contracts. The US document challenges EC claims that 'Buy America' laws bar EC bidders from the US market, insisting that Buy America legislation affects 'less than Dollars 15bn of procurement' - compared with 'over Dollars 50bn' of contracts affected by the EC's own 'Buy Local' laws. In a direct challenge to EC claims that the vertical integration of AT&amp;T, the leading US telecommunications group, in effect bars EC companies from bidding for business, a senior US trade official noted that regional US telecommunications groups bought more equipment from Canada's Northern Telecommunications than they did from AT&amp;T - which accounted for just 8 per cent of total US demand for switching equipment. 'The US market is completely open. All of our firms are private and do not discriminate in favour of national suppliers,' the document claims. It notes that in spite of the extreme competitiveness of US-made steam turbine power generators, the US has never sold a steam turbine in the EC, and no large transformer since 1983. By contrast, the US market is 'largely open', the document says.</p>

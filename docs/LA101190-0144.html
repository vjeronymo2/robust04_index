			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.B. STUDYING HOW TO STUDY DISNEY PLAN;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: THORNY ISSUES ARISE ON FORMATION OF COMMITTEE THAT IS TO DISCUSS  SIZE AND SHAPE OF PROPOSED $2-BILLION THEME PARK.  </P> <P> A plan that would guarantee local residents a voice in the Walt Disney Co.'s  contentious proposal to build a $2-billion theme park downtown arrived at City  Hall this week with brakes screeching.  </P> <P> So thorny are the issues surrounding the mammoth park plan that the city has  decided it needs two months -- not to study the size and shape of the park, but  to study the size and shape of the citizens committee that will study the size  and shape of the park.  </P> <P> "It'll be like herding grasshoppers if it gets too big," Long Beach businessman  Lloyd Ikerd told the Harbor Liaison Committee, which began to tackle the issue  of citizen input Tuesday afternoon.  </P> <P> How many citizens is too many? Should they be allowed to look at records?  Should they be allowed to sit at the table? Should the neighborhoods closest to  the proposed park have a greater say on the committee than the ones, say, on  the north end of town? If so, is Long Beach headed for a war between its north  and its south?  </P> <P> Ever since Disney unveiled its ambitious ideas for Port Disney on July 31,  citizens have been organizing to ensure that they have a say in a project that  could draw 13 million tourists yearly and change their town's very character.  </P> <P> A few residents promptly put together a proposal to put a citizen  representative on the team of Long Beach negotiators, and the idea was promptly  trounced by other citizens who decided one resident could not be trusted to  represent the conflicting wants of some 50 neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Some neighborhood division is almost certain considering that a few parts of  town stand to suffer the most from traffic and congestion the resort could  cause, while other parts of town could enjoy the vast tax profits without ever  bumping into a Disney tourist.  </P> <P> Then Councilman Tom Clark came up with an idea for a committee made up of nine  residents -- one appointed by each councilman -- 10 members nominated by  recognized community groups and two appointed by Mayor Ernie Kell.  </P> <P> That was sent to the Harbor Liaison Committee for study, which voted  unanimously on Tuesday in favor of still more study, sending the idea to the  city staff for a thorough going-over. City leaders hope to have some sort of  proposal in front of the full City Council by January.  </P> <P> "The wheels of justice move very slowly," attorney Randolph Linehan, who spoke  out in favor of a citizen group, said afterward.  </P> <P> City Councilman Wallace Edgerton contends there is no hurry to form a  committee, since it could be a year before Disney and Long Beach even decide  they want to be partners. Disney has also approached Anaheim with a similar  deal.  </P> <P> But Clark was pushing to get the committee up and running, lest the citizens  feel left out. Already, he noted, the city and Disney have begun hiring  consultants and preparing for negotiations that could begin within several  weeks, although no date is set.  </P> <P> Moderation won out. When the city staff asked for one month to look over the  plan, Edgerton offered two.  </P> <P> "The potential I am seeing out there for naysayers is significant," he said,  noting that a little caution now could save a lawsuit later.  </P> <P> The report is due back Dec. 10.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> On July 31, the Walt Disney Co. presented a master plan for Port Disney, a  beachside resort and hotel complex in Long Beach. The city and Disney are now  preparing to negotiate the terms of building the $2-billion project, a process  that could take years to iron out. Despite the detailed sketches drawn up by  Disney, the company has made no promises to build the resort, and could opt to  put its fortune into a separate theme park near Disneyland in Anaheim.  </P></p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Varig offers board seats for aid Varig, Latin America's largest airline, has proposed offering board seats to McDonnell Douglas and General Electric in return for their help with its financial restructuring. The Brazilian carrier said it had signed letters of intent with the two US companies to restructure its payments to Eximbank of the US for aircraft. Varig owes Eximbank more than Dollars 600m. A single board seat will also be given to Varig's Brazilian creditor banks and one more will be decided by Varig, McDonnell Douglas and General Electric. The other five board seats will remain under Varig's control. Varig said the proposals did not involve changes in the shareholding of the airline, which is controlled by an employees' foundation. General Electric has agreed to buy Varig's six Boeing 767 aircraft, which had been purchased with Eximbank funding, for Dollars 204m. Varig will continue to use the aircraft. McDonnell Douglas, which had sold Varig four MD-11 aircraft, will pay the principal on the debt for the next 18 months, totalling Dollars 72m, while Varig will continue to pay the interest. Varig's repayment period for the Dollars 400m debt for the McDonnell Douglas aircraft will then be extended and include the payments made by McDonnell Douglas. Varig has been restructuring after losing Dollars 300m in 1992 and Dollars 97m last year on sales of about Dollars 2.5bn.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Belt and braces for new personal pensions THE growing fashion for investment guarantees made its mark on the personal pensions market this week. Three separate policies were launched, each adding refinements to the formula 'stock market growth, or your money back', which has been the basis for many products in the savings market. Skandia Life has a policy which offers the capital growth of the FT-SE 100 Index, or a deposit-based return, whichever is the greater over five years. The deposit return offers a rate equivalent to three-month Libor minus 2.5 percentage points (which currently works out at 4.5 per cent). The plan is unusual, compared with other guaranteed products, in that it allows for regular as well as single premiums, and that it offers a 'rolling guarantee'. At the end of each five-year period, the guarantees will be applied and the fund will then begin a new five-year term, under the same conditions. If the fund matures within five years of an individual's retirement, the money will automatically be switched into Skandia's deposit fund. There is a bid-offer spread of five per cent, which means that the guarantee effectively applies to only 95 per cent of your investment. There is an annual management charge of 0.75 per cent, and an investment charge of 0.25 per cent. The minimum investment in the personal pension plan is Pounds 25 a month, Pounds 250 annually, or a lump sum of Pounds 1,000. Legal &amp; General's new pension fund offers a different choice; the capital rise in the FT-SE 100 Index, or the rise in the Retail Prices Index, whichever is the greater. The guarantee applies over the five-year period to April 29, 1998. The fund is more limited in scale than Skandia's - it is only designed for lump sum investments and will close by January 15. When the guarantee period expires, the policyholder will have to switch into a new fund, where a guarantee may or may not be available. Legal &amp; General says the fund is suitable for self-administered funds, and for lump-sum personal pensions and free-standing AVCs, particularly where a policyholder is within five to ten years of retirement. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. There are two further points of note. For the purpose of the guarantee, the change in the RPI will be that between May 1992 and August 1997 - not the same as the investment period, and there is a risk that the policyholder will suffer if inflation is high between August 1997 and April 1998. The second point is the familiar one that the policyholder will not benefit from the yield on the FT-SE, an important component of long-term equity performance. Moores Marr Bradley, an independent financial advisory group, has arranged a scheme with Provident Life which offers the capital sum indexed in line with the RPI over five years plus 50 per cent of the FT-SE 100 Index's growth. The fund is available for trustee investment plans, personal pensions and pension transfer plans, with a minimum contribution of Pounds 10,000. It has a subscription period of November 9 to December 10, and a maximum size of Pounds 2.5m. Following the article headed 'Pension Pitfalls' on pIV last week, a number of people have written in to dispute the basis of Life Association of Scotland's campaign on the poor death benefits of section 226 policies. 'In my experience' wrote Ian Chalmers, director of Minet Consultancy Services, 'the vast majority of retirement annuity policies carry a return of full fund death benefit. Very nearly all unit-linked policies have return of full fund death benefit, so the main problem is with profits policies.' LAS maintains that large numbers of s226 policies were sold on a return of premiums (or premiums with interest) basis. As the article stated last week, it will do no harm for s226 policyholders to check what the death benefits will be, and for them to consult an independent financial adviser, if the answer is unsatisfactory.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Pressure on Gillette over razor deal: Brussels likely to rule against company's involvement in buy-out of Wilkinson Sword THE European Commission is likely to rule against the involvement of Gillette, the razor company, in the buy-out of its main competitor, Wilkinson Sword. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) ruled against the deal last year. It demanded that Gillette sell the stake in Wilkinson Sword's holding group which it acquired through the buy-out in 1989. The EC formally launched an inquiry last June when it sent Gillette a lengthy statement of objection detailing criticisms of the deal. The Commission was responding to complaints from two of Gillette's main competitors - Bic, the French manufacturer of disposable razors, and Warner-Lambert, the US group which makes Schick razors. The companies gave evidence to competition officials in Brussels last month. A final decision could be months away, but officials in Brussels now indicate that the Commission will almost certainly force Gillette either to amend the terms of its involvement or unwind the transaction altogether. This would be a severe blow to the company. It has spent the past two years trying to persuade regulators around the world that its involvement in Wilkinson Sword would not work against competition in a market it already dominates. An EC ruling against the deal would leave Wilkinson Sword, one of the most famous names in British metal working, increasingly beleaguered. Unwinding the deal would be extremely complicated and may mean the management buy-out team would have to seek refinancing. The deal at the heart of inquiries is the controversial Dollars 630m (Pounds 352m) buy-out of Wilkinson Sword from Stora, the Swedish paper and forestry group. Gillette initiated, organised and helped to finance the deal with the aim of avoiding objections from competition authorities. Gillette is the leading razor supplier in large parts of Europe. Its share of the wet shave market ranges from about 45 per cent in most European countries to 60 per cent in the UK. In France it has 70 per cent of the market and in some non-EC countries, such as Norway and Denmark, it has more than 85 per cent. The group's efforts to clear the complex deal has involved more than 120 Wilkinson Sword companies in 40 countries. It has turned into an epic struggle between the company's lawyers and competition authorities from Brazil to Ireland, Switzerland and Canada. Authorities in Germany and France are also inquiring into the deal. Gillette, which would not comment on the EC investigation, said yesterday it was still in talks with the Office of Fair Trading on how it could comply with the MMC ruling. The group owns 22 per cent of the non-voting stock of Swedish Match, the vehicle used to acquire Stora's consumer products division which included Wilkinson Sword. Gillette also provided the buy-out team with a Dollars 69m loan. Gillette says it does not influence Wilkinson Sword's policies. However, Gillette has the right to prevent shareholders selling stakes to other companies, to block a flotation of Swedish Match and to turn its stake into ordinary voting shares which could give it management control.</p>

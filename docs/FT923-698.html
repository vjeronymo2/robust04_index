			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Doctors' dilemma on tax DOCTORS may face a taxing problem. Since the beginnings of the National Health Service, GPs have been classed as self-employed and taxed under schedule D, even though some of their circumstances might suggest relegation to the less generous schedule E. Dr Joe Neary, a Cambridgeshire GP, experienced what he saw as a challenge to the tax status of GPs when he applied for approval of a profit-related pay scheme for his four employees. 'I got a negative response from the Revenue, based on the argument that the enterprise of general practice is entirely government funded,' he told a medical magazine, adding: 'I saw no point in chasing it through the courts as this might be counter-productive if GPs' schedule D tax status was questioned.' Instead, Neary told the Financial Times, he went through his own political channels. He made informal contact with Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary who is MP for Norfolk SW. She confirmed what the Revenue had said. The profit-related pay issue became academic for him as, in the event, his first year in practice yielded far less than expected. But he says that if he nets a profit next year of more than Pounds 42,000, the national intended standard, he will pay staff bonuses reflecting their extra dedication. Since his scheme will not have been approved, however, the staff will have to pay tax on the performance-related payments.</p>

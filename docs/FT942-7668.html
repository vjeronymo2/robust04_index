			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Growth prospects lift Japan's OTC stocks - Small is beautiful again, but strategists like cyclicals long term Small is beautiful again in Japan. Since the beginning of this year, the country's over-the-counter stock market has gained 28.1 per cent on prospects of high growth against an 18.4 per cent rise in the Nikkei 225. The current attractions of the OTC market are different from those of 1990, when it climbed to a record high before plunging on profit taking. That upsurge was supported by investment funds looking for alternative investments, which ploughed in money without proper research. Some OTC companies were valued on their land holdings rather than earnings. The current buzz word is growth. With years of slow growth ahead for the Japanese economy and the large blue chip companies, the OTC market is now regarded as virtually another emerging market. Recent profit announcements have supported the theory. According to Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business daily, pre-tax earnings for leading OTC companies are showing an advance of 14.7 per cent against a fall of 19.5 per cent for all listed companies. The new consumer trend towards cheaper prices has given OTC companies extra scope. For example, Sari, a discount liquor store chain, has boosted its profits by offering its own, economy-priced house brand. The shares have risen by 80 per cent since their initial listing to the current Y4,500. With the Ministry of Finance's ban on listings lifted and Japan's Securities Dealer Association eager to allow five to six companies to list every week from next month, the scope for investment on the OTC market is expected to widen this year. However, investors need to be aware of the high risk factor surrounding these stocks. The market became a playground for speculators during the 1990 rally, since prices could be manipulated easily due to the lack of liquidity; and lax disclosure requirements, leading to unexpected bankruptcies, have left many investors nervous. Mr Craig Chudler, managing director of Thomas Norton Associates, an investment research company specialising in small Japanese companies, says that OTC companies are different animals from their larger peers, usually headed by a maverick entrepreneur and needing in-depth, individual analysis. Meanwhile, while strategists do not deny that OTC growth stocks are a buy, analysis suggests that larger, cyclical stocks may have longer term appeal. Mr Rod Smyth, strategist at Baring Securities, says that OTC stocks have more or less discounted the growth factor for now, and that the greater profit surprises which will push share prices higher will be in the larger blue chips. The return of domestic institutional investors to the market also points to a rise in interest in the larger companies, since the large financial institutions are loath to invest in high risk instruments. Mr Smyth advises: 'Investors who dump the larger stocks now for smaller OTC shares may miss the boat.'</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSPIRACY THEORY IN BLACK COMMUNITY  </P> <P> In response to "Call Racism by Its Real Name," by Mark Ridley-Thomas  (Commentary, Sept. 15):  </P> <P> Unfortunately, social activists like Ridley-Thomas tend to lose their  objectivity in their zeal to challenge society on issues such as race-related  crime. To those of us who prefer facts over rhetoric, there are certainly  missing pieces to the puzzle of the Amber Jefferson story that prevent a  conclusive determination about the motives of those involved in the  confrontation.  </P> <P> Was this another of the epithet-strewn street fights in the greater Los Angeles  area, blown out of proportion because of the simple race of the combatants? Or  was the fight motivated by racial hatred? From all available (media) evidence,  it is hard to say.  </P> <P> Thus, it seems premature, if not an outright denial of due process, for  Ridley-Thomas to demand that the Orange County district attorney's office  impose hate crime charges on the alleged perpetrators.  </P> <P> Recently, I read in The Times about a Latino man who was seriously beaten by a  group of black men in a mostly black neighborhood after a traffic accident. I  noticed Ridley-Thomas did not include this incident in his listing of hate  crimes against "people of color."  </P> <P> As an African-American, I am deeply concerned about the state of ethnic and  racial relationships in Southern California. However, extremism in public  commentary will leave people confused and unconvinced about the potential  dangers of racial intolerance.  </P> <P> HAMPTON N. CANTRELL  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAPHNE DU MAURIER, AUTHOR OF 'REBECCA' AND 'THE BIRDS,' DIES  </P> <P> Dame Daphne du Maurier, who once remarked, "I can't say I really like people,  perhaps that's why I always preferred to create my own," died Wednesday.  </P> <P> Monty Baker-Munton, a family friend, said he did not know the cause of death of  one of this era's most popular novelists. "For the last fortnight (two weeks)  she'd just been in a gentle decline," he said of the author of "Rebecca" and  other celebrated tales.  </P> <P> Dame Daphne, who also wrote such popular classics as "Frenchman's Creek" and  "The Birds," died in her sleep at her home in the village of Par, in Cornwall,  southwest England, he told the Associated Press. She was 81.  </P> <P> She had moved to that home -- a place called Kilmarth -- years ago from  Menabilly, the legendary old graystone mansion she had immortalized as  Manderley in "Rebecca."  </P> <P> That home, gutted by Oliver Cromwell's troops during England's civil war in the  1600s, typified the historic and adventurous splendor of Miss Du Maurier's  writing.  </P> <P>  And the opening words of the gothic "Rebecca" ("Last night I dreamt I went to  Manderley again") became one of the best-loved phrases in modern English  literature.  </P> <P> Through the 29 novels and dozens of short stories she penned in her lifetime  ran the melded threads of romance and intrigue.  </P> <P> Taking note of some minor shortcomings he found in "Rebecca," critic V. S.  Pritchett still offered this paean to her talent: "Many a better novelist would  give his eyes to be able to tell a story as Miss Du Maurier does, to make it  move at such a pace and to go with such mastery from surprise to surprise. . .  . The melodrama is excellent."  </P> <P> In an art form often distinguished by economic perfidy, Miss Du Maurier, who in  1969 was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire by the queen,  had been a success since publication of her first novel in 1931 -- "The Loving  Spirit."  </P> <P> "Rebecca" alone ran to 42 printings with the last edition in 1980. Her books  sold well into the millions but a spokesman for one of her three publishers  said he didn't have specific figures.  </P> <P> Several of her works have been adapted for film and television. "Rebecca," in  which Joan Fontaine played the naive second wife of Sir Laurence Olivier, a  widower with a funereal secret who is haunted by the image of his glamorous  first wife, won an Academy Award as best picture in 1940.  </P> <P> (The book itself has been described as "a Charlotte Bronte story minus  Charlotte Bronte.")  </P> <P> Alfred Hitchcock directed "Jamaica Inn," a Cornish tale of an orphan entwined  with smugglers in 1939. Hitchcock also did "The Birds" in 1963, a stark tale of  flocks of birds making wanton attacks on humans.  </P> <P> "Frenchman's Creek," a period romance starring Fontaine and Arturo de Cordova,  was a box-office success in 1944, while "My Cousin Rachel" and "The Scapegoat"  also proved well-accepted films.  </P> <P> Miss Du Maurier for most of her life fought an unsuccessful battle to keep her  from being branded a Grand Dame of romance. She chose to call her writings  "suspense adventures."  </P> <P> But a fairy-tale, real-life romance had sprung from her first book,  contributing to that dilemma and eventually bringing her a husband and three  children.  </P> <P> Miss Du Maurier was one of three daughters of the renowned actor Sir Gerald du  Maurier. She would one day write his biography.  </P> <P> She had been educated by private tutors in Paris and at age 21 published her  first articles and short stories. To encourage her, her publisher told her:  "Write a novel." Thus evolved "The Loving Spirit" in 1931, a tale of the lives  of a boat-building family she had seen in a small English seacoast town.  </P> <P> The novel captivated a young British army major and led to a storied courtship.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quick Courtship  </P> <P> The officer, Frederick A. M. Browning, resolved to meet the author. They met in  1932, married a few months later, and in the same year she published her second  novel, "I'll Never Be Young Again." She was just 25.  </P> <P> "It was rather woman's magaziny," she later remarked.  </P> <P> Regardless, she became both a prolific writer and dedicated mother. As the  novels, histories, biographies and plays developed, so did the children. She  said the twin career was not that difficult.  </P> <P> "I was always at home and that made things easier. I made a point of keeping  some time free after the children's tea to read aloud to them."  </P> <P> She told a long-ago interviewer that her favorite hideaway at Menabilly was a  gardener's hut, where, she said, "I'd sit for hours on end, chain-smoking,  chewing mints and tapping away at my typewriter."  </P> <P> Browning became commander of British airborne forces in World War II and then  treasurer to Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II.  </P> <P> After he died in 1965, she lived alone at Menabilly with her two Yorkshire  terriers. She finally was forced to leave when its owner returned and she moved  to Par.  </P> <P> In 1971 she published "Not After Midnight," a collection of five novellas  containing her special mix of romance and the eerie.  </P> <P> In 1981 she completed her autobiography, "Growing Pains."  </P> <P> She admitted that she never was "so much interested in people as in types --  types who represent great forces of good or evil. I don't care very much  whether John Smith likes Mary Robinson, goes to bed with Jane Brown and then  refuses to pay the hotel bill.  </P> <P> "But I am passionately interested in human cruelty, human lust and human  avarice, and -- of course -- their counterparts in the scale of virtue."  </P></p>

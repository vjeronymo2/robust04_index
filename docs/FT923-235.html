			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (27): Work, death and other problems NO ONE EVER died from hard work, we reassure ourselves in those Western countries which have adopted the Protestant work ethic. But the Japanese, who should know, have a word for it: karoshi, meaning death by overwork. Europe has not gone as far as the US in regarding a punishing work schedule as a virility symbol rather than a sign that the company or the individual is poorly organised. But the reverse of rising unemployment statistics is increased pressure on those still in work. Awareness of the these pressures has led to the growth of a consultancy industry aimed at tackling the problems of managing time and stress. Courses and books on the subject now abound. Taken to absurd extremes they suggest a regime of obsessive note-taking to establish work patterns and the implementation of artificial procedures to reduce non-productive time. Taken sensibly they can throw a revealing light on the disorganisation that lies beneath our apparently well-structured lives. Better Time Management (Jacqueline Atkinson, Thorsons, Pounds 5.99, 240 pages) begins with a series of questions. What sort of a problem do you have? asks Ms Atkinson, a psychologist and an academic. Do you spend too much time on trivial matters? Are you never able to finish one thing before starting on something else? Are you unable to say No when asked to do another job? Or do problems press in from the outside in the shape of too many interruptions to your work routine? You will not be able solve your time management problems overnight since they probably reflect habits which have been ingrained over ten or 20 years, says Ms Atkinson. But by analysing your present pattern of work and leisure and making a conscious effort to plan your day you should be able to work to greater effect and find more time for leisure pursuits. Start by estimating how much time you spend each week at work, with family, doing chores, following hobbies. Next keep a time log of how much time you actually devote to these different activities. A detailed study of your working day will probably show that a one-hour meeting took up to two hours when you take into account the 'hidden time consumers.' One sensible suggestion made in this practical and jargon-free guide is to untangle realistic goals from daydreams. Many people dream of learning a foreign language or mastering a musical instrument. But unless we make these activities a real goal and fit them into our time schedules they become a source of extra stress and frustration. Time is Money: Save It (Lothar Seiwert, Kogan Page, Pounds 9.99, 222 pages) covers much of the same ground, though the style is more academic. Diagrams and mathematical symbols are used extensively to convey a somewhat spurious precision. Mr Seiwert, a time management consultant, suggests that you identify your top five time-wasters from a 30-strong list which includes a failure to set priorities, taking on too many tasks, lengthy meetings and procrastination. When drawing up a timetable of activities set yourself specific goals - such as reaching agreement on a particular issue - rather than just 'meeting with so and so.' Most work days have their productive periods, early in the morning or while others are at lunch, and their less productive periods, so it makes sense to time important tasks to take place in the most productive periods, Mr Seiwert suggests. Working Ourselves to Death (Diane Fassel, Thorsons, Pounds 6.99, 156 pages) devotes more time to considering the causes of workaholism than it does to suggesting a cure. This is less of a practical handbook than an apocalyptic warning of what will happen if we fail to curb our over-emphasis on work. Achieving a sound balance between the time we devote to work and to other leisure activities is clearly an important one but Ms Fassel, a consultant on work-related problems, spoils her case by exaggeration. 'Workaholics no longer own their own lives,' she states. 'They are truly the walking dead.' Ms Fassel's remedy for the disease involves limiting the time spent at work or drawing up a work plan to restore balance. Companies may need to change their systems if they demand too much of employees. She borrows a programme of recovery from the techniques practiced by Alcoholics Anonymous but rejects conventional time and stress management techniques. These can become part of the problem, she argues, because they create the illusion that the disease can be controlled and delay more radical action. One workaholic quoted by Ms Fassel went as far as pretending to join his local golf club while using the time to make business calls. He was only found out when his wife suspected he was having an affair. You may not have let work take over your life to this extent but you might still benefit from reviewing how you spend your time.</p>

Our correspondent reports that the  conflicting sides claim to have inflicted heavy damage on each  other.    A spokesman for General Dostam has said that yesterday a  plane of the Supervisory Council attacked Bagram Airport, which  is 60 km northeast of Kabul and is under the control of Ahmad  Shah Mas'ud. However, a spokesman for Ahmad Shah Mas'ud has said  that positions of General Dostam's forces and of the Hezb-e  Eslami [Islamic Party] in the Bala Hesar Heights and Maranjan  Hill were bombed several times.    Another report from Afghanistan also states that our  ambassador to Afghanistan handed a written message from Velayati  to the Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party] secretary general  yesterday. Also, the UN secretary general has announced his  readiness to send a special political delegation to Afghanistan  in a bid to establish peace. The UN secretary general's  statement says that with the help of the Islamic Republic of  Iran and other countries, a group known as the friends of the  secretary general on Afghan affairs will be formed and will play  a consultative role in the secretary general's decision.</p>

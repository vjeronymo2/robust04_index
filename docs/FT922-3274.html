			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Leading Article: The EC-US soyabean war US FRUSTRATION with the EC's behaviour over oilseed imports is understandable. But it cannot justify the decision to retaliate by imposing punitive tariffs on Dollars 1bn of farm imports from the EC, about a quarter of the EC's farm trade with the US. Unpredictable political forces are at play both in the US (the Perot factor) and in Europe (the Denmark factor). Retaliation could even scupper hopes of progress in the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation and lead to escalation into wider trade conflict. The dispute over oilseeds has deep roots. In the 1970s the EC introduced a system of subsidies that encouraged oilseed production, thereby undermining a 1962 commitment to give soyabeans and soyameal from the US duty-free access into EC markets. Since 1987 the US has twice had its complaints upheld by dispute settlement panels of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). EC efforts at reform have satisfied neither the US nor, more significantly, the international trading community. Both impatient and cynical over EC delays, the US announced a month ago that if the EC failed to reform its oilseeds regime, punitive tariffs would be imposed on Dollars 1bn of EC farm exports. This it was entitled to do under the Gatt. Irrevocably weakened EC officials argue that the US irrevocably weakened its position in the EC when it embargoed soya exports in the mid-1970s during a domestic shortage. This created concerns in Europe about security of supply and opened the gate to Latin American producers. The US has been losing market share to such low-cost producers ever since, a development that has nothing to do with the new EC subsidy regime, argue EC officials. Nevertheless, last week the EC responded to the pressure. Though continuing to dispute the rulings, the EC agreed to compensate US exporters in settlement of the dispute - an option open to the EC under Gatt rules, which removes Gatt backing for US retaliation. Clever ploy EC officials presumably saw this as a clever ploy, but they may have failed to reckon with 'the Perot factor' in the US. President Bush has won praise from the soyabean lobby in the US for playing hardball with the EC. This is important for him as he prepares to enter a three-man race for the presidency, behind Ross Perot in many polls, and desperately needing to hold on to the Republican base in Midwest farm states. The danger is that President Bush will press ahead with unilateral retaliation, disregarding the fact that he no longer has a Gatt sanction for doing so. The EC would find it hard to resist a counter-attack. There would then be little prospect of further progress towards a settlement of the US-EC farm trade dispute that blocks successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Both sides have to move with great care, since far more is at stake than soyabeans. The US has the discretion to play the dispute long. President Bush can pause for up to 210 days before he imposes punitive tariffs. He should do so. Equally, the EC must now move swiftly in drawing up its compensation list. The danger of conflict can also be defused by skilful choice of the goods on the list: the more it comforts the US farm lobby, the better. And, should the US now retaliate, the EC should hold back on counter-retaliation and, instead, work even harder to settle the issue within the Uruguay Round.</p>

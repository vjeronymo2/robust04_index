			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Mercury victims win court battle A Japanese district court yesterday ruled that government can be held liable for industrial pollution, setting an important precedent in environmental law. The court, in Kyoto, awarded damages of Y193m (Pounds 1.2m) to 38 people who suffered mercury poisoning 37 years ago in a disaster has become a symbol of Japan's environmental conscience. It was caused when a factory owned by Chisso, a chemicals group, pumped polluted sludge into the sea near Minamata, a southern Japanese fishing village in the prefecture where Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, later became governor. It was not until eight years ago that the victims managed to bring their case to court. Out of 141 plaintiffs, eight have died waiting for Japan's tortuously slow legal system to produce an answer, and one has withdrawn. This was despite Mr Hosokawa's efforts to obtain a quick out-of-court settlement during his tenure as governor of Kumamoto prefecture. The Kyoto court yesterday ruled that the prefectural and national governments, as well as Chisso, failed to take proper action to prevent the outbreak and spread of so-called Minamata disease, paralysis caused by eating fish poisoned with mercury. The main points at issue were whether government could be declared negligent and whether the victims really were suffering from mercury poisoning. Friday's was the fifth such court ruling concerning the mercury poisoning. The ruling affected only 46 plaintiffs. Other separate cases are still pending.</p>

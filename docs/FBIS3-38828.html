Deputy Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said a  first informal meeting of the 16 members of the North Atlantic  Treaty Organisation would be held on Monday to prepare the  Council meeting.    France requested the meeting of NATO's governing body to  discuss Butrus-Ghali's request that the alliance confirm its  readiness to launch air strikes against artillery positions  outside Sarajevo in the wake of Saturday's massacre of civilians.    Colonna said the convening of the Council would enable NATO  to "announce precise, concrete measures" beyond a "simple  reiteration" of measures the organisation has already adopted.    "France will ask the Atlantic Council to issue a clear  ultimatum" on the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo and the  "repositioning of Serb and Bosnian heavy artillery" in a radius  of 30 kilometres (20 miles).    Colonna said the ultimatum should be "brief, precise and  expressed in days."    Colonna added that Paris expected Monday's meeting in  Brussels of the European Community foreign ministers to issue a  "strong message" giving its full backing to France's efforts  towards a NATO ultimatum.</p>

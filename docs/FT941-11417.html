			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / People: The Engineering Council Denis Filer, who was been director-general of the Engineering Council since 1988, is staying on beyond his scheduled retirement in May until a definitive proposal for reforming the council has been prepared. The council is the umbrella body for the UK's professional engineering institutions. Last year, Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the council, unveiled controversial proposals for a new relationship with the 42 professional institutions. The council said in December that Sir John would serve a second three-year term as chairman, beginning this May. Denis Filer is also to become chairman of ADWEST GROUP from April when Fred Grant retires. Graham Menzies, group md, then becomes chief executive and Richard Truscott, general manager operations for the past three years, joins the board.</p>

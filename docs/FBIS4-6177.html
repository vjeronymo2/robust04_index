			<p>BFN     [Text] The Philippine Embassy in Kuala Lumpur should  explain to its people the real situation relating to the  rounding up of more than 1,000 Philippine workers at St. John  Cathedral in the federal capital on March the 27th. Deputy Home  Minister Datuk Megat Junid Megat Ayub said the Philippines  should understand Malaysia's position and the problems it faced  following influx of illegal workers.    Speaking to reporters at parliament house, he said if the  embassy wants the issue to be settled amicably, then they should  tell the Philippine people that the operation was carried out in  accordance with the law. He said Malaysians, too, (?were  arrested) overseas for overstaying, but the government did not  protest. Datuk Megat Junid said Malaysia was facing not only  the problem of illegal workers from the Philippines, but from  other countries like Indonesia, Bangladesh, Thailand, and  Myanmar [Burma] as well.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 25 (BTA) -- A Bulgarian-Iranian Joint  Committee on Economic and Technical Cooperation today started a  sitting here. It was opened by Bulgarian delegation head  Transport Minister Kiril Ermenkov and his Iranian counterpart  Transport Minister 'Ali Akbar Torkan. The sitting was also  attended by Iran's Ambassador here Mohammed 'Ali Kormi Nuri.  The sides were unanimous that the business and economic  contacts between the two countries of the past 2 or 3 years are  not at the desirable level. According to them, this situation  was brought about by the reforms under way in Bulgaria and the  plummeting international oil prices.    The joint committee will sit in separate groups in charge of  industry, agriculture, trade and banking, oil and gas, transport  and communications, technical and scientific cooperation. The  Bulgarian side is expected to raise the issue of overdue  receivables of Bulgarian companies for a total of about $27  million.    The Iranian delegation, including 20 business circles  representatives will hold talks at the Council of Ministers and  meet National Bank of Bulgaria (BNB) Governor Prof. Todor  Vulchev and the ministers of trade and industry. The guests are  planning tomorrow to visit Burgas to consider the possibilities  for joint exploitation of transport technologies. They are also  expected to visit the Port of Burgas. Meeting with Bulgarian  President Zhelyu Zhelev is also on the agenda, the Transport  Ministry Press Office said. The joint committee is expected to  end its work with the signing of four bilateral accords and a  concluding document.    Bulgaria has longstanding relations with Iran. The Bulgarian  companies Agrocomplekt, Balkancar, Balkancarpodem, Machinoexport  and Electroimpex have established stable positions in Iran.  According to 1993 customs figures, Bulgarian exports to Iran  amounted to slightly over $18 million, of which metal processing  equipment, unprocessed zinc, minerals and chemical fertilizers  have the greatest share. Bulgaria has imported some $149  million-worth goods from Iran, of which crude oil and lubricants  accounted for 97.5 percent. In January 1994 the two countries'  foreign ministers signed an agreement on economic and business  cooperation which has yet to be endorsed by the two parliaments.  Agreements on double taxation avoidance and reciprocal  investments protection and promotion are currently being drafted.    The previous sitting of the Joint Committee on Economic and  Technical Cooperation was held in Iran in October 1993.</p>

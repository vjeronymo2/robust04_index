			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Books: Analysts in need of a couch - AC Grayling on the feud between Freud and Jung and its implications for psychoanalysis A MOST DANGEROUS METHOD by John Kerr Sinclair Stevenson Pounds 25, 607 pages In the late summer of 1904 an 18-year-old Russian girl called Sabina Spielrein was admitted to the famous Burgh'lzli psychiatric hospital in Zurich. She was alternately depressed and hysterical, obsessed with her digestive processes and sexually fixated upon her father's hands. To all efforts at help she responded with wild cries of loathing and disgust. Within a few years Spielrein was having an affair with the physician appointed to her care. She studied medicine and later practised as a psychoanalyst, thereafter lecturing in the subject at Geneva's Rousseau Institute. In the psychotherapeutic world it is not unusual for patients to turn healers. But this case was, says John Kerr, special; Spielrein's physician was Carl Jung, and later she was a colleague and confidante of Sigmund Freud. According to Kerr, her association with these two men played a significant part in their relationship. It is this relationship and its spectacular demise that is the subject of Kerr's book. When they first met, Freud excitedly proclaimed Jung his heir. Six years later he was apostrophising him as brutal, anti-Semitic, paranoid, 'emotionally stupid' and a sufferer from 'repressed anal eroticism'. Freud was always incontinent in his hostility to those he perceived as apostates - Alfred Adler furnishes another celebrated example - but with Jung his vehemence barely knew bounds. The Freud-Jung story is absorbingly told by Kerr, who in the process introduces us - equally absorbingly - to both the substance and the implausibilities of psychoanalytic theory. Of the two principals in the drama, Freud emerges smelling least of roses; on Kerr's account he appears mean-minded, jealous, self-serving, unscientific and prejudiced. On the evidence marshalled by Kerr it seems hard to disagree. But Freud at least was sane, which - on the same evidence - cannot be said so unequivocally of Jung, whose bizarre visions and religious torments constituted the main source of his theories. As a result, Kerr's account goes a long way to weakening the claims on our intellectual respect of both Freudian and Jungian psychology. Freud and Jung met in Vienna in 1907. On their first encounter they talked enthusiastically into the early hours. Freud was anxious to associate with Jung, who already had a reputation in medical psychology, and was not a Jew; these were both important attractions for Freud, who wished to make psychoanalysis respectable by having it accepted in institutions outside 'sensual' Vienna where its leading exponents were all Jewish. A non-Jew from prim Switzerland's best-known mental hospital seemed perfect. And to begin with, Jung was happy to play Paul to Freud's Jesus. Their collaboration started well; driven by Jung's energy, psychoanalysis began to acquire international respectability. The two travelled to America together to lecture, and Jung organised grand-sounding International Congresses of Psychoanalysis in various European cities. But Jung had too independent a mind to rest content with the role of second fiddle. Driven by his own demons, he commenced to differ. As with Adler, a chief disagreement concerned Freud's insistence on the importance of sex. But there were increasingly many other problems. Freud was a determinist; Jung believed in free will. Freud held that minds are individually shaped by the forces of infant sexuality; Jung thought in terms of a universal unconscious which can be understood through mythology. Freud concentrated on childhood experience; Jung attached great importance to the middle and later parts of life, which he believed to be dominated by religious concerns. These differences began to emerge after their American trip in 1909, but it was not until 1913 that the rift was complete. By the time of the Fourth International Psychoanalytical Congress, held that year in Munich, the two men were no longer on speaking terms. In the immediately following years Jung had a species of nervous breakdown; Freud meanwhile vituperated him at every opportunity. This story is compelling enough without the introduction of Sabina Spielrein. Although she is interesting in her own rather sad right, Kerr does not succeed in showing that she had any real importance to the Freud-Jung saga. Their quarrel had nothing to do with her. Kerr would have us believe that she was, in effect, the pivot of a mutual blackmail: he claims that Freud's knowledge of her affair with Jung - if affair it really was - was Jung's reason for keeping to himself his knowledge about Freud's incest with his sister-in-law, Minna Bernays. Kerr himself shows this hypothesis to be implausible, reporting that many of the early psychoanalysts, setting an honourable precedent no doubt, slept with their patients. Why should Jung worry particularly? Moreover it is clear from Kerr's account that Freud made desultory attempts to detach Spielrein's loyalties from Jung, but failed. So she is a minor figure, used by Kerr merely to give the story a novel perspective. But the story is gripping nevertheless, and for its controversial undermining both of psychoanalysis and its creators it makes an entertaining and highly educative read - and perhaps an important one.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Toyota forced into ban on overtime Toyota, Japan's biggest automotive manufacturer, has introduced its first overtime ban for assembly-line workers. The move underlines the extent of the recession affecting the industry, and its difficulty in exporting, given the continuing strength of the yen. The group stopped all overtime for production and office-workers at its Japanese plants during January and February. It has not yet decided whether to continue the ban during March. The company, which reported a 48.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits during the six months to the end of December, has also temporarily shut one of its 17 domestic production lines because of poor demand. The shutdown, at its Motomachi plant in Toyota City, Aichi prefecture, happened late last year. The group intends to reopen the line, which makes mark II passenger cars, in April. Another line, at the Tahara plant in Aichi prefecture, had also been closed. The company has not yet decided when the line, making Celica and Carina EDs, will be reopened. Toyota said its daily production had fallen from a peak of about 17,000 vehicles a day to 13,000. Japanese vehicle production fell 10.2 per cent last year, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association (Jama). The Japanese automotive industry is gaining little comfort from exports. In January, these recorded their 10th straight month of year-on-year decline. Exports slumped 26.5 per cent compared with the same month in 1993, according to Jama. January exports of cars, trucks and buses fell to 390,418 from 531,349 in January 1993.</p>

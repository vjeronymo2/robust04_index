			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Philippine sex slave protest greets Japanese premier Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama arrived in the Philippines yesterday to be confronted by angry women demanding compensation for being used as sex slaves in the second world war, Reuter reports from Manila. Police kept about 50 of the women, waving banners demanding 'Compensation Now', more than 100 metres from the luxury Manila Hotel where Mr Murayama was staying. The women are demanding Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 130,000) each in compensation. They were led by Ms Rosa Henson, the first Filipina to end decades of shamed silence in 1992 and tell of her experience as one of 200,000 women forced to work as prostitutes for Japanese soldiers. Mr Roberto Romulo, the Philippine foreign minister, told reporters the comfort women issue would be discussed when Mr Murayama and President Fidel Ramos hold formal talks today. Mr Murayama is expected to repeat apologies for Japan's wartime atrocities as well as discuss economic and security issues with leaders of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore during a week-long swing through the region. Mr Ramos will seek to boost trade with Japan and ask for an increase in official development assistance to the Philippines, which amounted in 1993 to Dollars 721.5m. Japan, the Philippines' leading donor, recently pledged Dollars 1.5bn in assistance for 1994. Total trade between the two countries reached Dollars 5.8bn in 1993, up by 20 per cent from the previous year. About 200,000 comfort women, most Koreans but also Filipinas, Chinese, Taiwanese, Indonesians and Dutch, were forcibly recruited by the Japanese army in the war to provide sex for their troops.</p>

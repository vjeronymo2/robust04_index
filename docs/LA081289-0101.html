			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY;  </P> <P> WHITMAN TO BUY VAN DE KAMP'S SEAFOODS DIVISION FOR $140 MILLION  </P> <P> Minneapolis-based Pillsbury Co. has agreed to sell its San Diego-based Van de  Kamp's frozen seafoods division to Whitman Corp. for about $140 million in  cash, the company said Friday. Pillsbury hopes to complete the transaction by  mid-September, according to a spokesman.  </P> <P> Pillsbury, which was acquired by London-based Grand Metropolitan PLC early this  year, in May announced its intention to sell both Van de Kamp's and Bumble Bee  Seafoods, another San Diego-based seafood operation.  </P> <P> Whitman officials were uncertain Friday if the proposed sale would affect 40  employees and managers in San Diego. Van de Kamp's also has 300 employees at a  processing plant in Erie, Pa.  </P> <P> "It's much too premature to speculate what might happen" in San Diego,  according to Wendell Larsen, senior vice president of corporate affairs at  Chicago-based Whitman. "But, generally speaking, we're not planning to strip  the company. We're planning to expand the business and make it more  successful."  </P> <P> Whitman, which owns several consumer goods and services companies, reported $4  billion in sales during 1988.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp's, which markets frozen seafood products in the United States,  recently reported annual sales of more than $100 million. Its products are sold  under the Van de Kamp's and Today's Catch brand names.  </P> <P> "Van de Kamp's is a superior company that has strong potential," said Ian A.  Martin, chairman and chief executive officer of Pillsbury, which reported $6.2  billion in 1988 revenue. "The Van de Kamp's line, however, does not fit  Pillsbury's core businesses and long-range strategy," Martin said.  </P></p>

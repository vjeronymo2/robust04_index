			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CONTROVERSY OVER IRVINE RIGHTS ORDINANCE  </P> <P> In response to Irvine Mayor Larry Agran's comments regarding the letter mailed  to Republican officeholders asking for their help in denouncing the recent  anti-discrimination ordinance: I challenge his belief that it is demagoguery.  </P> <P> One has only to read the newspaper to know that homosexuality is not limited to  consenting adults. What about "cruising" for young men, to say nothing of  molesting little boys? The council cannot legislate the acceptance of sodomy.  Do we want Irvine to become the West Hollywood of Orange County?  </P> <P> MRS. CHARLES (MARIE) HEATHCO  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

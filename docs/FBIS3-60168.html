Drug raids and hauls are being severely hampered because of  the inadequate facilities and this comes amidst a rise in drug  trafficking over the last six months.    There are only about 11 officers now on staff at the  Narcotics Division, less than half the required cadre of 25,  said Senior Superintendent Oswald Dwyer, chief at the Narcotics  Division.  <H5>  Raids </H5>   Added to this problem, the Division does not have enough  vehicles for the officers and this is affecting movement during  emergencies and raids. Although Superintendent Dwyer was unable  to say how many vehicles the Division has and how much [words  missing], THE GLEANER understands that there is frequent  rotation of vehicles used by the Narcotics Division.    Even sniffer dogs, the most important drug detection  component, are in limited supply. However, a move is being made  to get and train additional dogs. The dogs are used to detect  illegal drugs at the island's ports and the two international  airports.    The Narcotics Chief, however, pointed out that the Division  is trying its best to detect, as much as possible, all  contraband drugs coming in and going out the island through the  island's airports and ports.    About 33,979 kg of ganja were seized between January and  August this year. In 1991 about 41,393 kg were seized, 1.2 kg  less than the amount seized last year.    Up to August this year, 61 kg of cocaine had been seized  along with 511 pieces of crack. In 1991 the division seized some  68 kg of cocaine and 1,057 pieces of crack while in 1992 the  amount of cocaine seized had risen to 661 kg.</p>

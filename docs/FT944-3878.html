			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Sport: Grand Slam serves the whole game - Tennis You may never have heard of them, but Dan O'Connell, Nicolas Ayeboua, Gustavo Granitto and Frank Couraud are perhaps the most important names in international tennis. At least, they are to thousands of aspiring young tennis players in third world countries trying to make a start in the game. All four are tennis coaches, employed by the International Tennis Federation as full-time development officers. They travel their regions, working with the national federations to organise competitive events among junior players and train future coaches. O'Connell is an American, whose patch is Fiji and the South Pacific; Ayeboua, from Togo, looks after the whole of French Africa; Granitto comes from Argentina and operates in Central America and the Spanish Caribbean; while Couraud is a Frenchman, whose territory is the English and Dutch Caribbean. Doug MacCurdy, who runs the operation for the ITF, said: 'This has been the most significant step since we set up our development department in 1984. During 1995 and 1996 we shall appoint three more coaches in Africa, China and Central Asia to start the same process.' The whole of this work is funded from the Dollars 2m a year donated to the Grand Slam Development Fund by the Compaq Grand Slam Cup, the end-of-season event that is taking place for the fifth time this week at the Olympiahalle in Munich. Those who criticise the tournament for providing annual prize money of Dollars 6m for the 16 men who have performed best in the four major championships of the year - the Australian and French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open - forget the benefits to the whole of the game. One who does not is Andre Agassi. Speaking in Munich this week, after beating the Austrian left-hander Thomas Muster in a glorious first-round match, the US Open champion and world number two said: 'They are always asking, 'should there be all this money in tennis?' 'The reality is that the stadium is full up there and the tournament donates Dollars 3m a year to charity. Two million a year has gone to third world countries' programmes for developing tennis and another Dollars 1m goes every year to a charity of Axel's choice.' Axel Meyer Wolden, the Munich lawyer who came to the ITF and the Grand Slam Committee in 1989 with the idea of launching the Grand Slam Cup, is a man with a keen sense of social responsibility. 'The motive is a moral one - to help others,' he said. 'Contributions have been made to buy equipment for treating young children with cancer and for facilitating organ transplants. Bosnia, Russia and other areas afflicted with war and strife have received funds to feed, clothe and give shelter to children.' It is a proud record. But do not be misled. There is more than just philanthropy in Dr Meyer Wolden's motives. He has built the Grand Slam Cup into a profitable event of real stature. Television coverage ensures it is seen in more than 200 countries. That has been no easy task in the face of the political sniping from the Association of Tennis Professionals' Tour, the body that emerged when the ATP broke away from the Men's International Professional Tennis Council. The Grand Slam Cup is at the very top of the sporting pyramid. Three players who started at the bottom are Claude N'Goran from the Ivory Coast, Tamer el Sawy, an Egyptian, and Nigeria's Sule Lapido. All three have emerged from ITF programmes to achieve significant rankings - Claude and Tamer are now among the top 240 men in the world, Sule only a little lower. By winning local tournaments they were selected for one of the ITF junior teams, which are sent to appropriate tournaments under the eye of an experienced manager/coach. Through successes at this second stage of the ITF's 'pyramid of opportunity', Claude, Sule and Tamer were promoted to ITF Satellite teams, the first rung of the professional ladder where ATP points can be won. From there they have now been transferred to an ITF Challenger team, whose coach is the former French circuit player, Jacques Hervet. But they have yet to climb the final peak. Entry to the Grand Slam Championships and the tournaments of the main ATP Tour can be gained only by accumulating sufficient computer points from Challenger tournaments and Satellite circuits. That quantum leap has been made by a few players who started out on ITF programmes. Byron Black, the Davis Cup player from Zimbabwe and the French Open doubles champion, freely acknowledges that without ITF help his career would never have taken off. And Karim Alami, who beat Pete Sampras in the first round of the Qatar Open last January, benefitted from membership of an ITF professional team. So tomorrow, when this year's winner of the Compaq Grand Slam Cup steps forward to receive his cheque for Dollars 1.5m, remember the benefits that the contest has brought to the world game.</p>

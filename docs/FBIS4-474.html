			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Comment and Opinion" page: "A welcome </F> perspective"; article published in English]    [Text] The international backing which emergency rule in  Natal has received is unsurprising.    After all those who demanded the ending of apartheid and the  ANC's elevation to power were mostly silent on violation of  rights, including mass murder, elsewhere in the world.    That is why support for emergency rule from outside South  Africa carries little moral weight.    A discordant and perceptive note was however sounded in an  editorial in the London SUNDAY TIMES.    The editorial states that an election under present  circumstances will do nothing to reconcile South Africans, and  that as such we are on the brink of civil war. This is "not  simply a legacy of apartheid, but of the bungled way the  transition has been handled."    ANC and NP [National Party] "propaganda machines insist the  election will be substantially free and fair, and that once a  popularly elected government is in place peace will blossom."    But, it is predicted that neither will happen.    "Rather than addressing the underlying reasons for the  violence, the ANC and the government blindly push ahead,  believing states of emergency and military force will provide  solutions. They persist is claiming that the new constitution  they have drafted is a federal one, even when scores of foreign  experts have pointed out it is not."    The ANC, it is correctly pointed out, has won everything it  wants, and all who remain in the way are Zulu leaders. But,  though Dr Buthelezi and King Goodwill Zwelithini are dismissed  as spoilers: "All they are asking for are federal powers along  the lines enjoyed by German, Canadian or American states or  provinces. Is South Africa to be plunged into a bitter civil  war for this?"    The article predicts that South Africa, under present  arrangements, is heading towards an authoritarian, effectively  one- party state.    "Declaring states of emergency and sending in the army is no  solution. They will be able to take Ulundi, the kwaZulu  capital, but will face an unwinnable guerilla campaign in the  hills of northern Natal. At some point, a political solution  will have to be found."    "Mr Mandela and Mr De Klerk must take the plunge ... at this  week's summit with Chief Buthelezi and King Zwelithini they  should postpone the election, not just in Natal, as they are now  belatedly considering, but nationwide."    It is also recommended that, using international mediation,  they should give serious thought to granting real autonomy for  regions.    Though this all may not be politically correct, the  editorial  is entirely sensible. If this route is not followed this kind  of view will be repeated many times as the folly of ANC/NP  [National Party] handiwork becomes more evident.    This view will also be expressed by those who really count  --  foreign investors. They will express their view by withholding  their capital from South Africa, to the impoverishment of all.    This consideration is far more important that the  sycophantic  support of State Department or Foreign Office officials, whose  job after all is the cultivation and flattery of foreign  governments and by implication ruling parties. And it is also  far more important than mere expressions of "moral" support from  foreign governments, or from mutual admiration societies like  the UN or OAU.</p>

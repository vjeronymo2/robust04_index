			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: Kaneb arm acquires east German engineers KANEB-Furmanite, the German subsidiary of Kaneb Services of the US, has acquired KAB, the east Berlin-based power engineering company, in return for a pledge to invest a minimum of DM20m (Dollars 13.10m) in the group over the next three years. It has also agreed with the Treuhand, the agency responsible for the privatisation of former East German industry, to retain KAB's 1,300 employees and to expand its range of products to include power conversion equipment. Kaneb will also offer decontamination technology to tap the lucrative market for cleaning up polluted east German industrial sites as well as recently shut-down nuclear electricity stations. The Berlin-based company is to provide these services to east European countries which face growing international pressure to close down their Soviet-designed nuclear reactors. Kaneb Services maintains pipelines in the US and eastern Europe. Through the Furmanite group, employing 2,500 people, Kaneb provides engineering and services for the nuclear and conventional power generating industry, as well as the chemicals and petrochemicals industries. Furmanite's German subsidiary has 800 employees, of whom 600 are based in east Germany.</p>

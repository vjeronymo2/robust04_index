			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marcela Doleckova: "Czech Republic Pressing for </F> Liberalization of World Trade--Vladimir Dlouhy Claims That  Social and Ecological Dumping Are Misleading Concepts--The  Customs Union With Slovakia Is a Functioning Instrument,  According to the Minister"]    [Text] The Uruguay Round had lasted too long and had  resulted in too little, Vladimir Dlouhy, minister of commerce  and industry, proclaimed at Monday's festive meeting with  commercial attaches from countries that are represented in  Prague. Although this sentence was uttered outside of the  protocol and was not part of the minister's speech, it  emphasized the principal thought V. Dlouhy intended to  communicate to the world once more. That is to say that the  Czech Republic, with this government at its helm, will, within  the framework of its possibilities, be promoting the maximum  liberalization of world trade, on both multilateral platforms  and in bilateral forums. It will do so all the more vehemently  because it "set out into the rain without an umbrella" on its  own, the minister recalled. The relatively small economy of the  Czech Republic that had successfully overcome the delicate  period of the past years as a part of the Czechoslovak  Federation, as well as weathering one year of independent  existence, needs to grow today.    V. Dlouhy considers a rise in exports, which the Czech  Republic intends to achieve by utilizing its own comparative  advantages, to be the most important factor involved in economic  growth. The minister ranks the possibility of lower prices,  resulting from lower Czech wages, among these comparative  advantages. In this connection, the minister could not resist  criticizing the countries of the European Union that frequently  block deliveries of Czech goods by claiming that these shipments  involve dumping tactics. Social and ecological dumping are  misleading concepts, stated Dlouhy, and added that the economic  problems and their social aspects with which the countries of  the European Union are confronted today should not constitute a  reason for the Union to hinder competition for its domestic  products with other products, and thus also Czech goods. This is  primarily true in categories that are designated as being  "sensitive." In defiance of the important association agreement,  trade in these "sensitive" products has a long way to go toward  liberalization on the part of the European Union.    The minister's speech mentions trade with Slovakia in only  one sentence: In 1993, 20 percent of Czech exports went to  Slovakia, and Slovakia shared in Czech imports to the extent of  18 percent, so Slovakia was the second-largest trading partner  of the Czech Republic. Outside of the protocol, however, the  minister, again evidently with the intention of letting the  world know, stated that the customs union between both countries  is a functioning instrument that has resulted in advantages for  both sides. He underscored, with great emphasis, that "we cannot  afford the idea of wrecking the customs union," despite problems  that arise from time to time. He stated that, following a minor  period of improvisation, even foodstuffs are once more passing  across the Czech-Slovak border without problems.</p>

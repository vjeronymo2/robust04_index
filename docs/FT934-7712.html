			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (4): Spectacular returns bring big three the risk of protest - John Gapper explains why cost-cutting follows record bank profits THE international boom in securities underwriting and derivatives trading has created record profits for Switzerland's three biggest banks - but the achievement could not have come at a more awkward time. As they cut costs in the competitive domestic retail market, the banks now risk political and consumer protest. The success of Union Bank of Switzerland, CS Holding, and Swiss Bank Corporation in diversifying into profitable forms of international business was rewarded spectacularly in the first half. Post-tax profits increased by 83 per cent, with trading income double that in the first half of 1992. This gave them a respectable 13 per cent return on capital, despite domestic returns of between 5 and 6 per cent. The three have suffered from low returns in the past because they have high ratios of equity to assets. They have maintained their solidity at the expense of short-term returns. But concerns over the sustainability of trading revenue and risks associated with derivatives mean that each is trying to improve long-term profitability. This involves restructuring of domestic operations and some highly cautious provisioning against bad debts to provide a cushion for the future. 'The trading side is volatile and makes us vulnerable,' says Mr Josef Ackermann, chief executive of CS Holding's Credit Suisse. 'The things which will remain with us are cuts in costs and a high level of provisions.' Mr Ackermann says the big three must be cautious because the Swiss economic outlook is uncertain. The Swiss domestic market is characterised by high levels of competition and slim interest margins. Swiss banks also went through a period in the 1980s when they offered a large and expensive range of products to personal customers, and kept large networks of indistinguishable branches. The banks face political problems in improving net interest margins from the current level of 1.4 per cent. They have been unable to match the rise in mortgage margins achieved in other countries because of public antagonism. Customers are also astute at not leaving interest-free deposits. This means that attention has focused on cost-cutting and simplifying products. Mr Robert Studer, chief executive of UBS, says: 'In the 1980s all the banks introduced products of a sophistication that the customer did not want or understand, and certainly was not prepared to pay for.' Cost-cutting has been given impetus by the acquisition of the fourth largest bank - Swiss Volksbank - by what was the third largest by asset size, CS Holding. It is estimated by Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, that cost-cutting could improve domestic operating profits by 15 per cent by 1995. But the CSH/Volksbank deal has also reinforced the banks' contest for size. Mr George Blum, chief executive of Swiss Bank Corporation, says his domestic priority is to increase market share by measures that include buying small banks, and using unspecified new distribution channels. Mr Blum emphasises that SBC will do all it can this year to make bad debt provisions high enough to ensure a profits gain from falling provisions over the next few. 'It is best for them to be as high as possible in the special circumstances of this year to give us a totally safe base,' he says. The challenges in international operations are different. The banks have gained by not making similar mistakes to those of US and European banks which expanded into loss-making retail overseas operation in the 1980s. Instead, they have concentrated on more profitable corporate and securities businesses. The banks have gained from their derivatives strength as currency and interest rate volatility have drawn huge demand from corporate customers for risk management services. SBC's derivatives liabilities and credit substitutes alone rose by about a third last year from SFr1,017bn to SFr1,544bn. While the banks' strong capital is likely to help them keep their market share, concerns focus on narrowing of margins and trading risk. Mr Ackermann says that 'derivatives are here to stay', but adds that he expects margins to narrow for plain derivative products over the next few years. But the banks are optimistic that they can sustain international profits by expanding in securities and banking markets where they are underdeveloped. 'If we can expand our infrastructure, we can get stable income from markets where we've had a limited role,' says Mr Ackermann. The biggest strategic question facing the banks is whether they can maintain their approach of valuing capital strength at least as highly as return on equity. With US banks achieving returns on common equity of 15 to 20 per cent on strengthened capital, pressures may mount. In one sense, the world is moving in the direction of the big three. There is a growing international emphasis on strong capital ratios in businesses such as securities underwriting and derivatives. The Basle accord on minimum capital ratios has also encouraged banks to meet Swiss standards. Nonetheless, Switzerland is not immune from shareholder activism, with UBS already facing a legal challenge from BK Vision, the investments company which holds a 15 per cent stake. There could be external pressures to concentrate on higher earning businesses to raise overall returns. Mr Blum says that if SBC can produce returns above 10 per cent in future he will be 'very happy', but he does not regard it as the sole target. 'If we cannot, then so be it. What is the alternative? To reduce our capital would be crazy because that is the base of confidence in the bank,' he says. Mr Studer says that it would be wrong to depend too strongly on short-term equity returns. It must sustain types of activity which contribute to overall profits. 'We are an ocean steamer not a small boat on a lake, and you cannot try to move us as quickly as a small boat,' he says.</p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Arnotts' increase puts pressure on Campbell Soup ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit-maker, yesterday announced a sharp rise in first-quarter profits, putting more pressure on Campbell Soup, the US food company, to increase its ADollars 8.80-a-share hostile takeover bid. Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts' chairman, said net profits for the three months to September 30 rose by 33.9 per cent to ADollars 17.53m (USDollars 12.59m) from ADollars 13.09m a year earlier. Mr Purdy said the board expected the increase in full-year profits to be 'at least in line' with the the first quarter. The result reflected a significant increase in earnings from Arnotts' core biscuit operations, together with a modest recovery by its Macadamia nut division. Mr Purdy said the improvement followed restructuring, a return to core activities and the successful introduction of new products, which had led to higher productivity and better profit margins, Turnover fell 6.5 per cent to ADollars 186.7m, reflecting the sale of a number of loss-making businesses. The group said sales of core businesses were 7.5 per cent higher. Net profits were ADollars 40m in the year to June 30 after abnormal restructuring costs of ADollars 11.8m. Campbell is seeking a 17.2 per cent stake in Arnotts to add to its existing 33 per cent shareholding. The bid values the company at ADollars 1.2bn, but Campbell would pay only ADollars 209m to gain control. Arnotts shares have traded above the offer price since the bid was announced two weeks ago. The shares closed 1 cent higher on the Australian stock exchange yesterday at ADollars 9.13. Mr Tony Sullivan, Arnotts' finance director, said the 'very good result' suggested that Campbell's offer 'severely undervalues the company.' He said a fair price would be more than ADollars 11 a share. However, Baring Brothers and Burrows, the investment bank which is advising Campbell, said the result would not force Campbell to increase its offer. Baring said the profits were 'under estimates made by several leading analysts, and are no better than the consensus figure among analysts of ADollars 70m.'</p>

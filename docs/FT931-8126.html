			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Airtours/Owners Abroad The Office of Fair Trading has been taking an uncommonly long time to decide whether to refer Airtours' Pounds 221m bid for Owners Abroad to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. This is surprising, given there is such a strong prima facie case for examining the competition issues. Consumer groups believe the acquisition would accelerate the trend towards vertical integration, hurting small operators. Even Airtours was arguing this line in its 1991 annual report before the bid. It boasted about the advantages of integration which it claimed was making it difficult for new entrants to distribute their products. A referral would theoretically leave Owners free to pursue its preferred strategic alliance with Thomas Cook. Shareholders might reject that proposal, however, if they thought there was any chance of Airtours returning to the fray. To date, Airtours has not said whether it will bid again if its offer is cleared. But it might do so, considering its arguments appear to be winning over the City. Owners has a lacklustre record. This week's annual report, containing some worrying contingent liabilities, have not improved shareholder loyalty. A cash sweetener from Airtours could well seal its eventual success. But those investors who regard tour operators with suspicion have been given further reason to shun the sector. Owners' focus on Airtours' vulnerability to price wars will have only reinforced their prejudice.</p>

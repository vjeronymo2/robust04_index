			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk told journalists  following the Supreme Soviet [as received] Friday session that  338 deputies elected to new Ukrainian parliament were too few to  make what he called cardinal decisions.    He expressed the hope that there would be a sufficient  number  of deputies to form a government, pass legislation and change  the Constitution, for instance 430 or 440 deputies.    The run-off elections in 112 constituencies are scheduled  for  26 June.    Kravchuk did not say whether he would run for president. He  only expressed his gratitude to those who want him to. The  registration of presidential candidates will end on April 26.    He said that both the right and left-wing extremists in the  new Supreme Soviet were ideologically Bolsheviks doing harm to  Ukraine.</p>

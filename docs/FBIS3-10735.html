			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Former APRA [American Popular Revolutionary  Alliance] Secretary General Luis Alva Castro acknowledged that  there is a real crisis in his party, admitting also that many  mistakes were made during the administration of Alan Garcia.    He said, however, that the crisis is not affecting the APRA  alone, but, in general, all parties in Peru and the rest of the  world. "As far as we are concerned, enormous efforts are being  made to make renewed and updated proposals that can convey a  message of hope to people," he said.    As for the mistakes made during the APRA government, he said  that despite this, it should be admitted that there were major  achievements like decentralization, which produced the  democratization and transformation of the state, giving towns  the opportunity to independently build their own future.    He said: "Unfortunately, all this has been left behind  because we are a country in which centralism prevails."    In this regard, Alva Castro said the future and history will  make a much more accurate balance, without either annoyance or  passion.    "Let us allow the party and its leaders to build the future  for the consolidation of this institution so that it will  continue to contribute with its experience to the country's  sociopolitical development," he said.    He explained that APRA still has political weight in the  country, and that the clearest proof of this was seen on 18  February on the occasion of the meeting for the Day of APRA  Solidarity.    "The party has social power, and it is fully convinced that  its leaders and members will join efforts to find a renewed  image. That is why we will participate in the 1995 elections. We  will choose a presidential candidate later," Alva Castro said.    Concerning former President Alan Garcia's new work as  novelist, he said he has the right to use his knowledge, talent,  and capacity in literature. "This occurs because Alan has  decided to stay far from the current national situation," he  said.</p>

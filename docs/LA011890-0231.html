			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> '86 CAMARO TOPS THIEVES LIST  </P> <P> The 1986 Chevrolet Camaro topped a list of the nation's most-stolen vehicles,  thanks in part to the interchangeability of its parts with other General Motors  Corp. cars, an insurance valuation company said.  </P> <P> A list compiled by CCC Information Services Inc. of Chicago showed the 1986  Camaro again in first place.  </P> <P> It was followed by the 1987, '84 and '85 models of the Camaro. Camaros also  held the top four spots on the most-stolen list for 1988.  </P> <P> The 1988 Hyundai Excel GL, at No. 10, was the only car not made by GM that was  in the top 10 among car thieves.  </P> <P> The thieves, for the most part, are parts suppliers, CCC Vice President William  Geen said. And interchangeability of parts, such as between the Firebird and  Camaro, makes those cars more likely candidates for theft.  </P></p>

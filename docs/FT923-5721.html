			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Letter: Rise in UK exports vital for companies' survival Sir, Our worsening trade figures indicate that the UK is on track for a Pounds 10bn deficit in 1992. It is perhaps instructive that the figures were published on August 24, the same day as your article, ''Heads buried in the sand' over VAT rules', which pointed out that nearly 90 per cent of UK businesses are not yet prepared for VAT reporting in the single market. Until and unless exports feature as a priority on every chief executive's agenda, our balance of trade will remain negative. Sterling will stay under pressure, and interest rates, home repossessions and unemployment will continue to rise. UK companies must export more - not only to prosper, but to survive. Ian J Campbell, director-general, Institute of Export, Export House, 64 Clifton Street, London EC2A 4HB</p>

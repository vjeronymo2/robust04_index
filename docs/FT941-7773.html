			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI advances to Pounds 251m at nine months Pre-tax profits of Thorn EMI rose from Pounds 245m to Pounds 251.1m in the nine months to December 31. Turnover of Pounds 3.31bn compared with Pounds 3.29bn. The group was reporting quarterly profits for the first time. Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, said that although Christmas sales had been encouraging, they were now flat. He said: 'It's not doom and gloom, but it's not sunshine and light either.' Operating profits of continuing operations rose from Pounds 236.9m to Pounds 291.4m. After tax of Pounds 95.8m (Pounds 78.1m) and minorities, attributable profits were Pounds 5m lower at Pounds 151m. Music profits rose 39 per cent to Pounds 212m while rental profits were up 12.6 per cent to Pounds 90.4m. The HMV music chain saw profits advance to Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 1.9m). Security and electronics lost Pounds 17.5m, compared with a Pounds 2.2m profit. At period end net borrowings had been reduced to Pounds 534.8m (Pounds 761.5m) mainly resulting from disposals. Mr Warren Rudman, the former US Senator, said yesterday that Thorn EMI's American rental business provided many consumers with access to goods they would not otherwise have had. Mr Rudman was speaking after the conclusion of his investigation into alleged malpractice at Thorn's Rent-A-Center subsidiary. He said it was untrue that Rent-A-Center relied exclusively on poor customers who were open to exploitation. The investigation, he said, had found that 19 per cent of Rent-A-Center customers had annual household incomes of more than Dollars 40,000 (Pounds 27,000). A further 39 per cent had incomes of between Dollars 20,000 and Dollars 40,000. Mr Rudman said he had relied on three sources in preparing his 250-page report, which will be published in a few weeks' time.</p>

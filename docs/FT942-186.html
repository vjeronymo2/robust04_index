			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Fidelity drops exit charges on Peps Fidelity Investments, one of the top five providers of personal equity plans, is to abolish withdrawal charges on its tax-free Pep unit trusts from Monday. It will instead raise the initial charge from 2 per cent to 3 per cent from August 1, barely two years after introducing the new combined charging structure into the UK. Annual charges will continue to be levied by the underlying fund. Ms Mary Blair, executive director for product development, said market research had shown that investors found withdrawal charges confusing. In June 1992, Fidelity cut the initial charge on all its unit trust Peps from 5.25 per cent to 2 per cent and introduced tapering exit charges over three years. Other fund management groups followed. In May, Gartmore said it would abandon withdrawal charges on its unit trust Peps because of investor confusion over the charges and increase the initial charge from 2 per cent to 3 per cent. However, Gartmore and Fidelity said that the level of early redemptions on the Peps has been very low, while Ms Blair said that the difference between an initial charge of 2 per cent and 3 per cent was not great in investors' eyes.</p>

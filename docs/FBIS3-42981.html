			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by R. Levin: ``Cosmic Horizons of Russian </F> Communications'']    [Text] At the center of attention of  organizers and guests of the press conference held in February  at the press center of the RF Ministry of Foreign Affairs were  questions of satellite communications, its present and future.  Journalists talked about this topic (heretofore largely  ``closed'' to the mass media) with the leaders of legislative  bodies, industries, agencies and, of course, scientists whose  efforts are largely responsible for the fame of our engineering  work in space, including satellite communications. The reason  for the meeting was launching of the ``Rossiya'' Program of  Development of Satellite Communications and Broadcasting  approved by our nation's government last year.    Speedy updating of communication facilities has recently  come  to be one of the main concerns of the Russian Government. It has  become abundantly clear that without up-to-date  telecommunications, we cannot set up an effective mechanism of  economic reform and integrate ourselves into the international  community. Reaching this goal over the great expanse of our  nation is no easy matter, and therefore organization of  communications via satellite with many remote regions is not  only more advantageous than building relay lines or laying  cables, but at times is the only way to get information  ``cargo'' to and from these places. Of course, this is not just  a matter of telephone calls or data transmission, but also of  television broadcasting of local and national programs.    However, as witnessed by RF Minister of Communications V. B.  Bulgak, the current level of development of communications  cannot be considered satisfactory. The communication satellites  now in use were developed in the seventies, and therefore are  not up to today's world level in throughput and performance.  Moreover, there is a shortage not only of the satellites  themselves, but also of ground stations, which is slowing down  the development of communications and television broadcasting in  many regions of the Russian ``boondocks.'' Last year, the  fraction of satellite communication lines was only 6 percent of  the total volume of international channels in the nation, while  actual demand was at least 20 percent. Many reasons have been  named for such a sad situation, among which one of the main ones  is the disproportion evolved in the past between the number of  military and civilian satellites. Figures have even been cited:  to 140 of the former there have been only 36 of the latter, and  of those 36 only 10 were designed for communications and  broadcasting. So one of the main goals of Russian communication  satellite doctrine is conversion of defense satellites.    Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to assume that mere  launching of new satellites or defense conversion of old ones is  a panacea. Dozens of satellites may be placed in orbit, but  nothing would be accomplished. We need a developed reception  network, as otherwise we will be throwing money ``into space''in  a real sense. We must uniformly develop the satellite and ground  segments, making a much greater investment in the latter than is  now the case. And incidentally, even without launching new  satellites, we could cover all of Siberia today with TV  broadcasts; however, the ``satellite potential'' is not being  completely used because of a lack of ground stations.    To correct the situation that has evolved, a Program of  Development of Satellite Communications and Broadcasting has  been approved; implementation of this Program will enable us to  provide telephone service to inaccessible and remote regions of  Russia, to set up new main networks, to organize mobile  satellite communication, to considerably increase the volume of  data transmission and the number of international channels, and  also to provide multiple-program television broadcasting over  the entire territory of the nation. In accordance with the  intention of the developers of the Program (Scientific  Production Association of Applied Mechanics, Scientific Research  Institute of Radio, Central Scientific Research Institute of  Communications, ``Avtomatika'' Production Association and  ``Iskra'' Production Association), the entire satellite  communication system will consist of three subsystems: fixed  satellite service, mobile communications, and direct television  broadcasting.    Within the scope of the first subsystem, trunk and  international communication lines will be organized, as well as  lines of intrazonal and rural communications, business  communications and data networks. Priority will be given to  zonal and local communications, particularly in regions of the  Far North, Siberia and the Far East, where communication is  possible generally only via satellite. The subsystem of mobile  communications will connect subscribers of mobile and remote  facilities: ships and aircraft, railroad transport and the like  situated not only on the territory of Russia, but also beyond  its borders. Finally, direct television broadcasting will be the  base for organizing universal coverage by two national TV  programs and also local (regional) programs.    To handle these tasks, new advanced satellites are to be  developed as outlined by Academician M. F. Reshetnov, general  designer and director general of the Scientific Production  Association of Applied Mechanics. Incidentally, not many of us  had ever even heard of the SPA of AM. Situated in the formerly  classified city of Krasnoyarsk-23, this enterprise for several  decades has been the center of realization of nearly all our  space programs, both military and civilian. But, of course,  defense purposes predominated. The SPA of AM is now ``beating  swords into plowshares,'' and to that end a joint-stock company  of the same name has already been set up within the scope of the  Association, dealing with the business of bringing life to the  Program of development of Russian satellite communications,  mainly on a commercial basis.    Work is in progress today at the SPA of AM on new  satellites:  ``Gals,'' ``Ekspress,'' ``Arkos,'' ``Gonets,'' ``Sovkanstar''  and ``Mayak.'' These will not just replace their predecessors in  orbit, but will take on some new functions as well. For example,  the well known ``Gorizont'' satellites will be gradually  replaced by ``Ekspress'' satellites that will begin operating  next year. The first ``Ekspress'' will be launched this year.  The new satellites will support transmission of television  programs, as well as telephony signals and data. For these  satellites, the Scientific Research Institute of Radio is  developing new ground stations with antennas 2.5-4 m in  diameter. And in a few years, the ``Ekspress-M'' satellite is to  be launched, which will need a ``dish'' only 0.9-1.5 m in  diameter for signal reception.    According to tentative estimates, introduction of  ``Ekspress'' satellites will quadruple or quintuple the  throughput of the satellite communication system, and the  lifetime of the satellite itself will be more than doubled. The  increased throughput of the ``Ekspress'' trunks will be made  possible by the use of new multiple access equipment with FDM  and TDM, high-speed modems in ground stations, and the use of  statistical multiplexing equipment in the latter.    Quite promising is the prospect of introducing low-orbit  ``Gonets'' satellites that will be used to transmit various  kinds of information, including signals for E-mail service. The  whole world is showing interest in low-orbit satellites, though  we have been using them for decades, strictly for military  purposes, of course. The principal advantages of communication  systems with such satellites are low cost, and the capability of  using simple and inexpensive terminals. The SPA of AM is now  working on the first civilian low-orbit satellite, which last  year was granted a ``visa'' for the radio band of 300/400 MHz by  the World Administrative Conference on Radio Frequencies  (WACR-92). Plans call for launching 36 ``Gonets'' satellites  into circular orbit at an altitude of about 1500 km. The  low-orbit satellite system should begin working in 1994-1995.    Another new thing learned by those attending the press  conference: ``Gals'' satellites with three-band on-board relay,  and ``Gals-R'' satellites with four-band relay. This equipment  can be used to organize regional television broadcasting to  individual small-sized receiver stations. Five sets will be  integrated into a group to provide relay broadcasting to five  two-hour time zones of as many as four television and radio  programs. For signal reception from ``Gals,'' the Scientific  Research Institute of Radio has developed ground stations with  antennas 2.5 and 1.5 m in diameter (professional) and 0.9 m in  diameter (individual).    Nor did speakers fail to give attention to the ``Marafon''  mobile satellite system, which has been a topic of discussion  for several years. It turns out that it will be introduced in  the not very distant future. ``Arkos'' satellites are to be  launched into geostationary orbit next year, and ``Mayak''  satellites will be put into highly elliptical orbit in  1995-1996. Five ``Arkoses'' and four ``Mayaks'' will be the  basis of the ``Marafon'' system that will begin to operate in  full volume early next century. The throughput of the future  system will be 1800-2000 telephone channels.    Naturally, the expense of implementing such an ambitious  Program will be enormous. The handouts at the press conference  gave a figure of 13 billion rubles for the period from 1992  through the year 2000 in 1991 prices. Where do we intend to get  this money? It was explained that only 9.8 percent of this sum  will be taken from the federal budget. All the rest will come  from monies outside the budget. It is proposed that interest be  maximized on the part of Russian businessmen and foreign  investors. The SPA of AM has already made good progress in  accumulating experience in such business activity by offering to  lease Russian satellites to foreign companies, including  launching services and technical support.    Another example of international cooperation in space is the  Russian- Canadian project ``Sovkanstar,'' providing for setting  up an international commercial satellite communication system to  cover Russia and several other nations. Our specialists will  design the satellite platform, and the Canadians will design the  payload: a relay and antennas with minimum weight and energy  consumption. Provisions also call for production of inexpensive  Russian ground stations with antennas 2.5 and 1.5 m in diameter  intended for business communications. In a word, our work in  aeronautics and space, which has recently been on the brink of  economic disaster, may now become a rather lucrative business.</p>

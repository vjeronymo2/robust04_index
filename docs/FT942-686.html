			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Observer: Wrong track Whatever one thinks about the wisdom of Railtrack's dispute with the country's signalmen, the presentation of its case has been pretty abysmal. What has been on offer seems to have been chopped and changed at short notice and Railtrack's explanation of its position has been mind-bogglingly complex. It's all the more surprising because Railtrack chairman Bob Horton can be a pretty forceful communicator himself and had even hired a former Labour party spin-doctor, Lesley Smith, to be his head of government and public affairs. If anyone knew how to defuse the opposition, it should have been a professional like Smith. Indeed, one wonders whether her heart is really in the job.</p>

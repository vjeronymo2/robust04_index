			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Achille Occhetto, secretary of the Italian </F> Democratic Party of the Left, by Alberto Leiss in Bologna; date  not given: "Progressive Forces, the Historic New Factor" --  first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction]    [Text] Bologna -- The final days of the election campaign  are threatening to reach white heat. [Forza Italia leader  Silvio] Berlusconi and Fininvest are issuing a sharp response to  the rumors of links between the Arcore [Berlusconi's residence]  group and Mafia business. Organized crime has murdered a priest  who spoke out against the Camorra. The war of opposing  manipulations of the many inquiries opened by the judiciary is  increasing exponentially. This does not seem like the best  climate for the birth of the long awaited "Second Republic."  Particularly in commentaries in the major newspapers, there is  an extraordinary turn against the possibility of a  "bipolarization" of the political system, so enthusiastically  supported throughout the referendum campaign. There is a  nostalgic turning of attention back to the "center," but it is  difficult to observe for long the group comprising Zanone  [leader of the Italian Liberal Party, PLI], Martinazzoli  [secretary of the Italian Popular Party, PPI], and La Malfa  [leader of the Italian Republican Party, PRI]. We discussed all  this with Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the  Left, PDS] during a pause in his two day visit to Bologna,  before his television debate with Berlusconi, to be broadcast  this evening on Channel 5. His remarks -- on the eve of an  election that will in any case be historic -- were connected by  a thread: the voice of political reason must be allowed to  speak once more, but it must be a truly new politics.    [Leiss] Are we about to witness a violent "reckoning?" In  connection with the alleged relations between the Mafia and  Fininvest. Berlusconi denies having reported a "bloodless  coup." But he and Fedele Confalonieri, the group's chairman, are  talking in terms of crazy accusations, a campaign of lies, some  kind of conspiracy.    [Occhetto] I do not know who Berlusconi is referring to when  he talks about a conspiracy in connection with relations between  the Mafia and his group. What I can say is that he certainly  cannot be referring to us. In the frank and open broadcast  telephone discussion that I had with him -- which he himself  acknowledged was a civilized one -- I did not question the  judiciary's activities, unlike what his friend, Craxi [former  Italian Socialist Party secretary], is doing. I am simply  proceeding from an undeniable fact -- the statement by Mafia  boss Piromalli, in support of Forza Italia. So there is nothing  hidden and no "campaign." After all, I also gave him a chance  to say right away, I reject that. It is not my fault that he  hesitated, even though the broadcast lasted an hour.    [Leiss] But he did say in Palermo: Forza Italia's votes are  directed against the Mafia. Is that not enough?    [Occhetto] I certainly do not want to criminalize all the  votes that Forza Italia receives. However, that statement is  too general. Unless it is corroborated by explicit statements  about government options and measures to really counter the  Mafia, some scope for ambiguity still remains.    [Leiss] The controversy over the role of the judiciary has  been revived, too. The rumors about charges of Fininvest's  association with the Mafia started right on cue, the moment  Berlusconi arrived in Palermo. For that matter, the PDS has not  been spared in this election campaign, either: Stefanini's  custody pending trial, Vincenzo Visco's subpoena to appear as a  witness in the Cusani trial....    [Occhetto] If there is any timing that prompts suspicions,  the things you mentioned show that it does not affect only one  side. I would like to add that the matters relating to us are  connected with events that will certainly be clarified -- at the  investigation stage, I believe.    [Leiss] But has there not been some overprotectiveness on  the  part of the Left? This is the charge leveled by some radicals  who opted to side with the Right. Writing in CORRIERE DELLA  SERA, Angelo Panebianco said that the judiciary wields too much  power at present.    [Occhetto] If the judiciary seems so strong now, it is  because the balance has been upset on the political side, as I  have said many times. The political authorities have shown  themselves to be greatly compromised. Not only that, but they  have responded to the inquiries in the worst possible way -- I  am thinking here about Craxi and also about the arrogant  behavior of some businessmen. They thought that they could still  exploit their power to halt a process which was in fact  unstoppable. And they have created a disaster, causing two  results -- a profound delegitimization and destabilization of  politics and excessive attention on the judiciary. Only the  restoration of the authority of politics can restore the  disrupted balance. As for us, I remain convinced that we were  right to support the anticorruption investigations. This,  because it brought to light the indefensible reality of Bribe  City. The judiciary's work has been crucial and useful, though  some judges may have made some mistakes and some initiatives may  have been taken that are open to criticism with regard to the  aspect of guarantees and form.    [Leiss] Certain mistakes could be irreversible a few days  away from the elections....    [Occhetto] The judges cannot suspend their inquiries every  time there is an election. Of course, I hope that in such a  delicate situation for the country they will be able to  distinguish between actions, however legitimate, that could  acquire a propaganda flavor, albeit involuntarily, and actions  indispensable for the consistent pursuit of their inquiries.    [Leiss] One final question on this delicate topic. People  are talking again -- Judge Davigo, among others, has done so --  about the need for a political solution to Bribe City. Is this  not a crucial element in a government program?    [Occhetto] The only real solution is the establishment of a  new leadership class, an authoritative political system. We are  opposed to a "whitewash." The new government must provide all  the instruments and resources that the judiciary needs to ensure  that trials are held promptly and that clear sentences put an  end to this very sad chapter in our history.    [Leiss] Among the imbalances among the authorities that you  mentioned, is there not also that caused by the entry into the  arena of a big businessman owning half Italy's media organs, who  also has his sights set on the prime ministership?    [Occhetto] Undoubtedly. Berlusconi complains that he is  under attack from lobbies of rivals. But how was it possible  not to predict that there would be a reaction on the part of  those who can see a major competitor, who is also a great  communicator, in the race to gain political power, too? This  power would enable him to appoint directors to both public and  private television networks, to back legislation that benefits  his own vested interests. So much for liberal democracy! It is  enough to make [French philosopher] Montesquieu, whose principle  was the separation of authorities, turn in his tomb.    [Leiss] Many people now attribute this confusion to the  illusion of a "bipolar" system. The sharp rivalry between Right  and Left is a bad thing. The law resulting from the referendums  is a bad one, and people are turning their attention back to the  center.    [Occhetto] The law is not a good one, and it is the result  of  a miscalculation. Those who promoted it -- certainly not we,  who fought for a two-round system -- thought that the PDS would  not succeed in forming a broad alliance. Instead, despite  attempts to exclude Rete and Communist Renewal, we have achieved  a historic innovation -- the alliance of progressive forces.  Now people are trying to make the voters believe that it is  impossible for one alignment to be victorious over the other.  But it is possible. Difficult, but possible.    [Leiss] However, political strategies seem to be focused on  the assumption that this will not happen. Martinazzoli and  Amato [Pact for Italy] are dreaming of a coalition government  comprising the PDS, the PPI, and perhaps the League, excluding  the "extremes." At his rallies Bossi devotes five minutes to  criticizing Occhetto and 40 minutes to insulting Berlusconi....    [Occhetto] That seems to me a correct and fair  proportion....    [Leiss] What about the suggestions emanating from the  center?    [Occhetto] In reply I will cite what Pietro Scoppola and  other democratic Catholics have said. I am opposed to anything  that would suspend the process toward a system of rotation,  however much it may be hindered and obstructed by the mechanisms  of this electoral law. We must behave clearly within this new  rationale, law or no law. What if none of the three alignments  wins? Well, that situation too, if it comes about, must be  subordinated to the objective of a bipolar system, rejecting the  temptation to lapse back into the old mentality of alliances.    [Leiss] But how?    [Occhetto] By talking about policies, not alignments. Even  within the Popular Party and the "Pact," I remain convinced that  there is a great difference between the motivations of Segni  [Pact for Italy leader] and Rosy Bindi [PPI Venice regional  secretary]. The idea that the center could exploit a possible  stalemate by winning over part of the Right and part of the Left  is a new version of the DC's [Christian Democratic Party] old  "governability" theory. It is disheartening: Why was it  necessary to hold the referendums and to introduce a  first-past-the-post system just to achieve this? A continuing  process of decomposition and recomposition, conducted on the  basis of policies, would be another matter. With regard to  matters of substance, there are two poles of attraction, the  Right and the Left, which must demonstrate their ability to  attract the center.    [Leiss] Is this the same idea as the final destruction of  the  center?    [Occhetto] I am not talking about destruction. I do not want  to encourage the "wrecking" of this political area. What I am  saying is that the further disintegration of the center seems to  me to be an inevitable process. I know that a proper exchange  of views on policies will require absolute honesty among the  progressive forces, too, but this will be an obligation for the  others, too. Including the right-wing forces. Only thus, if we  want to continue the renewal, can we consistently fulfil the  citizens' wishes as expressed through their votes, if they do  not adequately identify a government majority. But I stress:  We must now work for the victory of a progressive majority.    [Leiss] Do you rule out an agreement on matters of policy  with the League? For instance, on the subject of federalism?    [Occhetto] Frankly, I do not see on the basis of what  policies such an agreement could be built. Its shameful  criticism of the concept of solidarity, especially of solidarity  between the north and south of the country, is too great a  negative factor for us. This, partly because it symbolizes a  whole vision of society. What kind of credibility could such an  alliance enjoy? If the League were really able to free its  federalist aspirations from their demagogic and separatist  encumbrances, then cooperation could prove possible in this  field in parliament.    [Leiss] The election campaign is reaching its conclusion.  What aspect of it has struck you most forcibly?    [Occhetto] I would say, the international attention on us.  The other evening in Naples, in that festive atmosphere, I  thought that because of the television news strike, I would not  be surrounded by television cameras, as usual. In fact all the  world's major television stations were there, starting with CNN.  I answered dozens of questions, which confidently took for  granted our victory, a government role for us. Nobody now,  except Berlusconi, is brandishing the bugaboo of "communism" any  more. And I was struck by something that Michel Rocard [French  Socialist Party secretary general] said in Genoa: "The whole of  Europe is watching you, and it would be crazy if there were a  victory for an unnatural government comprising the DC right, the  separatists of the League, and the neofascists of the MSI  [Italian Social Movement]." Is the fact that at our rallies so  much support has been shown for such people as Rocard, Glotz,  and the European group leader, Jean-Pierre Cot, not a sign that  the Italian Left really has embarked on a new chapter of its  history, no longer marked by the split between communists and  socialists?    [Leiss] The main event in this election campaign seems to be  the television debate between Occhetto and Berlusconi. Marcello  Flores has suggested that in the republic's new phase political  leaders appear on television no more than once every three  months. Do you agree with that?    [Occhetto] There is indeed something wrong in the  relationship between politics and television. I am not  convinced by the rules dictated by the watchdog committee.  After all, the forum of the political platform through which a  political leader can be questioned, calmly but closely, by  well-informed journalists is not so bad. In the discussions  involving several people, which are now the fashion, things are  not always clear. Facile quips prevail amid an atmosphere  rather more suited to a football match. It is exciting for the  fans of each side, but perhaps there is a broader public that  does not understand much of it and does not find it exciting.  Furthermore, the rivalry between the networks and the  superimposition of so many platforms has caused a kind of tower  of Babel. Flores' remark was excessive, a provocation. But it  is a move in the right direction. The direction of rules,  quality, selection. Not a television free-for-all.    [Leiss] Even some of Fininvest's television presenters have  entered the arena....    [Occhetto] That seems to me dangerous and unprecedented. In  such instances there should be prompt and strict action by the  monitoring authorities.    [Leiss] Are you worried about your "match" with Berlusconi?    [Occhetto] I read that he would have preferred to meet with  [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema, because he likes me as a person.  What is he doing -- counterattacking by flattering me? He might  succeed....</p>

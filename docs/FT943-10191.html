			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Reduced deficit for London Securities Reduced losses of Pounds 116,000, compared with Pounds 131,000, were announced by London Securities, the property investment and development group, for the six months to March 31. The result comprises rents, interest and dividend income of Pounds 4,000 (Pounds 7,000) less administrative expenses of Pounds 120,000 (Pounds 138,000). Losses per share were unchanged at 0.2p. The results only reflect income and expenditure deriving from and related to assets acquired on or after approval of the voluntary arrangement in October 1992. No surpluses for unsecured creditors arose in the period. The new board of directors, appointed last month, said it expected next month to announce proposals for the acquisition of certain properties from the Nu-Swift group.</p>

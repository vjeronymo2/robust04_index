			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Conference boost for women activists As the International Conference on Population and Development haggles its way to a conclusion this week, at least one group of women is already expressing delight at having been 'empowered' by the week-long gathering. These are the hundreds of women who dominate membership of the 450 Egyptian non-governmental organisations attending the conference. After years of battling for their causes disparately and under the tight control of the Ministry of Social Affairs, traditionally suspicious of anything which could be construed as political organisations, they suddenly won the trust of the Egyptian government during preparations for the conference. 'It all started with Mr Maher Mahran (Egypt's population minister) recognising the importance of NGO participation in the conference,' says Mrs Sarah Loza, co-ordinator of the Egyptian NGOs gender equity committee. 'Since Egypt was hosting the conference, he knew it had to have a leading role.' Mr Mahran, she says, suggested Egypt's NGOs establish a 15-strong steering committee (of which 11 are women) to co-ordinate their approach to the conference. In a country where the areas of political participation - particularly for women - are heavily circumscribed, the effect appears to have been galvanising. 'Through the ICPD, the government of Egypt recognised the NGOs for the first time as solid partners,' says Mrs Loza. 'It's a fantastic start. It's the first time Egyptian NGOs have come together to form a set of recommendations and have been given complete freedom to do so.' National Societies, as NGOs are dubbed in Egypt, have operated under strict controls since the 1960s, when the socialist government of Gamal Abdul Nasser kept an iron hand on all social and political groups. The Nasserite Law 32, passed in 1964, not only restricted creation of new organisations, but heavily constrained NGO activities by allowing the Ministry of Social Affairs to repeal internal decisions made by these organisations and giving the government powers to disband them at will. The government had traditionally tolerated such groups largely as entities to carry out its own policies. Stripped of any real legal status, Egypt's NGOs therefore had limited influence on the country's development or population policies, operating in many cases like a diffuse set of charity organisations. But preparations for the population conference looks to have changed that. The steering committee, for instance, has submitted recommendations to Mr Mahran for the revision of Law 32 and for a raft of changes to the legal status of women in Egypt, including easing restrictions on abortion during the first three months where the pregnancy is unwanted and due to the failure of contraception, and on the rights of Egyptian women married to foreigners to hand their nationality down to their children. Many among the NGOs say their new status arises from the realisation in the government that empowering such groups could help create a bulwark in Egypt against the creeping influence in other areas of civil society of Islamic groups, particularly the Moslem Brotherhood. The Brotherhood is Egypt's largest informal organisation and its members dominate key professional associations such as the lawyers and doctors syndicates.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 31 May issue  of the Cairo Arabic-language newspaper AL-SHA'B summarizes  articles that are Islamic in nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Muslim Brothers, Labor Party Youths Arrested    2. Government Campaign Against Muslim Brotherhood Criticized    3. Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Defends Group  <H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERS, LABOR PARTY YOUTHS ARRESTED </H5>   An unattributed 120-word report on page 1 of AL-SHA'B says  that "within the framework of the mounting government campaign  against the Muslim Brotherhood, the security forces have  arrested eight brothers. They were brought before the  prosecution, which ordered that they be detained for 15 days."  Among the imprisoned brothers is Ibrahim Sharaf, private  secretary of the general guide of the Muslim Brotherhood. They  were accused of belonging to an "illegal group."    In another unattributed 500-word report on page 3, the paper  writes about the arrest of Labor Party youths in various  governorates for distributing leaflets on the occasion of 'Id  al-Adha.  <H5>  GOVERNMENT CAMPAIGN AGAINST MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CRITICIZED </H5>   A 400-word article by Ahmad al-Suyufi on page 4 explains the  role of the security forces vis-a-vis the people. The writer  begins by explaining the difficult task of the security forces.  He says: "The security men in Egypt should be pitied. Our  impotent government has entrusted them with solving all the  problems of Egypt. The policemen are asked to resolve  political, economic, and social problems." They decide who is  an extremist, moderate, terrorist, or a good citizen. They also  decide which political parties cooperate with the government and  which oppose it, which is publications are enlightened and which  reckless, and which professional unions are good and which bad.  Problems are tackled by the security forces, not by the  politicians.    The writer then refers to the government campaign against  the  Muslim Brotherhood "just because they dare to voice their views  on our national issues." He asks: "What is their crime?  Frankly speaking, the issue is not detached from what is  happening everywhere in the world. What is happening to the  Brothers is not detached from what is happening in Bosnia,  Somalia, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Kashmir, Algeria, Tunisia, and  Burma. It is the same method and the hidden hands are the same.  No one will believe the nonsense that the Brothers stand behind  and encourage terrorism."  <H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD DEPUTY GUIDE DEFENDS GROUP </H5>   AL-SHA'B publishes on page 5 a 2,300-word article by Mustafa  Mashhur, deputy guide of the Muslim Brotherhood, in which he  defends the group against accusations of involvement in  terrorism. He begins by stressing that "not a single member of  the Muslim Brotherhood" has participated in any disturbances or  terrorist incidents during the past quarter century.  Nevertheless, he continues, "some tendentious writers have  continued to accuse the Brothers of involvement in terrorism and  violence, and to describe the groups that are known to embrace  violence as offspring of the Muslim Brotherhood." He says that  the Brothers at times have tried to respond to these writers and  refute their false accusations. The Muslim Brotherhood has  always emphasized its religious orientation and exercised its  legal activity through the official institutions, such as the  People's Assembly, the professional associations, faculty clubs  at educational institutions, and the local councils. "The  public," he says "became confident of our moderate methods,  which are far removed from violence and terrorism." But as soon  as the president said in an interview with the German  publication DER SPIEGEL that the Muslim Brotherhood encourages  extremists, the national press and their chief editors and  writers began attacking it and instigating the regime against  it. Sensational headlines began appearing in the press, linking  the Muslim Brotherhood with what happened at the Lawyers  Association.    Mashhur then gives a brief history of the Muslim Brotherhood  since 1948, when Hasan al-Banna was murdered for sending  fedayeen to confront the Zionist gangs in Palestine, and notes  that various state leaders have come and gone, but the Muslim  Brotherhood remains. He says that the Muslim Brotherhood  resumed their moderate, legitimate activity under President  Mubarak. The regime and some tendentious quarters were  displeased when the Islamists won in the Lawyers Association  elections.    Referring to the recent incidents at the Lawyers  Association,  Mashhur says: "I would like to emphasize that the Muslim  Brotherhood does not interfere in the internal affairs of the  associations." But, he continues, they are reassured that the  members abide by the correct Islamic behavior code. He also  denies accusations that the Muslim Brotherhood have exploited  the incident and turned public opinion against the regime.    Continuing his defense of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mashhur  says that al-Sadat once said that there is no politics in  religion and no religion in politics; we objected to this  saying. Al-Sadat later amended it and said that Islam is a  religion and a state. Mashhur expounds on this idea by saying  that Islam has from the beginning been a complete and  comprehensive religion, regulating the lives of people in the  political, economic, social, military, and other fields. Islam  is not just a religion. People must abide by its teachings in  all aspects of life. There is need for a state and government  to implement God's shari'ah.    Mashhur goes on to say that "it is unconstitutional to  prevent the Islamists from establishing a political party." He  says there is no proof that the establishment of an Islamic  political party in Egypt will be followed by the establishment  of a Christian party. The Muslim Brotherhood's relations with  the brother Copts has always been good. He stresses that "Islam  is the religion of justice, peace, freedom, and equality. It is  against dictatorship and oppression." What happened in Algeria  is that a regime, supported by the army, has destroyed the  democratic system and canceled the free elections which brought  the Islamists to power. It was not the Islamists who destroyed  democracy, he says.    Mashhur denies that the Muslim Brotherhood has a secret  apparatus or a military wing. He admits that they did have such  bodies in the 1940's when the Zionist gangs were fighting the  Palestinians and when the British colonialists occupied Egypt.  He says now conditions have changed, and "there is no more need  for a secret apparatus or a military wing. We support God and  His religion, which is the official religion of the state.  Regrettably, we find that the ruling regime is trying to curb  the activity of those who support God and His religion."    He continues: Some say that the Muslim Brotherhood's aim is  to seize power, after which it supposedly will prevent a  multiparty system. "We have denied this claim over and over.  We demand that government rule be according to the shari'ah,  but we do not demand to rule ourselves." We said if others  ruled according to the shari'ah, we would support them. Would  anyone seeking power for temporal gains and facing the  tribulations we have faced for half a century have persevered?  We demand rule according to the shari'ah; this is a religious  duty of every Muslim man and woman, rulers and subjects. "We  are fully convinced that Islam is the solution to all our  problems, because it comes from God, who created us and who  knows what is good and what is bad for us."    Mashhur concludes: "There is an international campaign by  the enemies of Islam led by the Zionists, the Western crusaders,  the Hindus, and others headed by the Zionist enemy and America.  They are fighting Islam and the Muslims, as we see everywhere."  These enemies think that with their material power they can  destroy Islam, but they delude themselves. God will safeguard  his religion, he says.</p>

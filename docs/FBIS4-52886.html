			<p>BFN     [Text] According to military sources, on 12 May, the U.S.  imperialists and the puppets conducted a provocative joint  aerial war exercise in the skies over South Korea aimed at  invading the North. Prior to this war exercise, fighter  bombers, pursuit-assault planes, and electronic jamming planes  took off from U.S. military bases in the Pacific and flew to  bases of the U.S. Air Force occupying South Korea.    This war exercise was conducted in the skies over Oeyon  Island and Yongwol. Squadrons based in overseas U.S. bases,  various fighter bombers, assault planes, observation planes, and  reconnaissance planes of the U.S. Air Force occupying South  Korea, and those of the puppet Air Force were massively  mobilized in this exercise.    Timed to coincide with this war exercise, KC-135 refueling  planes took off from overseas U.S. bases, prowled about in the  skies over Kwangju and Chungju, and refueled fighters which were  running amok in the war exercise for a war of Northward invasion.    That day, approximately 20 500-MD armed helicopters flew to  areas in Pochon, Yonchon, and Chorwon of Kangwon Province of  South Korea, which are close to the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ],  frantically launched midair firepower strikes, and supported  ground attacks. On the same day, the South Korean puppets  deployed tanks and large- caliber artillery groups of the puppet  Armed Forces to Paengnyong-ri and Chuhyon-ri of Paju County,  Kyonggi Province and, later, moved approximately 300 armed  bandits to Chungsu-ri, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County, Kangwon  Province of South Korea. In addition, 105-mm artillery units of  the puppet Armed Forces took up combat positions in Songok-ri,  Yonchon County, Kyonggi Province; Sangsa-ri and Kangsan-ri,  Chorwon County, Kangwon Province of South Korea; and Chomwon-ri,  Paju County, Kyonggi Province and fired approximately 100 rounds  of cannon to areas close to the DMZ along the Military  Demarcation Line.    The exercise commotions for a war of Northward invasion by  the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are a  deliberate provocation maneuver to aggravate the situation on  the Korean peninsula.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Thai Air alters funding plans Thai International Airways has temporarily shelved plans to issue USDollars 200m in Euro-convertible debentures because of a lack of demand in that market. Instead, it will mobilise funds worth some Dollars 686m to purchase the nine aircraft it expects to take delivery over the next two years. Some Bt11bn (Dollars 438.6m) will be raised with the issue of Y40bn (Dollars 388.3m) of samurai bonds to refinance the purchase of four Airbus A300-600s and one Boeing 747-200; Y6bn in Euro-commercial paper will be issued to refinance the outstanding cost of two Airbus A300-B4s. Mr Kasem Suwanagul, the airline's chairman, said that the airline would pay 'much lower interest rates of between 2 and 6 per cent for the bond and the commercial paper.' The finance ministry has also approved Thai Airways' plan to issue debentures, with warrants attached, worth Bt5bn in the domestic market towards future purchases. The company is also investigating other debt instruments; a medium-term note worth Dollars 200m will be issued with the support of the finance ministry, and a Japanese leverage lease will also cover USDollars 286m in purchase costs. The airline intends to take delivery of five Airbus A330-300s and one Boeing 747-400 this year and three more Airbus A330-300s next year. The refinancing exercise will save around Bt100m a year, Thai says. The airline is seeking a management consultant to help it improve its corporate image. The company wants to refurbish its staff uniforms and interior decoration, although the carrier will keep its colour scheme and logo.</p>

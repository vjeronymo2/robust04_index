			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Business hopes rise in north THE 23 CHAMBERS of commerce in Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Humberside yesterday reported steady economic improvement for the first quarter. Yorkshire and Humberside's 13 chambers said trading had improved beyond the levels of last summer, reflecting 'a slow but genuine increase in activity'. The 10 chambers in north-west England said domestic order books had improved for the first time in three years, with the number of manufacturers reporting increases outnumbering those reporting a continuing decline. But the Manchester chamber's economic committee urged caution until there were clearer signs of improved capacity utilisation. It also stressed that banks had a crucial role to play in providing working capital as recovery picks up. Banks have already warned that overdrafts will be harder to get than in the 1980s. Improvements in the last two quarters apply to domestic sales and orders, as well as investment in plant, machinery and buildings. Expectations of improved turnover and profit - the main measures of confidence - are strongly up. Exports are faltering in some markets, although Yorkshire and Humberside manufacturers are reporting strong quarter-on-quarter improvements. Between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of businesses have been recruiting, rather than shedding labour. Up to 40 per cent had continuing difficulties in finding the right people for posts. The Yorkshire and Humberside chambers surveyed 1,492 businesses. The north-west survey, co-ordinated by Manchester chamber's economic committee and Pieda, the economics consultancy, involved 778 businesses. Mr David Kern, chief economist at National Westminster Bank, sounded a note of caution yesterday about the economic recovery by forecasting that unemployment in London and the south-east would rise 13 per cent in the year ahead, compared with a national increase of 10 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Nevenka Mitrevska report: "Europeanization of the Greek </F> Blockade"]    [Text] Bonn, 16 Mar -- The Greek embargo and its possible  consequences for the stability of The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia [FYROM] and the whole region dominated the  discussions of President Kiro Gligorov during his meetings on  the second day of his working visit to the Federal Republic of  Germany. The FYROM president talked about that and about the  need for "Europeanization" with Mr. Karl Lammers, coordinator of  the parliamentary group of Christian Democratic Union; with Bonn  Mayor Hans Daniels; and also at lunch with former FRGB Foreign  Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Finally he had a two-hour  meeting with over 100 German and foreign journalists accredited  in Bonn. The German open disapproval of the latest act of the  government in Athens against FYROM was reaffirmed at every step.    "FYROM has played a significant, even a historical role in  safeguarding stability and peace in the south of the Balkans,  therefore also in Europe, which commits the European Union to  help FYROM in every way. This time Europe must not back down  and be in delay, as it did with Bosnia," Mr. Genscher said  during the lunch he had with President Gligorov.  <H5>  Nothing Can Be Solved With Pressure </H5>   The meeting between Gligorov and Genscher was initiated by  Genscher. The FYROM president described it as "very fruitful  and pleasant." Hans-Dietrich Genscher is not occupying an  official position at this moment; he is engaged in strategic  studies, but he is still considered as one of the current  architects of foreign policy in Germany. Therefore his  "recommendation" for Europeanization of the Greek blockade  against FYROM was not his private opinion.    That was also confirmed by Karl Lammers, the coordinator of  the parliamentary group of the Christian Democratic Union, with  whom President Gligorov started his working day. "The stance of  Germany and the European Union is that Greece must lift the  blockade immediately, because it does not coincide with the  principles of the Union, and not only affects the border with  Greece, but also the border of the European Union with a  neighboring country. I hope Greece will find a way to remove  this measure because it cannot use it to force the neighboring  country to anything," Mr. Lammers said at the end of the  discussions he had with President Gligorov. His assessment was  that the question of the blockade should be solved by the  Europeans, and not by the big powers, in order to avoid new  divisions, according to what he stated.  <H5>  The Reasonable Ones Talk, They Do Not Threaten </H5>   Another Greek characteristic during this visit of President  Gligorov, as has been the case with all his journeys in the past  two to three years, was the great number of Greek journalists  who followed him everywhere. They waited for him at the hotel,  at the residential houses and offices where he talked with his  hosts, they photographed him and repeatedly asked: Will FYROM  give up its flag so that Greece may remove the measures? The  Greeks were the most numerous, or at least the most intrusive at  today's news conference held by President Gligorov in Bonn.    Why does the FYROM insist on solving the dispute with Greece  in a "basket," and not issue by issue? Will Germany come out as  a new mediator in the FYROM-Greek dispute? What concessions is  FYROM ready to make? Is not the alternative road East-West not  an attempt to secede from Greece?    President Gligorov replied: "We had separate discussions,  one  question after the other. However, two years have passed.  Finally we must gather our courage, sit at a negotiating table,  and find solutions for the whole dispute in a basket. The  reasonable ones talk, they do not threaten." President Gligorov  also emphasized that FYROM and Greece, both being members of the  United Nations, are committed by a resolution to solve their  dispute.    "FYROM will suffer great damages with the embargo," Gligorov  said, "but so will Greece. Finally, we shall survive, but I  don't know if the fact that we shall have damages will help  Greece."    Asked about his opinion on the results of last week's start  of FYROM-Greek negotiations in Geneva, President Gligorov said  that "they are modest, but they clearly demonstrate that the  place to negotiate is in the United Nations. Two UN members  must respect the resolution adopted by the United Nations. We  are immediately ready to resume the negotiations, however not  under the embargo conditions and with a rope around the neck,  because it is not an equal and dignified position," President  Kiro Gligorov said at the news conference in Bonn.</p>

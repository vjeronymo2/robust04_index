			<p>Beijing     Rejects Political Compromise, Plays Down Economic  Threats                             SUMMARY     PRC authoritative media have reacted strongly to the Hong Kong  Legislative Council (Legco)'s adoption of the first stage of  Governor Christopher Patten's democratic reforms and to a Hong  Kong government "White Paper" on the contents of the aborted 1993  China-British talks, ruling out further negotiations with the  British and reaffirming China's previous decision to dismantle  any political institutions based on Patten's reforms after 1997.  At the same time, in an apparent effort to reassure foreign  investors and avoid actions that could jeopardize the European  Community's support for Beijing's GATT application, PRC media  have portrayed senior Chinese leaders as backing away from recent  threats to retaliate against British firms.                            END SUMMARY     Beijing's rejection of further negotiations with Britain over  Hong Kong's political future was authoritatively conveyed by a  spokesman of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State  Council on 24 February and reaffirmed by a Foreign Ministry  spokesman the same day.  The Chinese were reacting to the passage  by Legco on 24 February of the first stage of Patten's political  reforms and Patten's announcement the same day that he would  formally submit the remainder of his reforms to Legco on 9 March  and would publish a White Paper on the contents of the 17 rounds  of talks with the PRC in 1993 on Hong Kong's political future  (Hong Kong Asia television, 24 February).  Asserting that Beijing  would make good on its previous threats to terminate negotiations  and dismantle political institutions established without Chinese  consent if Legco adopted Patten's proposals, the Foreign Ministry  spokesman declared that "the door of the negotiations has been  closed by the British side" and "the framework of the  political system" established by Legco "cannot last beyond June  30, 1997."  Responsibility for "the disruption of cooperation  between China and Britain" on this issue, he said, "rests  entirely with the British" (Xinhua, 24 February).     Signaling Beijing's determination to accelerate plans to  establish its own institutions to govern Hong Kong after the  takeover, Premier Li Peng declared on 25 February during a  session with members of the Preliminary Work Committee (PWC)--a  group established last summer under the National People's  Congress to prepare for the Hong Kong transition--that the "PWC's  burdens and responsibilities have become even heavier and  greater" and called upon the members to "work harder and make  even greater contributions to Hong Kong's long-standing stability  and prosperity" (Xinhua).  Similarly, Lu Ping, director of the  State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office, warned that the  British were "trying to mislead Hong Kong people" by "spreading  the view" that the Hong Kong government based on Patten's reforms  "will not be terminated after 1 July 1997" and called for  "speeding up the working pace of the PWC" (Zhongguo Xinwen She,  26 February)     Countering the White Paper     In an apparent effort to bolster its political support in Hong  Kong, the PRC also mounted a media campaign to discredit the  British White Paper's version of the 1993 talks, first attacking  its credibility and Patten's motives, then issuing its own  version of the talks on 28 February (Xinhua).  Zhang Junsheng,  deputy director of Xinhua's Hong Kong branch, said in a 24  February interview that Britain's "unilateral move" to publicize  its version of the negotiations was intended to "deceive Hong  Kong people and mislead public opinion" (Xinhua).  On 28  February, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, commenting on a  lengthy Foreign Ministry version of what he claimed were the  "facts" concerning the talks, asserted that Patten's decision to  publish the White Paper was "designed" to "shirk its  responsibility for the rupture of the talks" (Xinhua, 28  February).  In the text of the document, publicized by Xinhua  that day, Beijing reiterated its position that the "core of the  controversy" was not about "whether democracy should be promoted"  as claimed by the British but "whether international commitments  should be honored."     Economic Reprisals Played Down     Despite the current political deadlock between the Chinese and  British over Hong Kong's political future, Beijing has, at least  for now, backed away from its recent threats of economic  reprisals against British firms and signaled its interest in  longterm British investment.  For example, backing away from  Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Wu  Yi's 28 January warning that the British Government's  "uncooperative attitude" on Hong Kong "is likely to affect Sino-  British trade ties" (Xinhua, 28 January), PRC Vice President  Rong Yiren was depicted by Xinhua on 24 February as cautiously  optimistic about the prospects for British investment  opportunities in China.  In a meeting that day with the chairman  of the prominent British multinational company John Swire and  Sons, Rong reiterated Beijing's contention that Britain's  "uncooperative approach" was to blame for the "current  difficulties on the Hong Kong issue," but he went on to emphasize  that both China and the British firm were "confident" about the  economic prospects of Hong Kong and China and to observe that  Swire "had been enlarging its business" in the region.  Xinhua  portrayed the British chairman as "willing" for his company to  engage in "long-term investment in Hong Kong and the Chinese  mainland."     Further suggesting a return to a more conciliatory approach on  economic relations, top Chinese officials have assured foreign  investors and the Hong Kong business community that its  uncompromising attitude on political reforms in Hong Kong will  not adversely affect economic ties.  For example, Vice Premier  Zhu Rongji reaffirmed China's commitment to the territory's  capitalist system after the takeover during a 25 February press  conference in Tokyo when he "reiterated" that China "will not  change the system in Hong Kong after 1997" (Xinhua, 25 February).  He went on to reassure the business community that "the Chinese  Government will continue to protect the interests of foreign-  funded firms" in Hong Kong.     Beijing's efforts to play down prospects of retaliation against  British firms may be linked in part to China's desire for  continued European Community (EC) support for its membership in  GATT.  PRC media used the recent visit to Beijing of EC Trade  Commissioner Leon Brittan to provide an upbeat assessment of EC  backing for China's application to GATT.  Xinhua of 28 February  reported that Brittan, at a joint news conference with MOFTEC  minister Wu Yi that day, announced that it would be "economically  beneficial" for "China and the whole world" to have China in  GATT.  Suggesting Beijing's efforts to avoid any overt threats of  economic reprisals, PRC media were not observed to carry Western  media accounts that EC Commissioner Brittan--in a response to Wu  Yi's assertion during the press conference that the political row  with Britain could affect economic ties--warned sharply that  retaliation against British firms would be "completely  unacceptable" to Europe (London Daily Telegraph, 1 March).     Implications     Beijing's refusal to compromise on Patten's political reforms and  determination to proceed with the establishment of a shadow  government in preparation for restructuring Hong Kong's  legislative institutions after 1997 reflects both Beijing's drive  to ensure total political control over Hong Kong after the  takeover and the acute sensitivity of China's ageing leaders to  perceived threats to China's "sovereignty," including political  pressure on senior leader Deng Xiaoping who has staked his  reputation on reclaiming Hong Kong from its colonial past.  At  the same time, China's decision to return to a more conciliatory  approach on economic relations likely reflects efforts to avoid  jeopardizing EC support for its GATT membership, and may signal a  leadership view that, given the failure of economic reprisals to  deter Legco from passing democratic reforms and Patten from  submitting his remaining proposals for a vote, Hong Kong's  stability is best served by maintaining strong ties to the  British business community.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jigme (2516 5019) and Luosang Zhaxi (3157 2718 </F> 2089 6007) from the "Regional News Hookup" program]    [Text] On 25 April, 12 members of the Tibetan  mountaineering team set off for a climb up Xixabangma Feng,  which is the world's 14th highest peak with an elevation of  8,012 meters above sea level. The climb up Xixabangma Feng is  yet another major feat taken by our skillful mountain climbers  after conquering the world's seventh highest peak, Mount  Dhaulagiri, and 10th highest peak, Mount Annapurna, in Nepal in  one vigorous effort last year.    Regional leaders Gyaincain Norbu, Namgyai, Gying Puncog  Cedain, and Lhamin Soinam Lhunzhub attended a mountaineering  mobilization assembly and gave the mountaineering team members a  send-off on 23 April.

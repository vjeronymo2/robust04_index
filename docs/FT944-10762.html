			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Watching for fall-out as dollar rates climb Now the mid-term elections are over, the US Federal Reserve can return from its sabbatical. The markets are assuming that the Fed open market committee will agree to raise short-term interest rates by at least half a percentage point when it meets next Tuesday. Astonishingly, short-term dollar rates are still lower than those on D-Marks, French francs and sterling despite higher inflation, a weak currency and a serious trade imbalance. However, the money market yield curve is artificially steep, and at six months dollars yield about 75 basis points more than D-Marks. Since the Fed last raised rates in August the dollar has weakened markedly, and so has the Treasury bond market. During August and September 10-year German government bonds outyielded the corresponding US Treasuries but now the T-bonds return 40 basis points more. Europe has managed to de-couple from the ailing dollar markets. Thus at the long end the 30-year T-bond yield has been moving up through 8.15 per cent. This has provided a weak background for the Treasury's auctions of bonds totalling Dollars 29bn (Pounds 17.6bn) yesterday and today. Although the US funding requirement is scarcely formidable in relation to the size of the economy, this is not a favourable time in the economic cycle for bonds. Not only are Americans notoriously unenthusiastic savers - nothing new there - but several main sources of demand have largely dried up. Flows into retail bond mutual funds have ceased this year in the face of capital losses, and modest (so far) rises in CD rates. Meanwhile foreigners are steering well clear of dollar bonds, at least until the Fed has tightened and it looks as though the dollar has bottomed. Then there is the problem of the banks. Until the bond market turned a year ago, US banks had bought more than Dollars 300bn of Treasury securities within about four years. They are now sellers, as the profitable spread over the carrying cost shrinks and meanwhile more attractive lending opportunities appear in the expanding US economy. The big question is whether they might become forced sellers. The huge interest rate spread available a year and more ago on two to five-year paper has been narrowed by the rise in overnight money costs from 3 to 4.75 per cent, but it would be much worse at 5.25 per cent, let alone the pre-emptive 5.75 per cent that the bears talk about; the positions would probably run at a loss and the banks might no long be prepared to maintain them to maturity. Nor will the story end there: by mid-1995 the market expects short rates to be at 6.5 per cent. A great deal depends on the extent to which the leveraged exposures in the US securities markets have been unwound. According to the Wall Street newsletter Grant's, very little: securities credit outstanding to banks, broker-dealers and households stood at Dollars 274bn at the end of June, having doubled in about three years. Meanwhile, the US equity market wriggles uncomfortably, trying to pretend that problems in bonds can be ring-fenced. The stock market is still only 4 per cent below its peak, although transports and utilities have sold off by a fifth. But if the long bond yield continues to edge up towards 8.5 per cent the pressures on equities may become unbearable. However, as the bulls argue, the bears have already had plenty of chances, and they have not taken them. Meanwhile there has been plenty of sector rotation to chase. The general summary of the US economy is that monetary policy has for several years been too loose. This has not shown up in exceptionally high monetary growth because the credit has been mopped up by the securities markets, or dollars have piled up abroad where Asian governments have been holding down their currencies. Nor has inflation been particularly high, because the balance of payments has taken much of the strain. Now the dollar overhang has become much more threatening, however, and policy must be sharply tightened. Yet Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has to move with care. Having saved the banking system in the late 1980s he surely does not want to have to rescue the securities markets.</p>

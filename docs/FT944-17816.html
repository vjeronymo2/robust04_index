			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Still much too close to call: Germany's small parties hold the Kohl government's future in their hands 'This time,' says the general election poster for Germany's liberal Free Democratic party, 'everything is at stake.' That could be painfully true for the FDP, the centre party of German politics and kingmaker in almost every coalition since 1949. In the general election on October 16, the party is in danger of being voted out of the Bundestag, the lower house of Germany's federal parliament, for the first time since the foundation of the federal republic 45 years ago. Yet the message of the poster means much more. This is the first election in an integrated, united Germany, with all the parties competing for votes in east and west under the same rules. The last election in 1990, immediately after unification, was carried out under special rules to ensure that the newly enfranchised easterners were adequately represented in the German parliament. And in the euphoria of the moment, many voters, especially in the east, endorsed the 'unity chancellor'  -Mr Helmut Kohl. The results of the 1994 election will show not just how the players have changed, but how the playing field has been transformed by the advent of 17m new inhabitants emerging from 40 years of communist dictatorship. With just 10 days to go before the poll, the result is too close to call. The Bundestag will still be dominated by Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its great rivals, the Social Democratic party (SPD). But nobody knows which other parties will scrape in alongside them. Yet the make-up of the next German government will be dictated by the small parties  -the FDP, the Greens, and the party of Democratic Socialism, the reformed east German communists. The Greens - who failed to gain 5 per cent of the vote cast, the minimum needed to get into the Bundestag, in 1990 - are expecting to win sufficient votes to get back this time. However, they are unlikely to win enough support to form a majority with the SPD, their natural partners. The SPD will need a third partner to unseat Mr Kohl. That could be the FDP. But the Free Democrats have failed to gain 5 per cent of the votes in six consecutive state elections in the past 12 months, and in last June's European poll. The other unknown is what happens to the party of Democratic Socialism (PDS). If it gets into the Bundestag, it could deny a parliamentary majority to Mr Kohl and his ruling coalition. At the PDS headquarters in east Berlin - in the former institute of Marxism-Leninism - the mood is supremely confident. Mr Gregor Gysi, the one-time defence lawyer for anti-communist dissidents who now leads the party in the Bundestag, is convinced the party can win three constituencies outright in Berlin. Under German election rules, that is enough to get the party into parliament with anything up to 30 seats, even if it fails to win 5 per cent of the popular vote. 'We have managed to speak out for the interests of the east Germans who still feel alienated and who still feel they have a separate identity,' says Mr Gysi. East Germany's economy remains sluggish and unemployment is high. But recent studies by the Martin Luther University in Halle and the Infratest Burke Berlin, a polling organisation, with Die Zeit, the weekly newspaper, show that the majority of east Germans are now far more optimistic about their daily lives and economic prospects than they were last year. The studies also show that more than 50 per cent of those polled hold little regard for the PDS's policies. Moreover, the PDS has not projected itself as the party of the unemployed. According to Deutschland Archiv, a journal specialising in the unification process, 'the unemployed and the under-educated have only average representation' in the PDS. Despite these trends, the former communists have so far managed to retain about one-fifth of the vote in recent state elections. One reason for the PDS's electoral survival is that east Germans vote for personalities, not policies. 'This is where the PDS has a real advantage,' says Mr Wulf Oehme, manager of the FDP's Berlin office. 'The candidates are known locally. They have not come from the west. They have the benefit of understanding what unification means to the east Germans. They belong,' he explains. Another reason is that the hard core of the PDS voters - former civil servants, white collar workers, graduates, academics and pensioners - still hankers after some vague form of social equality. 'If a majority of eastern Germans view equality as more important than freedom, it may be due to the fact that they already enjoy freedom and still miss equality,' according to Ms Ilse Spittmann, editor of Deutschland Archiv. Mr Gysi agrees. 'Unification is a psychological process as much as a political one,' he says. 'Unlike the political establishment which keeps preaching to the east Germans that the past 40 years were a waste of time, we say that not everything of the former system was bad, that they still have a voice, and that the state must play a role. We are that voice.' The mood in the FDP, in west Germany as in the east, is more gloomy. This is the party of the German Mittelstand, the shopkeepers and professional classes. In the west, those supporters seem to be deserting the party. In the east, they still don't really exist. One accusation by its opponents is that the party has lost its identity in the struggle to remain in power, first with the SPD from 1969 to 1982, latterly with the CDU. Mr Gerhard Schroder, the SPD premier of Lower Saxony, says it is guilty of 'merciless opportunism'. Count Otto Lambsdorff, the last FDP leader who stepped down in 1993, admits at least part of the charge. 'If he means that we want to be in the government, and to do so we must be opportunistic, I would agree. 'We don't want to be in opposition. That would be stupid,' he says. 'But we must not abandon our liberal principles.' Yet the party's liberalism has been squeezed. Many of its liberal policies have been stolen by its bigger rivals. Free-market liberalism, including greater deregulation and progressive privatisation, is now a central plank of Mr Kohl's government policy. As for the party's commitment to civil liberties, that has been stolen by the SPD. At the same time, the FDP has been unable to maintain a clear profile for the voters. Count Lambsdorff believes this is a result of the size of the present conservative-liberal coalition majority, thanks to Mr Kohl's landslide win in 1990. 'We must not give up on our liberal principles, but we may have run that risk in the past four years,' he says. 'I hear the complaints at our election meetings, that we allowed a health reform bill to be passed which seriously limits the activities of the self-employed, our natural constituency.' The FDP also agreed to the introduction of a publicly financed insurance scheme to care for the old and handicapped that has hit small businesses hard. 'I have considerable understanding for that charge,' Count Lambsdorff says. The survival of the FDP now looks to depend on the long-standing tradition of German voters giving their second votes - for party lists as opposed to individual candidates - to the liberals. There are two factors that make that less likely to happen. One is that voters in the east have never known that tradition. Having shown little understanding of liberal-market economics, they may not be inclined to adopt it. The other is that after a row of defeats, voters may start to question whether there is any point in keeping the FDP in parliament. According to the latest opinion poll, based on the second-vote preferences of electors, the FDP will make the 5 per cent threshold. So will the PDS. The present coalition would then be barely 1 per cent in front of the combined forces of the leftwing opposition. It is well within the potential margin of error of the polls. But it is certainly much too close for Mr Kohl's comfort.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Rush to import Chinese goods The Department of Trade and Industry is processing 4,000 import licence applications from small traders for Chinese goods covered by European Union import quotas. The demand was caused by the imposition of quotas by the European Council on selected imports from China covering leather gloves, footwear, some tableware, household glassware, radio broadcast receivers and toys. The rush was prompted by an EU decision to deal with applications on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

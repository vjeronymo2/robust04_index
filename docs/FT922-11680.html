			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Bank of Scotland offers Lloyds deal BANK OF SCOTLAND is interested in taking up to 500 branches from Lloyds Bank, if Lloyds decides to bid for Midland Bank, it emerged yesterday. Such a deal might help Lloyds persuade the Monopolies and Mergers Commission not to block its bid. Lloyds said yesterday it was keeping 'under review' the question of what it should do in the light of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's Pounds 3.3bn bid for Midland.

But if Lloyds does decide to make an offer, it may not launch its bid until after the weekend. In today's board debate, Lloyds' executive directors, led by the chief executive, Mr Brian Pitman, are understood to be in favour of bidding.

There are also 12 non-executive directors whose views are harder to gauge, according to bankers. Lloyds' chairman, Sir Jeremy Morse, is said to be uneasy about making a move that would be viewed by Midland as hostile. In his first public statement since it emerged a month ago that Lloyds is interested in buying Midland, Sir Jeremy said Hongkong Bank's bid had 'implications' for all other big UK banks. Speaking at Lloyds' annual shareholders' meeting, he said: 'We are keeping it under review.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "The Fate of the Paks Nuclear </F> Power Station Is Uncertain"]    [Text] If we do not find a safe solution to store the  expended fuel within 18 months then the further operation of the  Paks Nuclear Power Station Inc. may become doubtful. Should  this happen, half of Hungary's energy production would be lost,  Laszlo Kemenes, leader of the company's information service,  said.    In the past, the expended fuel was transported to the Soviet  Union. In the summer of 1992, the Russian parliament accepted  an environmental protection law that bans the import of  dangerous waste. In spite of this, in February 1993, Russia  accepted expended fuel filling a railway carriage. However, it  is not at all certain that it will again do this, although it  has not indicated, either, that it will refuse to process waste  from Paks in the future. The Ukrainian side has already  indicated that it would let the deliveries pass through.  Considering the favorable atmosphere of talks with the  Russians, it cannot be excluded that future deliveries will be  possible. As Hungary cannot expose itself to the decisions of  other countries, a solution will definitely have to be found  within a short time.    For five years, the used-up fuel elements has been stored in  a resting basin at the Paks Nuclear Power Station, then they  were transported in special containers. At the moment, the free  storage capacity at Paks is enough for 18 months, therefore, if  no solution is found in the coming 18 months then, failing all  else, the nuclear power station might be halted.    Being aware of this situation, to safely solve the further  placement of waste, the company had internationally announced  bids for building a transitional storage, and this was won by  the French-British GEC-ALSTHOM. This company, which has built  several of this type of storage, will have to complete the  reception building and the storage area in 18 months. Although  temporarily, the Paks Nuclear power station would gain time  through this 3 to 3.5 billion forints investment.</p>

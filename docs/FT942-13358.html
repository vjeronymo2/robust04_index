			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Move on beef ban by Bonn: European News Digest The European Commission moved closer to a serious confrontation with Germany yesterday, making clear it would take out an injunction against Bonn if the German government proceeds with its threatened unilateral ban on British beef exports. There are growing fears in Germany of 'mad cow disease,' or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). As EU agriculture ministers met to discuss the worsening BSE row in Luxembourg, senior Commission officials said Brussels would act swiftly to nip any German action in the bud. Normally, the European Court of Justice can take 18 months to two years to deal with infractions of EU law by member states. But 'in this case we can get an injunction within two weeks,' one official predicted. The stakes in the BSE controversy rose sharply last week, when German health minister Horst Seehofer threatened in a Bundestag debate to resign if his government did not take 'national action' against British beef. Mr Seehofer said that if this week's EU agriculture Council did not take further precautionary health measures against BSE, Germany would have to act alone. 'The position of the Germans is entirely unacceptable,' Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriclture minister said yesterday, reiterating that Bonn's stance was already damaging not only British beef but other food exports.</p>

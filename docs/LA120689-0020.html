			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> LAMB'S 'FESTIVAL OF CHRISTMAS' TIES SEASON'S SENTIMENTS IN A BOW;  </P> <P> THEATER: THE HOLIDAY PLAY IS REWRITTEN FOR EACH YULE SEASON, BUT STICKS TO ITS  RELIGIOUS, WARM AND FUZZY THEMES.  </P> <P> "Festival of Christmas," the Lamb's Players Theatre's annual hit (many  performances sell out before opening night), seems impervious to reviews and  that, perhaps, is as it should be.  </P> <P> Playwright Kerry Cederberg Meads, who writes each "Festival of Christmas,"  recognized that she was probably never going to write as definitive a Christmas  story as "A Christmas Carol," so she settled for writing minor riffs on how the  spirit of the season can touch a heart for the better.  </P> <P> The time and place may change, from Renaissance England to the American Midwest  to -- in the current production -- turn-of-the-century New Jersey. But what  results is always a familiar grab bag of warm, fuzzy feelings, studded with  carols beautifully sung by Lamb's talented ensemble and topped with a big bow  of a happy ending.  </P> <P> Unlike "A Christmas Carol," which courts the ecumenical, Meads' "A Festival of  Christmas" is very much for believers who wish to be reminded -- often in the  course of the show -- that Christmas is, first and last, the celebration of the  birth of Jesus.  </P> <P> Meads' latest story, her seventh in 12 years, tells of a brief, life-changing  journey through the land of the Faerie. The central character is a woman who  lost a child at birth the Christmas before, and turned a cold heart to her  husband's 5-year-old daughter from his first marriage. It is based, in part, on  "The Gifts of the Child Christ" by Scottish storyteller George MacDonald, and  the play as a whole is a valentine to MacDonald and his storytelling, rich in  fantasy, myth and morals.  </P> <P> The action begins in late 19th-Century New Jersey where MacDonald (Robert  Smyth) has been asked to dinner along with Belinda Lippencott (Deborah Gilmour  Smyth), the woman who has lost the child, and her husband, Thomas (Mike  Buckley).  </P> <P> Belinda wants nothing to do with MacDonald or his talk of children and fairies.  But, when she waits, alone, for her husband to make excuses so they can flee to  another party, she begins to read one of MacDonald's books. As the lights dim  she finds herself moved suddenly to a strange land where shadows walk like  people, leading her to goblins and a wise woman, a King and Queen and  ultimately, a shadow play of her own life.  </P> <P> For Gilmour Smyth to make this work is no mean trick; she rightly understands  that she has not just entered Faerie land, but the world of her own  unconscious. She lets us see her subtly reduce in age from an imperious,  world-weary adult in her 30s to a petulant 12-year-old and then mature, again,  in a more wholesome way.  </P> <P> If the turnaround smacks of sitcom formula in its completeness, that's more in  the writing than in the performance. It's particularly troubling in the closing  passage as Smyth makes a hairpin turn from mourning her child to rejoicing in  her rediscovery of the 5-year-old.  </P> <P> Some necessary tears and an appreciation of the crucial role time plays in  healing get overlooked in the process.  </P> <P> Robert Smyth, who keeps the direction fluid and affecting, plays MacDonald like  a warm, witty and wise Jiminy Cricket, literally over Gilmour Smyth's shoulder.  In the dream sequence, he narrates part of the story and advises her  thereafter.  </P> <P> Carmen Beaubeaux is enchanting as the maid in the opening scene who becomes the  blind old guide in the fantasy. Leigh Scarritt is deeply moving as the young  child, Sophie, and is eloquent as the fleeting Shadow. Buckley as Thomas  Lippencott, David Heath and Pat Thayer as friends at the dinner, all offer fine  support.  </P> <P> One of the few disappointments is Mike Buckley's set design -- a simple sitting  room, which has but one inspired moment, although that one is a doozy: a sudden  smoky drop through the floor to a goblin's lair. For the rest, as long as we  are going to have Faerie and goblin costumes (the effective clothes were by  Margaret Neuhoff Vida and masks by Nathan Peirson), could we not have a sprig  of greenery or twinkling lights, or from sound designer Mary Kidd, a hooting  owl that might suggest an enchanted forest?  </P> <P> Kidd's musical direction more than makes up for the lack of sound design; the  carol arrangements may have reached a new poetic height.  </P> <P> This "Festival" ends on the feeling that it gives patrons exactly what they've  come to enjoy over the past 12 years and that, more than anything, is probably  why, for many ticket buyers, "A Festival" remains a Christmas experience that  they subscribe to year after year.  </P> <P> This play wouldn't fly at any time of the year. It goes down like warm bread  pudding on a chilly day. The nutritional value may not be great, but it's  wonderful while you're eating it around a brightly bedecked table with family  and friends. Afterward, you may struggle to justify ingesting all those  low-protein calories, but that would be missing the point. The body needs  treats as well as sustenance, and, if you can't have one time of year to  indulge, then what, all moralizing aside, is Christmas really for?  </P> <P> "A FESTIVAL OF CHRISTMAS"  </P> <P> By Kerry Cederberg Meads.

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Safeway's Magowan steps down MR PETER Magowan, head of Safeway, the Californian food retailer which was the subject of Dollars 4.2bn leveraged buy-out in 1986, has asked to be relieved of his job as chief executive. Mr Magowan said he had made the request to the group's board of directors because he wanted to devote more time to his role as managing general partner and president of the San Francisco Giants baseball team. Mr Magowan, who had been chief executive of Safeway for 13 years, will remain as chairman of the group. The board has appointed Mr Steve Burd, currently president of Safeway, to the chief executive's post. Mr Burd, des-cribed as a long-time management consultant to Safeway, became president in October. Mr Magowan became involved with the San Francisco Giants last summer when he was asked to join a group of investors seeking to buy the team and keep it in California. He subsequently became managing general partner, and yesterday said the position was proving 'more time-consuming than I originally envisioned'. In the 1980s, Mr Magowan stayed with Safeway through the KKR-led buy-out, which was designed to see off a hostile takeover threat. The company came back to the stock market, and has been paying down debt through various refinancings. However, its business - which takes in over 1,100 supermarkets in the US - has been under pressure recently.</p>

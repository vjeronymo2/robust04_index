			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bad weather halves Norwegian crude output NORWAY'S 2.3m barrels-a-day oil production has been cut by nearly half since Monday as storms have hampered offshore crude oil loading by tankers, and two fields may be closed today unless the bad weather relents. The 100,000 barrels-a-day Snorre platform, operated by Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, has been shut down since Monday, while the 700,000 b/d Statfjord field and the 450,000 b/d Gullfaks field have both been restricted to about 50,000 b/d. Both fields operate offshore crude oil loading systems from which tankers are able to load crude only if waves are below 4.5 metres. Yesterday, they were exceeding five metres. The two platforms' oil storage capacity was nearly filled and seven tankers were queueing to load crude. Statoil official Ms Wencke Skorge warned that unless the tankers were able to load crude by last night, Statfjord and Gullfaks would have to be closed this morning. It would take about 24 hours to bring the fields back on stream. Ms Skorge estimated that the closures of the two platforms would mean a gross revenue loss of Dollars 250m a day. Last year, Statoil produced a record 1.1m barrels of oil a day, or an aggregate 442m barrels for the year. Production was also temporarily halted yesterday at Oseberg, Oseberg C and Gamma North fields, operated by Norsk Hydro. The fields' oil is piped ashore to storage tanks from where it is loaded by tankers. Bad weather has also interfered with these operations. The Ninian oilfield in the UK North Sea was expected to halt production later yesterday if bad weather kept the Sullom Voe terminal in the Shetland Islands closed, said Chevron Corporation, the fields operator, reports Reuter. The closure of the Ninian field would also result in the closure of the Magnus field, operated by British Petroleum, the Total-operated North Alwyn field, Unocal Corporation's Heather field and Lasmo's Staffa field, Chevron added. Oil from these fields is piped to Sullom Voe via the Ninian field. The total oil pumped, including Ninian, is some 300,0000 to 350,000 barrels a day. BP said it had shut down the 20,000-25,000 b/d Thistle platform after a plug failure on the main oil line led to gas and oil leaking into the crude pumping area.</p>

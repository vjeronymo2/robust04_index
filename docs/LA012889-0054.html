			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PULLING THE PLUG  </P> <P> In reference to Diane Haithman's Jan. 9 article, "NBC's Tartikoff Takes Heat  for Rivera's Satanism Show": I am leading a grass-roots movement for an annual  national TV blackout -- a blackout for one day to send a signal to the networks  that we demand better programming.  </P> <P> I consider watching TV an unhealthy habit, not unlike smoking. There is an  annual "smoke out" to help smokers -- why not an annual blackout to help TV  addicts?  </P> <P> Stay tuned for the "National Unplug Your Set Day."  </P> <P> RICHARD V. STEWART  </P> <P> La Crescenta  </P></p>

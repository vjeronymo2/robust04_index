			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / ADT lines up Dollars 1.3bn refinancing: Deal involves new Dollars 500m credit facility, Dollars 600m public debt offering plus share issue ADT, the security services and car auction company, is to make a public share offering in the US to help refinance Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 840m) of debt and preference share obligations. The share issue should raise more than Dollars 150m. The Bermuda-based company has also received commitments for a new Dollars 500m credit facility from Bank of Nova Scotia and Chemical Bank. Completing the three-part package, ADT expects to register details of a Dollars 600m public debt offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr David Hammond, ADT deputy chairman, said the package aimed to clear up all the 'financial question marks' surrounding the group, which conducts most of its business in the US. The package will allow payment next year of Dollars 435m to holders of preference shares who are likely to exercise put options. It also extends the repayment schedule for Dollars 750m of debt through 1995. The company hopes the refinancing will end a turbulent period in which its share price has fallen from about Pounds 20 in 1990 to 570p yesterday. While the company's share price was sliding, Laidlaw of Canada, the largest shareholder, sued in a New York court claiming ADT had produced 'an illusory profit stream'. The case was dropped, after Laidlaw got board representation. Mr Ashcroft, however, continues to attract attention. According to documents filed with the SEC, he received more than Pounds 2m in salary and payments in lieu of pension in 1992 and a salary of Pounds 1.44m in 1991. After the refinancing, ADT's gearing will still be more than 100 per cent. Mr Hammond said there would be no need for further refinancing for five years. 'We will now concentrate on nothing but security services and vehicle auctions.' The public offering of 18m shares is a substantially smaller issue than many observers had suspected would be necessary, limiting dilution of existing shareholders to 16.4 per cent. The Dollars 600m of public debt is split into Dollars 250m of senior seven-year debt and Dollars 350m of 10-year subordinated debt. Half the bank facility amortises over six years beginning in 1994, while half is payable in its entirety in six years' time. The share offer will be managed by First Boston Corp and Merrill Lynch.</p>

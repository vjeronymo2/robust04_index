			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / A-level and nursery plans top Blair list: Labour outlines 'key' strategy for education Mr Tony Blair yesterday put the extension of nursery education and the replacement of the existing A-level examination with a broader qualification at the centre of Labour's education strategy. Presiding over the launch of the first policy document since his election as leader, Mr Blair also emphasised the party's commitment to higher standards, firm classroom discipline and greater parental involvement. But the tone of his comments at a press conference to launch the policy statement, Opening Doors to a Learning Society, contrasted with the document's apparent concessions to the teaching unions. The statement was approved by the party's National Executive Committee before the leadership result and was warmly welcomed by the NUT, the largest teaching union. Mr Blair looked slightly uneasy when pressed about the party's attitude to grant-maintained and grammar schools. He said that the funding of grant-maintained schools would be brought back within the framework of local democracy but suggested they would retain much of their independence. Grammar schools would be discouraged but not necessarily abolished. He also played down a proposal to scrap the present system of testing and league tables to measure the performance of pupils and schools. Mr Blair stressed the intention of providing more rather than less information. The key planks of the document, which will be debated at Labour's autumn conference, are: A large-scale extension of nursery education to provide places for every child aged three and four whose parents require it. The replacement of A-levels with a broader General Certificate of Further Education and the creation of a new national curriculum framework. The abolition of the Funding Agency for Schools and the restoration of grant-maintained schools to a 'local democratic framework'. The establishment of a General Teaching Council to maintain professional standards. Replacement of the present arrangements for schools testing and league tables with an assessment procedure to replace the government's 'over-burdensome and educationally flawed tests'. Abolition of the Assisted Places Scheme which 'subsidises the independent fee-paying sector at the expense of the public sector and denies equality of opportunity'. Mr Blair said the plans provided the foundation for recognition of education as the 'key to personal fulfilment for the individual, to economic success for the nation and to the creation of a more just and cohesive society'. Colleagues expect him to make significant further changes before the next election. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, is widely expected to be moved to another portfolio after the autumn shadow cabinet elections. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, reacted to the document by attacking the 'credibility' gap between Mr Blair's rhetoric and the reality of Labour policies.

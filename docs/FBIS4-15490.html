			<p>BFN     [Text] "The Belarusian Government has not announced any  official position regarding Russia's desire to set up its  military bases in the CIS states," head of the governmental  board of national security, Major-General Valeriy Pavlov told  INTERFAX.    At the same time, he noted that "alien strategic units  cannot  be stationed in Belarus, because that would run contrary to  Belarus' aspiration to neutrality and non-nuclear status."    In the opinion of Valeriy Pavlov, "the present of Russian  aviation bases or air-defense units in Belarus would help  Belarussian colleagues to maintain "good condition," to get  familiarized with the latest examples of equipment and arms and  to resolve social problems."    Valeriy Pavlov noted that "all options of the presence of  foreign military bases in Belarus will be thoroughly studied."</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Agnellis may retreat in bid for control of Perrier ITALY'S Agnelli family may be considering a strategic retreat in its bid to gain control of Perrier following the increasingly bitter battle that has erupted. The fight for Perrier is thought to have pitched previous Agnelli allies in the French business and banking establishment against each other and brought to the surface deep personal animosities among some French members of the Agnelli camp. 'We never expected all this controversy and excitement,' said Ifint, the Agnelli investment vehicle battling for Perrier, in Paris yesterday. 'This was meant to be a quiet, friendly association fully supported by the management. We thought it was going to be a very smooth deal. We did not anticipate anything like this.' Meanwhile, the Agnellis are awaiting the outcome of the two court cases in France which, barring a compromise, will determine the next stage of the battle. The cases are concerned with a claim by Nestle that Perrier's sale earlier this year of 14 per cent of its shares to Saint Louis, the French sugar company linked to the Agnellis, was illegal. If the courts, which will deliver their judgments in late February, rule that Saint Louis's purchase was invalid, it will have to give the shares back to Perrier. This means Exor, whose president, Mr Jacques Vincent, also chairs Perrier, will be left to try to stave off Nestle with just 35 per cent of the mineral water company's shares. This could turn the Perrier affaire into a repetition of the dramatic bid by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, another ambitious Italian industrialist, for Societe Generale de Belgique in 1988 when the protagonists ended up fighting over every last share. Unlike Mr De Benedetti, however, the Agnellis could come out with a substantial financial gain even if their ambitions for Perrier fail. Alternatively, if the court endorses Saint Louis's investment, the French stock market authorities may force Exor to mount a public offer for Perrier. The Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs, one of the regulatory bodies in France, yesterday repeated an earlier ruling that Exor and its allies - Saint Louis and Societe Generale, the French bank - should do so. Exor would then have to decide whether to mount a token bid, or to compete with Nestle by making a counter offer. A token bid appears to be the likeliest option given that, with 49 per cent of Perrier, Exor and Saint Louis could be confident of blocking Nestle. Legally, the Exor camp, according to Ifint, would be able to comply with the SBV's ruling simply by bidding for two thirds of Perrier at the last price paid by Saint Louis, which was FFr1,235. Given that Nestle has already offered FFr1,475 for each Perrier share, Exor could make its token bid in the sure knowledge it would fail. The CBV will resume trading in Perrier and Exor shares on Monday. It has told the Commission des Operations de Bourse and the Societe des Bourses Francais to scrutinise dealings in both stocks.

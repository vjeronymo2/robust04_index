			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Fokus Bank president steps down MR CHRISTIAN KJOELAAS, the president of Fokus Bank, Norway's third biggest bank, yesterday stepped down, just two months after the announcement that the bank had run up a big loss for 1990. Last December, Fokus was given a three-year NKr1.5bn conditional guarantee with renewal options by the banks' guarantee fund which forced the bank to write down its share capital by 50 per cent. Fokus lost NKr992m last year after a net profit of NKr101.9m in 1989. A new board was appointed one month ago, headed by Mr Stein Holst Annexstad, a former executive with Hafslund Nycomed. In a terse statement. Mr Kjoelaas said he agreed to resign following the board's recommendation. The board said that the bank was facing such great challenges connected with its demanding economic situation that it felt Fokus should be led in future by someone without historical ties to the bank. 'The bank needs a new president and this will make it easier for the new board to implement the right strategy for the bank's future,' Mr Kjoelaas said.</p>

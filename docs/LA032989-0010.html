			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: THE MORNING LINE  </P> <P> Entertainment Data also handicapped the 1988 Oscar field as if it were the  Breeders' Cup and published its analyses in an eight-sheet brochure laid out  like The Daily Racing Form. The company's Academy Award Handicap makes "Rain  Man" a solid pick as best picture (each of the last six best picture winners  led the field in nominations, as "Rain Man" does this year); "Mississippi  Burning" cannot win because its screenplay was not nominated (previous nominees  in this predicament went 0-for-6); and "Dangerous Liaisons" is out because it  has done the least box-office business of the five nominated films (past low  grosser nominees have also gone 0-for-6). The handicap also rates Dustin  Hoffman the favorite for best actor, and Glenn Close and Jodie Foster  nose-to-nose for best actress. ALEENE MacMINN and Jack Mathews  </P></p>

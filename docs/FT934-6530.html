			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: ABB posts flat profits at Dollars 215m in third quarter ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group, reported flat profits of Dollars 215m before tax and non-recurring items for the third quarter. Incoming orders tumbled 24.3 per cent to Dollars 5.3bn in the quarter, although much of the decline was attributable to currency effects. The group said only Asian markets were strong. Demand in continental Europe was still weakening and the economic recovery in North America was having only a small positive impact on order intake. Exports from Scandinavia were increasing and the UK market seemed 'poised for some growth'. Last month, a UK subsidiary of ABB won a Pounds 150m (Dollars 224m) contract to build and lease rolling stock to Network SouthEast, part of the UK rail network. ABB is maintaining its forecast that profits before tax and non-recurring items in the full year will be at about last year's level of Dollars 1.11bn. However, it signalled that net income would be lower, largely because of a Dollars 500m restructuring provision announced in August and the resultant higher tax rate. Non-recurring items ballooned in the third quarter to Dollars 151m from Dollars 30m, as about 30 per cent of the provision was booked. Third-quarter revenues were down 7.5 per cent to Dollars 6.7bn, but operating earnings jumped 33.5 per cent to Dollars 482m. ABB adjusts revenues upwards and financial income downwards as a way of attributing to its divisions the interest earned from cash advances from customers. When, as in the third quarter, this process makes operating profits grow more quickly than pre-tax profits, it means that invoicing on projects from which the group has cash advances has been brisk. For the nine months, profits before taxes and non-recurring items were down 1 per cent to Dollars 722m, but up 15 per cent in local currencies. The power plant, financial services and transportation segments improved earnings. Revenues were down 6 per cent to Dollars 19.8bn, but up 4 per cent in local currencies. Order intake, down 15 per cent to Dollars 20.3bn, was down only 6 per cent in local currencies. Holderbank, the Swiss cement group, said it had placed 200,000 bearer shares from its treasury with Union Bank of Switzerland.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Social Democrats clinch Swedish election victory Sweden's Social Democratic party swept back to power in yesterday's general election, as a strong swing to the left led to the defeat of Mr Carl Bildt's right-centre coalition government. The Social Democrats, led by Mr Ingvar Carlsson, a former prime minister, fell short of a parliamentary majority but indicated they would form a minority government relying on centre parties to back them on the main economic policies. The Social Democrats won 45.6 per cent of the vote, a strong rebound from 37.7 per cent in the last election in September 1991. Mr Bildt quickly conceded defeat. His four-party coalition, led by his conservative Moderate party, tumbled to a combined 41.1 per cent from 46.7 per cent three years ago. The former communist Left party won 6.1 per cent, while the Environment party was returned to parliament for the first time since 1988 with 5 per cent. The rightwing New Democracy party, which backed Mr Bildt's government, failed to clear the 4 per cent hurdle to win any seats. The outcome is the 'nightmare scenario' for financial markets concerned that a Social Democratic government dependent on the left might be unable to implement tough policies to tackle Sweden's deep budget deficit and fast-rising public debt. Mr Carlsson's preferred option of forming a coalition with the Liberal party, a member of Mr Bildt's government, was undermined by the poor Liberal performance, their vote slipping to 7.1 per cent from 9.1 per cent three years ago. But Mr Carlsson indicated he would form a minority government, saying it was 'not realistic' to form a coalition with the Left party or the Environment party. He promised 'very strong measures' to tackle public finances. 'Our main priority will be an economic policy which gets down the budget deficit, stabilises the state debt and reduces unemployment,' he said. In the election campaign, the Social Democrats proposed a series of public spending cuts to help reduce a budget deficit expected to total the equivalent of 11 per cent of gross national product this year and stabilise the public debt (close to 100 per cent of GNP) by 1998. But they came under strong attack from industry for including in their SKr61bn (Pounds 5.2bn) budget saving package a raft of income and capital tax increases. Mr Carlsson will have to turn his attention quickly to the referendum on November 13 on Sweden's proposal to join the European Union from January 1 next year. The Social Democratic leadership is in favour, but public opinion is still divided.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Women close the jobs gap on men ESSEX WOMAN is more likely to have a paid job than Essex Man, government statistics show. Analysis of information gathered by the Department of Employment from about 400,000 employers indicates that Essex is just one of 11 areas in the UK where women are more likely to go out to work than men. There are now almost as many women in the workforce as there are men - separate official figures show there were 10.7m men in employment at the end of last year and 10.1m women. This contrasts with the position in 1979, when there were 13.1m men and 9.4m women in jobs. Nearly half of the jobs done by women are part-time, the latest figures show. According to Incomes Data Services, the independent pay and employment research group which has analysed the employment census figures, part of the explanation for the fall in unemployment in February and March this year lies in the growth in part-time jobs in the service industries where women are concentrated. In the past six months unemployment among men hit its highest level since the 1930s. It has risen much faster than unemployment among women, IDS says. It adds that many of the sectors which have suffered most during the recession of the past three years, including manufacturing and the energy supply industries, employ far more men than women. The Department of Employment survey figures, which are due to be published in detail in two booklets, show that nine counties and two Scottish regions now have more female than male employees. These are: Essex, Isle of Wight, East Sussex, West Sussex, Cornwall/Scilly Isles, Devon, Hereford and Worcester, Merseyside, Mid Glamorgan, and the Borders and Lothian regions of Scotland. East Sussex had the highest proportion of females in employment, at 54 per cent, while the highest proportion of male employees - 57 per cent  - was found in the Grampian region, the centre of North Sea oil operations. Greater London had the highest concentration of full-time employees (80 per cent) and of female full-timers - more than 31 per cent of all employees.</p>

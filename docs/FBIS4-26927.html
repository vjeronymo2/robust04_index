			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Noel Fung] </F>   [Text] The plunging U.S. dollar sent the Hong Kong dollar  bond and equity markets tumbling yesterday and prompted the  territory's Monetary Authority to pump $2.67 billion into the  banking system. The injection was the biggest in Hong Kong's  history.    The overnight inter-bank market rate was pushed up to 4.5  percent because of the excessive demand for funds, causing the  Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to pump $2.676 billion into  the banking system at about 3.30 pm. The move softened the  overnight rate to 3.5 per cent at yesterday's close. The  banking sector ended up placing $225 million in surplus funds  with the HKMA when the market closed.    The stock market fared no better. The Hang Seng Index dived  233.52 points to close at 8,647.48, on the back of world market  crashes last Friday. Aggravating the situation was the weak  U.S. dollar, which has brokers fearing the U.S. Federal Reserve  might raise interest rates as a last-ditch attempt to shore up  the currency.    It was the third time in less than a week that the Monetary  Authority had moved to inject liquidity into the market, after  the overnight lending rate repeatedly touched the 4.5 per cent  offer rate of the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) -- the  discount window facility run by the authority. The LAF offer  rate was kept at the same level as the Fed's discount rate so as  to maintain the stability of the territory's pegged exchange  rate system.    The HKMA injected $1.36 billion into the market last Friday  and $1.57 billion last Wednesday.    Although the exchange rate remained stable, hovering at  about  $7.728-$7.729 to the US dollar, the injections are considered  preemptive strikes to prevent the rising interbank market rates  from affecting the stability of the peg. "If the interbank  market rates are higher than in the U.S., then money will start  coming in," said HKMA chief executive Joseph Yam Chi-kwong.    The Hong Kong dollar bond market mirrored the fall in the  U.S., with the two-year government bond price dropping 37 basis  points and the three-year bond shedding 44 basis points. One  dealer said: "The yield spread between the three-year Hong Kong  dollar bond and three-year U.S. dollar bond, which usually  ranges between 30 and 50 basis points, has widened to a  historical level of 75 basis points." He attributed bearish  sentiment in the bond market to the upward pressure on U.S.  interest rates. "One famous economist in the US even predicted  that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond would climb to 10  percent by the end of the year," he said.    However, Mr Yam said the tight interbank market condition  was  only temporary, caused by expectations on U.S. interest rates  and banks' need to shore up funds in preparation for mid-year  accounting. "Banks that expect U.S. interest rates to go up  will borrow more in advance and sit on it," he said.</p>

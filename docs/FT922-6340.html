			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Observer: Official line The bureaucratic bent for seeing problems in everything is apparently highly developed in the Belgian civil service. When it introduced flexi-time working, the worry arose about how to prevent jams in its entrance corridors as late arrivals and early leavers tried to get past one another. Eventually, the tidy official minds decided to have a white line painted along the middle of each corridor, so dividing it into two lanes with in-comers using one side and out-goers the other. The project was dropped, however, before the paint had even been ordered. An ad hoc survey showed that the late arrivals and the early leavers were the selfsame people.</p>

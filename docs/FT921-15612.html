			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Christmas was a dull and featureless period for the wool market. However, with the US dollar weaker as a result of an interest rate reduction, and sterling weaker within Europe as a result of interest rate rises there, individual re-calculation of prices has often been necessary. Non-payment of debts by successors of the Soviet Union is a disturbing feature in assessing prospects in the second half of the Australian selling season, which opens next week. South African wool prices at a sale on January 8 were around 7% lower and there was a poor clearance to the trade, which cannot be seen as a good omen.</p>

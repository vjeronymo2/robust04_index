			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Dividend payments speeded up to beat Budget tax changes SOME OF Britain's largest companies yesterday speeded up their dividend payments to save shareholders money at the expense of the taxman. The rush was intended to pre-empt a change in the advance corporation tax rate, which was announced in last week's Budget and is due to come into effect on April 6. The change reduces the level of tax credits available to shareholders. PowerGen, the UK's second largest electricity generator, and retailer Boots brought forward the announcement of their end of year dividends by two months. Reed, the publisher, and Reuters Holdings, the business information and news group, said they would pay a second interim dividend on April 5 in place of previously announced final dividends which require shareholder approval at annual meetings. Several smaller companies, including Capital Radio and engineering company Laird made similar announcements with more to follow in the next week. PowerGen said a second interim dividend of 7.15p would be paid to shareholders on March 31. The company was due to pay its final dividend in October. Mr John Rennocks, executive director for finance, said about half of PowerGen's shareholders would benefit: 'The change delivers about Pounds 4.6m to shareholders which would not have been recoverable from the Treasury.' Under the Budget changes, shareholders who do not pay tax, for example pension funds, and higher rate taxpayers stand to lose out because of a reduction in tax credit. The rate of 25 per cent is being reduced to 20 per cent over two years for companies and from April 6 for shareholders. Yesterday's announcements alone cost the Inland Revenue nearly Pounds 20m. Boots and Reuters estimated they saved shareholders about Pounds 6m and Pounds 5.5m respectively, while Reed said its investors would be Pounds 3.4m better off. Mr Terry Steel, Boots' director of investor relations, said paying the dividend early would cost the company about Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m. Companies which have not yet planned moving their dividend forward may have difficulty meeting the deadline. The move needs prior arrangement with registrars and the Stock Exchange, and companies must have adequate cash on hand. Separately, RTZ Corporation, the mining company, said it planned to offer a scrip dividend 50 per cent higher than its recently announced final cash dividend of 13.5p. The shares offer, which follows a similar scheme from BAT Industries, is designed to reduce unrelieved ACT on high overseas earnings. Lex, Page 20 Dividend table, Page 22 London shares, Page 44</p>

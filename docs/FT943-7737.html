			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Coalition tries to defuse Italian bank row Members of Italy's governing coalition tried over the weekend to play down the significance of a dispute between the country's transport minister and the central bank over a planned merger between two banks. Mr Publio Fiori, the transport minister, publicly criticised the Bank of Italy last week for allegedly ordering the Banca Nazionale delle Communicazioni to hold a board meeting next Saturday to consider a merger with Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, one of Italy's biggest banks. BNC is controlled by the Ferrovie dello Stato, the Italian state railway. Mr Fiori and fellow members of the right-wing National Alliance believe the interests of the railways would be better served if BNC accepted an offer from a smaller bank, Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna. The Bank of Italy has refused to discuss Mr Fiori's comments, although bank officials quoted in the Italian press over the weekend strongly denied separate allegations by other members of the National Alliance that the central bank had misused secret funds for promotion and consultancy work. The National Alliance was criticised by the opposition and by coalition allies over the weekend. Mr Gianni Letta, chief of staff of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, came to the defence of the Bank of Italy, declaring that 'respect for the independence of the central bank is a sacred and inviolable principle'. But senior members of the National Alliance denied that the attacks on the central bank represented a party line, while Mr Fiori's office said the minister's chief concern was the bank's attitude to the BNC offer. The Bologna bank has not made a formal bid for BNC, and its directors only return from holiday today, but bankers say it plans to offer some L380bn (Pounds 154m) in cash for a majority stake, whereas the San Paolo merger would be based on an exchange of shares. Discussion of BNC's future, which began in March, was suspended by the government earlier this month to allow alternatives to be considered, but Mr Fiori has accused the central bank of 'incredible behaviour' and trying to force acceptance of the San Paolo bid with a 'summer holiday blitz'. Meanwhile, Italy's coalition parties are jockeying for political advantage ahead of Friday's cabinet meeting, the first since the Bank of Italy was forced to raise interest rates 10 days ago.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOES OF ORANGE DEVELOPMENT GATHER SIGNATURES  </P> <P> Several residents who live near the site of a proposed residential and hotel  development in east Orange said they collected about 500 signatures Saturday in  their effort to put the issue on the city's June ballot.  </P> <P> Opponents of the Irvine Co.'s 12,300-home project at Chapman Avenue and Newport  Boulevard manned petition tables in front of two supermarkets in the area and  canvassed neighborhoods in search of signatures.  </P> <P> They need to collect 5,500 signatures by Jan. 18 to let the voters decide  whether to accept or reject the development.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are responding to what we're doing," said Orange resident  Terri Sargeant, who was accepting petition signatures at a Vons supermarket on  Chapman Avenue.  </P> <P> After 3 1/2 years of negotiations, the Orange City Council voted unanimously  Dec. 19 to amend the city's General Plan and approve the development.  </P> <P> On Friday, when several homeowners held a news conference to express their  support for the development, a shouting match erupted between them and  opponents. Before it ended, supporters accused opponents of using "outside  anti-growth leaders" to help block the development.  </P> <P> Supporters said they favor the project because it includes jogging and horse  trails and two parks.  </P> <P> About half a dozen project opponents circulated petitions Saturday. They claim  the 7,100-acre development will cause severe traffic problems, worsen air  quality and rob residents of a prime piece of open space.  </P> <P> Opponents will step up their effort in the final weeks of the petition drive  and may employ mass mailings, said Sherry Meddick, a referendum supporter.  </P></p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Gardini and Vender form foods group MR RAUL GARDINI, the former Ferruzzi chief and Mr Jody Vender, majority owner of Sopaf, the merchant bank, have joined forces to create Italy's third-largest frozen-foods group, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. The new group, known as Argel, will comprise Finagel, the frozen-foods concern controlled by Sopaf's Invest subsidiary, and Sias, a frozen-foods company owned indirectly by the Grigolini family. It is also expected to work closely with Vital-Sogeviandes, a French meat company owned by Mr Gardini. The new company could soon expand further with the possible purchase of assets from the state-owned SME foods and retailing concern. In a complex deal, Invest and Garma, the fast-growing Italian food concern controlled by Mr Gardini and Mr Giulio Malgara, will take 35 per cent each in the new group. Sias will have a 20 per cent stake, while the remaining 10 per cent will be sold to unspecified institutional investors. Garma will have management control. With sales of about L300bn (Dollars 197m), Argel will have around 15 per cent of the Italian frozen-foods market, on a par with the foods business of SME's Italgel subsidiary. Argel has made no secret of its interest in bidding for Italgel's food interests as part of the SME privatisation.</p>

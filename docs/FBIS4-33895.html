			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today in Havana, Mexican  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari confirmed that private  Mexican investors will make a "major investment" in Cuba's  telecommunications industry.    President Salinas de Gortari noted that one of the most  significant results of the official visit to Cuba was the  confirmation of a telephone project. Salinas made the  announcement during a news conference following a meeting with  President Fidel Castro, within the agenda drawn up for his short  stay in the Cuban capital.    On Monday, Domos Internacional, a private Mexican  consortium,  and the Cuban Ministry of Communications signed a "general  agreement" to pave the way for a $1.5 billion investment to  modernize the Cuban telephone system. The final details of the  plan have yet to be established.    General Silvano Colas Sanchez, the Cuban minister of  communications, disclosed that it calls for the creation of a  partnership in which the Cuban State will own 51 percent of the  company's shares and Mexican investors will control 49 percent.  The investment will be made in two parts and part of the  Mexican portion will be in the form of a trade-off of Cuba's  debt, also known as swaps. This project could very well  represent the single largest foreign investment project in Cuba.  Its main goal is to modernize and expand the Caribbean island  nation's current telephone network and provide all other related  services.    President Salinas de Gortari said that during his interview  with Castro, he discussed other Mexican private sector plans for  investing in the textile and glass industries. Salinas de  Gortari spent six hours in Cuba and then flew on to the  Colombian port city of Cartagena de Indias, where he was  scheduled to sign a free trade agreement with the Group of Three  [G-3]. The Mexican president will sign the agreement with  Presidents Cesar Gaviria of Colombia and Rafael Caldera of  Venezuela, the other two nations that make up the G-3. The  leaders expect the agreement to enter into effect on 1 January  1995.</p>

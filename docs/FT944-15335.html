			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Judge calls for fraud tribunal A tribunal to deal with all criminal, civil and regulatory aspects of serious fraud was called for yesterday by the former judge in the Guinness trials. Lord Justice Henry, who presided over the trials arising from the 1986 Guinness takeover of Distillers, told a fraud forum that the need to avoid duplication of investigation and adjudication in white-collar crime pointed to the creation of 'forensic one-stop-shopping' for fraud cases. He said that issues of guilt, punishment by imprisonment or fine, civil liability, payment of damages and restrictions on companies' ability to continue in business should all be adjudicated in one process. He added that the closest the western world had to such a model was the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US where, within a statutory framework of racketeering laws much more hostile than anything in the UK, a commission suggestion of a plea-bargain became an offer the defendant could not refuse. The US system was 'brutal but effective' and the US racketeering laws could not be transferred entirely to the UK. The judge said, however, that there was one seemingly fatal objection to his proposal in that if a defendant pleaded not guilty he could not be sentenced to more than 12 months in jail without being convicted by a jury. As juries did not give reasons for their verdicts a jury's criminal verdict was not sufficiently discriminating to try all the issues which would be involved in one-stop-shopping. He said the solution might be for fraud cases to be tried by a judge alone giving a reasoned judgment. Defendants in serious fraud cases in other common-law countries, such as New Zealand and Canada, were being offered the choice of being tried by a judge. These trials would, he said, provide all the economies of a single fact-finding trial. The process would be internally consistent, more manageable, shorter and cheaper. It would also have the advantage that any appeal could concentrate on the validity of the conviction rather than questions of procedural irregularity, or technical misdirection.</p>

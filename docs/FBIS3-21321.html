This was the major outcome of the Indo-Bangladesh  coordination meeting at the level of the director-general of the  Border Security Force [BSE].    However, no significant progress was reported on the dispute  in the Muhurichar area.    A press release issued by the BSE said the surveyors general  of the two countries would now be asked to take up the job of  demarcation of the 50-km stretch of the border.    On the dispute in the Muhurichar area, India took the stand  that on the basis of the Indo-Bangladesh agreement of 1974, the  boundary in the area ran along the course of the Muhuri River.    The Bangladesh delegation insisted that cultivation on the  Indian side should be stopped.    The Indian side reiterate that the agreement between the two  countries related to the alignment of the border and not  utilisation of land on either side. It was nevertheless, agreed  that the security forces of both sides should exercise utmost  restraint in the area.    The two sides agreed that the repair work and maintenance of  boundary pillars along the international border should be taken  over by their security forces.</p>

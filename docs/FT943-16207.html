			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Corporate France gets shivers: Probe of Alcatel chief adds to climate of anxiety in business Mr Pierre Suard, the taciturn chairman of Alcatel Alsthom, was in unusually strident voice. The latest and most senior target in a series of corruption probes which have shaken French industry, he yesterday condemned the investigations he faces as banal and said there was a campaign of defamation against his company, one of the world's largest engineering and telecommunications groups. Mr Suard's tone reflects the events of the last two days. On Monday morning, the Alcatel chief was summoned to the magistrates' office in Versailles, to the west of Paris. Early yesterday, after more than 12 hours of questioning and a search of his home in the Parisian suburb of Neuilly, Mr Suard was formally placed under investigation for misuse of funds for work carried out at his private residences and released on bail of FFr1m (Pounds 110,000). Alcatel has strongly denied any wrongdoing, describing Mr Suard's detention on Monday as 'scandalous'. The company demanded a stock exchange investigation into the way information concerning the investigation was released and the movements in the company's share price, which lost more than 8 per cent on Monday, before bouncing back yesterday. The turbulence surrounding Mr Suard's ordeal, however, stretches far beyond the share price of his telecommunications and engineering company. The investigation into one of France's most respected industrialists and the head of an empire of almost 200,000 employees, has fuelled concerns among France's business establishment, already worried about the expansion of judicial investigations into French companies. The protracted legal tangles of Mr Bernard Tapie, the left-wing entrepreneur, the incarceration for 12 days in a Brussels prison of Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of Groupe Schneider, who is accused of fraud concerning two Belgian subsidiaries, and allegations of systematic corruption by French utilities companies by Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, a prosecutor turned politician, have contributed over the past few months to a climate of anxiety surrounding corporate France. 'There is a feeling of nervousness, in which allegations can be magnified out of proportion,' says one French merchant banker. 'It can be very harmful for the groups involved.' This view was echoed by Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister. 'I consider it distressing that one can damage the reputation of a group of tens of thousands,' he told French radio, adding that the affair could damage the image of French industry. For some observers, there is more to come. Mr Elie Cohen, a director of CNRS, the state research institute, believes that the flurry of investigations reflects a greater freedom on the part of law officials. 'The judges now feel free to investigate big companies,' he says. 'They feel a greater independence from political authority.' Mr Guy Danet, Mr Suard's lawyer, rejects the idea of a systematic campaign against business leaders. 'There are certain judges who don't hesitate to pursue business leaders, which doesn't bother me. But we reject categorically the investigation into Mr Suard, and the spectacular methods which have been used.' According to Mr Cohen, however, business will come increasingly under examination and the political right will be just as vulnerable as the left. Such a view is supported by the background and political connections of the Alcatel head. Unlike Mr Bernard Tapie, Mr Suard is a pillar of the industrial establishment with leanings to the political right. Despite his differences with the government over Framatome, the state-controlled nuclear power group which Mr Suard is pursuing, he is close to many senior members of the Gaullist RPR party, including Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. In 1986, Mr Balladur, then finance minster, backed Mr Suard for the chairmanship of Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, a diversified group which became Alcatel in 1987 after the merger of its telecoms activities with ITT of the US. The case of Mr Suard is more worrying than that of Mr Pineau-Valencienne, who has been released on bail from a Brussels prison but still faces an investigation into fraud and acting against the interests of minority shareholders at two Belgian subsidiaries. 'For many in France the problems of Mr Pineau-Valencienne are blamed on the Belgians and their legal system,' says one industry observer. 'This is not the case with Mr Suard. It is a purely French affair.' That affair dates back to an investigation into two former employees of Alcatel CIT, a subsidiary of the group involved in the manufacture of telecommunications equipment. The two employees, accused of manipulating prices for France Telecom, were fired by Alcatel last year. But during their investigation, they accused senior Alcatel executives, including Mr Suard, of having work done at their homes which was paid for by the company. In the case of Mr Suard, attention has focused on security systems installed at his Paris homes at a cost to the group of more than FFr3m. Alcatel denies any wrong-doing and says that the security devices were fitted on the advice of the government after the assassination in 1986 of Mr Georges Besse, the head of Renault, the state-owned vehicle group. This claim is supported by Mr Alain Madelin, minister for small business, who was then the minister for industry. Mr Madelin said he was 'very surprised' by the decision to take Mr Suard into custody and said that the expenses in question were not for luxury items but reflected the dangers of Mr Suard's job. Despite the specific nature of the case, however, there are common elements with Mr Pineau-Valencienne's ordeals at Groupe Schneider. In both cases, the chairmen have been dragged into a legal tangle by subsidiaries. In both cases the companies have offered this as a defence. 'Mr Suard does not exercise any functions at Alcatel CIT,' Alcatel Alsthom said, echoing the claims made at its electrical engineering rival. The tenacity of the investigating magistrates is also a common thread. At Alcatel, as with Mr Tapie, the French investigating magistrates have demonstrated an unexpected degree of doggedness in pursuit of their inquiries. That is why the business community is feeling rattled, and why Mr Suard's counterparts will be watching the headlines with interest.</p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXXON TO PAY MILLIONS TO CLEAN UP N.Y. SPILL;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE OUTRAGED BY 'MINI-ALASKA' IN WATERWAY. FEDERAL  AND STATE INVESTIGATIONS CONTINUE.  </P> <P> As a result of what is being called a "mini-Alaska," Exxon Corp. will have to  pay millions of dollars in cleanup costs for allowing a half-million gallons of  fuel oil to spill from a pipeline into a busy waterway between New York and New  Jersey.  </P> <P> The incident was the worst spill to hit the New York metropolitan area in two  decades, and as the cleanup continues almost two weeks later, the stench of  fuel oil still lingers in the area. Many local officials have expressed outrage  because Exxon employees apparently disregarded repeated warnings from their own  alarm system and allowed the leak to continue for 12 hours before acknowledging  it.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the state of New Jersey filed suit against Exxon Friday. At the  same time, New York officials hammered out an agreement with Exxon under which  the oil giant agreed to compensate the state for the environmental damage  caused by the Jan. 2 spill as well as the costs of a study to determine the  extent of the damage.  </P> <P> Both states are continuing criminal investigations to determine whether Exxon  was negligent or failed to act decisively enough to bring the spill under  control.  </P> <P> The federal Environmental Protection Agency is also looking into the incident  and has given Exxon until Wednesday to reply to a list of questions about its  behavior.  </P> <P> The spill has brought a new round of unwelcome attention to Exxon, which is  struggling to repair its image after one of its tankers spilled 11 million  gallons of oil in Alaska last spring.  </P> <P> The heavily industrial Arthur Kill, where the spill occurred, is far from being  as pristine as Alaska's Prince William Sound. However, it is the site of an  important and fragile wildlife sanctuary.  </P> <P> Prall's Island, one of the areas affected by the spill off Staten Island, is a  seasonal home to more than 1,000 pairs of rare herons.  </P> <P> Already, the bodies of more than 300 dead birds -- mostly ducks, geese and  gulls -- have been recovered. Environmentalists fear the effects may worsen  this spring, when migratory birds such as the herons return and begin feeding  and nesting in the tainted areas.  </P> <P> Initially, Exxon estimated that only 5,000 gallons had spilled on Jan. 2, but  it now acknowledges that at least 100 times that much fuel oil escaped through  a rupture in the 20-year-old, 12-inch-wide pipeline. The cause of the leak has  not been determined.  </P> <P> In its own version of events, Exxon has said that an alarm sounded in its  leak-detection system late on the night of Jan. 1. Its operators, accustomed to  false alarms from a system that had been operating poorly for years, relied on  a backup procedure that indicated all was well.  </P> <P> That sequence of events happened two more times during the next 12 hours. Only  after inquiries from the Coast Guard and local authorities did Exxon discover  the leak and report it to federal and local officials.  </P> <P> "It has become clear that Exxon's failure to properly maintain and monitor its  leak-detection system has led to one of the greatest avoidable ecological  disasters in New York City's history," New York Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams wrote  Wednesday in a letter to Exxon President Lee R. Raymond. Drawing a comparison  that many other officials here have made, Abrams called the situation a  "mini-Alaska."  </P> <P> After meeting with company officials Friday afternoon, Abrams said he is  satisfied with Exxon's assurances that it will pay for all the damage it has  caused. State officials said those costs alone will run well into millions of  dollars.  </P> <P> Abrams noted that New York retains the option of a lawsuit if Exxon fails to  live up to its side of the bargain.  </P> <P> He said no estimates of the amount Exxon might owe would be available until  after the study was completed. He added Exxon would not perform the study but  would assume the cost.  </P> <P> New Jersey's civil suit, filed by Atty. Gen. Peter Perretti, charged Exxon  violated the state's oil spill and water pollution control laws. The suit also  charges damages under the common law.  </P> <P> Under New Jersey's suit, Exxon is liable for fines of $50,000 daily for each  violation, the number of which has yet to be determined, according to a  spokesman for Perretti.  </P> <P> The suit also seeks to have Exxon repay any cleanup expenses the state incurs.  </P> <P> John Hagerty, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental  Protection, said the state hasn't "been able to put a price tag on our  environment yet."  </P></p>

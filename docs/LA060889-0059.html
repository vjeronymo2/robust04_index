			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LOMITA REVISES MEASURE TO SPUR COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT ON PCH  </P> <P> After a three-hour public hearing, the Lomita City Council has revised a  controversial ordinance designed to spark more intense commercial development  on a mile-long stretch of Pacific Coast Highway.  </P> <P> Council members asked the city attorney Monday to draft language clarifying  that existing commercial lots would not be subject to proposed new minimum  standards for commercial properties along the heavily traveled highway.  </P> <P> Before the council takes action on the ordinance, another public hearing will  be held July 17.  </P> <P> To encourage larger developments, the ordinance would require that all new  commercial lots on the highway in Lomita must be at least 10,000 square feet  and at least 100 feet wide.  </P> <P> But owners of commercial lots half that size have expressed concern that their  property would be affected by the ordinance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Lot of Concern'  </P> <P> "It was obvious there was a lot of concern about this section," senior planner  Richard Kawasaki said.  </P> <P> In response, the council members asked that the ordinance be revised to clarify  that existing commercial lots that are 5,000 square feet and 50 feet wide are  conforming properties. Lots smaller than that are already designated as  nonconforming.  </P> <P> The proposed ordinance has sharply divided Lomita.  </P> <P> Opponents warn that larger commercial developments will change the small-town  character of the community, force out existing businesses and generate more  traffic.  </P> <P> Mark Hays of Citizens for a Better Lomita opposed any ordinance that allows  more intense development and threatened to mount a referendum against the  measure if it is adopted. Hays also suggested that he may wage a recall  campaign against council members "if the City Council continues to completely  ignore the interests of the people."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Studies Urged  </P> <P> He said the city should not proceed with a zoning change without a full-fledged  traffic study and possibly an environmental impact report.  </P> <P> Supporters argue that it will lead to quality development projects, more retail  businesses and services and a larger and more stable tax base.  </P> <P> Bud Zinsmeister, manager of the Lomita Chamber of Commerce, called the  ordinance "a real good starting place. . . . It's going to be better for the  business community, better for the citizens, better for the community to get  better control of what goes on Pacific Coast Highway."  </P> <P> Zinsmeister noted that many motorists on the highway between Wilmington and  Redondo Beach pass through Lomita without stopping. He said the city is trying  to create "a zone where people will feel more like stopping and shopping."  </P> <P> A moratorium was imposed on most new development along the highway while the  ordinance is being considered. Some residents called on the council to extend  the moratorium beyond its October expiration date to allow time for a study on  the potential impact of more intense commercial development on nearby  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Uses 'Not Compatible'  </P> <P> Kawasaki said the city wants to see under-used properties recycled into larger  and more stable developments. He said that Lomita has quite a few land uses,  such as auto repair shops, that are "not really compatible with a major street"  like Pacific Coast Highway.  </P> <P> Council members are also concerned about the tackiness and haphazard  development along the highway in the adjacent Harbor City area of Los Angeles,  Kawasaki said.  </P> <P> After a public hearing attended by an overflow crowd, the Lomita Planning  Commission last month approved the ordinance to tighten development standards  and require larger lot sizes.  </P> <P> The ordinance would establish a new commercial-retail zone along the highway to  provide for "intensive retail activities and limited service establishments."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Retail Businesses  </P> <P> The measure suggests that appropriate businesses would include an array of  retail businesses, bakeries, banks and financial institutions, art galleries,  florists, markets, jewelry and furniture stores, bookshops, restaurants and  cafes.  </P> <P> It would restrict a variety of businesses, including small motels, auto repair  shops, liquor stores, gas stations, car washes and massage parlors. Liquor  stores and markets that sell liquor would have to be 1,500 feet apart.  </P></p>

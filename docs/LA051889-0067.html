			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL AMENDMENT AIMED AT BLOCKING LONG BEACH FREEWAY  </P> <P> An amendment inserted into a bill on Monday by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles)  could scuttle efforts to complete the final leg of the Long Beach Freeway  through South Pasadena.  </P> <P> By an 18-15 vote, the Senate approved the one-paragraph amendment to prohibit  the state from spending its funds on any state highway in Los Angeles County  built through a historically significant site or through parks or recreation  areas.  </P> <P> It was attached to a bill by Sen Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) to increase  the state gasoline tax by 10 cents a gallon. If the Kopp measure wins Senate  approval, it still would require Assembly approval and the signature of Gov.  George Deukmejian to become law.  </P> <P> Torres said he hopes his legislation will prompt the state Department of  Transportation to consider alternatives, including a light-rail line, increased  utilization of surface streets or a another freeway route.  </P> <P> "I think we've reached a time when expansion of freeways is not the only  answer, especially if it destroys communities," Torres said in an interview  Tuesday. He voiced optimism that his prohibition will remain in the bill as it  goes through the Legislature.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Meridian Variation  </P> <P> Caltrans is finishing an environmental impact study on a route that would  follow Meridian Avenue in South Pasadena, although veering around some historic  homes in the northern part of the city. The route, known as the Meridian  Variation, would be 6.2 miles long and cost about $425 million to complete.  </P> <P> Torres predicted that his proposal would place the Meridian Variation and the  so-called Westerly Route, previously rejected by Caltrans as too costly and  destructive, "in the freezer."  </P> <P> Monday's Senate action is the latest twist in what has turned into a nearly  30-year search for the "missing link" to complete the freeway. The dispute has  pitted neighborhood against neighborhood and politician against politician.  </P> <P> The Torres amendment already has rekindled the controversy in the capital,  where it immediately was assailed by Caltrans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Poor Precedent  </P> <P> Jim Drago, a Caltrans spokesman, said his agency opposes the Torres amendment  because the prohibition would set a poor precedent for the rest of the state.  "It has the potential to stop any major highway project in the state because it  would be common for a route to go through an area with a historic building or  resource," he said.  </P> <P> Just two months ago, Torres decided not to introduce legislation that would  have permitted Caltrans to build part of the freeway in the Arroyo Seco, the  dry riverbed stretching from Devil's Gate Dam to downtown Los Angeles and  skirting South Pasadena's western edge. That legislation was going to be the  centerpiece in the city's attempts to stop Caltrans from completing the freeway  through the middle of South Pasadena.  </P> <P> Torres, whose district includes South Pasadena, said that at that point it  became clear to him "that no route was going to be acceptable in terms of the  destruction it would lead to," prompting him to propose his amendment.  </P> <P> The Torres amendment was opposed on the Senate floor by Sen. Newton R. Russell  (R-Glendale), who said that his constituents in Pasadena support the proposed  freeway because it would funnel traffic off their streets. In an interview,  Russell said he objected to the amendment because its purpose is "to stop the  freeway."  </P> <P> Terry James, Alhambra public works director, said he has not seen the amendment  but also objects to it. "We're opposed because we want the Long Beach Freeway  completed" as a way to remove tremendous amounts of traffic congestion from  city streets, he said.  </P> <P> But Ralph Ochoa, a Sacramento lobbyist retained by South Pasadena, said his  clients are delighted by the latest developments in the freeway fight. He said  Torres' proposal would force Caltrans "to look for another alternative, and  that's precisely what we want them to do."  </P></p>

Bophuthatswana's "Information  Service" mouthpiece quoted Mr Mangope as saying at a news  conference in Mmabatho that the homeland government was 100 per  cent behind the Freedom Alliance's call for a mediated  settlement. "Depending on the competence of the mediators and  the terms of reference, it is conceivable that an agreement will  be reached before the elections," Mr Mangope said. He said  Bophuthatswana's main concern was not to meet deadlines, but to  find solutions.    He told reporters that the Bophuthatswana parliament would  have to decide whether or not it would contest the election.  The Bophuthatswana cabinet had been unable to make this  decision before the registration deadline on Friday because it  first had to consult with parliament on the issue. The  implications that participation in the election would have on  Bophuthatswana's 16-year-old independence also had to be  considered. He stressed that the value his country placed on  independence and freedom was underestimated by people who  believed that Bophuthatswana had not agreed to join the election  was because it was afraid of defeat. "We have worked hard in  this country to achieve what we have, and we are not prepared to  give that away lightly," Mr Mangope said.    Responding to a question on the spate of go-slows and  strikes  in the Bophuthatswana civil service, Mr Mangope said that the  government had made contingency plans which would be implemented  if necessary.</p>

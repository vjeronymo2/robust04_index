			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Observer: Melodious If you really want to catch Lord Hanson's ear, whistle an old Nat King Cole number, or better still get him to talk about his days in the British Forces Broadcasting Service. Lord Hanson may be rather shy when it comes to giving interviews but the BFBS's Richard Astbury had no difficulty getting him to go on the record about his days as a forces disc jockey for tonight's Radio 2 programme 'Forces Gold'. It all dates back to February 1945 when Captain James Hanson of the Duke of Wellington's regiment arrived in Athens. Having helped put down a communist uprising, Hanson bumped into Leslie Perowne, a radio star of that era, who asked him if he fancied spinning a few of his records on the turntable. Hanson didn't need to be asked twice and struck up a close friendship with Perowne. Apart from convincing Hanson that he ought to set up his own radio station one day, Perowne taught him a few presentational tricks which have helped Hanson 'enormously in business'. Given that Astbury had to condense BFBS's 50-year history into 58 minutes, most of Lord Hanson's remarks have ended up on the cutting-room floor. Apparently, Lord H waxed quite lyrically about his friendship with Frank Sinatra whom he entertains at his Palm Springs hideaway.</p>

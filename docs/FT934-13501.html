			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: F Cooper jumps 27% thanks to productivity and cost control FREDERICK COOPER, the manufacturer of architectural hardware and specialist coatings, announced a 27 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.12m for the year to July 31. The West Midlands-based group said the growth in profits, the first since 1989, was due to cost controls and improved productivity. Mr Ed Kirk, chairman and chief executive, said the outcome - achieved on turnover up from Pounds 82.8m to Pounds 84.3m - reflected the group's success in winning a greater market share for its products rather than a significant upturn in demand. The growth in market share was achieved mainly overseas, where in the second half exports rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 17.7m. For the year, overseas sales accounted for 21.4 per cent (19 per cent) of turnover, including Pounds 347,000 from Spectra, the US metal finishing company acquired in June. Although the Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.6m) cash acquisition had been expected to increase gearing to about 60 per cent, Mr Kirk said improved profits and a squeeze on margins had enabled the group to restrict year-end borrowing to Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 6m) for gearing of 42.3 per cent. Improved sales overseas were undermined, however, by flat demand in the UK where turnover fell 1 per cent. Profits from the architectural products division were also hit by a Pounds 150,000 loss on a contract for balustrading - an activity from which the group now intends to withdraw. Nevertheless, tight cost controls and a 2.5 per cent reduction in the workforce meant the company was well placed to increase its market share further, he added. That cautious optimism enabled the group to recommend a final dividend of 1.5p (0.5p), bringing the total to 2.2p (2p), payable from earnings per share ahead to 3.4p (1.8p) basic and 5.8p (4.8p) fully diluted.</p>

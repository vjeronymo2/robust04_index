			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (27): New issues abound after interest rates fall - But first-time investors should not overlook the big international general trusts, which have performed so well over the long term / Investment Trusts THE INVESTMENT trust revival continues. The sector has been able to launch a number of new funds this year, as investors have been attracted to equities in the wake of the decline in interest rates. Both John Govett and Kleinwort Benson have launched funds based on emerging markets; Dunedin and Perpetual have issued Japanese trusts; a smaller companies fund has been launched by a new group, CW Asset Management; further trusts, aimed specifically at the private investor, were launched by Ivory &amp; Sime and Johnson Fry (see below). As well as new issues, a number of existing trusts have taken advantage of their popularity to issue new shares. While this is good news for the sector, investors should not automatically assume that a new issue is the best way of buying shares in the trust. After allowing for the costs of the issue, shares will almost always start trading at a premium to net assets. Although this may be an acceptable cost if the trust breaks new ground, or if other trusts in the same field are also trading at premiums, private investors should always look to see if there are comparable trusts which can be bought at a discount to net assets. There is also the danger that specialist trusts tend to be launched at a time when the sector is in favour, which could be the top of the market. The big international general trusts, which have served investors well over the long term, should not be forgotten by first-time investors. ISIS DEFIES THE CURRENT THE LAUNCH of the Isis trust from Ivory &amp; Sime was an interesting experiment. The trust attempted to turn the logic of most recent trust issues on its head. Rather than offer shares with a high yield, in order to attract income-seeking investors, it offers investors shares with no yield at all. If investors then sell sufficient shares each year, they can achieve the desired level of income (7 per cent) in a tax-efficient manner, because capital is taxed less harshly than income. The idea is not new. Unit trust withdrawal plans used to be a regular feature of the market. What caused their demise was the 1972-74 bear market. With share prices steadily falling, each time investors sold units to get income they took a bigger portion out of a smaller pot. Their starting capital dwindled dramatically. The same could happen to Isis if similar stock market conditions were to prevail. (On the other hand, the comment also applies to some of the high-yielding split-capital trusts). Isis has come up with a partial solution to this problem. It has sold the dividend income of the trust to the institutions, in the form of convertible annuity shares. This gives an immediate uplift to the asset value of the ordinary shares, because the annuities have a negligible claim on the trust's assets. Thus the shares are in the unusual position of being issued at a discount to net asset value. However, there are plenty of critics of this structure. They point out that dividend income is an important component of investment returns, and argue that the uplift in asset value achieved for the ordinary shareholders (around 10 per cent, after expenses) is too small to compensate for this factor. Isis retorts that the structure gives it freedom to buy low-yielding shares which have greater scope for capital growth. A further potential problem, it has been suggested, is that there will be a steady supply of investors who need to sell shares to meet their income requirements. Unless there is equivalent demand to mop up these shares, the trust is likely to fall to a wider and wider discount. The Isis solution is to offer a savings scheme which rewards loyal investors with free warrants. This, the trust hopes, will create the regular demand for buying shares. It remains to be seen whether the balance can be struck at the right point. Isis certainly has an ingenious structure, and the aim of getting investors to exploit the tax break of the annual Pounds 5,800 capital gains tax allowance is a good one. The trust raised just Pounds 26m, and only time will show whether the structure works to the advantage of all concerned or, as critics maintain, is too clever by half. INCOME FROM UTILITY STOCKS THE FIRST investment trust to concentrate on utility stocks was launched by Johnson Fry in June. It has a split-capital structure, with ordinary income shares yielding 9 per cent gross and zero dividend preference shares, rolling up at 9 per cent a year to the wind-up date in 2003. To achieve that yield, the trust cannot concentrate solely on the utilities such as water and electricity. Around 25 per cent of the portfolio will be invested in fixed preference stocks to boost the revenue; in addition, the trust will earn income by selling call options against part of its utility holdings. The overall yield on the trust will be 7.7 per cent, falling to 6.75 per cent after charges. The main appeal of the trust will be the income stream. The ordinary income shares will need asset growth of 3.7 per cent a year to return the issue price of 100p, and the large holding of preference stock will obviously make this harder to achieve. Some capital growth may also be surrendered by the sale of options. THE HENDERSON-TR MERGER THE MERGER of fund management groups Henderson and Touche Remnant has brought together 17 trusts in one range. The names of the trusts will not change, but the management group can now market the trusts together. Those who want to use the combined group's savings scheme will pay a 1 per cent transaction charge on purchases and sales. The minimum monthly contribution is Pounds 25 per month, or Pounds 250 for a lump sum. A special Pep scheme covers five of the group's trusts: Henderson Highland, Witan, Lowland, TR High Income and TR City of London. The minimum monthly contribution is Pounds 100, or Pounds 3,000 for a lump sum. There is a 3 per cent initial charge, a 1.25 per cent annual management charge and a 1.25 per cent transaction charge. Some trusts have separate Pep schemes. The group also offers a free share-exchange facility for those wishing to invest in its trusts. An investor with, say, BT shares can sell them without paying dealing commissions provided the proceeds are invested in a Henderson TR trust.</p>

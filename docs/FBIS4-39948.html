			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1020 GMT on 11 June broadcasts a  40-minute recording of a meeting between Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk and Russian media correspondents.    Kravchuk opens the meeting with a brief speech, thanking the  correspondents for attending. Kravchuk then answers a  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA question about a possible joint ownership of  Crimea by Russia and Ukraine. Kravchuk replies:    "This idea should be put forward by the party that wants it.  If, for instance, the Crimea wants it, then it is not for us to  tell the Crimea, look, we are going to own you on a joint basis.  But there have been no such statements or intentions on the  part of past or present Crimean leaders. The Crimean leaders  have only expressed one opinion to date: First, they want to be  granted a statehood as a transitional stage and then, to become  part of Russia. This is a program, a goal of the party that is  currently in the majority in the parliament. The Crimean  president has the same program. All this time, especially  lately, they have been distancing themselves from Ukraine in all  possible ways except in the economic sphere, because they are  fully aware Crimea is 93 percent dependent on Ukraine."    He says the idea of a joint Russian-Ukrainian ownership of  Crimea would be difficult to put into practice:    "If the question of equal cultural, political, religious,  ethnic, and other conditions for Russians and Ukrainians in the  Crimea is raised, you will see at once that this problem cannot  be resolved. This joint ownership will mean that 95 percent will  be de facto owned by Russia and 5 percent, de jure, by Ukraine."    Asked what way out he could propose, he said: "There is only  one way out -- that the Crimean authorities should act in  conformity with the Constitution, that's all."    At 1034 GMT a LITERATURNAYA GAZETA correspondent asks  Kravchuk if it could be guaranteed that he will refrain from the  use of force in settling the Crimean issue. Kravchuk answers:    "I can tell you with full certainty that under no  circumstances will the leadership of Ukraine and I as its  president use forcible methods in resolving the Crimean issue.  I have said this at a Supreme Council session for all our  people to hear, because we realize that however much this might  hurt everyone, it would mean first and foremost a tragedy to us,  and it is our people who would suffer most. I have accordingly  called on the Crimean leadership to follow the same principle."  He says the Moldova-Dniester region situation should not be  allowed to evolve between Ukraine and Crimea and warned against  any provocations, be it by Russian or Ukrainian forces, with  regard to the Crimea.    Halfway through the program a KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA  correspondent asks whether Russia and Ukraine would be able to  reach an agreement on the Black Sea Fleet. Kravchuk says:    "Today the only issue is where the fleet will be stationed.  The infrastructure, all land-based economy of the Navy and so  on come later. What is the Russian stance today? That Ukraine  must have one base in the Crimea, in Donuzlav. Everything else  in the Crimea should belong to the Russian Black Sea Fleet --  not only Sevastopol. Sevastopol alone is 150 km. So, my  question is: Is it that Sevastopol is the base of the Russian  Navy or is it that the Russian Navy's base is in Sevastopol?  This is not just an editorial change. If it is Sevastopol,  this means 150 km. If the Russian Navy also takes hold of  Feodosia, Kerch, they even have Yalta on the list -- one does  not know why, it is not a military facility...(pauses) I will  then ask a practical question I keep raising with the  authorities, including Russian authorities. It so happens that  85 percent of all the infrastructure of the Black Sea Fleet of  the former Soviet Union -- I quote the figure from memory, so I  may be wrong -- is concentrated in Sevastopol. All or most  officers and junior ranks of the fleet live in Sevastopol. So,  today Ukraine receives its 174 ships, let us say, and they tell  us: move 160 km away from Sevastopol. We need -- just for these  ships -- 2,500 officers and junior ranks. They live in  Sevastopol, however. Are they prepared to move?"    He goes on to say that he understands Russia's interests in  the Black Sea:    "Russia is interested in having its Navy in the Black Sea.  It does not have any other options right now. It is the south  frontier, interests must be protected and so on. I understand  it, we are not children here. Russia uses other bases on the  basis of a contract with Ukraine, through agreements. That's  it. But one should accept that these are Ukraine's bases."    He concludes by saying that the agreement should be reached  following international principals:    "There should be a lease agreement for Russia's main base in  Sevastopol. This is a norm -- that is what other countries do,  so we have not invented anything here. All other bases, which  are there -- the Russian Navy needs them -- all these bases  should be used by Russia through separate agreements."    As he closes his meeting with the Russian correspondents,  Kravchuk asks the journalists to help build relations between  Russia and Ukraine with long-term prospects in mind.    "We are living for today. Sometimes our relations are  determined by mercenary considerations, by feelings such as we  shall show them, we shall cut them off, we are not going to pay,  they are bad because they want to be independent. This is not  like us. For 340 years, we have not fought against one another.  And today, when the question is asked if there will be war  between Russia and Ukraine, I answer without hesitation: no,  there won't be. This is like the Lord's Prayer to me. No, I  say, this is simply inadmissible. If we fail to realize now  that we have reached the point where our future, our children  and grandchildren might be at risk -- that will be the most  frightening thing imaginable."</p>

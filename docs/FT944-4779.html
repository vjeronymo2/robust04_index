			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Minister faces legal challenge The government faces a further embarrassing legal challenge to a ministerial decision following a High Court ruling yesterday. Two sisters who had murder convictions quashed because their trial was prejudiced by press coverage were granted leave to seek a judicial review of the solicitor-general's decision not to bring contempt proceedings against the newspapers involved. Michelle and Lisa Taylor were jailed for life at the Old Bailey in July 1992 for the murder of bank clerk Alison Shaughnessy. Their convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal last June. The judges ordered the trial papers to be sent to Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney-general, to consider contempt proceedings against The Sun, Daily Mirror, Daily Star and Daily Express. Sir Derek Spencer, solicitor-general, acting for Sir Nicholas, decided proceedings were 'not appropriate'. Mr Justice Schiemann, giving leave to the sisters to challenge that decision, rejected the government argument that, because of the attorney-general's unique role as 'guardian of the public interest', his decisions could not be reviewed by the High Court. Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC, counsel for the sisters, told the judge it was the first occasion in British history when a court had ruled that defendants were denied the right to a fair trial as a result of prejudicial press coverage. Mr Robertson said it was the sisters' concern that the same thing might happen again and that others might suffer as they had suffered if the attorney-general did not act. Prejudicial material which was inadmissible in court might be published  - as in the sisters' case - 'and so the danger of trial by newspaper will become a reality', he said.</p>

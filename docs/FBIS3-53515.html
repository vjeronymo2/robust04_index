Salman said that the sudden revelations about  scandals to harm the person of President Clinton have suddenly  surfaced in the defamation media on the eve of the summit and  are merely open operations of blackmail aimed at intimidating  the U.S. President and forcing him to remain committed to the  Israeli logic during his talks with President al-Asad, as the  Syrian minister put it.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Report on WDA highlights conflict of roles THE DAMNING report yesterday by the Commons public accounts committee on the management of the Welsh Development Agency highlights a potential conflict in its role: to be a fully accountable public body, while seeking to promote Wales and attract inward investment with entrepreneurial flair. The appointment in 1988 of the young businessman Dr Gwyn Jones - who was chairman until last week and for much of the period covered by the MPs' report - put the emphasis on the latter. Dr Jones, now aged 44, flew around the world to encourage leading world companies to set up plants in the principality. There are 45 Japanese companies with plants in the principality and the present chairman, Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, yesterday praised the 'enormous achievement' of the WDA in winning inward investment. At the WDA's headquarters in Cardiff the Jones style seemed to hold too much sway for what is a public body funded by the taxpayer and accountable to parliament. While the chairman's strong personality was admired by many, he was not regarded as a man with whom his subordinates would wish to argue. Perhaps partly in consequence, the internal management, headed since early 1991 by Mr Philip Head as chief executive, appeared insufficiently able to exercise what might have been regarded as bureaucratic controls. Neither the Welsh Office nor the government-appointed non-executive directors were effective in stamping out the practices condemned by the MPs. But the climate has changed at the Welsh Office with the appointment of Mr John Redwood as Welsh secretary and the imminent arrival of a new permanent secretary from the Treasury. Mr Redwood said yesterday that the government would make its full response to the criticisms of the public accounts committee later this year. The investigation by the public accounts committee, chaired by Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour MP for Ashton under Lyne, had itself followed concerns raised by the National Audit Office on the WDA's 1991-92 accounts. The committee's main criticisms are: The agency failed to follow a 'clear legal requirement' to seek Welsh Office approval for a redundancy scheme between 1989 and 1992 which led to an overpayment of Pounds 1.4m. The Welsh Office is criticised for providing grant for the scheme without realising that approval had not been sought. The MPs accuse the agency of seeking to buy the silence of its international director Mr Michael Price, who left in February 1992 with an early retirement package valued by the committee at over Pounds 228,000. They are also concerned by Operation Wizard, in which fees of Pounds 308,000 were paid to consultants over three years to consider possible privatisation. The MPs say there might have been a deliberate attempt by the agency to conceal the costs by spreading them under several headings in its accounts. The committee is also disturbed by the appointment in 1989 of an American, Mr Raymond Carignan, as a consultant to lead the agency's US operations. As a result of what are described as inadequate contractual and supervisory arrangements, Mr Carignan departed in 1991 with office furniture and equipment which had cost Pounds 53,000. An even more unfortunate appointment in 1991 was that of a marketing director, Mr Neil Smith, a fraudster whose bogus credentials were not checked. Mr Smith is in prison. 'He was able to breach internal financial regulations,' the report says. The MPs also criticise the agency's failure to seek Welsh Office approval in 1984 for allowing senior officials to have free petrol for their private use. This scheme was stopped in April last year. The MPs, referring to 'the high standards expected of those who handle public finance', recommend that the Treasury and the Welsh Office 'take urgent steps to ensure that problems similar to those covered by this report do not recur, and that the lessons which have been learned are notified to and applied by all non-departmental public bodies'.

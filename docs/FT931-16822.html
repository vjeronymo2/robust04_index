			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Kinkel set to become vice-chancellor: Rise of former civil servant given added boost by Mollemann's resignation MR KLAUS KINKEL, the former top civil servant who shot into the political limelight last year as German foreign minister, is set to become both vice-chancellor in the ruling coalition and leader of the Free Democratic Party. He is confidently expected to declare himself as candidate for the FDP leadership tomorrow, to succeed Mr Otto Lambsdorff, who retires later this year. He will also be the party's candidate for the formal position of vice-chancellor under Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in the wake of the sudden resignation of Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, on Sunday. That was confirmed yesterday by Mr Hermann Otto Solms, parliamentary leader of the FDP, as the junior partner in the coalition struggled to contain the fall-out from the resignation. The party is fighting to hold on to the economics portfolio in the government, in the face of calls from many parts of German industry, and from other political parties, that the job should be given to a serious expert. Party officials insist that the ministry, which covers both industrial policy, including most of the strategic planning for eastern Germany, and external trade, should still go to a fully fledged politician, and not to an outsider from the business community. On the other hand, the main business lobbies want a competent expert who also has the political influence necessary to put policies into action. They also want a candidate who can work well with Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, and not against him, as Mr Mollemann used to do. Mr Dieter Vogel, government spokesman, suggested yesterday that Mr Kohl would 'as a realistic politician' leave the choice of candidate up to the FDP, which was given the portfolio in the coalition negotiations two years ago. The two names cited so far - Mr Gunter Rexrodt, who formerly held the finance portfolio in Berlin, and Mr Walter Hirche, currently economics minister in the state of Brandenburg - are both numerate, but no more than provincial politicians. Both do, at least, have ample experience of the problems of east Germany. The whole upheaval leaves Mr Kinkel, who joined the FDP only two years ago, as the one clear winner. For years a close associate and protege of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister and honorary chairman of the party, he has no grass-roots political experience, although he was always a 'political' civil servant. He had been agonising about whether to confirm his candidacy for the party leadership, while remaining as foreign minister, but the demise of Mr Mollemann leaves him little choice, and little opposition. The only other alternative would be Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer, the construction minister, but she suffered a humiliating defeat last year in the contest with Mr Kinkel to become foreign minister. Mr Kinkel is expected to announce his candidacy tomorrow, at the traditional Epiphany rally of the party in Stuttgart - appropriately enough in his home state of Baden-Wurttemberg.

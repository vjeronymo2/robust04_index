			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Observer: Bearing gifts Evidently US defence company General Dynamics, which has just ousted Britain's Vickers from a tank deal in Kuwait, still believes in the traditional ways of winning friends in the Middle East. Off to the Gulf are its chairman, William Anders, and fellow board member Frank Carlucci, the former US defence secretary, together with wives and a bulging gift-sack which, besides such baubles as crystal and expensive briefcases, includes three ceramic falcons and another of bronze. Observer understands that Saudi defence minister Prince Sultan can expect to receive the bronze example today. In Kuwait, where the delegation is due tomorrow, the prime minister, Crown Prince Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah, can likewise count on adding a statue to his collection. Meanwhile, a special present is being reserved for Abu Dhabi's Sheikh Mohammed, third son of ruler Sheikh Zayed and a highly influential figure in defence procurement. He gets a bowie knife.</p>

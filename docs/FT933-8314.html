			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Beijing stumbles over 'good art': The problems of a new wave of film-makers CHEN KAIGE, director of the acclaimed movie, Farewell To My Concubine, was almost speechless with rage and frustration: 'How can I say anything? What should I say? Should I say the government did the right thing? But that's not the truth. Should I say the government did the wrong thing? If so, how how could I stay on in China?' 'If you quote me directly it could land me in trouble,' he says, before pausing and then adding: 'Well, if you really must quote me, say I don't understand.' Two weeks after the Chinese authorities withdrew permission to be shown after just one viewing in Beijing for Mr Chen's film, which shared this year's Palme d'Or at Cannes with Jane Campion's The Piano, it is difficult to fathom where the decision leaves the new wave of Chinese film-makers and writers; and whether, ominously, the ban heralds a new chill in official attitudes towards art and literature. Wang Shuo, the angry young man among Chinese writers whose books with their earthy real-life dialogue are often subject to ferocious criticism in the fusty official press, believes that a cooler breeze has been gusting through artistic circles for the past several months. 'We could feel the chill since the spring,' he says. 'It's a definite trend.' As for the decision to ban Farewell To My Concubine, it was 'stupid and poisonous', he adds. Other writers, such as playwright Guo Shixin, take a more phlegmatic view, and believe that problems over Farewell To My Concubine are peculiar to the film itself, and do not necessarily reflect a trend. 'The biggest obstacle now is writers' self-censorship,' he says. 'After decades of political pressure, they tend to put limits on themselves automatically.' Whatever the truth, there is no doubt the row over Chen Kaige's film, with its poignant scenes from China's recent turbulent Cultural Revolution past and its implied criticism of the Communist party, has come as a sharp reminder of limits on literary and artistic endeavour, even as Beijing continues to proclaim its commitment to an opening to the outside world. The difficulty facing the authorities in judging what is and what is not acceptable in their terms, was reflected in arguments put forward by Mr Liu Zhongde, the culture minister, in a recent People's Daily article, in which he sought to define what was appropriate in the new market economy. It was a prescription from China's leading cultural commissar that would hardly have engendered much confidence among artists and writers in the government's commitment to literary and artistic freedom. 'At a time when popular art is rapidly developing, we must use the law to stop 'garbage art' from running rampant,' said Mr Liu. 'We should also reward artists who make 'good' art and punish those who create 'crass' works.' It is not clear where Farewell to My Concubine falls between these categories since the authorities have not said publicly why they object to the film, although it is widely assumed that China's party elders found distasteful a homosexual scene and a downbeat ending in the which one of the leading characters commits suicide. Themes of despair and hopelessness are not deemed be appropriate in modern post-Cultural Revolution China, marching as it is towards a glorious new dawn under the banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Mr Chen, meanwhile, awaits the verdict of the censor, who had already chopped about 50 feet out of the film before its one and only showing in Beijing. He insists he will not co-operate in changing the ending. 'If they want to do it, fine,' he said recently. 'But there is no more footage with which to make the change. It will be a film without an ending.' The Farewell To My Concubine saga is unlikely to fade soon, happy ending or no happy ending, nor is there likely to be truce between China's new breed of avant garde film makers and the authorities, now that these talented directors and producers have discovered a means to make their films using private donations and equipment without having to rely on the state. They have also tapped a receptive and encouraging international audience. Underground film-maker Zhang Yuan, for example, was able recently to defy official attempts to prevent him taking his radical work, Beijing Bastards, to the Locarno film festival in Switzerland. China had asked the organisers to withdraw the film, which depicts the seamy side of life in the Chinese capital, and features China's reigning rock idol, Cui Jian. Other works that have been attracting attention recently, include Wu Wenguang's 1966, My Time in the Red Guard, and Bumming in Beijing - The Last Dreamers. Films like these, made on a shoestring, will not be released officially for the time being, since the state controls all means of distribution, but they are being shown to smaller, private audiences, and are helping to attract a following for their authors, and perhaps more important, financial support. Independent directors such as Zhang and Wu might also draw comfort from the example of Zhang Yimou, whose Raise the Red Lantern was initially not allowed to be shown in China. The authorities eventually relented late last year after it had won widespread international acclaim. Chen Kaige, who has graduated from low-budget films to works such as Farewell To My Concubine which cost several million dollars to make, is obliged to tread carefully these days since he requires official Chinese approval for his next venture. . . if it is to be shot and shown on the mainland. Chen is also being obliged to shelve for the moment plans to make a film about Nien Cheng's harrowing novel, Life and Death in Shanghai. This could hardly have avoided negative reference to the Communist party and taboo subjects such as Mao himself. Instead, Chen is embarking on the safer Shadow of a Flower, a love story set in 1930s Shanghai. China's cultural commissars should be able to live with that.</p>

Agriculture Secretary Roberto Sebastian said the government  will gradually reduce trade barriers on agricultural products in  the wake of the successful conclusion of the General Agreements  on Tariff and Trade (GATT). But the tempo of this policy will  have to conform with the existing laws such as the Magna Carta  for Small Farmers which requires some form of protection for the  country's agricultural sector, he added.    Sebastian said the government can only liberalize its market  once the country is already prepared to competitively take on  the global market. Sebastian explained that the government's  protection on smaller farmers does not reverse the government's  commitment to free trade and fairer playing field in the world  economy. He said these moves are part of government's measures  to prepare local farmers for global competition.    To prove his point, Sebastian said Malacanang is willing to  certify as urgent a package of legislative measures to help  local farmers compete in the world market. He said the  government is also putting in place the infrastructures needed  to become globally-competitive -- irrigation, post-harvest  facilities and farm-to-market roads -- while trying to reduce  protection measures gradually.    To demonstrate how the protection measures are gradually  reduced, the agriculture department cited the lifting of  quantitative restrictions on processed meat products which was  earlier listed on Memorandum Order 95 which reimposes  quantitative restrictions (QRS) on a number of products, like  corn, corn substitutes, livestock, meat and meat products and  other agricultural produce.</p>

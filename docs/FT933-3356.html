			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Du Pont to cut a further 4,500 from US payroll DU PONT, the largest US chemicals group, is cutting its workforce by a further 4,500 as part of its efforts to shore up the sagging profitability of its core chemicals operations. The compulsory redundancies, all in the US, will be followed by an unspecified number of job losses in Europe in a plan to save Dollars 500m a year from operations there. The job reductions announced yesterday are restricted to Du Pont's chemicals and specialties businesses in the US, which currently employ 66,000. The brunt of the cuts will be born by Du Pont Nylon, which will shed 1,600 of its 11,000 staff and reduce its textiles capacity by 10 per cent. The job cuts are part of a cost-reduction programme announced last year, which is intended to produce savings of Dollars 2bn a year. An additional 1,300 jobs have already been shed under the plan, Du Pont said. Some 3,000 workers will receive redundancy notices by the end of this month, with the remainder of the 4,500 staff going by mid-1994. Du Pont will take a Dollars 375m after-tax charge in the third quarter to reflect the cost of the redundancies. However, the company will record an after-tax gain of Dollars 235m stemming from changes to the UK's petroleum revenue tax regime. Efforts to cut costs in Europe will take longer to implement, in part because employment laws there will make it more difficult to shed staff, Du Pont said. But Mr John Ogren, senior president in charge of human resources, said: 'There will certainly be some sort of restructuring in Europe.' Under a separate Dollars 1bn cost-reduction effort announced in 1991, Du Pont has shed 9,000 support staff and between 2,000 and 3,000 contract workers.</p>

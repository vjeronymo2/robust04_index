			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Nikolay Geronin and </F> Anatoliy Krasnov]    [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- Russia is now working out an  agreement which would allow North Korea to lumber woods in its  eastern regions, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said.    Speaking to journalists after his talks with visiting South  Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu in Moscow on Thursday,  Kozyrev said that the agreement will reflect two aspects --  Russia's interest in cooperation with North Korea in lumbering  and guarantees of personal safety and human rights for any  person staying in the Russian Federation by the highest  international standards.    "At the same time we understand the interest and concern of  the Republic of Korea because this involves its compatriots," he  continued.    "In this connection we discussed the Russian approach  towards  the enforcement of the rights of our compatriots, including in  the countries that have emerged on the territory of the former  Soviet Union," he said.    "We speak not about interference in anyone's internal  affairs  or manifestations of an imperial approach. We speak about our  natural interest in enforcing human rights," Kozyrev said.</p>

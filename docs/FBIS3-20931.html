			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed Pierre Collet: "Saudia Airlines: The Wings </F> of Desire"]    [Text] After Jedda and Abu Dhabi, and before returning to  Paris, [Industry, Foreign Trade, and Telecommunications  Minister] Gerard Longuet stopped off at the Dubai aeronautics  salon, the third gathering since its creation in 1989. This was  a particularly timely visit since a number of contracts, civil  and military, are now on their approach run.    The "jumbo contract" will be for the partial renewal of the  Saudia Airlines fleet, representing some 40 aircraft and worth  in the region of 20 billion French francs.    The Airbus-Boeing race to win the contract will be ruthless.  After Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and President Mitterrand, and  before Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, it was Gerard Longuet's  turn to discuss the deal with Saudi officials. For the  Americans, President Bill Clinton personally telephoned King  Fahd to inform him of the importance he attaches to this  contract. It is true that Boeing, which has had to concede 70  percent of the market in this region to the Europeans from  Airbus Industrie, is determined to catch up again. This is all  the more true since the potential airliner market in the Middle  East could be worth in the region of $28 billion between now and  2010.    Between 7 and 10 November, the 48 French companies present  in  Dubai, out of a total of 450, noticed that competition was  increasingly severe, with the arrival of newcomers like South  Africa and Romania.    Serge Dassault, president and managing director of Dassault  Aviation [DASA] and chairman of the French GIFAS [French  Aerospace Industries Grouping], took the opportunity to  reiterate that "unlike the United States, we are not opposed to  the transfer of any of our technology."    French manufacturers are ready to take off in the military  market. Dassault Aviation hopes to sell Mirage 2000's, and in  the longer term, Mirage 2000-5's, which Taiwan has expressed an  interest in purchasing.    Eurocopter, a subsidiary of Aerospatiale and DASA, which has  already sold 190 helicopters in the Gulf, would like to sell  some fifteen Panthers to the United Arab Emirates, to compete  with the British Lynx. The Cougar is also being offered to  Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in competition with the American  Blackhawk.    Lastly, Matra has sold the Mistral missile to Saudi Arabia,  the Emirates, and Qatar. The company, headed by Jean-Luc  Lagardere, is in the final stage of negotiations with Kuwait and  Oman.    The coming year 1994 will reveal whether or not France has  found takers for a share of this arsenal.</p>

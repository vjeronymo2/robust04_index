			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (7): Quality tests raise hackles - Funding Quality control has just hit the UK's business schools. Funding for all the UK's higher education is now handled by one powerful quango - the Higher Education Funding Council(Hefce) which is now busily implementing the government's policy that funds should reward quality and that institutions should be inspected to ensure that the state is getting good value for money. Nobody objects to these aims, but assessing the quality of something as subtle as academic endeavour has, almost inevitably, proved highly controversial. Business schools feel particularly badly treated. Professor Leo Murray, director of Cranfield University's school of management, is forthright about the government's role: 'Just as they did with the poll tax, they took something which could be improved and made a hash of it.' Funding is based on two separate components - research and teaching. The first quality assessments of teaching are now being announced. They judge individual departments within institutions, rather than universities as a whole, and divide them into only three broad bands - excellent, satisfactory and unsatisfactory. These classifications hinder marketing overseas, particularly in the competitive business schools market. It is difficult to explain away an official rating of only satisfactory to a foreign company looking for excellence. The committee of vice-chancellors and principals describes the classification as 'a marketing bullet in the foot'. Universities must first make a self-assessment, which, according to Hefce's guidelines, should be an up-to-date, self-critical analysis. In practice, this forces institutions to compose a brief mission statement, and then cite statistics to show that the mission is being fulfilled. This allows recognition for diversity - those who feel they should compete with the best in Europe may do so only satisfactorily, while the excellence of less ambitious institutions which aim to train local middle-managers can also be recognised. Hefce assessors then visit every institution which has claimed to be excellent, plus those where they have grounds to believe that quality is unsatisfactory. Most of the the assessors are are academics contracted to work for Hefce for one to three years - whose presence often causes ire with academics devoted to their own research - along with a core of permanent Hefce staff and subject specialist assessors. Even institutions revealed as excellent by the survey, such as City University Business School and Cranfield, have mixed feelings about the exercise. Mr John Kaye, dean of City, is positive about the new system. He said the process had forced City to 'take a long hard look at itself.' However, he expected Hefce's methodology to evolve with time. Results for the last research selectivity exercise, marked on a five-point scale, were announced in 1992. It found that the top-scoring institutions in business and management studies were the universities of Bradford, Warwick, Lancaster and Strathclyde, the London Business School, the London School of Economics and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. These emphasised published research in academic journals, and in the press. Professor Murray was not happy about this: 'Our job is as a service provider for companies. What is most important for us is how we transfer or apply our research.' He said the exercise forced academics towards publishing research, whether or not this best served their students, 'pushing us towards the old and damaged American model of 'publish and be damned''. These difficulties, facing a government agency, may be resolved as the system matures, but they suggest that precise business school league tables, wanted by many applicants, will not be easy to compile.</p>

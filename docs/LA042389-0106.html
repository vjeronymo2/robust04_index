			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAUGHTER, 3 OTHERS HELD IN KILLING OF MAN  </P> <P> Last Sunday, Deborah Ann Werner, 40, frantically called Orange County sheriff's  deputies, telling them her 72-year-old father had been murdered in his bed and  their Mission Viejo home had been ransacked, apparently by burglars.  </P> <P> On Saturday, however, deputies arrested Werner and three acquaintances on  suspicion of plotting the murder so she could inherit "several hundred thousand  dollars," a sheriff's spokesman said.  </P> <P> The victim, David Werner, a retired stockbroker and businessman, was found with  a knife in his neck. An autopsy showed that he had been smothered before he had  been stabbed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suspicions Raised  </P> <P> The disarray in the house immediately raised suspicions that the scene had been  faked, Sheriff's Lt. Richard Olson said.  </P> <P> "It appeared the scene was made to look like a burglary scene," he said. "There  was no sign of forced entry and nothing was missing."  </P> <P> Inconsistencies in Deborah Werner's story focused suspicions on her, Olson  said.  </P> <P> Also arrested late Friday and early Saturday were Carrie Mae Chidester, 20, of  Huntington Beach, Charles L. Clemmons, 20, of Anaheim, and Miguel Ruiz, 21, of  Garden Grove.  </P> <P> The four were being held in Orange County Jail on suspicion of murder and  conspiracy. Bail was set for each at $250,000.  </P> <P> Deborah Werner reportedly became acquainted with the other suspects through her  daughter, who is a friend of Chidester.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Open Door  </P> <P> Deborah Werner then allegedly hired Clemmons -- a construction worker who was  Chidester's boyfriend -- along with Ruiz to kill her father. She left the  home's sliding glass door unlocked so they could enter the house easily, Olson  said.  </P> <P> After killing David Werner, the two men overturned some chairs and tables in  the house to simulate a burglary, he said.  </P> <P> All four suspects gathered later that night at a nearby convenience store, and  a $3,000 check was given as payment for the killing, Olson said. An additional  $1,000 in cash was promised but never delivered, he said.  </P> <P> Olson described Deborah Werner as a bookkeeper who worked as a liquor store  clerk. Family acquaintances said she was divorced.  </P> <P> After David Werner, a widower, had remarried and then filed for divorce, his  daughter moved into his house to help him through the ordeal, a friend said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Daughter 'Supportive'  </P> <P> "His daughter was very supportive," said Castas A. Ladikos of Brea, David  Werner's divorce attorney. "She'd come to court with him. When I spoke to her  about him, she was very supportive."  </P> <P> Ladikos said she telephoned him after her father was killed, asking whether  Ladikos would handle her father's will in probate. Ladikos referred her to  another attorney, he said.  </P> <P> "From what she told me, the will was in thirds. She and her two brothers would  each get a third," Ladikos said.  </P> <P> He said he would be "real surprised" if the estate amounted to "several hundred  thousand dollars," as estimated by sheriff's investigators. "I handled his  divorce. Unless he's got some life insurance, he just didn't have that kind of  money."  </P> <P> Another attorney who had counseled David Werner during business deals said he  led a varied life that included work as a cattle rancher, appraiser, oil  developer and stockbroker.  </P></p>

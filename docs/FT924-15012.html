			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party At Brighton: Chancellor to emphasise fight against inflation MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, will use his speech tomorrow to emphasise the government's determination to defeat inflation. Normally, the annual gathering of the Tory faithful would not be considered a suitable audience for an exposition of government economic policy. But in a break with tradition the chancellor is expected to devote a substantial part of his speech to policy questions to counter widespread criticism following sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism three weeks ago. During tomorrow's debate on the economy, Mr Lamont will develop his idea of using a number of financial indicators, encompassing measures of narrow and broad money supply growth, asset prices including house prices and the exchange rate, to determine monetary policy. He will also underline the government's wish to get a grip on the UK's rapidly growing public sector borrowing requirement through control of public expenditure rather than any increase in taxation. However, Mr Lamont is likely to avoid giving a very detailed description of the government's policy stance tomorrow. His meeting next Monday with the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee will provide a better opportunity for expounding macro-economic policy, while the annual Mansion House speech to the City on October 29 is still seen as the occasion for giving a comprehensive analysis of monetary policy. Government officials yesterday insisted that sterling's sharp fall since Black Wednesday was not a sign that the government was turning away from tight policies designed to reduce inflation.</p>

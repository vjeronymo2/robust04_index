			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F> "Crimea"]    [Text] Two more deputy factions have been set up at the  Crimea Supreme Soviet session. These are the "Reform" faction  made up of 12 deputies under Vladimir Shevyev, cochairman of the  Crimean Economic Revival Party, and the 10-seat Agrarian faction  under Yuriy Velyukh, a well-known Crimean entrepreneur operating  in the agro-industrial sector. It is expected that yet another  faction -- "Republic" -- will be set up that will fully support  the Crimean Tatar Assembly faction. According to observers, it  may include some deputies from the "Russia" faction. The  session has also elected chairmen of nine of the Crimea Supreme  Soviet's 12 standing commissions and formed the parliament's  Presidium made up of the Supreme Soviet chairman, his two  deputies, and nine chairmen of Supreme Soviet standing  commissions.</p>

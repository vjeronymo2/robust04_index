			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Tighter scrutiny by BR fund BRITISH RAIL Pension Trustee Company, which manages Pounds 8bn in pension-fund assets, has pledged to monitor more closely the management of companies in which it has a significant stake. The move is a sign of the growing restiveness among institutional investors, who are demanding more information about companies they invest in and the ability to effect management changes. The BR fund - one of the largest in the public sector - is the first scheme to announce a policy on corporate governance since the publication last month of the Cadbury report urging wide-ranging reforms. The BR scheme said: 'BRPTC's corporate governance policy has two main aims: to support and promote efficient and effective equity markets and to protect shareholder value.' The policy calls on the scheme to vote on all resolutions placed before company meetings.</p>

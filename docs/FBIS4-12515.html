			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F> delegation, by Sa'id Mu'addi in Cairo on 11 April; from the  "With the Midday Events" program--recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] How do you evaluate the first day of  negotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian sides?    [Sha'th] I think many positive things were realized today,  but we cannot say yet that something has been achieved. As you  know, we are late, and we wanted and still want to complete our  work before 13 April, and to sign the agreement as scheduled.  This led us to call for not delaying the talks and to do what  has to be done to conclude this agreement. Nevertheless, I say  that the first day was not bad, and some positive things have  taken place.    [Mu'addi] What subjects were discussed today?    [Sha'th] All issues were discussed. We discussed the subject  of the Palestinian police, its armament, and number. We  discussed security in the Gaza Strip. In the Legal Committee,  we discussed issues relating to legal and judicial jurisdiction.  We also discussed the transfer of civilian powers. We  discussed the freeing of prisoners. I believe we made important  progress on the full plan for releasing prisoners. I also  believe that we made progress regarding civilian powers.  Perhaps, we will be able before the end of this round to  announce some specific achievements. We also strongly demanded  an end to this security blockade that closed the doors before  our people in the West Bank and Gaza, especially in Jerusalem,  and threatened their livlihoods and business dealings at a stage  that cannot tolerate much obstruction. We also discussed the  need to end the security blockade and curfew in Hebron that  suffered much after the Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre. Perhaps, we  will be able to make some achievements in this field too.    [Mu'addi] Will the negotiations resume next Sunday?    [Sha'th] Yes, we will stay here, and if we fail to conclude  our talks tomorrow, we will resume the talks next week.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, one final question. When will the  vanguards of the Palestinian police arrive in the Gaza Strip?    [Sha'th] This is one of the subjects that we are discussing.  I believe that large numbers will start to arrive soon after  the agreement is signed, and this is what we want to do as soon  as possible.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian  delegation, thank you very much.    [Sha'th) Thank you.</p>

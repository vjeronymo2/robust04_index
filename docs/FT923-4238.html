			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Pressure on margins at Brammer BRAMMER, the industrial services company, blamed depressed business conditions for a 5.5 per cent drop in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.47m to Pounds 4.22m. Turnover slipped by 2 per cent to Pounds 56.1m (Pounds 57.1m) in the six months to June 30, and operating profits fell to Pounds 3.91m (Pounds 4.35m) while earnings per share fell by 7 per cent to 6.7p (7.2p). The interim dividend was unchanged at 4.5p. The results reflected pressure on margins in the UK bearings and power transmission distribution business and tight margins in precision engineering services. There was also a small operating loss in the Texas-based Master Pumps subsidiary due to the reduction in drilling activity. The ESE Rental business posted a small increase in turnover and flat profits. Net cash balances at the end of June were Pounds 6.7m compared with Pounds 2.7m in mid 1991. Since then Brammer has acquired Roulement Service, a Strasbourg-based bearing distribution business, for Pounds 7.3m cash, of which Pounds 1.1m is deferred, and assumed its borrowings of about Pounds 5.2m.</p>

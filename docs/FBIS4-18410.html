			<p>BFN     [Text] We Republikaner actively advocate the fundamental  principles of the liberal-democratic basic system:     -  The  right of the people to exercise state power in elections and  referendums and through special organs of the legislature,  executive, and judiciary, and to elect representatives by  general, direct, free, equal, and secret ballot;    -  The linking of  the legislature with the constitutional system and linking the  executive power and judiciary with law and order;    -  The right to  education and to exercise parliamentary opposition;    -  The  possibility to replace the government and hold it responsible to  the people's representatives;    -  The independence of the  courts;    -  The exclusion of any kind of rule by force and  despotism;    -  The observance of the human rights that are specified  in the Basic Law;    -  Our community as a social state.    We Republikaner advocate a pluralistic rule-of-law state.  The freedom of the individual is limited where it endangers the  freedom of others.    In order to strengthen and develop our democracy in the  sense  of more direct participation by the citizens, we Republikaner  demand:     -  Direct election of the German president by the  people;    -  Submission of constitutional amendments that are adopted  by the Bundestag to the people for decision  (referendum);    -  Introduction of petitions for a referendum and  referendums at federal level, on the example of the constitution  of the Free State of Bavaria;    -  Adherence to the principle of  division of powers. Holders of a political mandate of the  Bundestag and the landtage may neither hold another paid office  nor be a member of the management or board of directors of a  profit-oriented company. This excludes management functions in  one's own company;    -  Prevention of the abuse of state institutions  by political parties and groups, and a struggle against  party-book mismanagement in connection with filling posts in  public administrations;    -  Legal obligation of the responsible  authority to apply within three months to the Federal  Constitutional Court to ban any party that orders observation of  another party by means of the intelligence service, and the  right of a party itself to apply for a ruling on itself being  banned as soon as it is mentioned in a report by the offices for  the protection of the constitution;    -  In addition to the approval  of two-thirds of the members of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat,  an amendment to the Basic Law requires majority approval within  the framework of a referendum.</p>

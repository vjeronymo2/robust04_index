			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACKAGING EXPO TAKES WRAPPER OFF NEW IMAGE  </P> <P> The 7,200 conventioneers who gathered in Anaheim Wednesday for a packaging  industry exposition didn't look like they were under attack. The demonstrations  of wrapping, stuffing and labeling machines seemed to proceed unhindered, and  the racks of plastic bottles, cardboard cartons and foam insulators were not  being visibly assaulted.  </P> <P> But any doubts that the industry has an image problem were quickly put to rest  by the latest cover story in Packaging magazine: Packaging Under Attack. Rising  concern about the environment -- and especially about the ever-growing  mountains of garbage that have nowhere to go -- has jolted the $70-billion  packaging industry, and companies from bottle makers to label-printers are  trying to adjust to a new climate.  </P> <P> "There is an immense consciousness about this now," said William Pflaum,  executive director of the Institute of Packaging Professionals. "We are  committed to the traditional role of packaging, but we're also concerned about  the environment."  </P> <P> That concern, many in the industry concede, is relatively new, spurred by fear  of a consumer backlash against products perceived to be environmentally unsound  as well as a desire to head off legislation that might ban packages that are  non-recyclable and non-biodegradable.  </P> <P> "We had our heads in the sand, but we're trying to reverse that," said John  McKernan, director of marketing at Setco, a large Anaheim-based firm that  manufactures plastic bottles for everything from shampoo to spice. "We are  threatened by irresponsible legislative action, and we have an image problem,  and we are trying to educate the public . . . and educate the politicians."  </P> <P> Plastic bottles, McKernan said, can in almost all cases be recycled just as  glass or aluminum can, and the company is now trying to develop workable  methods of getting the plastic bottles back from consumers.  </P> <P> Gordon E. Hart, legislative representative of the Sierra Club, drew grimaces  from assembled packaging professionals when he suggested that a lot of  packaging products were not necessary to protect and preserve products.  </P> <P> Hart said legislation is necessary to provide incentives for reducing the  amount of waste contained in packages. He suggested by way of example a  per-unit fee on all packages, with a higher fee for those that cannot be  recycled.  </P> <P> And recycling, he emphasized, is not a complete answer; reducing the amount of  waste that is produced to begin with is equally critical.  </P> <P> Pflaum of the Institute for Packaging Professionals said industry was not  necessarily completely opposed to legislation, but that it wanted desperately  to avoid having different sets of regulations in different jurisdictions.  </P></p>

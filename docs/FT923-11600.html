			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / UN fears a million more Bosnian refugees THE United Nations, already pouring relief supplies into Bosnia, fears that winter hardships could force a million more people to leave their homes in the newly-independent Balkan state and become refugees, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. 'We are already assisting 2.5 million people (from Bosnia) and we are terrified at the way this conflict is evolving,' said Mr Jose Maria Mendiluce, special envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). 'We are not expecting a massive return of population to their place of origin (after the war). We are witnessing ..a growing conviction among the people that the situation will never be as it was,' he said. Mr Mendiluce said a big fear was that as winter approached, hundreds of thousands more civilians would try to leave their bombarded towns and cities in search of food, warmth and safety. The UNHCR has called a conference in Geneva next week to ask the world community for more support and to establish mechanisms to deal with the crisis.</p>

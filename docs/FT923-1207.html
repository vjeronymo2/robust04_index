			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Sea change in industry turns tide for unions: Old-style pay bargaining is declining the most comprehensive of its kind - will seem old hat to close observers of UK industrial relations, but still contains a fair number of surprises. It concludes that the UK's distinctive 'system' of industrial relations, based on adversarial collective bargaining, no longer characterises 'the economy as a whole'. Where it persists, institutional change has been slight, and no new pattern of industrial relations has emerged in the non-union sector. The survey is sponsored by the Department of Employment, the Economic and Social Research Council, the Policy Studies Institute and Acas, the conciliation service. The 1990 survey, published today, finds fewer union members, fewer employees covered by collective bargaining, fewer shop stewards, fewer closed shops and fewer strikes than in the 1980 and 1984 surveys. The 1984 survey, published in 1986, caused some surprise because it found that the Thatcherite revolution, then in full swing, had had relatively little effect. The 1990 survey confirms that union power has declined, but not disappeared. The authors say changes in industrial relations law were only one cause of the sea change in industrial relations. In the 1980s the nature of the workplace was changing. There were far fewer big manufacturing plants, less manual work, a smaller public sector and a growing service sector. Least change has been recorded in public-sector workplaces, which are much more likely to be unionised, more likely to have national-level bargaining with several unions, and much more likely to experience strikes. Private manufacturing has the 'model' profile, with fewest strikes, the highest incidence of merit-based pay, and - where unions are recognised - the highest number of single-unit bargaining groups. The survey is based on 5,000 interviews with managers and employee representatives at 2,000 workplaces, together employing more than 1m people. It starts with the chronicle of decline. Union density - the proportion of union members in the national workforce - fell from 58 per cent in 1984 to 48 per cent in 1990. The survey excludes workplaces with fewer than 25 employees, so it probably overstates union density, and similar indices, perhaps by 10 percentage points. Density is down from 66 per cent to 53 per cent among manual workers and from 51 per cent to 43 per cent among non-manual workers. The newest plants show a slight increase in union density over the early 1980s, so the high-water mark of 'macho management' may have passed. The proportion of workplaces with 100 per cent unionisation has declined from 18 per cent to 13 per cent - partly because of the collapse of the closed shop, which now covers an estimated 4 per cent of manual workers. The index of union recognition for collective bargaining on pay has dropped from 66 per cent to 53 per cent of workplaces, with engineering (down from a half to a third of plants) and printing and publishing (from more than three quarters to less than half) the most affected. The proportion of employees covered by collective bargaining has fallen from 71 per cent to 54 per cent - 8.4m workers out of the sample of 15.3m. It is hard to say how much of the fall-off in collective bargaining is due to derecognition. One part of the survey says that only 3 per cent of workplaces derecognised unions between 1984 and 1990, but a separate panel found the figure to be 9 per cent. Although the reach of traditional collective bargaining has been reduced, its form is surprisingly unchanged. Multi-unionism still predominates, with an average of 2.5 unions to each workplace, and a third of public-sector workplaces with four unions or more. Against that, more than half of private-sector workplaces have just one bargaining unit. The average number of bargaining units in the public sector is 2.5. Only 10 per cent of workplaces experienced strike action in 1990, compared with 19 per cent in 1984 - the figure in the public sector was 25 per cent, concentrated in local government and higher education, while the private-sector figure was 3 per cent. About a third of strikes were likely to involve picketing, considerably more than in 1984. The main cause of strikes remained disputes over pay. Pay bargaining at workplace level has become the most common form of bargaining in private manufacturing. The most common bargaining level is still multi-employer, national bargaining, covering 26 per cent of workplaces. Single-employer bargaining covers 15 per cent of workplaces and plant bargaining 5 per cent. The most important influence on pay settlements is still the Retail Prices Index, but there is now more merit-related pay, which covers some employees in 45 per cent of workplaces - 31 per cent in the public sector, 66 per cent in private manufacturing. Forty per cent of workplaces have profit sharing and 32 per cent employee share schemes. About 27 per cent of workplaces, especially those with mainly women workers, paid low pay - below Pounds 3.28 an hour. Workplace Industrial Relations Survey.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "No Time To Trivialise Human Rights"] </F>   [Text] The news that Chinese authorities have released  three political prisoners is indeed welcome. But we are  profoundly uneasy about how China's Western critics have been  drawn into what one human rights group described as "a cynical  trade in political prisoners".    Both sides -- not just China -- are treating prisoners of  conscience as mere tokens, commodities suitable to be bartered  for tariff reductions, export quotas, satellites, or arms  proliferation deals.    Xiao Bin's only crime was to tell a U.S. television reporter  what he had heard about the 1989 Tiananmen massacre in Beijing.  His mistake was to speak in front of a camera. For this he was  sentenced to 10 years in prison.    The other two freed dissidents had also been convicted of  "counter-revolutionary crime". Ding Junze, a philosophy  instructor in Shanxi had been sentenced to 12 years for the  crime of "inciting anti-government activities."    Liao Yiwu, a Sichuan poet, was sentenced to four years for  "antigovernment activities." This, apparently, was the making  of an art video which expressed sympathy for the victims of the  1989 massacre.    Under China's legal code counter-revolution is defined as  "all acts...committed with the goal of overthrowing the  political power of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the  socialist system." It embraces "acts" of speech deemed to be  "counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement."    The existence of this so-called "law" is the sole basis for  Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin's fraudulent claim that  China has no political prisoners.    Wu's preposterous statement last Thursday that the  functioning of China's judiciary "is something that the Chinese  government cannot interfere in" was a bald application of the  "Big Lie" techniques first perfected by Stalin and his  apologists.    We are expected to believe that the trials of political  dissidents in China remotely resemble due process, and that they  are not carried out strictly according to the instructions of  party leaders.    Wu's smug defence of China's suppression of dissent as  "legal" and therefore unrelated to human rights is bad enough.    Equally cynical, however, are the circumstances surrounding  the release of Xiao, Ding and Liao, just one day after the  release of the U.S. State Department report on human rights.    We are poised for another round of cynical manipulation as  the annual charade of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status  negotiations meander to a conclusion on June 4, exactly five  years after the Tiananmen uprising.    What began as a sincere impulse to help the victims of  political oppression in China has been degraded to the lowest  form of political theater.    Yesterday's reported release is only the first act in this  year's MFN circus. China will play its part by releasing a few  more political prisoners, agreeing to prison visits by the  International Red Cross, and making reassuring noises about arms  proliferation and helping to curb North Korea's nuclear  ambitions.    The Clinton administration will deliberate meaningfully  before finally pronouncing these concessions "significant,  overall", and therefore sufficient to justify extending China's  MFN status one more time.    Congress, after a series of gestures to demonstrate the  purity of its commitment to human rights, will agree -- with  reservations -- that China does deserve to keep MFN after all.    What are rational people to make of this? The starting point  should be to state unambiguously that it is inexcusable for  there to be political prisoners in China and everywhere else.  It is even less acceptable for them to be treated inhumanely.    There are certain universal standards of acceptable behavior  which the international community has a responsibility to try to  uphold.    China, as a member of this community, cannot expect to be  immune from pressure on this front.    The question is how can pressure be best applied? Most  useful of all may be simply to communicate to Beijing, as  clearly and as often as possible, what are seen as minimum  standards of decency for a civilized society, and to identify  where we believe China does not measure up.    Trade policy and sanctions have so far proved a blunt and  not  very effective tool for protecting or developing these freedoms  in China, or anywhere else.    However satisfying the rhetoric sounds, the use of real  sanctions, like revoking MFN, may strengthen the reactionary and  repressive elements in the Chinese leadership.    But what we dislike most of all is the trivialization of  human rights in China into an excuse for empty rhetoric and  political posturing by U.S. politicians, none of whom will ever  have to live with the consequences of their actions.</p>

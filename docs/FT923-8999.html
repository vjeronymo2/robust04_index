			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Observer: Transcending Lloyd's of London needs all the help it can get. But maybe it should look no further than its own navel. The Natural Law Party thinks that transcendental meditation is a solution for all the world's problems; now it is proposing 'detailed discussions' with insurers. For the investment of 'a few million pounds' in 'Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Vedic technology', insurers could save hundreds of millions of pounds by reducing crime and accidents, according to the party's leader, Geoffrey Clements. Seven thousand experts, which presumably include the 310 candidates fielded in the general election, practising transcendental meditation twice daily can 'create a positive influence on the entire world,' he insists. The crisis at Lloyd's and at big insurance companies indicates the 'short-sightedness of leaving the destiny of the world to chance. We would like to invite the leading insurers to ensure their own future,' says Clements, arising from his horizontal plane.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: STILL SMALL VOICES BY JOHN &amp; JANET WALLACH (CITADEL  PRESS: $9.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> Fourteen profiles of Palestinians and Israelis living in the Gaza Strip and  West Bank. John and Janet Wallach balance their account by interviewing  subjects who represent a wide spectrum of opinion: a liberal rabbi who works to  establish dialogues among the citizens of Efrat; Jewish and Islamic  fundamentalists who believe that the land is God's gift to their people and  everyone else should convert or leave; a Palestinian journalist whose efforts  to provide a balanced account of life in the occupied territories have earned  him the enmity of both sides.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, the interviews are filled with recriminations,  rationalizations, accusations, excuses and ingenuous statements about how  simple the solution to everything could be if only . . . These candid profiles  make it clear why a peaceful solution to the intifada is unlikely: Both sides  seem more interested in achieving victory over their foes than in living in  peace with their neighbors.  </P></p>

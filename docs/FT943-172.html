			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Insurers and watchdog at odds over pension sales compensation The City's chief regulator and the life insurance industry are deadlocked over how to compensate people who could lose money from the mis-selling of personal pensions. The discord is a sign of the gulf between the Securities and Investments Board and the life industry, which has become increasingly defensive after public criticism of its practices. The industry is refusing to set up a voluntary scheme to deal with compensation claims for pension transfers - which some regulators now believe could total Pounds 500m. Instead, cases will be handled within existing compensation arrangements. Details of how life companies should identify and compensate those who may lose out because they took poor advice to opt or transfer out of an occupational scheme will be published in an SIB report next month. The report is also expected to confirm findings from a pilot study last year, suggesting that up to a third of the 500,000 or more total pension transfers since 1988 could have been based on poor advice. The existing Investors Compensation Scheme, operated by the SIB together with the industry, acts as a safety net for those entitled to redress who find that the adviser responsible for their plight has ceased to trade. The government and the regulator wanted separate arrangements for pension transfers, to avoid the risk that they would swamp the current scheme. Compensation claims in a pension transfer case go first to the life company or independent financial adviser which mis-sold the pension. The ombudsman for the Personal Investment Authority, the new regulator to protect the private investor, will probably intervene in any dispute. For the life industry, the most sensitive compensation issue is paying claims against independent advisers who have gone out of business. Such cases will now be handled by the ICS. A special unit is be set up within the PIA to deal with inquiries from customers of such firms. The scale of potential mis-selling indicated in next month's report is likely to be a cause fresh of conflict between the SIB and the life companies. Many life companies dismissed the pilot study, as it was based entirely on files rather than talking to sales agents and customers. They said the problem was one of record-keeping rather than of poor advice.</p>

Tolstikov, Institute of Organic Chemistry, Ural  Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Ufa; UDC 547.919.2+582.736]    [Abstract] Technical details are presented on the synthesis  of a series of glycopeptides derivatives of glycyrrhizic acid as  part of a screening program for potential immunomodulating  agents. The basic approach consisted of activation of the  carboxyl group with N-hydroxybenzotriazole and  N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide--1:3-4:3-4 molar ratio--in dioxane  or THF. The activated intermediates were reacted with amino acid  esters prepared in situ from the hydrochlorides in the presence  of a tertiary base (eg., pyridine,  triethylamine)--3.5-4:4-5--for 24 h at 0-5C. The target  products were obtained in pure yields of 79-95%. Tables 3;  references 8: 6 Russian, 2 Western.</p>

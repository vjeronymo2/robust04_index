			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (5): Crocodile venture - Leslie Crawford looks at novel businesses Crocodiles, vanilla pods, roses and the colossal Nile perch of Lake Victoria do not, on the face of it, have much in common, but they belong to a growing list of non-traditional exports which last year earned Dollars 40m for Uganda. The emergence of new, export-oriented ventures is perhaps the best economic news Uganda has had in years. Many analysts believe the country's future development depends on the multiplication of these small, private-sector businesses. Neither the privatisation of bankrupt parastatals, nor Uganda's international road shows to attract foreign investment, seem to hold as much promise as the eclectic activities of Uganda's new entrepreneurs. Tony Bristow left his native Zimbabwe to start up Uganda's first crocodile farm three years ago. A Ugandan friend, who had worked in Zimbabwe, convinced him the project would succeed with the tax breaks and liberalised foreign exchange environment available to new investors in Uganda. The novelty of the project at first baffled the authorities. Mr Bristow had to obtain the authorisation of three different ministries - Animal and Fisheries, the Game Department and National Parks - to set up Uganda Crocs Ltd. He also helped draft Uganda's proposal to join the UN Convention for the International Trade of Endangered Species (Cites), that regulates the export of crocodile skins. Cites allocated Uganda an initial export quota of 2,500 skins a year. Mr Bristow collects crocodile eggs in the wild, and breeds them in captivity. The cold-blooded creatures are warmed to an optimal temperature of 32 deg C to accelerate their development. After two to three years, the crocodiles are ready for marketing. Only half a dozen tanneries around the world specialise in exotic leathers, and they pay between Dollars 2.5 and Dollars 7 per centimetre for the soft underbelly of a young croc. The Gulf War, Mr Bristow says, depressed demand for crocodile skins. He thinks it may take four years before he sees a return on his Dollars 500,000 investment. In Mukono, a district near Kampala, more than 5,000 peasant farmers now have vanilla vines interplanted with their banana, maize and coffee bushes thanks to an export venture started in 1990 by Aga Sekalala, a local businessman. 'After the war ended in '86,' he recalls, 'I was looking for cash crops to plant on my farm.' He sought advice from the World Bank's Africa Project Development Facility, which noticed, during a visit to Mr Sekalala's farm, that vanilla was growing wild among the food crops. APDF came back with a proposal: it would find a guaranteed buyer for Ugandan vanilla if Mr Sekalala could persuade the farmers of Mukono to revive the vanilla production that had been abandoned during the Amin years. After testing Mr Sekalala's vanilla, McCormick &amp; Company of the US, the manufacturer of seasonings and flavourings, signed a three-year agreement in 1990 to purchase his entire production. The contract has just been renewed for another three years. Meanwhile, the vanilla growers involved in Mr Sekalala's venture have multiplied from 50 in 1990 to 5,000. Vanilla fields now cover an estimated 600 hectares. 'Over the past four years,' Mr Sekalala says, 'we have exported more than nine tonnes of cured vanilla worth a total of Dollars 825,286.' Premium-grade cured vanilla commands about Dollars 72 per kg on the world market. Within 10 years, it is estimated Uganda could be exporting up to 150 tonnes of vanilla a year, pushing foreign exchange earnings up to Dollars 7.5m. Half a dozen Ugandan companies have launched themselves into the rose exporting business, after observing how floriculture has blossomed in neighbouring Kenya. 'Uganda has a more favourable climate for rose growing than Kenya,' says Rene Bartoli of Victoria Flowers, 'and it is not plagued by water shortages.' In addition, the cost of air freight - the largest outlay of any flower export operation - is more competitive from Entebbe airport than Nairobi. This combination of factors is leading many established Kenyan flower companies to look at Uganda to diversify their sources of production. Mr Bartoli and a Ugandan partner have bought a 3.3 hectare plot on the shores of Lake Victoria to start their rose farm. At Dollars 400,000 a hectare, their initial investment carries a considerable degree of risk, particularly as returns will depend on the price their roses can fetch at the flower auctions in Holland. The first roses will be ready for export in October. Launching a business in Uganda, however, is not for the faint-hearted. 'You have to be prepared to be completely autonomous and self-sustaining,' Mr Bartoli warns. Because power supplies are unreliable, he had to invest in a back-up generator. The lack of cold storage facilities at Entebbe airport means that Victoria Flowers will have to build its own. But the most common complaint of Uganda's new breed of exporters is the loss of competitiveness of Uganda's currency, the shilling, which has appreciated by more than 20 per cent against the dollar in recent months. 'The appreciation of the shilling could kill our business, particularly as Indonesia is also making serious inroads into the vanilla market,' Mr Sekalala says. 'I also had a project to export organic honey, but it is just not competitive at the current exchange rate.'</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Baggio's magic deserts Italy in shoot-out - Jurek Martin at the Rose Bowl sees Brazil win their fourth World Cup Roberto Baggio ran out of miracles in Pasadena last night. The man who had steered Italy to the brink of World Cup glory drove a penalty kick over the bar to hand Brazil their fourth championship in the first final to be decided on penalties. Italy's veteran defender Baresi missed with the first penalty of the shoot-out, blazing the ball over the bar. But goalkeeper Pagliuca temporarily rescued Italy when saving Brazil's opening spot-kick from Santos. Brazil regained the initiative when Massaro's shot - Italy's fourth penalty attempt - was saved by Taffarel, diving to his left. After Dunga scored to give the Brazilians a 3-2 lead, Baggio's miss then handed Brazil the trophy with a penalty kick to spare. The match itself was goal-less after 90 minutes. During 30 minutes of nerve-wracking extra time, clear chances were squandered at both ends as two magnificent defences finally started to wilt. After 93 minutes Bebeto missed an apparently open goal for Brazil from an acute angle and 16 minutes later his fellow striker, Romario, amazingly missed from only 4 yards' range after Bebeto had set up a cross from Cafu. But it was not all one way. Twenty-three minutes into extra time Roberto Baggio worked a beautiful one-two with Massaro and had a clear sight of goal, but could not summon the energy to put a shot wide of Taffarel, the goalkeeper falling on a weak effort. So it went back and forth, with Berti and Baresi in agony with cramp. Brazil made their last substitution in extra time, Viola for Zinho, and Viola went close twice. But the defences held. They had played magnificently all day. The first half was pretty quiet - pretty at times but mostly uneventful. Play flowed generally Brazil's way, because Dunga was the dominant mid-fielder on the pitch, but Maldini and Baresi gave little away at the back and three or four Brazilian half-chances were blocked by Italian legs and bodies. In fact, the clearest opportunity fell to Massaro after 18 minutes, when put through by Baresi who more than once ventured out of defence. But Taffarel, previously the most under-worked goalkeeper in the World Cup and also mistrusted by his countrymen, fell smartly on the low, hard shot. At the other end Pagliuca was never seriously tested, though not for want of trying by Romario and Bebeto. After 12 minutes Romario headed straight at him from a Dunga cross. Five minutes later Dunga and Romario combined to set Bebeto through but his shot was blocked. The closest Italian squeak came after 24 minutes when Branco practised his speciality - the bent free-kick - from 25 yards out. Pagliuca got to it at the post but could not hold on. With Brazilians lined up in solid ranks in front of goal, Mazinho failed to pull the ball back. It was Pagliuca who came closest to deciding the match. After 75 minutes he made a hopeless mess of a long-range shot from Mauro Silva. Bending to gather it, he let it through his hands. It bounced off his knee and slowly on to the right-hand post and back to him again. That apart, neither side created a clear-cut chance and two marvellous defences increasingly controlled the game with Silva, Santos and Aldair matched manfully by Maldini and Baresi. For Brazil, who won the World Cup in 1958, 1962 and 1970 in the Pele era, it was a dramatic way to win a record fourth title. For Italy, winners in 1934, 1938 and 1982, it was heart-breaking.</p>

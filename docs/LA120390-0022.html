			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NATIONWIDE;  </P> <P> WEATHER FORECAST FAILURES REPORTED  </P> <P> The National Weather Service has fallen short of its mission to warn the public  of savage weather that claims more than 400 lives and causes $6 billion in  damage every year, a newspaper reported. The federal agency misses two-thirds  of all tornadoes, three-fifths of all flash floods and 40% of severe  thunderstorms every year, the Cleveland Plain Dealer said. The newspaper said  its investigation was based on weather service internal computer records and  other data.  </P></p>

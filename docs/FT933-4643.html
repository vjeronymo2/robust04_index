			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / People: Italian with designs for Dawson Dawson International, the Edinburgh-based textile company, has appointed the merchant banker Arnoldo di Giorgio to the newly created post of director of corporate strategy. He will be responsible for identifying and helping secure acquisition opportunities. Di Giorgio, 34, was until recently director of investment banking with IMI Capital Markets UK, an offshoot of IMI, the Italian state-owned investment bank. He has also worked for Schroders and the Industrial Bank of Japan, both in the US and Europe. Born of Italian parents in the US but educated in Italy, he says he came into contact with Dawson International while acting for companies which Dawson was attempting to take over. Sir Ronald Miller, chairman of Dawson, says it is hiring di Giorgio because of his international experience of the textile industry. 'This new appointment brings additional resources to help realise our full potential and marks the strengthening of our resolve to do so,' he said. Di Giorgio will join Dawson on November 1 and will be based in London. Dawson is divided between Dawson Premier Brands in the UK, which is predominantly in knitwear, and Dawson Consumer Products in the US, whose products include thermal underwear. It made pretax profits of Pounds 32m on turnover of Pounds 431m in 1992/93, making it a medium-sized player among other textile groups. 'Dawson has reached a critical level of profits and sales,' says di Giorgio. 'It can either go up or down - it can't stay where it is. I would like to see global approach.'</p>

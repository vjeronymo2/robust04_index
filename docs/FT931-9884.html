			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: High rents blamed for pub price rises BEER prices in pubs have risen 17 per cent in real terms since 1989 mainly because of the higher rents and charges imposed on pub leaseholders by national brewers, the Commons agriculture committee was told yesterday. Though wholesale prices had moderated, consumers had so far gained little benefit, Mr Stephen Cox, of the Campaign for Real Ale, said. Many of the pub-owning companies that had been formed as the national brewers were forced to dispose of a third of their pubs by the government's reforms - known as the beer orders - had 'borrowed so heavily to buy pubs that they are in no position to pass on brewery discounts to customers,' he said. Mr Ted Weakner, chairman of the London and South-East Licensed Victuallers Association, said many tenants had been forced to accept uneconomic rents and repair costs or quit their pubs. Both Camra and the licensed victuallers told the committee that a review of the effects of the beer orders should be carried out urgently. The government has already indicated that any review will be left to the European Commission in 1997.</p>

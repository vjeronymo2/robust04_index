			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Alcoa of Australia ahead after nine months THE WEAKER Australian dollar and the benefits of expansion at the Wagerup refinery helped push up profits at Alcoa of Australia, the intergrated aluminium producer, in the nine months to end-September. Net profits before abnormal items rose 47.6 per cent to ADollars 300.4m (USDollars 198m). The results, which were reached on total revenues of ADollars 1.66bn against ADollars 1.61bn last time, were also aided by lower corporate taxes. However, even before tax and abnormals, Alcoa of Australia, in which Alcoa of America and Western Mining Corporation are the largest shareholders, posted a 37.3 per cent improvement to ADollars 453m. After abnormals, the company made a net ADollars 360.1m, compared with ADollars 203.5m in the same period last year. Alcoa said the results reflected the favourable impact of the alumina refinery expansion on production, shipments and costs, and the weaker Australian dollar. These benefits were partially offset by lower US dollar prices for aluminium ingot, can sheet and alumina, lower interest income and lower ore grade from gold-mining operations. Gold production for the period was 103,885 fine ounces, compared with 124,712 ounces in the first nine months of 1992.</p>

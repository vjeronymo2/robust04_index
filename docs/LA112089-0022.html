			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> ADMIRING, REVEALING 'ADIEU' TO JACQUES BREL  </P> <P> What are the shows that touch us the most? Not the ones that tell us about  other people. The ones that tell us about ourselves -- our pain, struggles,  contradictions, our secret dreams. Sometimes through other people.  </P> <P> That is surely the case with Noel Harrison's "Adieu, Jacques . . . !," a  melancholy salute to Jacques Brel, an old friend of the heart. The standard  Brel show in America is "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living Paris," a  bouncy, forward-looking encomium that acquaints the theatergoer with a  repertoire of striking, playful and emotional French songs written by a  venerated Belgian songwriter and sung in English. It is cabaret revue stuff, to  be delivered at top energy by a quartet of performers.  </P> <P> Now, starting with the almost audible sigh in its title, listen to Harrison's  moody "Adieu, Jacques . . . !," playing at Theatre/Theater and sung entirely  (and articulately) in the original French. Rather than a triumphant affirmation  of the man, it examines Brel through a glass darkly, catching his complex  reflection in Harrison's own tortured soul.  </P> <P> The singer-songwriter who died of cancer at 49 was an unshackled optimist who  refused to go gentle into his good night. Harrison, who met Brel once, admits  he envies and admires such defiance and decisiveness, "completely committed to  the fierce, implacable victory of the heart," which he feels he can never  attain. Thus, "Adieu, Jacques . . . !" informs us about both men -- their  differences harmonically joined at the psyche in what turns out to be a raw and  disarmingly naked evening.  </P> <P> Harrison gives us a couple of the stunning Brel standards ("Marieke" and  "J'Arrive"), but mostly talks to us about the man and delivers a passel of  splendid songs new to American ears: the laconic "Next to Gauguin," "Vesoul"  (word-play about familiar marital spats), "Rosa" (a schoolboy's inclination to  love in Latin declinations), the humorous "Comment Tuer L'Amant de Sa Femme"  ("How to Kill Your Wife's Lover"), "La Chanson Des Vieux Amants" ("The Old  Lovers' Song") and the nostalgic "Mon Pere Disait" ("My Father Used to Say").  </P> <P> That doesn't make it all good news, however. Harrison's interpretation of the  Brel is low energy communion and catharsis. Often too low. And the device he  has chosen for speaking and singing to us is at the very least cumbersome:  memories triggered by receipt of a packet of letters written to a deceased  friend and returned by another.  </P> <P> This opens the floodgates of reminiscence, yes, but also requires too much  moving to the small desk in the dark, disheveled room, folding and unfolding of  letters, putting on and taking off spectacles, which mostly interrupts the  stream of consciousness.  </P> <P> The set, lights and direction go uncredited, suggesting that Harrison did them  all himself. At some loss. Because as penetrating as the piece can be, it also  feels a bit scruffy and untended. It is one thing to wander through another  artist's soul, illuminating both the explorer and the explored, and it is  another to give the journey coherence (as opposed to slickness). A better grip  on what's there would produce louder reverberations.  </P> <P>  At 1713 N. Cahuenga Blvd., Thursdays and Fridays, 8 p.m. until Dec. 22.  Tickets: $13; (213) 871-0210.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Late-Night Pipeline Series -- Neuroses With a Grin  </P> <P> "Two Heads" at the Saxon Lee Gallery is another in the Pipeline company's  late-night series that can accommodate short, offbeat performance fragments for  a dedicated crowd. In "The Night Driver," Scott Kelman serves up a  dramatization of a delicious Italo Calvino treatise on the neuroses of love, as  a man races along the autostrada towards the woman he wants to leave but isn't  quite ready to surrender.  </P> <P> It is a hilarious exploration of the complex permutations of the event, subtly  paralleled by the hostile automotive environment and humorously underscored by  Jay Green's music and sound effects. The whole affair is beautifully suited to  performance, but Kelman will have to shed his New Yorkish colloquialisms for us  to accept him as an urbane, complicated and terminally self-tortured Italian.  </P> <P> There is no lack of self-torture in "Help Me Out of This Head With Peter  Bergman," which constitutes the second half of this bill. Bergman is a  certifiable zany, erstwhile with the sorely missed Firesign Theatre, and his  Woody Allenish lament on the fate of the Earth and its inhabitants, especially  one Peter Bergman, is not new but enduringly funny and perpetually updated.  </P> <P>  At 7525 Beverly Blvd., Saturdays, 10:30 p.m., until Dec. 16 (No performance  Nov. 25). Tickets: $12; (213) 933-5282 or 629-2205.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / US attacked over satellite launches THE US government is putting unfair pressure on international satellite operators to place launch contracts with Russia and China, the chairman of Europe's Arianespace has claimed. Mr Charles Bigot said Washington had 'political reasons' for pressing Intelsat, the world's biggest independent operator of telecommunications satellites, to consider such launches. Intelsat is an international co-operative owned by 120 national telecommunications companies such as privatised British Telecom and state-owned France Telecom. In an interview Mr Bigot identified two main benefits for the US of encouraging the flow of contracts to China and Russia. The US wanted to improve political goodwill with these new business partners, and to dilute competition to its own satellite launch companies, he said. In the last decade Arianespace has overtaken US rivals and now dominates the market. Mr Bigot pointed to the US decision in September to allow the export of the first US-built Intelsat satellite to China for launch in 1995. This followed the US sale of F-16 fighter aircraft to Taiwan, to which China had objected. Washington controls where US-made satellites are launched through the granting of export licences. Mr Bigot said Washington was using Comsat, the US official body with a 23 per cent stake in Intelsat, to press its case. Intelsat denied, however, that Comsat exerted undue pressure. 'As an international organisation we have an obligation to consider international bids,' it said. Nevertheless, Comsat's legal staff acknowledged that the US State Department 'regularly takes a note of Comsat's position to ensure it is not inconsistent with the US government's position.' Further international launch contracts, worth up to Dollars 200m, are at stake over the next few weeks as the governing board of Intelsat meets in December and the board of Inmarsat, a parallel body that operates satellites for mobile telecommunications, meets later this week. China and Russia are challenging the established launch companies in the US as well as Europe's Arianespace, despite their absence of a track record in the commercial satellite business. For Russia, an Intelsat contract would mean its entry into the lucrative western commercial space market. The row, which has been brewing for months, centres on the price of a launch. China and Russia charge about Dollars 30m, compared with Dollars 60m-Dollars 100m for Arianespace or the US companies McDonnell-Douglas and General Dynamics.</p>

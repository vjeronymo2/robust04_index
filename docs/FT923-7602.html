			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / International Company News: Vital Forsikring declines 19% VITAL FORSIKRING, reported a 19 per cent fall in first-half pre-tax profit, before extraordinary items. The company saw the figure decline to NKr555m (Dollars 96m) from NKr689m a year earlier due to a fall in financial income as a result of the weak stock market. Group financial income also fell, to NKr1.47bn from NKr1.67bn, and Vital took a charge of NKr157m for an unrealised loss on securities. Premium income, however, rose to NKr1.43bn from NKr1.24bn while operating expenses were cut to NKr275m from NKr282m. Vital said premium income jumped 16 per cent, with income from the sale of life insurances and pensions with single premiums increasing by 18 per cent and sales of insurance with annual premiums rose 15 per cent. The company added that despite a drop in financial income the yield on total assets increased to 9 per cent. Actual and estimated losses on loans at the half-year mark were just NKr9m, but no comparative figure was given. Since the turn of the year reserves covering investment assets were reduced to NKr39m from NKr111m, Vital said. Vital said that since the end of June, the reduction in asset values had continued because of the weak performance of the stock markets at home and abroad.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 1992 Preview: A fight destined to be as bitter as it is close - Neither of the main parties will stand on its record The immediate policy choices facing the voters on April 9 look narrower than at any general election since the early 1970s; and yet the consequences of their decision will be as important as any in post-war history. The outcome of this election will offer history's first judgment on Thatcherism: on whether it lives up to its claim of a revolution; or whether it was a noisy but brief interlude in the comfortable politics of consensus. A fourth victory for the Conservatives would hold out the prospect of one-party government - now established as the norm in Japan and Italy. In the process it would provide the catalyst for the realignment of opposition politics which the 1980s so often promised but never delivered. Whatever the result, there will be pressures on the new government for constitutional change - including the introduction of self-rule for Scotland and proportional representation - which could redraw decisively the political map of the United Kingdom. It is an election that challenges precedent. If Mr John Major is returned to Downing Street, he will have defied the shifts in national mood which have ensured that no party since Lord Liverpool's administrations during the Napoleonic Wars has secured four successive terms. For Mr Neil Kinnock to be certain of victory, Labour needs to secure a swing in votes (of 8 per cent or more) not seen since the defeat of Sir Winston Churchill in the aftermath of the Second World War. If Mr Kinnock does not secure the 5 per cent needed to deprive Mr Major of his parliamentary majority, then his party will have little choice but to embrace electoral reform. Sandwiched between them are the Liberal Democrats. Led by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the awkward yet confident offspring of the old Liberal-SDP Alliance is struggling to salvage third-party politics from the wreckage of the 1980s. Nobody talks any longer of breaking the mould. Yet Mr Ashdown's hopes of securing a real influence on government are as strong as those of any third party leader this century. The opinion polls have given credibility at last to the Liberal dream of a hung parliament. For the past year Labour and the Conservatives have seen their support stuck at just below 40 per cent with the Liberal Democrats hovering between 15 and 20 per cent. The private assessment of their respective strategists is that this will be the first election since 1974 which will be decided in the final few weeks or days of campaigning. The fight will be as bitter as it is close. The Conservatives have become too accustomed to power and Labour too desperate to win it for either to prefer the moral high ground to the mud of negative campaigning. Mr Kinnock's tax and spending plans will be at the heart of the Conservative onslaught. Mr Major, for his part, will be blamed for the recession and charged with plans to privatise the welfare state. Presidential-style campaigns will encourage the personal invective. This is Mr Kinnock's last chance. It might also prove to be Mr Major's, if he were to lose badly. The Conservatives are convinced that they have a decisive edge. Mr Major is young, popular and judged to be in touch with the mood of the country. Only a tiny proportion of voters blame him for the present economic mess. A large majority tell the opinion pollsters that they prefer him to Mr Kinnock. The Labour leader is not dismayed. His efforts since 1983 to rebuild his party have left him one of the toughest politicians of his generation. He is an experienced campaigner. Mr Major is much-liked but he can be brittle. He has never faced the pressure which will confront him in the next few weeks. Personalities will be as important as policies. There is a new equilibrium: Labour has retreated from socialism, and the Conservatives from Thatcherism. The battle is no longer to shift the centre of gravity but to occupy it. Mr Kinnock promises to manage a capitalist economy more effectively than the Conservatives. Mr Major pledges that only he can modernise the most important creation of socialism - the welfare state. Both accept that the constraints imposed by the exchange rate mechanism and by the march towards European integration will restrict their freedom to operate the main levers of economic management. Neither party will fight on its record. There is much in the Conservative record since 1979 - the replacement of statist with market economics, the taming of the trade unions - that has become so much the conventional wisdom that even Mr Kinnock is pledged to preserve it. There is much embarrassment, also. Who dares mention the 'economic miracle' proclaimed just four years ago when the voters have since been battered by recession. How much credit can Mr Major claim for sinking the poll tax, the flagship of his then triumphant predecessor in the 1987 election? He will ask not for a fourth term for his party but for a first term for its youthful prime minister. Mr Kinnock too will prefer a vision of the future to reminders of Labour's past. Nobody can doubt his achievement in bullying and cajoling his party into dumping the ideological baggage which weighed it down in 1983 and 1987. But the longest recession since the 1930s has not been enough to give the opposition a decisive lead - an awkward reminder that the voters are not persuaded that its conversion is permanent. The retreat from political extremism to the more reassuring worlds of Mr Kinnock's market socialism and Mr Major's social market will not rob the voters of a choice. The sound and fury on the hustings - Labour would put 10p on the basic rate of income tax, the Tories would privatise the health service - will obscure less dramatic, but real, differences. The emphasis in Mr Major's agenda on personal ownership and choice, on individual opportunity and responsibility, encapsulates the aspirations if not the revolutionary zeal of Thatcherism. Public health and education will not be privatised but these great monoliths of the welfare state will be broken up. The tax cuts, privatisation and personal ownership at the heart of the Conservative manifesto will underscore that its economic instincts still owe more to Atlanticism than to European Christian Democracy. Labour has different ambitions. The most prosaic but by far the most important is to demonstrate that, after 13 years in the political wilderness, it is competent to govern. This craving for respectability is underlined by a commitment to sustain an exchange rate in the ERM which the party would never itself have chosen. It finds echoes in the constant reassurance that its tax and spending policies threaten only the most modest redistribution of wealth. But Labour has not been converted to US-style market economics. Instead it sees the deregulation and liberalisation pursued by the Anglo-Saxon economies during the 1980s as the cause of their current ills. Mr Kinnock has declared himself for capitalism - but for comfortable European, not abrasively American, capitalism. There are other fault lines. The opposition has a constitutional agenda  - starting with a devolved assembly for Scotland and ending with the replacement of the House of Lords - which could yet provide the impetus for more radical change than its authors intended. In the interim it would offer the basis for an informal deal with the Liberal Democrats if neither of the main parties secures an overall majority. But such concepts have yet to stir the voters in the general election battlegrounds of the north-west and Midlands, London and the south-east. Robbed of the certainties of Thatcherism and of the opportunity to punish the 'loony left', they are concerned with the recession, their prospective income tax bills, local hospitals and schools. Mr Major starts with the advantage of a large majority at Westminster and of an electoral landscape the contours of which provide a natural bias in favour of the Conservatives. But he leads a government that has let the economic and political cycles fall hopelessly out of alignment. Mr Kinnock leads a party that has cast off its socialist shackles but has yet to persuade enough of its erstwhile supporters that it again offers a better guarantee of their future prosperity. It may be that, this time, the voters will need more than one election to make their choice.</p>

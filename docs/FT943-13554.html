			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Bonn drops threatened ban on UK beef exports Germany last night decided not to impose a unilateral ban on British beef exports after European Union agriculture ministers agreed tighter restrictions against 'mad cow' disease. A European Commission spokesman said the Germans would totally withdraw their threat of a ban. 'It's peace in our time,' he said The German move followed unanimous agreement by the ministers to limit exports of British beef carcasses to herds that have been free of the disease - bovine spongiform encephalopathy - for six years, instead of the current two years. The tighter limits were recommended by the Commission's veterinary committee. The ministers' decision and German reaction appeared to end a worsening German row over BSE with both Britain and the European Commission, which had threatened legal action against Bonn if it took unilateral steps to stop imports. Last week, the Bundesrat, Germany's upper house, voted in favour of an immediate, six-month import ban on all British beef from cattle more than three years old, or from herds not certified free of BSE for at least four years. However, a German government spokesman in Brussels said last night the lifting of the threatened ban was a matter for the Bonn government and would not require Bundesrat approval. Following the agreement, Mr Horst Seehofer, the German health minister who initiated the proposed ban, has cancelled his scheduled attendance at the second day of the agriculture ministers' meeting in Brussels today. Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, said the breakthrough was a 'victory for common sense'. Although Mr Seehofer has argued there might be a risk to human health from BSE, Mrs Shephard has accused him of acting for electoral rather than scientific reasons. Welcoming the new restrictions and the German decision, she said last night: 'This shows the whole Community including Germany now believes that our beef is safe.' A British official said sales of carcass beef containing bones accounted for the bulk of beef exports. He conceded that the new rules would make life tougher for exporters. But he insisted the restrictions reflected differences in procedures for deboning beef and disposing of waste in Britain and other member states, rather than any criticism of UK controls. The National Farmers' Union said the six-year rule would mean extra problems for farmers because of the need to trace the health history of carcasses for export. British officials say the incidence of BSE is declining, with the number of cases reported in the first six months of the year down by 23 per cent on the same period last year.</p>

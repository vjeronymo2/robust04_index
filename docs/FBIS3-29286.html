			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Labor and Social Welfare Minister Phaithun  Kaeothong has denied a report that he is scheduled to hold talks  on economic and investment issues with Taiwan President Li  Teng-hui, who is on a vacation in Thailand. Asked to comment on  the PRC Government's dissatisfaction with countries who have  welcomed the Taiwan president, Phaithun said that the Chinese  Government should understand this issue well because China  itself recognizes Taiwanese investment. The Cabinet, however,  has allowed talks with the Taiwan president on economic,  cultural, and educational affairs.    [Begin recording] [Phaithun] Yes, we have contacts through  the private sector for labor issues. The government only  extends its cooperation; this has nothing to do with politics.    [Unidentified correspondent] Although there are only talks  on economic issues, it could upset China.    [Phaithun] Mainland China itself recognizes Taiwanese  investment. Taiwan also has investments in Thailand. There  should be no problem discussing economic affairs. [end  recording]</p>

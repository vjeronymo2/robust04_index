			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Ward says he put Pounds 3.2m in Swiss bank for tax bill MR THOMAS WARD, the US lawyer who advised Guinness on its takeover of Distillers, paid Pounds 3.2m into the Swiss bank account of Mr Ernest Saunders, the company's former chief executive, to put money aside for his tax bill, he told the Old Bailey yesterday. He owed the US tax authorities about Pounds 3.2m and wanted to keep this money separate from the rest of the Pounds 5.2m success fee that Mr Saunders had paid him, Mr Ward told the jury. He said in evidence that he wanted to place the money in a Swiss bank because he had always thought them 'the most secure banks in the world'. As a foreigner it would have been difficult for him to open a Swiss account himself. He told Mr Andrew Trollope QC, his counsel, that Mr Saunders had agreed to allow the use of his account to deposit the money. Mr Ward denies a single charge that he stole the Pounds 5.2m from Guinness after its successful bid for Distillers. Later, cross-examined by Mr Victor Temple, prosecuting, Mr Ward agreed that the agreement between him and Mr Saunders over his Pounds 5.2m fee was never put in writing. 'It was simply the way this business (Guinness) was run,' he said. The trial continues today.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUP TO BACK POSSIBLE PAN AM BID FOR NWA  </P> <P> Prudential Bache and the Airlie Group, a fund whose investors include the  wealthy Bass brothers of Ft. Worth, Tex., said Sunday that they would  contribute $400 million in equity to a possible combined bid with Pan Am Corp.  for the parent of Northwest Airlines.  </P> <P> The amount the group expects to borrow if it bids for NWA Inc., Northwest's  parent, wasn't disclosed, although it would almost certainly exceed $2 billion.  </P> <P> Pamela Hanlon, a Pan Am spokeswoman, said Pan Am believes that a $400-million  equity contribution is more than adequate, and that it is "substantially"  greater than the $300-million ownership stake proposed by a competing NWA  bidder, Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis.  </P> <P> Investment analysts have said that Pan Am, heavily burdened with around $1  billion in debt, would have to raise between $300 million and $500 million in  equity to avoid taking on too much additional debt to buy NWA.  </P> <P> Sunday's announcement signaled that billionaires Sid and Lee Bass now support a  possible bid for NWA. A source close to the brothers said they were upset last  Tuesday when Pan Am said it was exploring an NWA bid with the Airlie Group  without first informing the Basses.  </P> <P> Morton H. Meyerson, co-manager of the Airlie Group, said he met Friday with Sid  Bass, who said a possible bid for NWA "looked like a good deal." Meyerson said  the Basses dismissed as "rumor" talk that they had been initially upset.  </P> <P> Meyerson said Airlie is committed to providing a maximum of $200 million in  equity to a possible bid for NWA. The rest of the equity would come from  Prudential Bache, the merchant banking arm of Prudential Life Insurance Co.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5-Year-Old Fund  </P> <P> The Airlie Group is a 5-year-old fund that had primarily concentrated in  high-yield, high-risk "junk bonds." In January, the Airlie Group changed its  focus to concentrate on leveraged acquisitions, Meyerson said.  </P> <P> Meyerson said Airlie's limited partners are the Bass group, a second group of  investors led by Ft. Worth financier Richard Rainwater, and a third group whose  members are Airlie employees. Each group has an equal, one-third stake in  Airlie.  </P> <P> In addition, the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States is a  special limited partner, suppling about 95% of Airlie's financing, he said. By  the end of the year, Meyerson said, Airlie expects to have $1.6 billion  available for investments.  </P> <P> Meyerson acknowledged that Los Angeles financier Alfred Checchi, who is  weighing a competing bid for NWA, is a member of the Bass group of Airlie  investors. But Meyerson described Checchi's investment as small and said his  participation in the fund had no bearing on Airlie's decision to possibly bid  for the airline.  </P></p>

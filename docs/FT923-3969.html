			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: Normandy Poseidon rises 46% NORMANDY Poseidon, the Australian resources group, yesterday reported a 46 per cent rise in net profits to ADollars 33.6m (USDollars 24m) for the year to June 30, up from ADollars 23m a year earlier, AP-DJ reports from Adelaide. However, the company noted that comparisons with the previous year were not meaningful, due to new accounting standards and the merger between Normandy Resources and Poseidon in May 1991. Sales advanced to ADollars 680.9m from ADollars 58.5m. Earnings per share, however, were down 33 per cent at 6.8 cent compared with 10.1 cents and the dividend is being cut by 27 per cent to 5.5 cents a share from 7.5 cents. Normandy Poseidon said that the comparisons with the previous year were distorted by new accounting standards on consolidation and by the fact that the former results included the merged Normandy and Poseidon groups for only two months: 'The group believes that this is an excellent result in a year which saw significant diversification through acquisition and internal reorganisation aimed at providing a sound base for the future.' Normandy Poseidon is controlled by Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny. It controls Poseidon Gold, an Australian goldmining concern, and Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie, which owns half of the Super Pit gold mine in Western Australia. It also controls Mt Leyshon Gold Mines. Normandy Poseidon also has diamond and oil interests.</p>

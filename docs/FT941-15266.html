			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Appetisers Bagatelle in south London must be the most authentic patissier-traiteur in London. It serves wonderful French-style cakes as well as the usual prepared dishes available from similarly grand establishments in Paris and the French provinces. This year Bagatelle has added the traditional northern French galette des rois to its range. The idea resembles the old twelfth cakes which existed in this country in Swift's time (see the Journal to Stella) but which have disappeared. They should be eaten as close as possible to the Feast of Epiphany (January 6) but they are still available. Inside the cake there is a coronet. The person who gets it becomes 'king' of the day. Be careful of your teeth. The galettes start at Pounds 6.70 for four persons and go up to Pounds 29.80 for 16. Bagatelle is also offering the traditional Provencal brioche filled with a rum and orange blossom cream. Bagatelle: 44 Harrington Road, London SW7. Tel: 071-581-1551. Orders 081-453-1340. *** Alastair Little, one of Britian's most admired chefs, will run his own cookery school in Italy for four months this year. Little, who has taught occasionally at La Cacciata, in Orvieto, some 130km north of Rome, takes over the school completely for its 1994 summer season. Holidays at la Cacciata cost Pounds 750 per guest per week. This includes tuition, accommodation, full board and wine. It excludes flights. Ring Sarah Robson (071-243-8042) or write to 15 Dawson Place, London W2 4TH.</p>

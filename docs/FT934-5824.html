			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Travel: Rioja - abundant food and religion / Adam Hopkins recommends one of Spain's most scenic regions for a car-spin next spring Once upon a time, in Spain's Rioja region, a young woman named Oria, wanting none of the male attentions she received, walled herself up - together, heaven help us, with her mother. The intensity of Oria's reaction has made her a specially-loved saint in the locality and one to be reckoned with when it comes to sexual harassment. In fact, if you want a collection of unusual saints along with royal tombs and quirky cathedrals, brilliant scenery and monasteries galore, not to mention an endless supply of wines both red and white, Rioja is well worth considering for a car-borne spin in spring or autumn. Traversed by the Camino de Santiago, or Pilgrim's Way of St James (leading on to Santiago de Compostela in far Galicia), the Rioja naturally has religious monuments in abundance. Being also traversed by the rivers Ebro and Oja - it takes its name from the latter - it has the benefit, as well as wine, of fertile ground and excellent produce. A good Riojan menestra de verdura - potage of vegetables - can knock spots off any Provencal ratatouille. If I seem partial, please lay the blame on neighbouring Castile where you are hard put to find anything to eat except roast lamb and suckling pig. At all events, the much-traversed Rioja is open and civilised in attitude and happens to have some of the best asparagus and red peppers in the business. Up in the north the marginally decrepit town of Haro, with bodegas bearing names such as Muga and L'opez de Heredia, is wine capital of the Rioja Alta, or Upper Rioja, the most-prized zone of this surprisingly small region. You can visit the bodegas if you wish, though personally I have always found one winery much like another. More to my uneducated taste is a non-posh restaurant called Terete, up in the old part of town, which has a medieval tunnel with 250,000 bottles in it and a grand hall with a barrel containing 16,000 litres. Haro also has an agreeable main square, featuring bandstand and cafes, a proper palace and an 18th century town hall with a road running under it. There is, however, an even better class of monument not far off in Najera; and Najera, being on the Pilgrims' Way and a repository of royal tombs, would do very well for the first stop of a tour. You will find it where the river Najerilla has eaten a steep cliff into the cave-pocked, heavily striated, bright red sandstone of a grassy hill. The kings of Navarre made it their capital for a spell, popping the remains of their loved ones into a wide-mouthed cave. The cave was extended outwards by a handsome church which in turn was equipped with a monastery where masses could be said for the departed. This was a very normal Spanish arrangement, considered a good investment both by a grateful church and by crowned heads who looked at their own careers and feared the worst. As is often the way with Spanish pilgrim towns, there is a tight little cluster of ancient streets around one end of the bridge and, with Santa Maria la Real tucked under the cliff, Najera makes a charming stop. Good little restaurant, too, named Los Parrales, upstairs in the Calle Mayor at No 52, with a nice line in white beans and clams - alubias con almejas. But it is really the next place on my itinerary, San Millan de la Cogolla, which fascinates me, and, I think, many others. Leaving behind the wide and open land south of the river Ebro, you climb and climb, through rolling, partly-wooded foothills, into the halcyon country of the Sierra de la Demanda: wide skies, well-wooded mountains and the gentle peak of San Lorenzo rising high above. Here it was, way back in the 6th century, that San Millan took up his abode, between a pinnacle of rock and groves of stunted oak. Author of more miracles than you could fit into a book as fat as the Bible, the saint now lies, straight-nosed and curly-bearded, in green alabaster effigy, in yet another cave-mouth in a hillside. The church built round this cave is extraordinary: two little naves lying against the hillside, separated from each other by horseshoe arches and with stonework in a medley of styles going back to pre-Moorish Visigothic. The place feels intensely ancient and spiritual and is also, beyond doubt, one of the loveliest corners of Spain. This is the Monastery of San Millan de Suso. It was here, in a marginal note on a parchment, that the first written passage of bone fide Spanish was discovered along with the first known fragment of written Basque. This gives the place a pivot-like position in the evolution of language, a genuine thrill for Spanish visitors and ardent linguists. The next saint on this tour is one of Spain's three Santo Domingo's (another of the trio founded the Dominican order). This particular holy man built a causeway, or calzada, for the Santiago pilgrims and lived to a staggeringly old age. He has a whole town named after him - Santo Domingo de la Calzada, naturally enough - and he is patron saint of the Spanish Society of Gerontology, as of the ministry of public works and its highway engineers. All have left decorative plaques on the railings round his tomb in the cathedral. Here, too, you will find a splendid cock and hen, both purest white, cheeping and pecking away in a wooden balcony. It seems there was a German pilgrim who resisted the advances of the innkeeper's daughter - a kind of Santa Oria in reverse. To pay the young man back, she loaded his knapsack with the hotel silver, told the authorities - and had him hanged. When the boy's parents returned from Santiago, weeks and weeks later, so the tale assures us, they found their son still swinging on the gibbet but otherwise alive and well. They rushed to tell the judge, interrupting his chicken dinner. 'If it's true,' he said, 'these birds on my plate will crow.' Which they did, so their successors, generation after generation, live out a comfortable life in the cathedral. It seems to me entirely necessary to visit the cathedral and check its unusually saintly poultry - a short but lovely foothill drive from San Millan. The inn that features in the story is now a state-run parador: a comfortable and, in this case, ancient hotel, just open again after restoration. There is a pleasant dining room, a spectacular arched lounge and even two bedrooms with whirlpool baths. The Rioja region of Spain, about two hours south of San Sebastian/Bilbao along the motorway, is easily reached by anyone driving into Spain via Bordeaux and Biarritz. A quicker method is to fly to Bilbao. Iberia, Spain's national airline, flies direct from Heathrow daily, and from Manchester via Barcelona, from Pounds 162 return (London tel: 071-830-0011). Then pick up a hire car in Bilbao (Iberia has a deal with Avis). Least hassle might be to buy a package using the P &amp; O car-ferry from Portsmouth to Bilbao, with hotels in the Rioja pre-booked: P &amp; O Breakaway to Spain, tel: 081-863-3787. Two nights on ferry (there and back, 28 hours each way) with three nights in Spain cost from Pounds 185 per person.

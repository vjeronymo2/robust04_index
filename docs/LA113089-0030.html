			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORE HOME BUYERS TURN TO CONDOS;  </P> <P> HOUSING: 'STICKER SHOCK' ON NEW-HOME PRICES TURNS ATTENTION OF SHOPPERS BACK TO  CONDOS, THE PRICES OF WHICH ARE STARTING TO RISE.  </P> <P> With fewer home buyers able to afford to pay the high prices of new San Diego  County houses, budget-conscious buyers are increasingly turning their attention  to the condominium market.  </P> <P> According to recent market data, San Diego County condominiums are posting  healthy price rises this year. Year-to-year unit sales are down, but observers  blame that on diminished inventory.  </P> <P> The condo market is benefitting from "sticker shock" experienced by new San  Diego residents after seeing the county's steep housing prices, industry  observers say. Interest shown by the "move-up condominium buyer" is also  contributing to the condo price increase.  </P> <P> "We're beginning to see a new breed of home buyers," said Gerald T. LaFlamme,  managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., a public accounting firm that  closely monitors the real estate market.  </P> <P> "About three years ago, somebody may have bought a condominium for $80,000 to  $100,000 with plans to eventually buy a single-family, detached home," LaFlamme  said. "But, as (the buyer) looks around now, he's finding himself priced out of  the market.  </P> <P> "Nowadays, instead of buying a new home, the buyer is purchasing bigger and  better condominiums," LaFlamme said.  </P> <P> According to a recent survey conducted by Market Profiles, a San Diego-based  research firm that tracks subdivision sales, the average price of attached  housing, including town homes and condominiums, during the three months ended  Sept. 30 was $170,553; up 18% from the $144,562 average price posted during the  same period in 1988.  </P> <P> Although the number of new units sold during the third quarter of 1989 dropped  to 816 from last year's 1,381, the units sold figured as a percentage of  available inventory has steadily increased in recent years, said Russell T.  Valone, president of Market Profiles.  </P> <P> The percentage of available units sold through the third quarter of 1989 was  66%; up from 58% in 1988 and the 47% recorded in 1987.  </P> <P> Valone says family-oriented condominiums, rather than smaller apartment style  units, should fare well in the coming years because it will be a less costly  alternative to pricey, single-family detached homes.  </P> <P> Deborah Krivoshia, a Meyers Group consultant said: "New homes prices are  leveling off, but I don't think they're going to go down. That's why, at  $150,000, condos are still a good deal. You can't buy any kind of home for that  price."  </P> <P> During the three months ended Sept. 30, the median price of a new condominium  was $153,950, up 29% from $118,900 during the same period in 1988.  </P> <P> "The condominium is becoming the only choice for a larger and larger  cross-section of the home-buying public," said LaFlamme of Kenneth Leventhal.  "Condominiums are coming back into vogue again.  </P> <P> "They lost their appeal back in the 1960s," LaFlamme said "It was new product  at the time and single-family homes could still be bought at a reasonable  price. In the 1970s, we had the inflation problem that made compact housing  more of a necessity. If you remember, apartments were rapidly converted into  condominiums. That created a oversupply, and prices came down. (Condominium  prices) have been relatively flat ever since, but now they're starting to  increase again."  </P> <P> Resale prices of condominiums are going up, too, LaFlamme said, though at a  slower rate than those of single-family dwellings.  </P> <P> Comparing July median resale prices of the last three years, LaFlamme said the  prices have increased from $100,600 to $112,500 to $120,000.  </P> <P> LaFlamme added: "Just between June and July of this year, the median resale  price of condominiums went up from $115,000 to $120,000."  </P> <P> Lack of available land and growth control measures should prevent overbuilding  and a drop in condominium prices, observers say.  </P> <P> "It's one of the better condominium markets in the United States," said Sanford  Goodkin, executive director of Pete Marwick Main &amp; Co./Goodkin Real Estate  Consulting Group. "With land prices continuing to inflate, there will be more  condominiums. They have become a legitimate product in the marketplace."  </P></p>

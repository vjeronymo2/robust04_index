			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David] </F>   [Text] There has been yet another mishap in a test  launching of the Arrow missile. A malfunctioning occurred  during the seventh test launching of the Arrow missile. The  project directors believe that the malfunctioning is in the  missile's ground control system and has nothing to do with the  missile itself. Our army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David  is here with more details:    This morning's experiment was supposed to simulate the  interception of a surface-to-surface missile with a chemical  warhead. An Arrow missile, serving as the target, was launched  from a ship far offshore at 1100 [0900 GMT]. During the  countdown leading up to the launching of the intercepting  missile, a malfunctioning occurred, which prevented it from  being fired. A built-in self-destruct system was then used to  destroy the target missile. It is believed that the  malfunctioning occurred in one of the ground control system's  computers and had nothing to do with the missile itself.    Amir Oren, a commentator on military affairs, reported that  sources at the Defense Ministry and Israel Aircraft Industries  claimed that the experiment was unnecessary and was only carried  out as a result of pressure from American experts also working  on the project. Over the next few days, the project directors  will continue to try and locate the problem and repair it. The  next test launching is expected to take place in approximately  six weeks.</p>

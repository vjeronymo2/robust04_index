			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special Correspondent Ching Chi 5427 2765: </F> "Beijing Adopts Draft Labor Act; Workers' Trade Unions Are To Be  Set Up in Foreign-Funded Enterprises"]    [Text] The State Council adopted a draft "Labor Act"  yesterday, the first of its kind in China, in which it is  stipulated that workers' trade unions are to be set up in  foreign-funded enterprises. It is learned that problems  involving the rights and interests of workers and staffers in  foreign-funded enterprises being violated had aroused the  concern of the CPC top echelon.    A report showed that currently the rights, interests and  dignity of workers and staffers in quite a number of  foreign-funded enterprises have been violated and some people  even said that it was "a repetition of miseries characterized by  primitive accumulation at the initial stage of capitalism."    A recent poll in Guangzhou showed that workers and staffers  in foreign-funded enterprises had complaints against their  employers; 30 percent of them said they had been forced to work  overtime and many said that they had experienced body searches.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Poll of Workers and Staffers in Foreign-funded Enterprises                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Grievance                             |Percentage                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Seven-day working week                |61                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Forced to work overtime               |34.7                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Working overtime without compensation |20                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Workplace lacking safety equipment    |28                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Warned about getting the sack         |37.4                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Having experienced body search        |17.6                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Female workers without maternity      |55.3                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source of data: Guangdong Provincial Federation of Workers' Trade Unions     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      This reporter has recently been in contact with some  individual cases of workers and staffers in foreign-funded  enterprises and what they had experienced was quite beyond the  imagination.    The 18-year-old Hua Ming from Hunan told this reporter that  he had managed to escape from Shenzhen. In May 1992, Hua Ming,  who came from a poor family, dreamed of bright prospects in  Shenzhen and eventually took a train heading south and found a  job at an electronics component assembling factory with a  monopoly of Hong Kong investment. It was not long before he  found his dream burst like a soap bubble. He said: "The  factory was like one big prison. We were shut in on the second  and third floors of the three-story building working every day,  with three watch posts inside the house, which was walled by  electric barbed-wire. One even had to get a pass to go to the  rest room. The boss always wanted us to work overtime, without  compensation. I was the most efficient hand in the factory but  got only 100 yuan a month pay. I felt dizzy working 15 hours a  day. However, I was lucky compared with those who had lost  their fingers at punching machines and had been maimed."    He further said: "Once I carelessly bumped into the  supervisor and he kicked me so hard in the small of my back that  I fell several meters away."    The ways the boss penalized workers and staff were  continuously "updated." For example, ordering everyone to go  down on their knees, "horse-vaulting" under the scorching sun,  even shutting workers in the same cage with a dog....    Sometimes the "white-collar" Chinese staff in foreign-funded  enterprises were humiliated. A female graduate from Beijing  University worked as the public relations manager in an  enterprise with monopoly Japanese investment in Hainan and  earned considerably high income but, at one time, the Japanese  boss wanted her to spend the night with a Hong Kong businessman.  She angrily refused and was slapped so hard by the Japanese  boss that she bled.    According to an analysis by a relevant department the causes  for violations of the legitimate rights and interests of workers  and staffers in foreign-funded enterprises are complicated. A  worker at Tianjin service center for foreign investment said:  "We know that problems are becoming increasingly serious; this  situation has something to do with the work in various places.  Today, when some places import foreign investment, they keep  talking about preferential treatment but say very little about  control according to the law. Some leading members do not want  to talk about control lest foreign businessmen be scared away."</p>

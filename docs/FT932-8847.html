			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Arts: Tennstedt's Mahler - Concert Although Klaus Tennstedt has already recorded one successful cycle of the Mahler symphonies, he is gradually recording another live in the concert hall. There are always some conductors (Bernstein, Rattle perhaps, to name two other Mahlerians) who have found that inspiration shines most brightly upon them when they are standing in front of an audience. On Friday the regimented rows of microphones lined up through the orchestra at London's Royal Festival Hall suggested that this performance will be the latest in the new series. Tennstedt and the London Philharmonic have now arrived at the Seventh Symphony. The concert (no filler, just the symphony) was to be repeated the next day, which will have been useful for EMI, as it opened with a small rash of minor bloomers. That is the risk of recording live. But, as the evening progressed, the rewards were also there, yielding an ever increasing dividend. Tennstedt is not a conductor who steps on to the podium and demands instant involvement. He works to a long-term strategy, creating an atmosphere that will last the duration of the symphony, working towards intermediate climaxes, keeping his eye on the final goal. Without wanting to declare one a better Mahlerian than the other, it is fascinating to compare Tennstedt with Bernstein. The latter used to inflect the aching string melodies of the first movement with every hairpin dynamic marking in the score; the music started to sound contorted, as though parading its emotions with exaggerated self-awareness, irony, sarcasm, even a touch of neurosis. Tennstedt lets the music sing simply. It comes from the heart. In a symphony that is generally regarded as Mahler's least successful, he manages to find a lot of genuine importance to say. The three central movements are well written anyway and this performance kept finding passages that suggested deeper emotions than one had hitherto suspected (the dusky, veiled tone of the strings in the second 'Nachtmusik' was particularly affecting). The finale is empty bombast on Mahler's part, but it rose to the occasion here, exciting, exuberant, the London Philharmonic's playing at its most brilliant. It is too early to say whether this performance will replace Tennstedt's earlier recording as a permanent record of his views on the symphony. Judged simply as a concert, it was by some way the most moving and involving Mahler's Seventh I have heard.</p>

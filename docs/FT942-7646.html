			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Mandela pledges to curb state spending and deficit President Nelson Mandela pledged yesterday to curb government spending and reduce South Africa's budget deficit as part of a programme dedicated to redirecting state resources to meet the basic needs of those deprived under apartheid. In his state of the nation address to the new multiracial parliament, Mr Mandela concentrated on economic policy, promising to maintain financial discipline and to reduce the deficit without any increase in general taxation this year. It was Mr Mandela's first formal statement of economic policy since becoming president on May 10, and was widely welcomed by businessmen and economists for emphasising fiscal conservatism. Mr Mandela outlined a cautious plan for his government's first budget, due to be presented to parliament on June 22. He called for government spending of R2.5bn (Pounds 450m) on the so-called Reconstruction and Development Programme, and said these funds would come from rationalising and redirecting government spending, which is forecast at R125bn for 1994-95. Government ministers said spending by all government departments would be cut by as much as 4-5 per cent, with military spending to face the largest cut. The proceeds would be used for investment in housing and other social services, including a plan to improve children's health services during Mr Mandela's first 100 days in office. In addition, electricity is to be provided to about 350,000 more houses during the next year. This spending will be separate from the estimates contained in the central government budget. Further productivity improvements in government, as well as redirected spending, would be required to free more funds for the reconstruction programme. The estimated total government commitment is about R37bn over five years, with further funds to come from the private sector and foreign sources. Throughout the programme, the government hopes, general government expenditure would be held constant in real terms and the budget deficit would continue to decline from last year's 6.8 per cent of gross domestic product. General tax rates would not rise this year, but might increase temporarily to help reduce the deficit in later years, government officials said. But Mr Mandela insisted that 'a permanently higher general level of taxation is to be avoided'. He avoided quantifying promises to build new houses and provide other basic services, though he said a campaign would be launched 'to rebuild our townships, restore services in rural and urban areas while addressing the issue of job creation and training, especially for our unemployed youth'. No reference was made to the issue of land reform. Mandela pleases business, Page 4 World stocks, Page 41</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government's policy is aimed at ruining the  agro-industrial complex (AIC), it fails to meet the requirements  of the country's food security and makes Russia dependent on  industrialized countries in the future, the agrarian policies  committee of the Council of the Federation has said in a  "Political Statement" sent to the mass media.    Agrarian members of parliament described the situation in  the  AIC as catastrophic and requiring urgent economic measures. For  instance, farm produce this year will decline 45-50 percent  against the average level of 1986-1990. Gross grain production  is estimated at no more than 80 million tonnes (as compared with  99 million in 1993 and 106.8 million in 1992). In livestock  farming the number of cows is down to the level of 1970, and  sheep, at the 1952 level.    The statement dwells at length on the falling production in  farm machine turn-out, the curtailed social programs in rural  areas and other negative effects of reforms in the AIC.    The committee demands budgetary allocations for the agrarian  sector in 1994 in keeping with the government's resolution of  February 23, 1994 as well as protectionist measures.    A member of the committee's technical staff told Interfax on  the condition of anonymity that none of the committee's leaders  had been invited to the meetings of agrarians with President  Yeltsin on June 27.</p>

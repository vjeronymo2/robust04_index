			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> GALANTER OFFERS PLAN TO SAVE SAND DUNES  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter proposed Friday that 200 acres of  ecologically sensitive sand dunes at the west end of Los Angeles International  Airport's runways be turned into a nature preserve.  </P> <P> Flanked by a handful of supporters at the site and fighting to be heard as  jumbo jets screamed overhead, Galanter said the airport should abandon its  long-stalled plan to convert about 200 acres of the 302-acre dunes into a golf  course.  </P> <P> Rather, Galanter said, the airport should use only 100 acres of the dunes, best  known as a habitat for the endangered El Segundo Blue butterfly, for the golf  course. The airport could complete the course by using another 50 acres it owns  next to the dunes on the north side of LAX, she said.  </P> <P> "We can have the butterfly and we can have the golfers," Galanter said.  </P> <P> Galanter's proposal has not been formally presented to other council members or  to the city Airport Commission. Clifton Moore, general manager of the Airport  Department, said he and Galanter have discussed her proposal in general terms  but not in detail.  </P> <P> "We have indicated we will keep an open mind and talk about it," Moore said.  </P> <P> Galanter's plan to use 50 acres on the airport's north side for a golf course  clashes with the airport's plan to use the land as part of a large office and  research park development. The parcel is part of 350 acres once dotted with  homes that were acquired by the airport because of severe jet noise.  </P> <P> Donald Miller, the airport's deputy executive director, said work has already  began on a four-lane highway for the office park project, which is to extend  from Sepulveda Eastway to Pershing Drive. The airport recently received final  approval from the city for the development to proceed, he said.  </P> <P> Galanter contends that most of the land for the office project will be paved  for parking lots. By redesigning the project and building underground parking  structures, she said, 50 acres could be found for the golf course.  </P> <P> The dunes that Galanter wants to protect are the last large section of a dune  system that once stretched from Point Conception, above Santa Barbara, south to  Mexico.  </P> <P> The airport began work to establish a habitat for the El Segundo Blue butterfly  on the dunes in the late 1970s, shortly after the insect was classified as  endangered by the federal government. About five years ago, the airport  proposed using 200 acres of the dunes for a golf course and turning the rest  into a nature preserve.  </P> <P> That plan was stalled in 1987 when the California Coastal Commission refused to  give the airport permission to move ahead because it was unclear what effect  the golf course would have on the butterfly.  </P> <P> Airport officials hired scientist Rudy Mattoni to do a biological study of the  dunes to determine the golf course's effect. Mattoni's study identified at  least nine insects, including the El Segundo Blue butterfly, and a flower that  apparently live only on the dunes and could be classified as endangered.  </P> <P> Mattoni, who supports Galanter's plan, said the butterfly is now flourishing on  the dunes. If 200 acres of the dunes are preserved, he said, the entire dune  ecosystem would have a better chance of surviving.  </P> <P> "We're trying to preserve the whole ecosystem, this whole community of  interactions," Mattoni said. "I'm not worried about the butterfly; I am worried  about everything else."  </P> <P> Mattoni's study found that native plant and animal life on the dunes has been  seriously affected over the years by development and soil contamination, which  in turn have allowed non-native species to invade the area.  </P> <P> Of the 20 original mammals believed to have lived on the dunes, only three  remain, Mattoni said. Of the 91 original plant species, only 58 remain and 19  are in danger of being eliminated.  </P></p>

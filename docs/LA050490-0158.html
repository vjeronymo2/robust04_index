			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES;  </P> <P> ADDED UC ENTRY COURSES VOTED  </P> <P> The University of California faculty senate voted to add a year of laboratory  science and a new history course as part of the requirements for freshman  admission to the university. The recommendations would require a second year of  a lab science, such as biology or chemistry, with the stipulation that the  second-year course be in a different discipline than the first.  </P> <P> Students would also have to take a course in world history, cultures and  geography in addition to a U.S. history course. If the UC Board of Regents  approve the changes, they would take effect for high school seniors graduating  in the spring of 1994. Currently, high school seniors must complete four years  of English, three years of math, two years of a foreign language, one year of  history and one of a lab science to be eligible for entrance to a UC campus.  </P></p>

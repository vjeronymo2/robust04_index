			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Deputy Defense Minister Colonel General  Georgiy Kondratyev believes that the situation in the zone of  the Georgian- Abkhazian conflict is explosive. "Although  large-scale combat operations are hardly possible, armed clashes  between various groupings may destabilize the situation," he  told Interfax on Monday.    Kondratyev favors the earliest possible despatch of  peacekeeping forces to this zone. He said, however, that the  final decision is to be taken by the Russian president, who  chairs the Council of the CIS Heads of State.    To quote Kondratyev, a peacekeeping operation might  facilitate the return of refugees and a comprehensive settlement  of the conflict. He also announced that the Russian  peacekeeping contingent was ready to begin the operation three  to five days after the decision was taken.    A total of 1,500 Russian peacekeepers, consisting of two  divisions based in the Leningrad and Volga military districts,  are expected to be sent to the conflict zone. Subsequently,  peacekeepers from other CIS countries are to join the operation.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / High Court move delays treaty: Rees-Mogg wins right to challenge way government handled Maastricht bill THE GOVERNMENT conceded yesterday that the UK's ratification of the Maastricht treaty will have to await the outcome of a legal challenge on behalf of the anti-Maastricht campaign. Its decision came as the opposing camps at Westminster stepped up their preparations for Thursday's critical Commons debate on the social chapter. It means ratification will be delayed until the autumn. As Tory Eurosceptics met to lay their plans, they expressed confidence that they would defeat the government and put a further obstacle in the way of ratification. But in an atmosphere of intrigue and bluff, the possibility of a government deal with the nine MPs of the Ulster Unionist party was raised as it was announced that Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, would meet unionist MPs on Thursday afternoon. With all sides agreeing that the votes of the minor parties are likely to determine the result of the debate, there was a further glimmer of light for the government with a split emerging among the Liberal Democrats over voting tactics. Although Mr John Major has said he does not regard it as a confidence issue, a defeat would undermine his battered authority. Yesterday, even loyalists who said they believed the government would win admitted that, on paper, they did not see how a defeat could be avoided. If all the opposition parties vote together and are joined by 10 Tory MPs, the government's 18-strong overall majority would be overturned. The Eurosceptics were encouraged by the decision of two High Court judges to allow Lord Rees-Mogg, a leading critic of the prime minister, to apply for a judicial review of the government's planned ratification of the treaty. At the review, which begins next Monday, Lord Rees-Mogg will seek a court order preventing ratification of the treaty in its present form because, he claims, the government's approach is legally and constitutionally flawed. The government made no attempt to block Lord Rees-Mogg's move yesterday, saying it did not want the application obstructed. Lawyers for Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, went on to say the government had no intention of ratifying the treaty before the conclusion of the court proceedings. Downing Street emphasised that the government would oppose the substance of the challenge. Applying for the review, lawyers for Lord Rees-Mogg argued the government was using the royal prerogative to bypass parliament in a way not attempted since Stuart times. Modern legal authorities had demonstrated that the government's attitude was legally unsustainable. Lord Rees-Mogg's legal challenge will be based on three main grounds - the transfer of the foreign policy prerogative to Brussels, the increase in the powers of the European Parliament and the exclusion of the social protocol. The judicial review is expected to be completed within the week when the courts rise for the summer. This would leave time for any appeal by the government to be heard during August. At Westminster, there was confusion about how the Commons debate would be affected by the matter's becoming sub judice as a result of the legal challenge. Government tactics seemed to be aimed at forming different coalitions on the two separate votes at the end of the debate. There was a suggestion that if the Labour amendment - that the government should not ratify the treaty until it has committed itself to the social chapter - were passed, ministers might not vote against the amended motion. This was apparently intended to win support for the government on the first vote among those Eurosceptics who want to stall ratification by ensuring that MPs reject the final motion so that the technical requirement for a parliamentary resolution is not met. If the Labour amendment is defeated, the Liberal Democrats may vote with the government in order to allow ratification to proceed.

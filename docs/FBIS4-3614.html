			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Fan Chun (5400 0689) ] </F>   [Text] Forces From Various Quarters Vie With Each  Other To "Step Forward"    At the Second Session of the Eighth National People's  Congress [NPC], the proposal put forward by Cheng Yiu-tong (an  NPC deputy from the Hong Kong region) suggesting that Hong  Kong's constitutional structure should not straddle 1997 was  bearing down menacingly, as if to hand down a "death penalty" on  the Hong Kong Government. But his motion did not make it onto  the agenda of the session. The "abortion" of this proposal for  "denouncing Britain" greatly disappointed the forces from  various quarters who were eager to seize power.    One would seem to be blaming the pro-China people wrongly if  one thinks they have misjudged the situation and vied with each  other to "step forward." There is one "encouraging" factor in  all this, that is, the People's Liberation Army [PLA] has also  put forward proposals for "denouncing Britain." Because the  proposals were very sensitive, after the high-level CPC  personalities did some "persuasive work," they were quietly  withdrawn.  <H5>  Commanders of Three Military Regions Submit Proposals for </H5> "Denouncing Britain" Signed by 88 People    It is learned that the undisclosed proposals were handed in  to the general meeting on 12 March, after they had been signed  by 88 members of the PLA delegation. The three initiators of  the proposal are powerful people. They are: Lieutenant General  Li Zhu, commander of Beijing Military Region; Lieutenant General  Gu Hui, commander of Nanjing Military Region; and Li Xilin,  commander of Guangzhou Military Region. They submitted two  proposals, the thrust of which was to condemn Britain for  confronting China and causing disturbances in Hong Kong, and  they demanded the termination of its colonial rule in Hong Kong.    According to some personalities who read the proposals, this  was tantamount to the military openly expressing their opinion  on the Hong Kong issue. Judged by the wording of the proposals,  they are very unhappy with the current policy toward Hong Kong,  thinking that it is weak and even smacks of capitulation.  <H5>  The Military Decided for Themselves and Demanded the </H5> Remaking of Hong Kong Policy    This is a very subtle mentality. One wonders if it is  because Deng Xiaoping's repeated emphasis on "reflecting  sovereignty through the stationing of armed forces" has  imperceptibly upgraded the status of the gun barrel. As things  stand now, the military is showing a tendency toward making  decisions for themselves on the issue of Hong Kong.    The proposals signed by 88 military personalities contain  the  following five major points:    1. To sternly condemn the British authorities for openly  violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration and brazenly  tearing up the agreements between the governments of the two  countries.    2. To lodge a serious protest about the British authorities  blatantly putting forward the constitutional reform package that  interferes in China's internal affairs and attempts to extend  their colonial rule.    3. To issue a stern warning to the British authorities that  they should not try to turn Hong Kong, which is China's  territory, into a zone of international political dispute and a  base for opposing China and the communist party.    4. Asking the government to take firm and resolute measures  in the event of changed circumstances, especially when Hong Kong  is plunged into a trauma, and recover Hong Kong to end Britain's  colonial rule ahead of time.    5. Asking the government to give serious thought to  terminating high-level contact and withdrawing the Chinese  ambassador to Britain in view of Britain's change of position on  China and deliberate deterioration in bilateral relations.    A battery of such terms as "solemnly" and "request" sound as  if the military is above the CPC Central Committee. A point of  breakthrough seems to have been made in "letting the gun command  the party."  <H5>  Jiang Zemin Personally Persuades Military Deputies </H5>   This situation immediately attracted the attention of the  CPC  high-level leadership. CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin took  the matter up himself and visited the military deputation two  times to persuade them. Jiang Zemin said: The Central  Committee is following the principle of striking only after the  enemy has struck on the issue of Hong Kong, because the  initiative and timetable are both in our hands. As things stand  now, we can recover Hong Kong ahead of schedule according to  reason. Our stand has not changed, and it will not change.  Political cooperation between China and Britain is entirely  nonexistent. But we should watch how things develop so that we  can better handle the affair with justice on our side, to the  benefit of ourselves, and with restraint.    The current CPC policy toward Hong Kong seems to be pleasing  neither the people at home nor abroad. It cannot explain to its  people what is meant by "striking after the enemy has struck,"  yet it cannot cut off all cooperation with the British Hong Kong  Government. This very policy of "being strong in appearance but  weak inside" has met with criticism at home and caused  "ideological confusion" among the loyal "patriots" in Hong Kong  in particular.    In order to reassure people, some political figures, such  as Qian Qichen, Wang Hanbin, and Lu Ping, had "heart-to-heart"  talks with some NPC deputies and vice chairmen of the national  committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC] from Hong Kong and Macao during the recent  NPC and CPPCC sessions. They explained what the central  authorities have been doing to fulfill its "obligation" to the  people.  <H5>  Qian Qichen Claims China Is Strong Enough To Deal With </H5> Britain    Qian Qichen said: The Sino-British relations are now at rock  bottom and facing noncooperation or even confrontation. This is  a natural result of Britain changing its policy toward China and  confronting us on the issue of Hong Kong. This situation is not  something we wanted to see, because Hong Kong is, after all,  China's territory and the 5 million odd Hong Kong compatriots  are part of the big family of China. But Britain wants  confrontation, wants to extend its colonial rule beyond 1997,  and wants to turn Hong Kong from an international financial,  industrial, and commercial center into a city of international  political dispute. How can we let Britain's plot succeed! We  must be responsible to history, to the 1.2 billion Chinese  people, and to our 5 million odd compatriots in Hong Kong.  Also, we must be responsible to foreign businessmen who have  properties and investments in Hong Kong. Therefore, we will not  yield even a single inch or compromise even once to colonialism  on matters of sovereignty and principle. We have the confidence  and strength to deal with and defeat Britain's old political  tricks.  <H5>  Deng Xiaoping Recently Instructs: Check the Dynamic From a </H5> Point of Stillness, Overcome Disturbance With Substantial  Strength    Qian Qichen also emphasized: After putting up such  confrontations, Britain lost what it had been capitalizing on.  Now the initiative is entirely in our hands and so is the  timetable. A high degree of consensus among the party, the  government, the military, and the people nationwide is the basis  on which we make our decisions.    Qian Qichen also revealed the central authorities' latest  strategy for dealing with Britain, that is, to check the dynamic  from a point of stillness and overcome disturbance with  substantial strength. It is said that this was proposed by Deng  Xiaoping when he recently spoke to the central leading comrades.    Lu Ping put forward the policy of "uniting with all those  who  love China and Hong Kong." He said: "With the exception of the  core members of the pro-Britain, anti-China ultra-right  organizations that attach themselves to foreign forces, we  should unite with all Hong Kong compatriots and expatriates in  Hong Kong who are willing to work for the smooth transition of  Hong Kong and who are willing to stay in Hong Kong and help  build a new Hong Kong under the principle of one country, two  systems, the Basic Law, and the leadership of the future Special  Administrative Region [SAR] Government. This is our policy."  <H5>  Wang Hanbin on "Preparing for Both Eventualities" </H5>   Wang Hanbin was more specific when he talked about the  current preparatory work. He said: Now Sino-British relations  are in an abnormal state. It is impossible for China to take  the initiative to try relaxing and mending relations, because  the basis for doing so is not there. The Sino-British Joint  Declaration has been sabotaged by the British side, so its role  has been almost entirely taken away. We no longer have the  basis for Sino-British cooperation at this stage and such basis  will not be ready for some time. The Chinese side does not  place any unrealistic hope in the situation. The current work  is mainly to prepare for the following two things:    1. The Preliminary Working Committee's work should be  realistic and should be strengthened, increased, and  accelerated. The preparations for setting up the SAR should be  carried out and arranged earlier than scheduled.    2. The work of the relevant departments in the central  government has been more or less assigned and various  preparations made. Once Hong Kong is plunged into a political  trauma, the society lands in protracted turbulence, and foreign  countries meddle in Hong Kong affairs and try to change Hong  Kong's status, we will not have a second choice.    Wang Hanbin said: The initiative is entirely in our hands.  No violation of the integrity of national sovereignty and the  sacredness of our internal affairs is allowed, as they override  everything else at all times.  <H5>  Ye Xuanping: China and Britain Will Not Have the Conditions </H5> and Climate for Cooperation    CPPCC Vice Chairman Ye Xuanping disclosed a piece of  information to the NPC deputies from Guangdong Province: The  central authorities have made it clear that they will do  everything to ensure the stability and development of Hong Kong.  Naturally, they have various preparatory measures, including  full political, economic, and military considerations. They  will not let Britain control the destiny of Hong Kong beyond 30  June 1997. You and I can see that day when it comes. If things  change, it will not be in three years and a few months. China  and Britain will not possibly have the conditions and climate  for cooperation.    That "restoring cordial relations with the British side is  impossible" seems to have become a "common understanding" shared  by personalities at all levels in the CPC. But opinions on how  to deal with the "British colonialism's plot in Hong Kong"  differ. What merits attention is that the CPC's Hong Kong  policy has been constantly challenged, which is bound to cause  the already "left"- leaning policy to get out of control.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Dorling Kindersley jumps 29% - Adult list leads all-round advance with 31% rise in turnover DORLING Kindersley Holdings, the publisher, reported full year pre-tax profits ahead 29 per cent in its first set of annual results since its flotation last October. In the 12 months to June 30 profits were Pounds 9.65m (Pounds 7.5m) on turnover up 23 per cent to Pounds 87.4m (Pounds 70.9m). Fully diluted earnings per share were 9.9p (9.4p). A final dividend of 2.2p is proposed making a total of 3.3p, against a notional 3p. The profit was struck after a non-recurring Pounds 208,000 charge for flotation costs and reflected the strong performance of most of the businesses. Operating profits improved 17 per cent to Pounds 9.08m (Pounds 7.77m). Mr Peter Kindersley, chairman and chief executive, said: 'It is pleasing to report a sixth successive year of substantial profit growth. DK Adult's success in increasing turnover by almost 31 per cent to Pounds 50.5m and DK Children's resilient second half performance are especially creditable.' Overall, the group printed about 30m books during the year, an 18 per cent increase. Among the adult books, particularly successful titles included the two Royal Horticultural Society gardening books while, from the children's list, Stephen Biesty's Incredible Cross-Sections sold 650,000 copies. Backlist turnover increased by 46 per cent to Pounds 31.4m, equivalent to 36 per cent of total turnover, up from 30 per cent in 1992. US turnover from publishing under the DK imprint, which began two years ago, grew to Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 5.2m). After concerns at the interim stage about trading conditions in the DK Children's division, it had a resilient second half, but this was not quite enough to claw back the first half shortfall and turnover slipped to Pounds 26.6m (Pounds 27.8m) reflecting difficult trading conditions in its main markets. New businesses, including DK Multimedia, boosted turnover from Pounds 400,000 to Pounds 4.4m. COMMENT Dorling Kindersley's results were in line with market expectations and underline the depth and quality of the group's established operations, together with the potential of its new businesses. The group continues to attract a premium based on its promising CD-Rom multimedia business, but its core business also has considerable strength as the growing revenues from the backlist demonstrate. This year the group should produce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 11.5m and earnings per share of 10.8p. Based on yesterday's closing share price of 292p, up 3p, the stock is trading on a lofty prospective p/e of 27, reflecting its glamour-stock status.</p>

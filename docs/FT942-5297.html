			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Aircraft raid on Aden refinery Northern Yemeni aircraft attacked Aden's oil refinery a second time last night, setting a number of storage tanks on fire, Aden Radio said, Reuter reports from Aden. The radio was quoting a source at southern Yemen's Ministry of Oil and Mineral Resources. Before the broadcast an Aden resident told foreign correspondents in a hotel in the city that an air attack had severely damaged refinery facilities and people had been killed. It was not possible to confirm the report. The plant is the only refinery in breakaway southern Yemen and has been producing around 90,000 barrels a day. One of its crude oil storage tanks was set ablaze earlier yesterday by what southern officials said was a northern air raid. During the day rival forces exchanged rocket and tank fire around the city before the expected arrival in Yemen of a UN envoy.</p>

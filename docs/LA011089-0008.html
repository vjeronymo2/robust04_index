			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FIREMAN IN STABLE CONDITION AFTER HIGHWAY SHOOTING  </P> <P> A Los Angeles County firefighter shot in the face over the weekend while  driving near Palomar Mountain was in stable condition Monday at Kaiser  Permanente Hospital in San Diego as sheriff's deputies continued to look for  suspects, authorities said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies investigating what they described as an attempted murder  said Clayton Richard Howe, 31, was shot in the face while off duty at about  1:50 p.m. Sunday in Valley Center, near where South Grade Road meets California  76.  </P> <P> Howe and a companion were on their way to Palomar Mountain when they were  tailgated by an unknown number of people in a white Suzuki Samurai, sheriff's  deputies said.  </P> <P> "Howe was apparently traveling too slow for the Suzuki driver," said Sgt. Manny  Castillo.  </P> <P> Someone in the Suzuki displayed a shotgun and gestures were made back and forth  between the occupants of both cars, Castillo said. The Suzuki eventually passed  Howe and sped away.  </P> <P> But when Howe reached the top of the grade, he saw the suspects pulled over on  the shoulder of the road. Howe pulled in behind them, displayed his badge and  ordered the suspects to drop their weapons, deputies said.  </P> <P> Then someone in the Suzuki fired a shotgun at Howe as he stood beside his own  car. A passer-by stopped to help Howe as the suspects fled, sheriff's deputies  said.  </P> <P> Howe was taken to Palomar Hospital in Escondido, where he was treated for  facial and eye injuries. Sheriff's deputies said Sunday that Howe was expected  to undergo further eye surgery.  </P> <P> Monterey Park Fire Chief James Page, a resident of Carlsbad, said: "The whole  department is in a state of shock." Page said Howe has been a training officer  at the Monterey Park station for 18 months.  </P> <P> "He's one of the most dedicated fire officers I've ever met," Page said. "At  least two people here have talked to him today, and those reports sounded  fairly optimistic," he said Monday.  </P> <P> Several suspects have been questioned and released. Homicide detectives are  still investigating.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EX-VOCATIONAL SCHOOL OWNER GETS 5-YEAR PRISON TERM IN LOAN FRAUD  </P> <P> The former owner of a San Fernando vocational school was sentenced to five  years in federal prison for fraudulently collecting more than half a million  dollars in student loans, authorities said Friday.  </P> <P> Richard R. Romero, 49, of Rancho Palos Verdes, who was co-owner of the  now-defunct Medical Training Institute, was also ordered to pay $557,500 in  restitution to the U.S. Department of Education for submitting 225 phony  student loan applications between 1982 and 1984, Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen  A. Mansfield said. The other owner was not charged.  </P> <P> In a plea agreement, the federal government dismissed one conspiracy charge and  two other fraud charges against Romero in exchange for his guilty plea to two  felony fraud charges, Mansfield said. In addition to incarceration and  restitution, he was sentenced to three years probation upon release from  prison.  </P> <P> Romero, who ran the San Fernando school and another with the same name in  Bellflower, solicited signatures on blank student loan applications from poor  people standing in welfare lines, on street corners and outside churches,  Mansfield said.  </P> <P> "He would find folks who were down on their luck and get them to sign blank  government loan applications," Mansfield said. "He would give them a song and  dance about how they could work in a medical office. And these were people that  actually needed an education and a job."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Never Attended School  </P> <P> About half of those who signed the documents never attended school, Mansfield  said. Romero fraudulently filled out loan applications in their names and  endorsed and cashed their loan checks, he said.  </P> <P> The school, which was on North Maclay Avenue, was accredited by the Department  of Education to receive federal and state student loan money. But the  Bellflower school was not, said Deputy Federal Public Defender Dennis J.  Landin, Romero's attorney.  </P> <P> Romero fraudulently filled out applications stating that students who were  attending the Bellflower school were enrolled in the accredited San Fernando  school, Landin said.  </P> <P> He said Romero, who was deputy director of student financial aid at Cal State  Fullerton from 1970 to 1973, never personally recruited students in welfare  lines, but hired others to do so.  </P> <P> The money was used to operate the schools and not to personally enrich Romero,  Landis said, adding that "no one ever said he used it to buy Cadillacs and fur  coats."  </P> <P> The Department of Education began investigating Romero and the schools in 1984  after receiving student complaints about poor educational offerings and the  lack of job placement. In the two years that the schools operated, 239 students  attended the San Fernando school and 225 went to the Bellflower school. It is  not known how many actually found jobs as medical assistants.  </P></p>

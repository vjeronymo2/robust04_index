			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCKEY'S RETURN TO TEACHING  </P> <P> Shame on The Times ("A Return to Classroom for Buckey," Metro, March 2) for the  disgusting pictures of the long-suffering Peggy Ann Buckey and woman and child  protesting Buckey's return to teaching. The press has almost succeeded in  totally wrecking this person's life.  </P> <P> The article stated: "The demonstrators said they were outraged that she was  being allowed to teach again, even though all molestation and conspiracy  charges against her and four other McMartin teachers were dropped in 1986."  </P> <P> Is this Russia or the land of the free? It is one thing for a handful of  demonstrators to exhibit their ignorance -- it is quite another for The Times  to publish this outrageous event.  </P> <P> Let's put an end to the bashing of this woman by the press. Let her get on with  her life. She is either guilty or innocent.  </P> <P> One of the demonstrators said: "We're not saying she's guilty. We're not saying  she's innocent We're saying she's suspect." Our courts in the land of the free  have determined she is innocent.  </P> <P> I thought the days of the "lynch mob" mentality were dead.  </P> <P> BYRON DILLON  </P> <P> Downey  </P></p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Bush vows to fight off Buchanan challenge PRESIDENT George Bush took his re-election campaign to the south yesterday in an attempt to restore his flagging electoral fortunes, and promised a no-holds-barred battle against Mr Patrick Buchanan, his rightwing Republican challenger. Mr Buchanan's unexpectedly strong performance in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary is a triumph for the television commentator whose campaign tapped widespread discontent over Mr Bush's handling of the economy. The size of the protest vote against the president embarrassed Mr Bush's supporters and elated Democrats, who believe they have a strong chance of defeating him in November's presidential election. Mr Bush said he had still scored a 'good victory' with 58 per cent of the Republican vote, against Mr Buchanan's 40 per cent. 'I'm not saying I wouldn't have liked to do better, but I'm satisfied with the results, and now we're down here and we're going to take this guy on in every state,' he said on a campaign visit to Tennessee. Although Mr Buchanan is not expected to endanger Mr Bush's chances of winning his party's nomination - especially as several states have refused to allow him on to the primary ballot - he came closer to the incumbent than any challenger since Mr Ronald Reagan startled President Gerald Ford in 1976. Republicans fear that Mr Buchanan could split the party, damaging its chances in November's election. Now that the conservative coalition, which has given the Republicans a near stranglehold on the presidency since 1968, is showing signs of crumbling, Mr Buchanan's long-term target appears to be the soul and perhaps even the body of the Republican party in the years ahead. Mr Bush campaigned for only four days in New Hampshire, but he will step up the pace with several trips to southern states, which will see a series of critical primaries over the next three weeks. This culminates in the Super Tuesday contest on March 10, when 11 states will cast their votes. Mr Bush attempted to minimise the significance of Mr Buchanan's strong showing in New Hampshire, calling it a protest vote from a state that has been severely hurt by recession. The president's advisers said New Hampshire would prove a high water mark for the Buchanan campaign. But Mr Buchanan said his relative success had given him the momentum to take the Republican nomination from Mr Bush. 'If an incumbent president with his resources and his machinery and the White House and the entire establishment cannot do any better than that, I think they should really stand down,' he said. Mr Bush acknowledged the weakness of his performance and promised a tougher campaign. 'All I did was lay back and get hammered by these Democrats and, to some degree, by Pat,' he said. 'I've been in tough fights before and I'm looking forward to this one.' In New Hampshire, he avoided attacking Mr Buchanan or even mentioning his name. Yesterday, he threatened some of the ferocious advertising that he used to destroy Mr Michael Dukakis, his Democratic opponent in 1988. Mr Bush warned: 'I've been very kind and gentle. I'll still be kind, and I'm now debating how gentle to be.' Mr Bush also took aim at his Democrat opponents, noting that Mr Paul Tsongas, who won his party's primary in New Hampshire with 35 per cent, disapproved of the economic programme put forward by Democrat leaders in Congress. Mr Tsongas and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who came a strong second in New Hampshire with 26 per cent of the vote, have emerged as the Democratic frontrunners. Early recovery in the US economy and inflation at its lowest for a generation was predicted yesterday by Mr Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman.

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Names expect report to boost fight SEVERAL thousand Names at Lloyd's of London who were members of syndicates formerly managed by the Gooda Walker agency will learn of the reasons for their multi-million-pound losses in the next few days. Names were told yesterday that a Lloyd's investigation, or 'loss review' report, into the losses of four Gooda Walker syndicates - numbers 164, 290, 298 and 299 - was being printed this week and would be dispatched to them tomorrow. Names are the individuals whose assets support the Lloyd's market. Gooda Walker syndicates' losses totalled Pounds 491m in 1989 alone, Lloyd's latest reported year. The syndicates mainly specialised in spiral reinsurance - reinsuring the catastrophe exposures of other Lloyd's syndicates and insurance companies trading in London. The syndicates were overwhelmed by claims arising from Hurricane Hugo in September 1989, the European storms of January 1990 and other disasters. The loss review report - 1,500 pages in three volumes - was prepared by a committee chaired by Mr Kieron Poynter, a partner with accountancy firm Price Waterhouse. It is understood not to identify regulatory failures but Gooda Walker Names are confident that it will help their campaign to win compensation. Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said last night he was confident the report would 'provide us with the questions that we will have to ask'. He added: 'It's bound to be a good source book even if it doesn't provide us with all the answers we need.' Mr Doll-Steinberg said his group had recently appointed new solicitors Wilde Sapte and a team of technical experts to assist its case. A further loss review report on the syndicates formerly managed by the Feltrim agency is also complete and will be sent to Names next week. That report, prepared by a committee chaired by Sir Patrick Neill QC, is also more than 1,000 pages long.</p>

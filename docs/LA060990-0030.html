			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: JORDAN RANCH;  </P> <P> HEARING ON LAND SWAP POSTPONED  </P> <P> A House subcommittee hearing on a controversial proposal to exchange National  Park Service property in Cheeseboro Canyon for land owned by entertainer Bob  Hope in eastern Ventura County has been rescheduled for July 19. The  subcommittee on the environment, energy and natural resources of the Committee  on Government Operations is holding hearings to determine whether the federal  agencies should approve large land swaps.  </P> <P> Subcommittee Chairman Mike Synar (D-Okla.) has suggested that requiring  congressional approval might provide more public scrutiny and safeguards. The  hearing, originally scheduled for May 3, will be the second to be held by the  subcommittee. National Park Service officials will be asked to explain previous  actions on the proposed land swap and verify the agency's stated neutrality on  the deal, a subcommittee aide said. Under the land-swap proposal, the park  service would exchange 59 acres in Cheeseboro Canyon for 1,100 acres that Hope  owns in adjacent Jordan Ranch. Developers who have an option to buy Jordan  Ranch are seeking the Cheeseboro property for an access road to a proposed golf  course and 750 homes.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Al-Tikriti, Iraq's ambassador to Turkey and a  relative of Saddam Husayn, said that Turkey should cooperate  with Iraq to establish [kurulmasi--no negative as published] a  Kurdish state in the region.    Ambassador al-Tikriti said: "The project of creating a  Kurdish state incorporating Iraq and Turkey is Britain's. The  United States supports this project."    He gave assurances to Turkey, saying: "If the Hammer Force  leaves, we will not allow even a single PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] militant to take shelter in northern Iraq."    Iraqi Ambassador to Ankara al-Tikriti assessed the latest  developments in the region during his visit to our paper's  Ankara bureau.    Indicating that the Turkey-Iraqi oil pipeline will rust  unless the oil is flushed out, al-Tikriti said: "Iraq owes some  $1 billion to Turkey. We told Turkey: Take the oil in the  pipeline to enable us to pay our debt; and moreover, do not give  the remaining money to us in the form of foreign currency, we  want foodstuffs. But, the United Nations will not give  permission to Turkey. Turkey is hurt from the embargo the most.  At present, BOTAS [Turkish Pipeline and Oil Transportation  Company] buys oil from other countries at $19 per barrel. It  also pays $1.50 for the transportation of each barrel. Were the  oil pipeline open, this transportation price would not be paid.  That is why BOTAS is losing $1 billion every year. We want to  act within the framework of UN resolutions, but we are being  obstructed. Because of the embargo, 4,500 children in Iraq die  every week."  <H5>  "Cooperation Is a Must" </H5>   Indicating that the establishment of a Kurdish state in  northern Iraq will considerably undermine the regional stability  and that the real damage will be done to Turkey, al-Tikriti  said: "This is because there are more Kurds in Turkey than in  Iraq. The Kurds' goal is obvious. They want to set up a large  Kurdish state in the region. They have even published maps.  These maps were shown on one of your television programs. The  West does not want stability in our region. Turkey and Iraq are  face to face with a plot. The project of creating a Kurdish  state in the region belongs to the British. The United States  is supporting this project."    Indicating that Turkey and Iraq should cooperate to prevent  the implementation of this project, al-Tikriti said:  "Otherwise, a Kurdish state will be established."  <H5>  Guarantee Given to Turkey </H5>   Noting that prior to the Gulf crisis no such tension and  disorder existed in the region, al-Tikriti said that at the time  Iraq gave importance to Turkey's security. Asking "where was  the PKK before the Gulf crisis?" al-Tikriti said: "The PKK will  vanish if the Hammer Force leaves and the oil pipeline is  opened. At present, the PKK is being protected and sheltered by  the Kurds in northern Iraq. Ask the Hammer Force to leave. Once  the Hammer Force leaves, our government will restore authority  in the region. Not even one single PKK militant will remain in  northern Iraq. PKK is a terror organization. Besides, Turkey's  security is important to us."    Asked what Iraq's position towards the Kurds will be once  the  Hammer Force leaves, al-Tikriti replied: "We gave official  guarantees to Ozal in the past, and later to Demirel. We told  them that we would not oppress the Kurds."</p>

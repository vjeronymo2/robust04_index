			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Australia's star rises again - They used to call it the 'lucky country' before recession struck and unemployment soared. Now, though, recovery seems well under way. Inflation is low, the growth rate is relatively high, the political climate is stable - and prospects for overseas investors appear to be good Never mind Australia's endless beaches and cuddly koalas. With a 5 per cent growth rate, low inflation, and a stable political climate, interest is turning towards Australia as a good investment prospect. So isn't the country equally appealing in stock market terms? And shouldn't private investors, looking to diversify funds overseas, take note ? The answer probably is yes - but only with some big provisos. The first of these relates directly to the economic situation. While the numbers look good at present, there is much debate within Australia about the quality and sustainability of the recovery. This argument centres mainly on whether the nation is headed for a repeat of the boom and bust cycles seen in the past, or whether a decade of economic restructuring - including the continuing reduction in tariff barriers, some deregulation of the labour market, and a major effort to introduce competition into key sectors - has wrought fundamental changes. The optimists - who include Ralph Willis, the Australian treasurer - think it has. Government forecasts say the economy should grow at more than 4 per cent for the next four years; the budget deficit should reduce steadily from ADollars 13.6bn this year to virtually nothing by the late 1990s; and the underlying inflation rate should be pegged at around 2 per cent, at least in the immediate future. According to this scenario, a greater export focus by Australian companies should allow the nation to piggy-back on the growing economies of south-east Asia, while the successful outcome to last December's Gatt talks could boost the farm sector significantly. By the time the provisions of the Uruguay Round are implemented fully, the annual export benefit could be ADollars 1bn-plus. The pessimists paint a very different picture. They note that the economy's strength stems from a strong recovery in consumer demand. Business investment, by contrast, remains weak, and actually dipped last quarter while the household savings ratio is painfully low, too. All this, they say, is potentially destabilising. They feel that if capacity constraints are reached and investment surges all at once, balance of payments problems could emerge. These would be doubly serious because of the domestic savings shortage. The government could then be forced into interest rate increases, tax rises  - or both. Don Mercer, head of the ANZ - one of the country's leading commercial banks  -says: 'My fear is that we are going to blow it again. Achieving a durable economic upturn hinges on a substantial lift in investment, exports, and in national saving.' In the short term, perhaps, this debate need not worry a prospective investor too much. Most analysts forecast strong profits growth in the financial year that ended in June, and again in 1994/95 as restructuring moves taken during the recession augment the upturn in demand. John Baynos, strategist for stockbroker McIntosh Baring, thinks listed companies could achieve an average 13.3 per cent return over the next 12 months; with inflation at such low ebb, this suggests a double-digit real return. Merv Peacock, head of marketable securities at the AMP insurance giant, says he is looking at a 15 per cent annual growth in earnings per share for the next two years. Nevertheless, the possibility of a 'blow-out' scenario down the track does suggest that any investment funds committed to the Australian market should not be left unattended. A second, more technical, point is that the Australian stock market has enjoyed a very strong run already. This began late in 1992 and continued until early this year when the US Federal Reserve increased interest rates. It is true that the Australian All-Ordinaries index has fallen by about 14 per cent since then. But the long period of unbroken progress means that the historic price/earnings ratio on the index has climbed to around 17-18 times. This looks wildly out of line with the 1970s and 1980s when the market p/e rarely exceeded 10-11 times, and was sometimes as little as 6-7. Yet, as statisticians at the Australian Stock Exchange point out, comparisons with the 1960s (a low-inflation era) are much more favourable. Then, the market p/e stood at around 15-16 times earnings. In short, if you want to believe the Australian market offers value, you probably need also to believe that an era of modest price increases is here to stay. For those investors undeterred by such caveats, some fund managers do think the market's post-February weakness presents a good buying opportunity. Offshore investors, moreover, may have the added opportunity of a currency play. Australia remains weighted heavily towards the resources sector and tends to see a close relationship between commodity prices and its currency, with a rise in the former usually boosting the dollar. Although commodity prices have moved off their recent lows - and have surged in recent days - most forecasters see further improvements ahead as more economies pull out of recession. 'I know some investors are playing the Australian market largely because of the foreign exchange factor,' says one fund manager. So, as long as you are persuaded that this adds up to a plausible case, where should you shop? A number of fund managers and analysts say they see more value in the industrial sectors than the resources stocks, simply because the climb so far has been most marked in the latter area. (Many major resource companies, like Western Mining Corporation, saw their share prices double between late 1992 and early 1994). Baynos likes Australia's media sector because of such factors as its exposure to the surging domestic economy and the potential for increased advertising. He also likes the engineering sector and sees some selective value left among resource stocks. Peacock tends to concur on this point. 'Resource stocks run hard when they run, and it would be a brave man who says that they won't run further,' he says. But John Murray, head of equities at Perpetual Funds Management, thinks that 'a fair bit of the resources game is over'. He reckons that some of larger industrial conglomerates have been overlooked in recent months and recommends the likes of BTR Nylex and Pacific Dunlop, both of which are listed in London.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> AUTOMATIC 'DEATH PENALTY' UNLIKELY FOR GATORS' ATHLETICS, NCAA SAYS  </P> <P> An NCAA official said today that it is unlikely that the University of Florida  would face an automatic "death penalty" for Gators' athletic programs because  any investigation of rule violations would have to be completed by January.  </P> <P> "First of all, it's not guaranteed there is a case," David Berst, assistant  executive director for enforcement, said.  </P> <P> "We have to find a major violation and process it before January of 1990," he  said, adding that it's unlikely that the NCAA could close a case in less than  four months.  </P> <P> He refused to say whether the NCAA has even launched an official investigation.  </P> <P> "I don't have any intention of disclosing that," he said, but he acknowledged  that investigators are aware of grand jury testimony from Florida athletes who  said they received money from members of the coaching staff.  </P> <P> Under legislation passed in June, 1985, programs found in violation of NCAA  rules twice during a five-year span automatically qualify for the death penalty  -- a one- or two-year suspension of the program. The Florida football program  was placed on probation in 1984.  </P></p>

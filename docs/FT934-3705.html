			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / World Bank says Zaire in default The World Bank has declared Zaire in default after the central African nation failed to pay Dollars 23.8m (Pounds 16m) in interest and payment due on its outstanding loans, George Graham writes from Washington. Zaire owes Dollars 84m to the World Bank and Dollars 1.24bn to the International Development Association, the Bank's concessional loan affiliate. With President Mobutu Sese Seko clinging to power, Zaire is in political and economic chaos. The World Bank suspended disbursements on loans to Zaire in July.</p>

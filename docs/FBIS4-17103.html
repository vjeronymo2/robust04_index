			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Aleksandr Stepanov in Berlin and Vladimir </F> Peresada in Brussels under the "`New World Order' in Action"  rubric: "Collapse of `Strong-Arm Peacemaking.' Will the United  Nations and NATO Be Able To Draw the Proper Conclusions?"]    [Text] Berlin, 19 April -- The latest bloody impasse into  which the resolution of the Bosnian problem has been driven has  arisen thanks to military interference by NATO. This attests  that, by following the gradual and quite irresponsible decisions  of politicians, it is possible to achieve only a dramatic  escalation of the stand-off.    In point of fact, FRG Foreign Minister K. Kinkel agreed with  this assessment at a meeting with his colleagues from the  European Union member countries. Of course, his judgments were  far more diplomatic, and he still considers military  interference justified -- how could it be otherwise? -- but even  the head of German diplomacy has been forced to acknowledge the  obvious: "This has not produced the desired results." This, in  fact, could easily have been ascertained in advance from Russian  diplomats, for example, who know both the state of affairs on  the spot and the Serbs' national character. But no, instead  they preferred to organize a public airshow.    Now Kinkel is appealing to Russia, asking it to use all its  influence to induce the Serbs to pull back their troops from  Gorazde. Appealing to that very Russia which there was  "insufficient time" to warn of the air strike against the  Bosnian Serbs' positions. The microscopic military effect  turned into a crushing blow against the months-long peacemaking  efforts of Russian diplomacy, which also has to its obvious  credit its highly successful participation in lifting the siege  of Sarajevo.    What has happened in Gorazde demonstrates very graphically  the impotence of the United Nations and NATO and, most  importantly, the total lack of any ideas whatever about how the  Balkan problem should be resolved. Of course, it is far simpler  to down aircraft and shoot up tanks from the air than to display  a consistent will to peacefully achieve the set goal. But where  is this goal? It long ago vanished beneath mounds of  verbiage....    Brussels, 19 April -- Did the NATO raids produce what was  expected -- at least the psychological capitulation of the  "target" in the face of the alliance's show of military might  or, most importantly, hope of a move toward a political  settlement dictated by this might? No, something else happened.  NATO's military interference has led only to a radicalization  of the belligerents' positions, as well as jeopardizing the  contingents of UN forces in Bosnia, whom the embittered Bosnian  Serbs are already calling "participants in the conflict" and  who, accordingly, are increasingly frequently becoming the  object of countermeasures which the West calls "repressive."    What now? To judge from available information, NATO's  Brussels headquarters still proceeds, in principle, from the  decisions adopted earlier. Namely, to carry out new raids if a  request is received from the command of the UN Bosnian forces --  a request sanctioned by A. Akashi, the UN secretary general's  special representative. But the internal situation within this  "company" no longer appears as definite and clear as it did just  at the end of last week. The events of the weekend, which  showed the futility of the "strong-arm peacemaking method" in  Bosnia, presented both the United Nations and NATO with a  dilemma: to step up pressure or abandon it altogether?    NATO headquarters has not yet reacted officially to this  dilemma, which Akashi recently formulated as a need to make a  choice between sharply increasing the size of the UN contingents  in Bosnia and withdrawing them, but on the other hand there is  lively press comment on this topic. Diverse opinions are being  heard, but probably never before have views which cast doubt on  the present "peacemaking policy" as a whole been expressed so  frankly and in such a generalized form in the newspapers. The  newspaper LA LIBRE BELGIQUE, for example, writes that the losses  borne by a number of Western countries in the course of  expeditions under UN auspices make peacekeeping operations  unpopular, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for some  governments to continue this "humanitarian" policy.    But what is the alternative? In the opinion of practically  all commentators, only the talks process can work. Mindful of  the fact that it is constantly malfunctioning, however, LA LIBRE  BELGIQUE expresses another noteworthy thought: Why not use, in  the interests of a settlement, an additional trump card such  as...the lifting of the embargo against the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia?    You probably could not invent a better epitaph for  "strong-arm peacemaking."</p>

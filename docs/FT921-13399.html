			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / World Trade News: GCC greets petrochemicals offer by EC The six-nation Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) yesterday welcomed an EC offer to let in more petrochemical imports under a planned free trade deal, Reuter reports from Brussels. The European Commission revised its proposals last year after the GCC demanded better access to EC markets for certain industrially-sensitive petrochemicals, subject to special tariffs and quotas. GCC members are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and the UAE. Diplomats said the EC, which wants greater access to expanding Gulf markets and to cement relations with this strategic region, was encouraged to liberalise its position following the 1991 Gulf War. EC officials said the offer included shorter time limits on raising quotas and cutting import duties, with special arrangements to liberalise trade in sensitive petrochemicals.</p>

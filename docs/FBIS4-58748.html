			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cairo, 5 May (MENA)--Dr. Han Wang-san, the South  Korean president's envoy and former deputy prime minister [name  and title as received], described his talks with President Husni  Mubarak as fruitful and beneficial.    In exclusive statements he made to MENA this morning prior  to  his departure for Tanzania via Germany, he said that his visit  to Egypt was to participate in the signing of the  Palestinian-Israeli Agreement. [passage omitted]    In reply to a question, he said that he discussed with  President Mubarak the question of raising South Korea's  diplomatic representation in Cairo to the ambassadorial level.  He added that President Mubarak showed an understanding of the  situation and this issue will be discussed at the proper time.  [passage omitted]    On Korea's aid to the Gaza-Jericho area, he said that his  country has allocated around $12 million to help rebuild and  develop this area's infrastructure in addition to another  $200,000 allocated for preparing and equipping the Palestinian  police.    On the situation in the Korean peninsula and the possibility  of war in the region, the South Korean envoy said that North  Korea will achieve a gain for itself and the region if it  accepts nuclear inspection but will lose if it rejects this  inspection. He added: North Korea has to balance between gain  and loss and on the basis of this formula, the outbreak of war  in the peninsula seems impossible, especially as North Korea is  officially saying that it has no intention of developing nuclear  weapons, does not have the capability to develop them, and has  no intention of going to war. But if it rejects inspection, then  this will create a major problem.</p>

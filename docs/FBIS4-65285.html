			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Winfried Muenster commentary: "To Unify Europe Means To </F> Think of Strasbourg"]    [Text] Brussels, 12 May -- Three years ago, at the time of  the negotiations on the Maastricht Treaty, Helmut Kohl pretended  to be decidedly heretical. Unasked, he stated that in 1994 he  would not recommend to the citizens to elect a European  Parliament to which basic rights are still denied. At that time,  the chancellor wanted to exert pressure to ensure that the  Maastricht conference paid the same attention to the development  of the former European Community into a democratically  legitimated political union as part of the project of monetary  union.    The Strasbourg chamber still does not have the most  important  of all parliamentary rights, that is, the power to pass laws.  But now, four weeks before the election, Kohl does not call for  an election boycott because this would not serve the cause, the  European unification process. A poor turnout at the election  does not exactly improve the parliament's chances of ever  getting more power. On the other hand, it is hard to imagine  that the Community might once again get new responsibilities  that are not accompanied by credible parliamentary control. A  growing number of member states would not take part in that.  Thus, those who want to continue to put the Strasbourg chamber  forever on the backburner, are curbing, in fact, European  integration. The conclusion for the deputies is that they are  more or less obliged to struggle for their own rights if they  want to advance the development of the European Union. And it  is likely that they do not want to refrain once again from using  their means of power, such as the refusal to ratify the entry of  new laender. If Switzerland were to submit an application for  membership in a few years, a frustrated parliament would  probably be obstinate.    Thus, in the future the unification of Europe will mean  thinking of the Strasbourg parliament. The question is only  whether Maastricht II, the second conference for the examination  of the treaty scheduled for 1996, will seriously consider  further integration at that time. Apart from the British, all  who reflected on the Community at the time of Maastricht still  had the European federal state in mind, as if this were  self-evident. However, hardly anybody talks of this anymore.  After the nations lacked the necessary enthusiasm for the  treaty, more and more governments are opposing integration. At  the table of the Council of Ministers in Brussels, political  blackmail triumphs more and more frequently over reasonable  compromises -- would it not be too much of a good thing to  really give the "obscure" Strasbourg chamber legislative power?  For example, the partner state, Germany, which is otherwise so  well disposed toward integration, reacted to the Community's  increase in power, as a result of Maastricht, with more control  powers for the national parliament -- instead of strengthening  the rights of the European Parliament.    Thus, the unification process has perhaps already been  stopped, so that those who want to advance it -- undoubtedly,  the chancellor can be considered one of them -- have to think of  something. Consistently thought out to the end, the completion  of the Strasbourg parliament as the second chamber, in addition  to the Council of Ministers, cannot be avoided because only in  this way can the powers of the European institutions be brought  to a stable balance. It is wrong to deny the parliament its  full rights; rather, it would be correct to precisely define the  field for which they are valid -- for example, for all  resolutions that are adopted with a qualified majority in the  Brussels Council of Ministers. Thus, the people in Strasbourg  would not get the right to levy taxes, but the power to use the  revenue from a tax reserved to the Community. These are not  pipe dreams, but integration policy objectives that seem to be  attainable by 1996, though perhaps not with all partner states.  What matters is that France and Germany want it. Helmut Kohl  knows that only then will his Europe rest on a solid foundation.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK;  </P> <P> A COSWORTH COMEBACK IS KEY TO RAHAL HOPES  </P> <P> From June 28, 1981, to Nov. 9, 1986, Cosworth engines powered 81 consecutive  winners of Indy car races.  </P> <P> Last year, Ilmor Chevrolet engines were in the winning chassis of 14 of 15 Indy  car races. A Judd engine won the other. Cosworth, for the first time since it  was introduced in Indy cars in 1976, was blanked.  </P> <P> The perplexing engine question as the 1989 season approaches is this: Can the  Cosworth make a comeback and become competitive with the Chevrolets?  </P> <P> Bobby Rahal, who won the 1987 CART Indy car championship with a Cosworth but  then switched to a Judd for 1988, has switched back to Cosworth and believes it  is possible for the once-dominant engine to reassert itself.  </P> <P> "I liken Cosworth to the story of awakening the sleeping giant," Rahal said.  "For years, it didn't have to do much because it had no competition. Then along  came Ilmor. Now it's back to the fight."  </P> <P> Ironically, Rahal switched teams -- from the late Jim Trueman's Truesports to  Maury Kraines' Kraco -- last year because he wanted a Chevy engine. Truesports  was committed to Judd, and it was rumored that Kraco might join the group of  Ilmor Chevy engine users, which includes the teams of Roger Penske, Pat Patrick  and Carl Haas-Paul Newman.  </P> <P> However, Ilmor executives decided to add only one new engine this year and it  went to Haas-Newman after they signed Michael Andretti to join his father,  Mario, on a two-driver team.  </P> <P> "Initially, I was disappointed not to get a Chevy," Rahal said. "But there were  no promises made (by Kraines), and I'm a big boy, so I accepted it. Last year,  I thought I had to make a change, Chevy or not, to a team that was associated  with a major engine builder. The change from Truesports to Kraco was made based  on that need.  </P> <P> "Now I think, frankly, that the change may work in my favor. With only two  teams using the new short-stroke DFS, we'll be sharing the development  information with only one other team (Dick Simon's with Arie Luyendyk as the  driver). I don't think there is any question that Cosworth has the capabilities  to compete head to head with Chevrolet. Michael (Andretti) showed its potential  in the Marlboro Challenge at Miami."  </P> <P> Andretti, in his last ride as Kraco's driver, won the non-points race on  Miami's Tamiami Park road course last November.  </P> <P> "Tests on the dyno show the engine as considerably stronger than last year's  version," Rahal said. "It is very different, more than just the short stroke. I  would say that literally 50% of it has changed."  </P> <P> Enough changes were made for Cosworth to change the designation of the engine  from DFX, which scored the 81 consecutive wins, to DFS, for short stroke.  </P> <P> "There's a lot at stake between Cosworth and Ilmor, more than meets the eye,"  Rahal said. "There's a great intercity rivalry, too, that has to do with  pride."  </P> <P> Cosworth's headquarters are in Northampton, England, where the engines are  developed and manufactured, although they are distributed and maintained at  their American headquarters in Torrance.  </P> <P> Ilmor's headquarters are in Brixworth, a Northampton suburb.  </P> <P> There is more, even in the derivation of their names, that is similar.  </P> <P> Cosworth was started in 1958 by Mike Costin and Keith Duckworth, hence the name  Cosworth. Ilmor was formed in 1985 by Mario Illien and Paul Morgan, hence the  name Ilmor.  </P> <P> Illien and Morgan were friends working at Cosworth when they decided to design  and build their own engine. A transatlantic phone call to Penske led to  financial backing from Penske's racing empire and General Motors, specifically  the Chevrolet division.  </P> <P> The new engine was raced for the first time by Al Unser in April, 1986, at  Phoenix. Ironically, Unser also drove the first Indy car Cosworth, a DFV, when  it made its debut in 1975, also at Phoenix. "Having a huge corporation behind  me is a good confidence builder," Rahal said. "We worked hard last year to  develop the Judd engine, but there is no comparison with the way I feel this  year. John Judd's first priority is Formula One and it fell on Truesports to do  a tremendous amount of development with a budget that obviously didn't match  Chevy or Cosworth."  </P> <P> Rahal, an avid golfer between races, is so serious about helping develop the  new Kraco Cosworth-Lola that he skipped the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am to go  testing. And he has canceled his plan to drive in the 24 Hours of LeMans in  June because it might detract from his Indy car preparation. "I'm committed to  making this team successful," he said. "I know (crew chief) Barry Green is,  too. I told Maury Kraines that I knew the feel and thrill of winning Indy, and  my commitment is to get him in Victory Circle so he can get the same feeling."  </P> <P> MOTORCYCLES -- The second and final round of the Coors Spring Classic for  speedway bikes will be held Friday night at the Orange County Fairgrounds in  Costa Mesa. Sam Ermolenko won last week's first round when race leader Rick  Miller broke a chain on the last lap. The weekly speedway season will open  March 31 at Costa Mesa, April 2 at Victorville and April 9 at Glen Helen Park  in San Bernardino.  </P> <P> OFF-ROAD -- The fifth annual SCORE Great Mojave 250 will have three separate  starts Saturday. Motorcycles will be flagged away at 6 a.m. from Bessemer Mine  Rd. in Lucerne Valley. Four-wheel vehicles will officially start at 7 a.m. from  downtown Lucerne Valley, but will be restarted under race conditions at 8 a.m.  from Bessemer Mine Rd. The race will consist of four laps of approximately 60  miles along the north side of the San Bernardino mountains.  </P> <P> SPRINT CARS -- Two old-timers pulled off surprise wins in the opening weekend  of the California Racing Assn. schedule in Phoenix and the Parnelli Jones  Firestone-sponsored series will move to Raven Raceway in Tucson for a 30-lap  main event Saturday night. Ed Reed, 41, of Orange, and Bob Meli, 43, of Temple  City, were the Phoenix winners. It was the first CRA win for Reed, who started  last in the 20-car field, and Meli's first in 10 years. Ascot Park, home track  of the CRA, will open its season March 18.  </P> <P> DRAG BOATS -- The International Hot Boat Assn. will open its season Saturday  and Sunday with more than 150 boats competing on Firebird Lake in Chandler,  Ariz. Tom Black, in Final Effort, and Ron Braaksma, in Madness, are expected to  resume their top-fuel rivalry. Last year, Black won the season championship and  Braaksma the season-ending world finals race in November.  </P> <P> POWER BOATS -- The American Power Boat Assn. inducted 18 drivers into its Hall  of Fame, including unlimited hydroplane champion Tom D'Eath of Fair Haven,  Mich., endurance champion Bob Teague of Granada Hills, and outboard champions  Jimmy Johnson of La Palma and Don Johnston of Riverside. . . . Thunderbirds  Unlimited, which conducts hydroplane racing in San Diego, was honored by the  Unlimited Racing Commission as the safety and rescue team of the year and its  chairman, John Daley, was named winner of the outstanding contribution award.  </P> <P> KARTS -- The Championship Kart Racing Assn. will hold a charity benefit race  for the Huntington Valley Boys and Girls Clubs this weekend along Pacific Coast  Highway, near Beach Blvd., in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> DRAG RACING -- The United Sand Assn. will hold sand drag programs Saturday and  Sunday at San Bernardino's Glen Helen Park.  </P></p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (10): New and harsh realities - Halle BEFORE the unification of Germany there was hardly an ambitious communist party apparatchik who did not want to be promoted to run the eastern German city of Halle. It was a powerful sinecure. Its importance as a party post lay primarily in the region's old industrial base, which in turn had bred a radical socialist movement. Not surprisingly, the city's nickname, 'Red Halle', was coined long before east Germany's communists assumed power in 1949. The city's economy was anchored on heavy industry, consisting of machine-tool manufacturing, chemicals, and brown coal. These were the three main engines which also drove the east German economy. But they were never tested on the world market. After the declaration of German unification on October 3 1991, preceded by monetary union which did away with the Ost Mark, the eastern German currency, the inhabitants of Halle were faced with a new and harsh reality: its industry was uncompetitive. Without huge restructuring, investment, and privatisation, this region of Saxony-Anhalt would never be able to compete either on the domestic or the world markets. These are some of the challenges facing the 300,000 strong population of this city, the birthplace of George Friedrich Handel. To meet this challenge, the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising and restructuring eastern German industry, placed almost the entire industrial network of Halle and its environs under its control. It brought in western German managers to introduce new accounting methods in the enterprises, reduce inefficiency, and above all, prepare the manufacturing, brown coal, and chemicals sectors for privatisation. There is hardly an inhabitant of Halle who has not been affected by these sweeping changes. The most fundamental changes have occurred at the work place. Instead of employment for life, more than 124,000 people have lost their jobs. This does not include the 14,500 on short-time work, or the 46,100 on job creation schemes. In all, the total unemployment rate in Halle is 40 per cent of the labour force. The virtual collapse of the industrial base, combined with high unemployment, has had a debilitating affect on the city's finances. Mr Klaus Rauen, the mayor of Halle, says the city is running a budget deficit of 70 per cent. The annual budget is DM1bn. 'What would you expect?' he said in his office overlooking Halle's old, elegant, but neglected town square. 'Without revenue from industry, and without people working, it will be a long time before we even approach the level of financing to similar-sized cities in western Germany.' Mr Rauen gives a poignant example. Bonn and Halle have the same size population. While the latter was, and is still dependent on industry, the economy of the former is fuelled by services. Thus, more than DM250m revenue from services is earned by Bonn's city council each year. In Halle, revenue from industry totals DM18m, and total tax revenue does not exceed DM65m. Narrowing the gap between expenditure and revenue is now one of the key tasks facing Halle's administration. The question is how. There is no doubt, that, in common with the other cities and states in eastern Germany, Halle will be reliant on financial transfers from Bonn for many years to come. Annual transfers to the five eastern states total DM180bn gross. However, the future economic growth of Halle will depend on what happens to two key sectors: the chemical and brown coal industry. These two sectors are located less than half-an-hour's drive from Halle. To the north-east lies Bitterfeld, home to Germany's chemical industry before the second world war and one of the first big manufacturing centres of Germany's own industrial revolution of the late nineteenth century. After 1945 the Allies broke up the huge industrial conglomerates led by, among others, IG Fraben and Bayer. After 1949 the entire region, in common with other parts of the east German economy, was placed under state control. Until 1990, the regime was more intent on extensive development, determined to become the main industrial country in Comecon, the former socialist trading bloc. But the price was heavy. The industry proved to be uncompetitive after unification. And environmental standards were ignored, leading to soil pollution on such a scale that more than a third of Bitterfeld's chemical sites are unlikely to be fit for use again. The Treuhand and west German investors are now slowly turning Bitterfeld around. It will take several years. But Mr Klaus Schucht, head of chemicals and mining at the Treuhand, and one of the most energetic officials working to open up the region to competition, has no doubt that Bitterfeld will have potential in one important aspect: by attracting through generous investment grants and tax holidays, companies such as Bayer, the pharmaceuticals and chemcial manufacturers, and others, will create a competitive industrial base. After all, these green-field sites will bring with them very high technological standards. But green field sites and high technology do not create many jobs. 'That is true,' says Mr Schucht. 'But you must remember that these new, capital intensive industries, coupled with research and development, have to be serviced, and it will be attractive for other investors.' Signs of a services sector are already emerging in Halle itself. These consist of handwerken - small work shops employing fewer than 10 people, which specialise in anything ranging from car and house repairs, to computer programming and engineering. Mr Michael Wilkens, head of Deutsche Bank in Halle says that these work shops, together with the mittelstand, the small and medium sized industries which formed the backbone of western Germany's post-war growth, are sprouting up. But he recognises the need for an industrial base, however small, to act as a magnate for the mittelstand. Apart from the future development of Bitterfeld, Halle's economy will also depend on the Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle, or Mibrag, the giant lignite fields which straddle Saxony-Anhalt. An Anglo-American consortium led by Britain's PowerGen, NRG of Minneapolis, and Morrison Knudsen of Idaho are set to sign contract later this month to buy Mibrag. Although Mibrag's pre-1989 work force of over 50,000 has been reduced to under 10,000, the consortium is committed to turning the mines round. Certainly these two sectors alone will not revitalise Halle's entire economy. Construction and services are already playing a key role, as any visitor to Halle will testify - it is hard to avoid the bulldozers and the scaffolding. But together, all three sectors will eventually generate tax revenue. The budget deficit will remain. But at least it might narrow over time.</p>

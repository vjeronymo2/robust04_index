This disposal and reuse is being conducted in compliance with the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act (BCRA) of 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with recommendations of the 1993 Base Closure and Realignment Commission, the Navy plans to close NTC Orlando, and its three remote sites: Area ``C'', Herndon Annex, and NTC Annex. Approximately 2,020 acres and associated buildings will be available for reuse following closure of NTC Orlando and the remote sites. NTC Orlando's functions and operations will be relocated to other Department of Defense locations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed action involves the disposal of land, buildings, and infrastructure of NTC Orlando for subsequent use. As required by the NEPA process, the Navy will evaluate alternative reuses for the NTC Orlando properties. In accordance with CEQ regulations, the ``no-action'' alternative of Navy retention of NTC Orlando properties in a caretaker status will also be addressed in the EIS. However, because the process is mandated by the BCRA, selection of the ``no-action'' alternative would be considered impracticable for the Navy to implement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reuse of NTC Orlando's assets will be defined in coordination with the City of Orlando NTC Reuse Commission. Anticipated uses include, but are not limited to: residential, industrial, commercial, office, recreational, or a combination of these. Major environmental issues that will be addressed in the EIS include, but are not limited to: air quality, water quality, wetlands, endangered species, cultural resources, and socioeconomic impacts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Navy will initiate a scoping process for the purpose of determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying the significant issues related to this action. Navy will hold a public scoping meeting on Thursday, August 25, 1994, beginning at 7 p.m., at the Audubon Park Elementary School, 1500 Falcon Drive, Orlando, Florida. This meeting will be advertised in the Orlando area newspapers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A brief presentation will precede request for public comment. Navy representatives will be available at this meeting to receive comments from the public regarding issues of concern to the public. It is important that federal, state, and local agencies and interested individuals take this opportunity to identify environmental concerns that should be addressed during the preparation of the EIS. In the interest of available time, each speaker will be asked to limit oral comments to five minutes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agencies and the public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comment in addition to, or in lieu of, oral comments at the public meeting. To be most helpful, scoping comments should clearly describe specific issues or topics which the commenter believes the EIS should address. Written statements and/or questions regarding the scoping process should be mailed no later than September 26, 1994, to: Commanding Officer, Southern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, P.O. Box 190010, North Charleston, SC 29419&hyph;9010 (Attn: Mr. Ronnie Lattimore, Code 203RL), telephone (803) 743&hyph;0796, Fax (803) 743&hyph;0888. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lewis T.

The accident occurred on the  territory of the frontier Noemberyan district of Armenia where  specialists from the "Armgazprom" were sent for repairs.    Meanwhile, the gas pipeline damage has immediately affected  the electric power supply of Yerevan and other cities and  districts of Armenia. Under the transport blockade conditions  gas is the only fuel for Armenian thermal power stations.  Therefore, residents of Yerevan are supplied with electricity  only for one-two hours daily as it was in winter.</p>

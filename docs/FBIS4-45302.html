			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the report received on 1 June, the  fighting between Burmese Government troops and minority rebels  has eased up in different parts of Burma. All encounters took  place 50 to 70 kilometers from the Thai border, except for the  fighting opposite Mae Sai District of Chiang Rai Province.    Government troops and the rebels in the vicinities of Namon  and Hin Kong Mountains and Mong Chot Town continuously exchanged  artillery shelling. It is believed that the new units sent to  reinforce the government's position at Thachilek border town are  planning to attack the rebels now surrounding Mong Chot, Mong  Ton, and Mong Pan Townships.    Kun Sa's men reportedly have set up a field hospital  opposite  Lak Taeng Village of Tambon Wiang Luang, Wiang Heng District,  Chiang Mai Province. The hospital is capable of providing  treatment for 300 patients. Meanwhile, Khun Sa has dispatched  3,000 men from Mong Mai, opposite Mae Hong Son Province, to the  northeastern region of the Shan State.    Major General Yutthana Muangmangkhang, commander of the 33d  Military Circle in Chiang Mai Province, ordered reinforcements  for the security force at Doi Tung Royal Villa, the residence of  the princess mother, because the fighting between Burmese  Government troops and rebels are not very far from the place.</p>

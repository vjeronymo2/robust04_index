			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- The Beijing  Municipal Government intends to take further steps to improve  quality and efficiency in utilizing foreign investments.    This was stated at a municipal comprehensive economic  working  meeting held recently.    Efforts will be made from now to improve the investment  environment of Beijing, shift investment directions and  diversify the forms of utilizing foreign funds.    The municipal government will attach much importance to  investment from transnational corporations and investments to be  used for urban infrastructure construction, major national  projects and high-tech projects.    Profit-earning and efficiency will be stressed in utilizing  foreign funds, instead of merely asking for increased numbers of  projects and expansion in the amount of investment.    Diversified and more flexible forms will be adopted in  utilizing foreign funds, such as introducing share-holding  systems, contacts with overseas investment funds and issuing of  "b"-shares -- shares which companies in China issue solely for  foreigners to buy.    A more authoritative and sensitive information network  offering latest information to foreign investors will be  established soon.    Approval procedures for foreign-funded projects will be  simplified and different procedures will be followed for  different kinds of projects.    Implementation of related laws and regulations will be  strengthened to protect the interests of all sides involved.    Fifteen years of reform and opening-up of the country has  brought about establishment of 7,500 overseas-funded enterprises  in Beijing and an imported investment totalling ten billion U.S.  dollars.    The opening drive reached its zenith last year with newly  approved foreign-funded enterprises reaching 3,752 in number,  almost equalling that for all the previous 14 years put  together. Last year's batch included 49 large-scale projects  involving foreign funds of at least 50 million u.s. dollars each.    Among foreign investors in Beijing, the number of  world-renowned transnational corporations has reached 60.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Australia claims US support over Apec AUSTRALIA yesterday claimed to have won US support for proposals to strengthen the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) process by establishing regular meetings of regional heads of government, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. Australian officials said US president George Bush endorsed the plans in a letter to Mr Paul Keating, prime minister and also supported the establishment of a permanent Apec secretariat. Mr Keating proposed upgrading Apec on a visit to Indonesia last month. The plan was received cautiously by President Suharto, and is thought to be regarded with suspicion by other south-east Asian nations. Malaysia, in particular, has opposed Australian attempts to strengthen Apec because of concerns that it might undermine the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean). Asean, grouping Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand and the Philippines, is planning a south-east Asian free trade zone in response to the emergence of trading blocs in Europe and North America. Apec, launched two years ago by Mr Bob Hawke, former Australian prime minister, was envisaged as a forum for informal discussion of regional trade and development. However, the process has become an symbol of Australia's increasing trade and foreign policy focus on the Asia/Pacific region since Mr Keating replaced Mr Hawke last year. Mr Keating has increased pressure on the US to keep a security presence in the region. In recent talks with Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, Mr Keating supported continuation of US facilities in Australia, and offered use of a bombing range when the US leaves the Philippines this year.</p>

			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FRANCE;  </P> <P> MUSLIM TENSION IN TOWN IS REKINDLED  </P> <P> A makeshift Muslim prayer hall in a small southeastern French town has been  attacked and strewn with pieces of pork, a meat forbidden by Islam, just two  months after the demolition of the local mosque outraged France's 3 million  Muslims. The mosque in Charvieu-Chavagneux was bulldozed in mid-August during  morning prayers, a move that brought accusations of racism against right-wing  Mayor Gerard Dezempte. Dezempte said at the time that the mosque, a condemned  building, was accidentally destroyed.  </P></p>

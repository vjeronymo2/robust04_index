The  plasmid spectra of 122 strains of Yersinia pestis  were isolated in Mongolia from patients, wild mammals, and  arthropods. The populations of three plasmidovars of Y.  pestis were circulating in the natural foci of plague in  Mongolia. Samples were tested for Ca[.sup]2+[/] growth  dependence at 37C. Of the three plasmidovars, the first  harbors three plasmids with mol masses 6, 47, 65 Md. The second  and third contain plasmids with mol masses 6, 16, 47, 65 Md and  8, 47, and 75-80 Md. It is hoped that this work will help solve  the problem of intraspecific differentiation of the plague  microbe and will uncover the mechanism for the formation of  epidemically significant populations of Y. pestis and  determine their clonal structuring.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Transportation Minister Publio Fiori by </F> Franco Fatone in Rome; date not given: "How To Reduce the  Deficit? It Is All Roses and Fiori"]    [Text] Rome -- The squeeze is on its way. These are the  words of Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini. Meanwhile, however,  Transportation Minister Publio Fiori is suggesting how the  council of ministers can recuperate 50 trillion lire without  cuts or taxes. He is practically a magician: "It involves five  items," he explains to L'INDIPENDENTE, "that will enable us to  block the INPS [National Institute for Social Security] deficit.  Trust in me." The trust is granted. Meanwhile, Fiori is  expecting a less drastic budget that will relaunch the economy.    [Fatone] Minister, what deadlines do you foresee?    [Fiori] We must start immediately. A climate of uncertainty  is emerging both in the internal and international markets. And  this may not encourage the signs of recovery in our country.    [Fatone] Must we speed things up?    [Fiori] Yes. We must immediately clarify what policies the  government intends to adopt.    [Fatone] Should we expect a drastic budget?    [Fiori] No. But I trust in a very serious budget.    [Fatone] In what sense?    [Fiori] In the sense that we must not focus on the theme of  public finances. Instead the first concern must be the  development of the economy.    [Fatone] Could you explain yourself better?    [Fiori] Certainly! Perhaps, for too long now we have made  the mistake of sacrificing the economy to balance our public  accounts. While, if by absurdity, there was to be a period of  confidence among our citizen voters, we could even draw up a  medium-term plan that would take account of a worsening in the  public accounts, provided, however, that it would be drawn up  with the intention of relaunching the economy.    [Fatone] Excuse me, but your thesis is still unclear.    [Fiori] Let me explain myself better then. What I want to  say is that we must not work at balancing public spending at the  cost of suffocating the economy, but that we need to relaunch  the economy to pay for the public deficit with the wealth that  would be produced.    [Fatone] Yet the lancets of the cuts will affect spending.  Pensions are the target...    [Fiori] This is absurd. It would be a mistake to start with  the policy of cuts again. Pensions have been sacrificed for  years and it would be unjust to think that recovery can be made  to bear upon the shoulders of the weak, the pensioners again.    [Fatone] According to you, would it be necessary to reverse  the trend?    [Fiori] Of course. Not only this: The pensioners must be  guaranteed that which has been established by the Constitutional  Court, and pensions must also be linked to salaries. I repeat,  the continuation of the phenomenon of year-based pensions that  we all know is unjust.    [Fatone] There is no doubt, however, that the financial  burden will be considerable. Do you agree?    [Fiori] Certainly. However, we must immediately work out a  reentry system and at the same time reflect on how to manage the  payment of this debt. This is not an impossible operation.  There are already some rather clear ideas on how to overcome  this obstacle easily.    [Fatone] Many people, however, expect to see cuts in public  spending in the budget. The axe could even fall upon  transports...    [Fiori] Anything can be done under a budget. I would exclude  any transport cuts, however. It is a wrong political choice.    [Fatone] Why?    [Fiori] Transportation infrastructures form the basis of any  development program in a modern society. If the cuts were to  affect the transport sector, in the medium term we would pay for  this with a fall in production, trade, and consequently GDP.  The effect would be a worsening in the public accounts.    [Fatone] Do you have faith in [Prime Minister] Berlusconi?    [Fiori] Certainly. I find that Berlusconi possesses an  exceptional lucidity and simplicity in these problems.    [Fatone] Have you any suggestions to give to Berlusconi  concerning the budget?    [Fiori] Yes. We can rake in 50 trillion lire without having  to resort to cuts and new taxes. We will succeed in blocking  the INPS abyss.    [Fatone] And where do you intend getting these 50 trillion  lire from.    [Fiori] I will communicate this at the right moment. First I  must complete the plan that I will offer to the council of  ministers.    [Fatone] Can you give us a preview of your recipe?    [Fiori] I can only say that it concerns four or five items.  Trust in my words.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 6 Jun (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi  has decided to refer four police officers to the Higher State  Prosecution Office for interrogation for selling arms from the  Interior Ministry arms depots. These officers are Major Samir  Mahmud Mujahid, chief of the arms depot at the General  Administration for Police Supply; Major Hani Sabri Mahmud, chief  of the Returned Arms Department at the same administration;  Major Mustafa 'Ashur, depots secretary at the Central Security  Department; and Captain Iyhab Nafi', head of the Department of  Returned Arms at the police supply.    The Interior Ministry statement released today said that the  four officers sold five Lee Enfield rifles, three automatic  rifles, and a quantity of rounds to certain arms and ammunition  dealers. The investigating agencies continue their efforts to  seize other quantities of arms and ammuntion that were sold with  the knowledge of the four officers.    The interior minister earlier pensioned off the four  officers  as soon as their involvement in this operation was uncovered.  It should be recalled that the interior minister issued  directives for periodic inspection of the arms and ammunition  depots to make sure that the regular instructions on the  handling of various arms were implemented.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / More tunnel freight The Channel tunnel takes a further step towards paying its way today with the start of long-distance freight services carrying new cars from the West Midlands to Milan. Rover Group will make its first shipment of about 250 cars to its Italian distribution centre as part of a regular service involving five trainloads a week. The journey will take two days compared with eight days previously. Railfreight Distribution, the British Rail subsidiary, expects to run six freight trains a day each way through the tunnel by midsummer, rising to 27 a day by the end of 1995. Through freight trains are the second type of service to begin running through the tunnel after the start of freight shuttles, which carry lorries between Folkestone and Calais, on May 19. Passenger services are expected to start in July.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: BA's economy class Yesterday's disappointing dip in British Airways' second quarter profits amply demonstrates the volatility of airline earnings. Though this inevitably carries a price in BA's rating, the 20 per cent fall in the shares over the last 10 days looks a little overdone. Next year's prospective multiple on the basis of one City forecast, after all, is 45 per cent below the stock market average. There is bad news, to be sure, in the latest evidence of falling passenger yields. It will take more than the prospect of a modest economic upturn before the average finance director sanctions first-class travel all round. So far, at least, BA detects no rush of eager British exporters in search of overseas business. Even so, investors may be putting undue emphasis on the latest numbers. News that currency adjustments will continue to be a malign influence on profits in the current quarter is certainly unsettling, if explicable in terms of the lag effect of advance sales. But this will cancel itself out in the final three months, and boost both yields and earnings next year. Given BA's reasonably aggressive balance sheet and global ambition, the closer the company gets to its target cash flow of 21 per cent of revenues, the better. This is all the more so since BA has big capacity increases planned for next summer and would be better able to keep up the cost-cutting momentum. While a rights issue is probably inevitable at some stage, the USAir and Dan-Air deals are manageable without it.</p>

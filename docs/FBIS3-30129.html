			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 22 February, a Foreign Ministry source disclosed  that the ministry has made firm its decision to tentatively put  a freeze on internal debates over whether it would be proper for  Japan to participate in the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC).    The Foreign Ministry has made this decision in consideration  of Japan's relations with the United States, which is strongly  opposed to the establishment of the EAEC. Circumstances are  such that even if debates on this issue are resumed in the  future, it cannot be predicted whether Japan will decide to  participate in the organization. Thus, Japan's currently  strained relations with the United States are affecting its  Asian policy, too.    The EAEC plan is aimed at unifying nations in the East Asian  region. It has its origins in the East Asia Economic Group  (EAEG) plan proposed by Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed  Mahathir. The United States is strongly opposed to the plan  because it excludes such nations as the United States, Canada,  Australia, and New Zealand.</p>

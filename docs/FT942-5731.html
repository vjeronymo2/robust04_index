			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Israel air raid kills up to 45 Hizbollah Israel yesterday launched its bloodiest air raid in seven years on guerrilla targets in Lebanon, killing up to 45 members of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah group in a dawn attack which provoked retaliatory rocket strikes from Hizbollah fighters into northern Israel. Lebanese officials said four Israeli jets and two helicopters launched the raid on a mountainside Hizbollah training camp at Ain Kaoukaba in the eastern Bekaa Valley. Lebanese troops had fought off 'an Israeli landing attempt' near Baalbek, close by. Long columns of Israeli tanks and artillery later began moving towards Lebanon as Hizbollah fighters in south Lebanon fired at least 40 Katyusha rockets into northern Israel and about two dozen into Israel's self-declared 'security zone' in south Lebanon, hitting buildings in the Israeli town of Nahariyya. The Lebanese government condemned the Israeli raid as a 'barbarian aggression.' A statement called for a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the attack. President Elias Hrawi called it a disaster for Middle East peace hopes. The raid came two weeks after Israel provoked anger in Beirut and Damascus with a dawn raid deep into the Bekaa to abduct Mr Mustapha al-Dirani, an Islamic militant suspected of having kidnapped Mr Ron Arad, an Israeli airman missing in Lebanon since 1986. Mr Faris Boueiz, Lebanon's foreign minister, said 45 Hizbollah 'martyrs' had died in the raid. Hizbollah put the death toll at 30, but said the figure was likely to rise. The exchanges were the most serious since Israel launched artillery and air attacks on towns in south Lebanon last July, after a spate of Hizbollah rocket attacks. More than 120 people died in those raids, eight of them Hizbollah militants. Hizbollah said yesterday it would make a 'comprehensive response on all levels' against Israel, threatening to increase fighting in south Lebanon from the skirmishes which have continued between Israel, its proxy forces and Hizbollah since last July. Mr Mordechai Gur, Israel's deputy defence minister, asserted the raid was a 'pure and successful military strike'. He said the Hizbollah militants killed had taken part in attacks on Israel or were training for future strikes. Raised tensions in south Lebanon will further strain peace talks between Israel and Syria, whose leader, President Hafez al-Assad, has long used Syrian influence on Hizbollah as an important card in his talks with the Israelis.</p>

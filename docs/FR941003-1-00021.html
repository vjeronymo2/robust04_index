			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.616 is proposed to be amended by adding a paragraph (c) stating that to the extent that any information under the control of an individual or entity located in a NAFTA country concerning knowledge, use, or other activity relevant to proving or disproving a date of invention has been ordered to be produced by an administrative patent judge or the Board (&sect;1.671(h)), but is not produced for use in the interference to the same extent as such information could be made available in the United States, the administrative patent judge or the Board shall draw such adverse inferences as may be appropriate under the circumstances, or take such other action permitted by statute, rule, or regulation, in favor of the party that requested the information in the interference, including imposition of appropriate sanctions under &sect;1.616(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.647, which currently requires a party who relies on a non-English language document to provide an English-language translation and an affidavit attesting to its accuracy, is proposed to be amended to extend these requirements to non-English language documents that a party is required to produce via discovery (see &sect;1.671(h)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Attorney Fees and Expenses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.616 is proposed to be amended by redesignating current paragraphs (a) through (e) as paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) and (a)(6) and adding new paragraphs (a)(5) and (b). New paragraph (a)(5) would authorize the award of compensatory (as opposed to punitive) expenses and/or attorney fees as a sanction for failing to comply with the rules or an order, since there are occasions when such a sanction would be more commensurate in scope with the infraction than the sanctions that are currently authorized. New paragraph (b) would authorize the imposition of a sanction, including a sanction in the form of compensatory expenses and/or attorney fees, against a party for taking or maintaining a frivolous position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Certificates of Prior Consultation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (b) of &sect;1.637 currently requires that a miscellaneous motion under &sect;1.635 contain a certificate stating that the moving party has conferred with all opponents in a good faith effort to resolve by agreement the issues raised by the motion and indicating whether any other party plans to oppose the motion. It is proposed to amend paragraph (b) to extend the requirement for such a certificate to motions filed under &sect;&sect;1.633 and 1.634 and also to require the certificate to indicate that the reasons and facts in support of the motion were discussed with each opponent and, if an opponent has indicated that it will oppose the motion, to identify the issues and/or facts believed to be in dispute. The proposed requirement for consultation should result in a reduction in the number of issues raised by motions under &sect;1.633 and 1.634 as well as a reduction in the number of motions filed under those rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Service of a ``Developing Record''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the amendments to &sect;1.672 discussed above under the heading ``Amendments responsive to adoption of Public Law 103&hyph;182,'' it is proposed to amend &sect;&sect;1.672, 1.682, 1.683 and 1.688 to require each party to serve on each opponent a ``developing record'' that will evolve into the record required to be filed under &sect;1.653. Specifically, in &sect;1.672, it is proposed to amend paragraph (b) to provide that a party presenting testimony of a witness by affidavit shall, no later than the time set by the administrative patent judge for serving affidavits, file (which includes serve) the affidavit, whether it is a new affidavit or an affidavit that was previously filed by that party during  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  prosecution of an application or under &sect;1.608 or 1.639(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 1.682, 1.683 and 1.688 are proposed to be amended to parallel the proposed amendments to &sect;1.672. Specifically, paragraph (a) of &sect;1.682 as proposed to be amended would provide that a party may introduce into evidence, if otherwise admissible, an official record or printed publication not identified in an affidavit or on the record during an oral deposition of a witness, by filing (which includes serving) a copy of the official record or publication no later than the time set for filing affidavits under &sect;1.672(b), thereby dispensing with the current requirement to file a notice of intent to rely on the official record or printed publication. In &sect;1.683, paragraph (a) as proposed to be amended would provide that a party may introduce into evidence, if otherwise admissible, testimony by affidavit or oral deposition from another interference, proceeding, or action involving the same parties by filing (which includes serving) a copy of the affidavit or a copy of the deposition transcript no later than the time set for filing affidavits under &sect;1.672(b), thereby dispensing with the current requirement for a party to file a motion under &sect;1.635 for leave to rely on such testimony. Section 1.688 as proposed to be amended would provide that, if otherwise admissible, a party may introduce into evidence an answer to a written request for an admission or an answer to a written interrogatory obtained by discovery under &sect;1.687 by filing a copy of the request for admission or the written interrogatory and the answer no later than the time set for filing affidavits under &sect;1.672(b). Thus, all evidence filed under &sect;&sect;1.672, 1.682, 1.683 and 1.688 that relates to a party's case-in-chief should be filed together no later than the date set by an administrative patent judge for the party to serve affidavits under &sect;1.672(b) for its case-in-chief and all evidence under those sections that relates to the party's rebuttal should be filed no later than the date set for the party to serve affidavits under &sect;1.672(b) for its case-in-rebuttal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

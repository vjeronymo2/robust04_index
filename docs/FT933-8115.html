			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Czech recession persists despite market reforms AFTER three years of steady market reforms, the Czech economy remains hamstrung by a recession which is proving more difficult to shake off than expected, though officials believe the worst may be over. The finance minister, Mr Ivan Kocarnik, is confident the government's 1993 targets will be met, though with a more modest growth rate of 1 per cent and with inflation - aggravated by the introduction of value added tax in January - at around 17 per cent. The Czech National Bank endorsed the minister's cautious optimism in a report showing private and public demand rising 12 per cent and 16 per cent respectively in the first half of the year compared with the period in 1992. But analysts believe it will be difficult to turn around an economy labouring under a fourth consecutive year of declining output. Industrial production dropped 4 per cent and gross domestic product fell 1 per cent in the first six months compared with last year, when output already had declined sharply. Efforts to build a market economy have been hampered by recession in western Europe, the collapse of traditional markets in the east, and the extra costs arising from the break-up of Czechoslovakia. Rising protectionism in western markets has been an additional handicap, though, apart from sensitive sectors such as steel, the overall effect on the Czech economy of restrictions on imports into the European Community have been exaggerated by politicians. The Czech Republic has a trade surplus with the EC. Industry is running below capacity, but this is due not simply to lack of access to markets, but also to poor marketing skills and structures. Czech industry also needs time and capital to modernise and improve product quality. The Industry Ministry recently warned that the lower quality and rising costs of Czech products - at a time when recession and devaluations made western European manufacturers more competitive - was causing a decline in local demand. Officials fear that big companies such as Volkswagen, which is currently going through fierce cost-cutting measures, could abandon plans to develop local supplier networks for its Skoda venture in the Czech Republic and turn to west European producers instead. The staunchly free market government of the prime minister, Mr Vaclav Klaus, has rejected calls for a devaluation to make Czech products more competitive, saying companies must become more efficient. The government is concerned that inflation and rapidly rising wages could undermine prospects of recovery and frighten foreign investors, who invested more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in the Czech territory in the three years before Czechoslovakia split. The average industrial wage has risen by more than 22 per cent compared with a year ago - while productivity has stagnated - and Mr Klaus is determined to bring wages under control. He says that Germany's economic success was built on productivity growing faster than wages. Labour costs are still about a tenth of those in Germany, but competition for investment from other ex-communist countries is fierce. However, with unemployment at 148,600, or 2.8 per cent, the Klaus warning loses much of its impact. Prague has no unemployment. Laid-off workers are absorbed in the city's bustling private sector. Extensive indebtedness is another problem. About a third of privatised companies are believed to be technically bankrupt. Total inter-company debt is estimated at about Kcs 150bn (Pounds 3.48bn). Since a new bankruptcy law came into force in April there has been a steady trickle of official bankruptcies, but its full effect has yet to be felt.</p>

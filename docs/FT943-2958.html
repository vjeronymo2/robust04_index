			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Technology: Pick of a rich software crop - Software at Work / A package that lets accountants take quick stock of client billing Discard the image of the insular chartered accountant so mocked by Monty Python comic John Cleese. Accountants, among others, are achieving a judicious mix of the personal touch and advanced technology with the help of new 'groupware' communications software. Levy Gee, the London-based accountancy firm, is less conventional than most. It was the first accountancy practice to advertise on the radio, the first to automate timesheets and billing and, it claims, the only one with more personal computers than people. Founded in 1969, the firm employs 260 staff, including 36 partners, served by 300 computers at home and in the office. Connecting people and computers became a priority once Levy Gee had assembled several software building blocks dedicated to different functions. These included a billing system developed in-house, a packaged accounts system, an in-house system to assess work-in-progress and bills outstanding, plus an 'executive information system' to give senior partners screen-based snapshots of the business. 'In many respects the English professions have suffered from the prejudice against computers,' says Ross Mullinger, head of Levy Gee's information technology consultancy. 'We saw that there was an increasing IT input, and that our firm had to be more IT aware and, at the same time, distributed as widely as possible.' There had to be easy communication between all of its six UK offices, and between its UK base and its partners in the US. Many staff work from home and they needed to have as much immediate access to information as anyone working in the office. The firm's main client base consists of small, typically family businesses. In the years of recession, its insolvency and consultancy arm has grown and now contributes 30 to 40 per cent of the bread-and-butter income. As well as this 'hand-holding' service for companies in trouble, it has extended its activities to risk investigation on behalf of banks and corporate investors. Other activities include offshore services, financial services, a training company and a computer training division. Levy Gee practised what it preached in the acquisition of a new accounting system, investigating its risks and assessing its functions. But it is the wider environment in which Levy Gee has embedded its accounting which makes it unusual. At the time of choosing its accounting software, the firm was also ready to upgrade its hardware. While many firms were buying systems (usually the Unix multi-user standard) with a central processor supporting a number of terminals, Levy Gee decided on a PC-based local area network (Lan), linking its partners in the UK and abroad. This was to prove more flexible and expandable, because extra PCs could be tagged on to the system without having a significant upgrade. It does, however, need expert management. The IT operation is run with six people, supporting six offices linked by high-quality ISDN (integrated services digital network) telephone lines. Levy Gee's structure was also a factor in choosing an accounts package. Each partner runs a separate 'department', typically of 20 people or so, and is responsible for the billing and profits of the business. 'Each partner has his own fee ledger and manages the costs against it,' explains Jonathon Teller, the partner responsible for information technology and finance. From the moment of recording the time worked to the putting out of an invoice, nothing goes on to paper. Clients get a breakdown of where time and costs are incurred. Time is billed in six-minute units and partners can inspect every detail of each itemised invoice. The work-in-progress system, written as a companion to time billing, enables Teller's department to see exactly how much work-in-progress is unbilled. Unlike payables, receivables are managed centrally: 'It means you get a feel for the cash flow.' A monthly debtors list goes round to the partners. Bills still not sent out after 45 days are frowned upon, and only rarely would work still be unbilled after six months. Levy Gee used to rely on handwritten timesheets, like most other firms. Now part of the assessment of performance is how well a partner and his department keeps up with billing, says Mullinger. 'I think we were among the first to have a system in which every fee-earner input his own time into the system to raise his own billing.' The firm chose the components of its system by first assessing a shortlist of accounting packages which included Tetra, Systems Union, Pegasus, Multisoft and Sky. Flexibility and ease of use were important, with such a wide user base. But the firm says the main criterion was ease of data import and export, and it was on these grounds that the SunSystems package of integrated ledgers from Systems Union won the contract. Levy Gee became the first user of the Lan-based version of SunSystems, with the SQL version - which allows it to upgrade from the smallest PCs up to large computers without changing software. With SQL, the daily bank balance report that used to take 40 minutes now takes 40 seconds. The package is portable in that it can run on a variety of PCs. At Levy Gee, it integrates with the Microsoft Office word processing package, Excel spreadsheet, Forest and Trees executive information system (published by ESP of Maidenhead), and the in-house software built for time-recording and billing. The system operates on Lotus Notes - the communications framework integrating the voice mail system and all textual exchanges between users: forms, letters, E-Mail notes, extracts of accounts, even press cuttings. The company is working towards putting clients and other colleagues on to its own Lotus network. Lotus Notes is 'the ideal glue to connect the systems together', says Mark Iwaszko, technical director. It is clear that anyone joining Levy Gee who is not already familiar with computers must have a hard few weeks getting to grips with everything from Lotus Notes to the voice-messaging system. Notes has become the lingua franca of the company, used for everything from integrating data from the work-in-progress and accounting ledgers, to customising letters. Notes has provided a discussion platform for ideas and is used to co-ordinate everyday work, such as auditing (audit files are replicated on Notebook computers so that staff working from remote offices can keep in touch with managers, and use the central database for reference and case-history). It acts as a meeting-place for minds and US colleagues use it as 'a noticeboard' for clippings from the US information technology press. Leon Nahon, a senior partner, also often works at home. Logging on, he is faced with a simple menu offering work-in-progress, time recording, work schedule, electronic mail and voice-messaging. 'The first thing I do is run through the messages and delete what's unimportant, then I check my schedule and get on with it.' As Nahon points out, one of the problems of such a rich choice is that he will never know every function, despite extensive training programmes. 'I only send a fax every three weeks or so, and although I know I can do it from my screen, it's quicker for me to ask someone else to send it for me,' he admits. Training staff to use the equipment effectively was one of the hidden costs. The three switchboard staff, for example, have to be as comfortable with a PC as they are with the telephone and the voicemail system. They take incoming calls personally and only then offer the option of voicemail or computer messaging. Clients can choose to dial straight into the voicemail computer. Levy Gee says its investment of more than Pounds 1m in the IT infrastructure during the past three years has been more than offset by the returns in administrative and staff savings. However, Mullinger insists that cost is the least important aspect of the IT initiative. 'The systems make our staff more effective,' he says. 'But we didn't do it just to save on costs. We did it to prepare ourselves for the 21st century. Its real value has been in our competitive positioning.'</p>

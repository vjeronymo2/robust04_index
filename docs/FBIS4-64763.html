			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The topic everyone is discussing this morning is  the one which Francois Mitterrand has just relaunched concerning  nuclear testing. At the Elysee [office of the president]  yesterday the head of state in fact expressed great firmness  over the costs, reaffirming his opposition to any resumption of  nuclear testing. The statement has been well received by the  Left, but criticized by the Right. [passage omitted]    Without being totally opposed to the head of state, [Foreign  Minister] Alain Juppe is less convinced: the refusal to resume  testing threatens the entire nuclear deterrent system, the  foreign minister believes:    [Begin Juppe recording] We need a credible and adequate  deterrent force. It exists today; will it exist in 10 years'  time? We are not certain of that, because it has to be  modernized, and in order to modernize it many experts, in fact  most experts, consider that further nuclear testing will be  necessary, before computer simulation makes it possible for us  to do without it. The president of the Republic has taken up a  position. That is his right, no one contests his position as  head of the Armed Forces up until the end of his mandate. But  he cannot anticipate what his successor will do. It is for the  future president of the Republic in May 1995 to explain to the  French people what his concept of the matter is. [end recording]    That was Alain Juppe, who was the guest of Annette Ardisson  just now at 0820 on France-Inter.</p>

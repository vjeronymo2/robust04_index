			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges ahead in spite of uncertainty Equities closed marginally higher in thin trading in spite of the coalition government's withdrawal of its tax and fiscal stimulus plan, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Sentiment was encouraged, however, following assurances by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, that a new package would be formulated and announced next week. The Nikkei index closed up 126.61 at the day's peak of 20,301.43 after a low of 20,034.80 in the early afternoon. The index has risen 8 per cent over the week. The Topix index of all first section stocks edged up 2.07 to 1,614.80 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.32 to 1,336.39. Volume was 370m shares after Thursday's 540m as many investors remained absent because of the prolonged political haggling. Traders expect caution next week ahead of Mr Hosokawa's talks with Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, on Friday. However, they fear that a sell-off could be triggered if the government scaled down its income tax cut from Y6,000bn as originally announced. Advances led declines by 609 to 422. Speculative issues were higher on short-term trading by individuals. Hanwa, the steel trader, rose Y23 to Y705 and Mitsumi Electric gained Y30 to Y1,900. Honda Motor, which had declined recently following BMWs acquisition of Rover, recovered Y40 to Y1,570. Nissan Motor fell Y15 to Y840 on profit-taking. Many banks continued to fall on selling by corporate investors. Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y70 to Y3,130 and Sumitomo Bank Y30 to Y2,160. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 70.55 to 21,782.36 in volume of 133.1m shares. Roundup A round of profit-taking was seen in some Pacific Rim markets, trimming advances seen over previous sessions. HONG KONG rose sharply on institutional demand for blue chips. The Hang Seng index added 306.44, or 2.6 per cent, to 12,157.57, for a week's rise of 6.8 per cent. HSBC Holdings led the day's gains, up HKDollars 7 to HKDollars 131, while Hang Seng Bank leapt HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 80.00. Among gains elsewhere Jardine Matheson surged HKDollars 3.00 to HKDollars 81.50 and Swire Pacific HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 66.50. Turnover was HKDollars 10.5bn. MANILA advanced for the third consecutive session, reflecting renewed investor confidence after bombings and street protests over recent fuel price rises. The composite index rose 46.39 or 1.6 per cent to 2,965.38, a weekly rise of 1.2 per cent. Volume surged to 23.1bn shares from Thursday's 2.4bn. SEOUL saw renewed interest in banking shares which balanced a sell-off among blue chips. The composite index added 9.40 to 964.42, a week's rise of 4 per cent, while the banking sub-index rose 23.60 to 582.08. TAIWAN fell 1.7 per cent on profit-taking after four days of rises with the selling triggered by Thursday's news that the cabinet had approved the reimposition of a stock capital gains tax. The weighted index ended 105.75 lower at 6,256.33, off an intra-day low of 6,181, for a 4 per cent rise over the week. Turnover remained heavy at TDollars 100.97bn against Thursday's TDollars 122.86bn. AUSTRALIA ended down but off its lows on after a day of profit-taking and falls in futures and overseas markets. The All Ordinaries index closed 7.8 lower at 2,332.8, but was still 3.2 per cent higher on the week. NEW ZEALAND pulled back as profits were taken after the rises of the previous 10 sessions. But renewed demand at the lower prices enabled the NZSE-40 capital index to pick up from the day's low of 2400.12, to finish 26.4 easier at 2,413.24, for a 3.2 per cent rise on the week. KUALA LUMPUR was pushed lower by a 20 cent decline in Telekom Malaysia which closed at MDollars 20.50, leaving the composite index off 2.89 at 1,147.32. The market has gained 5 per cent this week. BOMBAY declined towards close on profit-taking in cash shares and squaring up of deals in the specified section ahead of the fixing of carry forward charges today.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vitaliy Makarchev] </F>   [Text] Kiev 25 May TASS -- The implementation by Ukraine of  the international agreement which obliges it to transfer its  nuclear weapons to Russia is a separate issue and must not be  connected with other problems, British Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd said.    During his talks with Ukrainian top officials Hurd said that  ten days ago EU [European Union] leaders discussed ways to  expand ties between Brussels and Kiev and ensure control over of  Ukraine's's part of the Soviet nuclear arsenal.    Despite attempts by some EU countries to interconnect these  two issues, the European Council decided not to condition the  signing of a comprehensive cooperation agreement with Ukraine on  the full withdrawal of nuclear weapons from its territory, Hurd  said. He also called Kiev to join as soon as possible the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.    Ukraine's participation in the treaty is very important not  because the European Union is suspicious of Ukraine, but because  it is much more concerned about the reaction to the current  state of affairs from the countries seeking to obtain nuclear  weapons, he said.    He said the EU believes the assurances received from  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and his government that the  agreement on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons will be strictly  observed. He emphasised that neither Britain nor the European  Union link the withdrawal of nuclear weapons with any of the  existing problem.    Hurd called on the Ukrainian Parliament to give guarantees  of  the implementation of the agreement. Parliament Chairman  Aleksandr Moroz assured Hurd that the lawmakers are strongly  against nuclear weapons in Ukraine.    The British foreign secretary noted that there is only one  way to solve the nuclear problem in Ukraine -- strictly observe  and implement the agreement on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons.</p>

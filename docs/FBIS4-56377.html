			<p>BFN     [Text] San Carlos de Bariloche (Argentina), 28 Apr (EFE) --  At its meeting today, the Indigenous Communities Advisory  Council [Consejo Asesor Indigena] (CAI) assembly warned that  4,000 Mapuche Indian families in southern Argentina are barely  able to eke out an existence.    The meeting was attended by indigenous people from the Rio  Negro and Neuquen Provinces in the Argentine Patagonian region.    The CAI issued a press release stating that "the prices of  products have not changed," adding that -- on the contrary --  "low prices continue to aggravate the situation of small- and  medium-size producers."    The CAI demands that the authorities order the immediate  implementation of a comprehensive Indian law and rejects  "attempts to divide the region, which merely seek to undermine  the historic decision by indigenous peoples to remain  politically united."    The CAI reaffirms the determination to struggle and resist  all plans "to evict us and to do everything possible to defend  the land that is our life."    They decided to strengthen the political unification of the  southern region "through coordinated movements, as a way to  defend our rights and the rights of all groups affected by  current economic policies."    They demand the implementation of the Southern Region  Development Organization "which must make every effort to plan  alternatives."    The document concludes: "The participation of the CAI in the  continental, indigenous, black, and popular movement places us  on the same footing as other Argentine and Latin American  organizations, on the same path of construction, and as part of  the same resistance."</p>

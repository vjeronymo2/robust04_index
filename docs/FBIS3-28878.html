			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 14 (KCNA) -- A NODONG SINMUN  analyst today condemns the unending arrests of patriotic  students in South Korea in the new year as a heinous challenge  to the patriotic force which calls for independence, democracy  and reunification.    Recalling that the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique recently  arrested Kim Yong-ha who was chairman of the committee for  national Reunification of the former "National Council of  Student Representatives (Chondaehyop)" and Ho Hon-chun, a  fourth-year student of Chonpuk National University who was  chairman of the South side's headquarters of the National  Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification  (Pomchonghaknyon) at the time of the first joint presidium  meeting of Pomchonghaknyon, the news analyst says:    The students thrown behind bars by the puppet clique have  done nothing guilty. It is, to all intents and purposes, a  praiseworthy patriotic deed for the students in the North and  the South and abroad who were born in a divided territory to  exchange greetings though by correspondence and on the phone and  vow to bring earlier the morning of national reunification.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however, did not cease to  arrest patriotic students in the new year, too. This tells that  they overshadow the preceding military fascist dictators in  suppressing the people stubbornly and maliciously.    Either the independence and democratization of South Korean  society or peace and Reunification of the country cannot be  realized while the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is left intact, a  group of traitors who are brandishing the fascist sword against  pro-reunification patriotic forces at home and are engaged in  confrontation and war rackets against the fellow countrymen  abroad.    The South Korean students and people who aspire after  independence, democracy and reunification will certainly bring  down a sledge hammer to bear upon the traitorous clique of Kim  Yong-sam, a dyed-in-the-wool fascist dictator, separatist and  warmaniac.</p>

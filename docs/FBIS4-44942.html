			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, April 25--The Supreme Court today  clarified that the Chief Election Commissioner, Mr T.N. Seshan,  could take action for alleged breach of the code of conduct  after the issuance of the by-election notification...    A Division Bench comprising Mr Justice J.S. Verma and Mr  Justice S.P. Bharucha, said:     -  The court made it clear that its interim order of April 4,  1994, was made and intended to operate only till the time of  issuance of the statutory notification.    -  As such notification was  expected shortly, the CEC had sought modification of the April 4  order.    -  From the submission of the CEC, it seems that it was  merely for the clarification of the said order.    -  The only dispute  raised by the writ petition of the Andhra Government was  regarding the enforceability of the Model Code of Conduct prior  to the issue of the poll notification under the RPA which  commenced with the election process.    -  The petition also pertained  to the question whether the code had legal sanction in case of a  breach, of the code prior to the issue of the statutory  notification calling for the by-elections 31 days from the  actual poll date.    -  The petition by the Andhra Pradesh Government  did not raise the dispute regarding the desirability and  enforceability of the model code from the time of issuance of  the poll notification.     That order had come on a petition by the Andhra Pradesh  Government seeking a restraint on the CEC from stopping the  State from going ahead with certain schemes in the Kurnool Lok  Sabha seat, where by-elections are due next month, with effect  from the date of announcement of the poll instead of the  notification date.</p>

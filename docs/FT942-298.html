			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (14): In Plato's footsteps - Technopols / The question of whether political systems govern economic success is a sticky one The Political Economy of Policy Reform Edited by John Williamson Institute of International Economics Pounds 9.99 93 pages What conditions are needed for a government to implement economic reform successfully? The knee-jerk response to this is to drum up an image of an authoritarian government taking power during an economic crisis, acting quickly and using all the means at its disposal, including violence, to silence any opposition to the policies it knows it must rigorously pursue despite all the short-term costs. Does that answer the question? Partly. Those conditions - which more or less describe Pinochet's Chile, for example - might be sufficient for a government to implement reforms, but they are not necessary. At least that is the sensible conclusion of John Williamson's book from the Institute for International Economics. Williamson doesn't bring us much closer to knowing what is both sufficient and necessary. But that says less about the quality of his book than the slipperiness of the subject. The book, which has grown out of a conference held last year on these issues, draws together 13 essays by a group of authors that Williamson calls 'technopols' - policy-makers who start off life as technically skilled functionaries (armed almost always with an economics PhD from a US university?), unconnected to any vested interests, whose only political commitment is to their vision of the common good. On this definition, they are probably the nearest substitute the modern world has for Plato's philosopher-kings. Eleven of the 13 give accounts of successful episodes of economic reform, and two - Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira, Brazil's finance minister in 1987, and Richard Webb, Peru's central bank governor in the early 1980s - try to say why they could not make reforms stick. These essays have a tendency to dissolve into acts of self-justification, and some of them could have had a bit less 'pol' and a bit more 'techno'. In one essay, for example, Jose Pinera, who was at different times Pinochet's minister for labour and for social security, fails to mention his government's suppression of dissent, and thus creates a loud silence which mars an otherwise interesting piece. Readers looking for a user's guide for policy-makers will find this book disappointing. Every time you think you have come across the political sine qua non of economic reform, a counter-example pops up to frustrate you. You might start off thinking, for example, that authoritarian regimes headed by visionary leaders must have an advantage over democratic ones, only to discover that plenty of democratic governments - Portugal in 1985, Colombia in 1989, Poland in 1990 - have implemented successful reform packages, and plenty of authoritarian ones have not. The book tries to test a number of hypotheses like this. Are a government's chances of success better in the midst of an economic crisis? Or in the 'honeymoon' period at the start of an administration? Commonsense suggests that they must be, since a crisis creates the sort of shock needed to wear down resistance to change, and a 'honeymoon' hands the benefit of the doubt to a new regime. But honeymoons and crises are not always ingredients of successful reforms, as you learn by bearing in mind that Colombia's 1989 reforms were begun just a few months before the end of President Barco'sadministration in an atmosphere of relative calm. Perhaps the biggest drawback of the book is that apples in one country are too frequently compared with pears in another. Arguably it just doesn't make sense to compare Colombia's reforms in 1989, for example, to Poland's in 1990, since completely different goals were being pursued. In Poland, the aim was a fundamental re-ordering of society, against which Colombia's reforms appear to have been mere tinkering. Naturally, the political conditions that made each reform possible were different, since the type of reform being implemented was different. A more complete book would have resulted if some attention had been paid to this. Only one condition stands out as being a feature of every successful reform episode the book describes: the presence of a united and coherent economic team in charge of designing the reform programme. What lessons come from this? Should we, after all, hand over our destinies to the technopols? At least Plato would approve.</p>

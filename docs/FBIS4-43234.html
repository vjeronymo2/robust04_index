			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Terrorist Friends on the Rhine"] </F>   [Text] A militant support group of the terrorist Red Army  Faction (RAF) is active in the greater Duesseldorf area.  Experts from the Office for the Protection of the Constitution  are proceeding on this assumption after analyzing the bomb  attack on the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] district office  in Duesseldorf on 5 June and the letter claiming responsibility  for it.    Among the accomplices of the circle of the RAF auxiliary  troop are reportedly people who reported on the territory around  the Duesseldorf house of Trust Agency chief Detlev Karsten  Rohwedder, who was murdered in 1991. The security authorities  are convinced that there is an international aspect to the  attack on the CDU office: The "militant leftist autonomous  group" (that is, according to the letter claiming responsibility  for the attack) apparently wanted to demonstrate to foreign  groups that someone is putting up resistance to an imperialist  policy in the Third World. According to the analysis, the CDU,  as a government party, will continue to be threatened by attacks  on a "decentralist basis."</p>

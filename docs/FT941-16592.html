			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Arts: Arts Council off the hook - Off the Wall A month ago the Arts Council seemed to be one British institution going rapidly down the plug hole. I now confidently forecast a future for the Council of serene stability: its crisis is over. This is only partly because of the arrival in April of a tough new chairman, Lord Gowrie, who knows his way around politics and would not have taken on the job without certain guarantees. The main reason for feeling sanguine is that the Council now has few opportunities to beat itself up. It is a small irony that, during a Conservative government, the Arts Council has become excessively dirigiste. The most obvious example is the four London orchestras. Instead of letting market forces decide which should prosper, the Council tried to impose a solution, with the well known baleful results. But also in modern dance, the regional theatre, and the visual arts the Council has attempted to know better than the consumer. Now, with the one exception of a joint review, with the BBC, into the regional orchestras, the Council plans few major initiatives that seem certain to explode in its face. An era of indolence goes hand in hand with the hope that the organisational turmoil in the arts, and the Arts Council, is over. In a few weeks the Council will announce around 30 redundancies as it cuts Pounds 600,000 from its administrative costs as part of an efficiency drive forced on it by Peter Brooke, the heritage minister. After that the Council is supposed to be in perfect shape. It is the same with the Regional Arts Boards. On April 1 they take on more, and bigger, clients devolved from the Arts Council, and the new grass roots structure of the arts in England finally falls into place. Only a lunatic would suggest another major review or strategy document on the arts. There is one other factor which should give the Council confidence. While Peter Brooke protected the rest of his empire in the November Budget he cut the grant to the Arts Council by Pounds 3.2m, the first ever reduction in its revenue. But this was only politics. The Treasury felt that the Council had been over-generously endowed by David Mellor. The cut was a small slap on the wrist to put the Council in its place. Next autumn, when the 1995-96 grants are announced, the Council can anticipate a reasonable rise in revenue. If things look brighter for the Council it is far from certain that its secretary-general, Anthony Everitt, will have his contract renewed at year's end. When Lord Palumbo arrived as chairman, with a blueprint for devolution and a slimmed down Council, it so appalled the then secretary-general, Luke Rittner, that he resigned. His deputy, Everitt, went along with Palumbo and stepped up to the top job. Rittner is close to Lord Gowrie. Indeed when Gowrie was chairman at Sotheby's he brought in Rittner to head the marketing team. Old scores could be settled. Apart from a love of the arts Lord Gowrie was keen to chair the Arts Council because in a year's time it becomes a much bigger challenge. The Council will distribute Lottery money to the arts which will transform the cultural scene in the UK. The first trickle of the gold rush might emerge in January 1995. Ministers originally played down the size of the cash flow. Of course it depends upon the betting instincts of the British, but early estimates of Pounds 70m a year for the arts (with the same amounts going to heritage, sport, charities and the Millennium Fund) look over-cautious. Now the whisper is that the arts could eventually be Pounds 200m a year better off. The money is intended to go on capital projects - a better heating system for the National Theatre, for example, or improved dressing rooms at Covent Garden - rather than boosting annual subsidy, but improved facilities can have a direct effect in bringing down running costs and increasing box office revenue. For one object of national importance it looks as if the Lottery has already arrived as saviour. The Three Graces, the classical sculpture Canova made for the Duke of Bedford in the early 19th century, was bought by the Getty Museum of Malibu, California, for Pounds 7.9m. But an export licence has been refused. Last month Peter Brooke announced that he was consulting the museums and the art market as to whether, in exceptional circumstances, an export block should not last for 18 months instead of the more typical three months. If the soundings support the idea, then the Three Graces will still be in the UK in the spring of 1995. The V&amp;A can launch another appeal to acquire it and the government gain general kudos when, thanks to Lottery money, it stays in the UK. The Lottery seems so wonderful that it is bound to be a disappointment. Apart from a mad scramble by applicants for its largesse, one worrying aspect has emerged. The Millennium Fund was supposed to leave the nation with a legacy of great cultural monuments for the 21st century - a Welsh Opera House in Cardiff; a National Gallery of Scottish Art; a Tate Gallery of Modern Art; a revamped Royal Opera House, etc. But now it seems that the money can also be spent on general building projects, like an Embankment Underpass from Westminster to the City. Such an undertaking might make life in the capital sweeter, but it hardly counts as a heritage gain.</p>

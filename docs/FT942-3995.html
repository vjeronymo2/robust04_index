			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Motoring: Seat Cordoba The new Seat Cordoba (above) - a booted, four-door saloon version of the Toledo hatchback - is in British showrooms now at fiercely competitive prices. It starts at Pounds 9,095 for the 1.6 CLX (pictured) and goes up to Pounds 12,595 for the 2.0 GT E, which has anti-lock brakes and electronic traction control. Other models are a 1.8-litre GLX (Pounds 10,895), 2.0 GT (Pounds 11,995), and two diesels: the 1.9 D CLX (Pounds 9,395) and the 1.9 turbo-diesel GLX (Pounds 11,195). Every Cordoba has power steering, a glass tilt/slide sun-roof, 60:40 split rear seat, six-speaker RDS radio, and tinted glass all round. A driver-side air bag is a Pounds 350 optional extra. The boot is enormous: a little bigger even than that of a Ford Granada and much larger than a Bentley Turbo R. Its volume is 16.1 cubic feet (456 litres) with seats up, extending to 27 cu ft (765 litres) when seats are folded forward. Seat is owned by Volkswagen and the Cordoba's engines, five-speed gearboxes, and many of the other mechanical components under its Spanish-styled body are what you would find in VW Golfs. In length (13 feet 6 inches/4.109 metres), it falls between the Golf hatchback (13ft 2in/4.02m) and its saloon version, the Vento (14ft 4in/4.38m). The Cordoba passed all Volkswagen's safety tests, most of which are carried out at higher speeds than the 30mph (50kph) demanded by EU regulations. Clearly, the British insurance industry was impressed, because its ratings (from group seven for 1.6 CLX and 1.9 D CLX to group 11 for the 2.0 GT) are below those of its competitors. Average fuel consumptions should range from about 46 miles per gallon (6.14 l/100 km) for the turbo-diesel to 35mpg (8.07 l/100 km) for the 2.0 GT. Seat's value for money has been recognised by the Automobile Association. It now runs a fleet of 130 Toledos, most of them diesels or turbo-diesels.</p>

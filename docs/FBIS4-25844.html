			<p>BFN     [Text] Changchun, June 15 (XINHUA) -- About a quarter of  the income of farmers in northeast China's Jilin Province comes  from growing special local products, according to a report from  the provincial trade department.    The province's specialities industry earned a total of 3.83  billion yuan last year, some 25 percent of the total output  value of its farming sector.    Jilin has a good climate for growing some 20 special  products, including ginseng, mushrooms, flowers, fruits,  vegetables, frogs, silk and herbs.    Over the past few years, it has built 1,207 frog-raising  centers, with a total output of 680 million frogs worth 300  million yuan. The areas for growing fruit trees, ginseng and  flowers have doubled or tripled.    Some four major growing projects, including fruit trees and  vegetables, have earned three billion yuan.    About 1.3 million households in the province have developed  the "courtyard economy", under which farmers make money by  selling special products they grow in their courtyards or  gardens.    This added 1.1 billion yuan to the farmers' pockets.    In Tonghua City, a ginseng home, as it is called by many,  the  cash crop planting area last year reached 40,000 hectares, with  the output value totalling 2.4 billion yuan. The income of  150,000 farmer households increased by 600 yuan.    Farmers in Fusong County also exported a wild herb to  countries such as Japan, raising their per capita income by 100  yuan last year.</p>

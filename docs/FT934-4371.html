			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreigners take driving seat in Stockholm - Christopher Brown-Humes says the market has hit a rocky patch after its earlier surge A market registering a 50 per cent gain this year was always likely to hit a rocky patch, so there should be little surprise at what has happened in Sweden during the last month. Shares have fallen by 6 per cent with daily trading showing considerable volatility, although the Affarsvarlden index picked up 3.5 yesterday to 1,345.5. For many observers this is an overdue consolidation, after a year of steadily rising share prices. Others believe it could be a sign of a more fundamental weakening which could last well into next year. The turbulence indicates that Stockholm will have to get used to greater volatility, now that the proportion of shares held by foreign owners has risen to around 25 per cent, from just 10 per cent at the end of 1991. As many Swedish institutions are long term holders, selling and buying of Swedish shares by foreigners has become a key to whether prices rise or fall. The weight of foreign buying and the fall in interest rates are the main factors to have driven equity prices higher this year. In the first 10 months foreigners were net buyers of SKr28.2bn (Dollars 3.3bn) worth of Swedish shares and they accounted for 28 per cent of the trading volume in Stockholm. In the same 1992 period, foreign net buying amounted to just SKr9.4bn and the foreign element of turnover was 18.5 per cent. Clear evidence that foreigners are now steering the price of Swedish shares to a much greater extent came several weeks ago, after a collapse in the price of Ericsson, the telecommunications group. The fall was triggered by heavy selling in New York, when it emerged that full-year profits would not reach the dizzy heights expected by some analysts. Since then, Ericsson, which accounts for some 10 per cent of the stock exchange value, has seen its shares fall by 15 per cent to SKr355 at yesterday's close. According to Mr Leif Vindevag, head of research at the Stockholm exchange: 'Ericsson was the trigger for a broader reappraisal of the Swedish market, where many felt that prices had risen too much.' However, the market's turbulent performance also reflects broader international concerns, particularly the outlook for US interest rates, as well as specifically domestic issues such as Volvo's controversial plans to merge its car and truck operations with Renault. Volvo's shares rose by a cumulative 17.1 per cent over the last three trading days as opposition to the merger grew and institutional investors began to throw their weight against it. The shares, traded as ADRs in the US, surged by 11.9 per cent in early trading last night in immediate reaction to news that Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar and four other board members had quit, and that the merger was off, before slipping back to finish the session a net Dollars 2 7/8 higher at Dollars 55 3/8 . But in the broad shake-out afflicting Swedish stocks, the engineering sector has fallen by 11 per cent, forestry by 3 per cent, pharmaceuticals by 7 per cent and the banks and insurance sector by 8 per cent. A number of factors suggest the downturn may be short-lived. They include the likelihood that short-term interest rates will continue to fall, and the prospects for much improved profitability among the big exporters during 1994. Domestic buyers at least should be in plentiful supply as a result of changes to individual pensions legislation and reforms which will halve the capital gains tax on equities and scrap taxes on dividends from Swedish companies for domestic residents from January. Analysts, however, are divided over where the market is heading. Mr Joe Rooney, European equity strategist at Lehman Brothers in London, expects the market to pick up momentum again, against a background of a continuing fall in short-term interest rates and a likely strengthening of the krona. But Mr Richard Davidson, European equity strategist at Morgan Stanley in London, is bearish. He cites political worries linked to next year's election, which may well see the return of a Social Democrat government, and concern over the size of the country's borrowing requirement, which is close to 16 per cent of GNP. Mr Davidson also believes the market is overvalued on fundamentals. He predicts a further 10 per cent drop in the market over the next three months and a flat performance over the coming year.</p>

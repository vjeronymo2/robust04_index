			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / BNF aims at big rise in overseas business British Nuclear Fuels, the state-owned fuels reprocessing company, yesterday announced plans to increase significantly its overseas business as it published financial results which suggest it can double profits to more than Pounds 160m this year. Mr John Guinness, chairman, said he expected overseas contracts to rise from 20 per cent of the Pounds 1.13bn turnover in 1993-94 to about 30 per cent of this financial year's increased sales. The proportion will rise further as the recently opened Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (Thorp) gets into full swing. By the end of the century the company expects it to be nearer 40 per cent. 'By 2010 the worldwide nuclear services market is likely to be worth over Dollars 35bn a year,' Mr Guinness said. Contracts won recently, including one for Dollars 45m (Pounds 29m) to help reprocess spent plutonium in the US, suggested BNF could win a sizeable market slice. In the year to March 31 BNF lifted pre-tax profits by Pounds 5m to Pounds 81m on turnover up 8 per cent at Pounds 1.13bn. It said profits would have been Pounds 78m higher had it not been for regulatory delays in starting Thorp. The dividend to the government, BNF's shareholder, was Pounds 26m. As in the previous annual report, Ernst &amp; Young, BNF's auditors, said the figures were subject to a fundamental uncertainty because of continuing negotiations by the company on contracts with Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear. The negotiations result from the government's refusal to underwrite earlier agreed contracts. Mr Guinness said revised contracts were with the government. He hoped the matter would be resolved in the government's present review of the nuclear industry. BNF has cut staff from 17,000 eight years ago to about 14,000. It expects to employ about 12,000 at the end of the decade. By April the company expects to have achieved the target set in 1988 of improving productivity by 40 per cent. BNF is raising the basic pay of its directors by 2 per cent this year after a freeze last year. However performance-related bonuses meant there were substantial rises last year, with the total emoluments of Mr Neville Chamberlain, chief executive and the highest-paid director, rising to Pounds 216,000 from Pounds 169,000. He received no bonus in 1992-93 but Pounds 39,000 last year. BNF's drive abroad has worried environmentalists who argue it could increase the amount of plutonium in transit. BNF yesterday argued that it and other reprocessing companies could help to reduce the terrorism threat from plutonium. Mr Guinness suggested western countries should buy Russian plutonium to turn into mixed oxide fuel which can then be used in reactors. BNF last year completed commissioning a mixed oxide demonstration facility at Sellafield, Cumbria. The first fuel from the facility was deliv-ered to a Swiss customer in June. Work on a full-scale mixed oxide plant should be completed by the end of the decade and the company hopes to win orders for it from countries including Japan. Environmentalists see BNF's arguments as self-serving, and point out that its other reprocessing facilities increase plutonium stockpiles.</p>

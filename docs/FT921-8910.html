			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Theft of computer data reported THE PRISON Officers Association suggested yesterday that four thefts of sensitive computer information from its north London headquarters fitted the pattern of break-ins suffered by the three main political parties. The union said it believed the thefts, which started last August, could not be dismissed as coincidence. Stolen information included details of staff arrangements at prisons in Northern Ireland and at Brixton in south London, procedures for handling top security prisoners, and addresses of those sympathetic to the union, including MPs. Mr John Bartell, the union's chairman, has written to Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, drawing his attention to the burglaries and the 'lack of police coverage' which made further incidents 'a distinct possibility'. Mr Barry Sheerman, a Labour home affairs spokesman, has tabled three Commons questions to the home secretary urging an inquiry into the thefts. 'The thefts coincide with an extraordinary series of attacks on the POA including the forthcoming opening of Britain's first private prison,' said Mr Sheerman. Mr David Evans, the association's general secretary, suffered a burglary at his home in August. Family memorabilia were stolen, but the association said it viewed the break-in as suspicious. The disclosures follow revelations that MPs have suffered a spate of thefts, some apparently aimed at sensitive computer information. Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, was forced to make a public statement about his private life after the theft of a confidential document from his solicitor. The 37-strong ruling general executive council of the TGWU general union has moved slightly further to the left after the latest elections. The left-right balance is now thought to be 23-14. Two of the territorial seats have been abolished, taking out a right-winger in the northern region and the leftwing dockers' leader Mr Walter Greendale from the Hull area.</p>

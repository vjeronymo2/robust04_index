			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Sarajevo airlift suspension stays: Resumption of relief flights must await assurances on security THE UN yesterday said the suspension of humanitarian airlifts into Sarajevo would continue. The announcement coincided with a fact-finding mission by international mediators Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen to Banja Luka, the Serb stronghold in northern Bosnia, amid escalating violence and reports of ethnic cleansing. In Geneva, UN aid officials said the airlift into Sarajevo could not restart because governments believe conditions are too dangerous. The suspension is preventing delivery of essential supplies and materials needed to avert what officials fear may be thousands of deaths from hunger and cold during the freezing winter months. The 19 governments previously involved in the airlift say they want further assurances on security from the warring factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina before agreeing to resume relief flights. The flights to the Bosnian capital were halted on September 3 after a missile shot down an Italian aircraft. Mr Vance and Lord Owen travelled southeast from Zagreb, the Croatian capital, to the Bosnian border and drove with Mr Radovan Karadzic, the militant Bosnian Serb leader, to Banja Luka, 38 miles south. The two men held private talks with local Moslem and Croat leaders. Their visit followed allegations of a Serb massacre on August 21 of 200 Moslem men and youths. Lord Owen, the European Community envoy, told reporters: 'We want to find out what indeed happened.' The reports said Serb police shot dead the Moslems near Travnik, 90 miles south of Banja Luka, after they had been released from a detention camp. During their brief visit to Banja Luka, run by some of the most militant Serb nationalists, the mediators also met a Serb general and Mr Jovo Kupresanin, the extremist mayor who is believed to have been involved in reprisals against Moslems and Serbs opposed to his rule. The mission was prompted by mounting concern over a spate of recent bomb attacks and shoot-outs in the city and surrounding villages. Croats and Moslems make up about 30 per cent of the area's population of 195,000. Meanwhile, Belgrade radio reported fighting between Serb forces and mainly Moslem Bosnians in Sarajevo and throughout much of Bosnia. Leaders of the three Bosnian communities signed undertakings a week ago designed to assure the safety of relief flights and convoys, but they have not been acted on. The airport at Sarajevo remains a battle zone. Ms Sylvana Foa, for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said the future of the airlift was still 'very much in doubt'. However, while recognising the dangers to aircraft and crews, there was an urgent need to deliver supplies to the 450,000 people trapped in Sarajevo. Ms Foa said aid agencies had a maximum of six weeks to transport heavy materials, such as plastic sheeting for shattered windows, to Sarajevo before winter set in. The extra 6,000 UN troops approved by the UN Security Council are not due to arrive in the region for up to eight weeks. Ms Foa said UNHCR convoys travelling on mountain roads from the Croatian port of Split were supplying less than a quarter of Sarajevo's daily food needs of 200 tonnes.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon tumbles to Pounds 61m RECESSION IN the UK and the continuing weakness of the US insurance market again depressed profit growth at Willis Corroon. The UK's largest insurance broker yesterday reported a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 89m to Pounds 60.9m for the nine months to September 30 1992. Turnover from broking activities rose marginally to Pounds 460.3m (Pounds 457.9m), with growth in new business offset by a decline in premium rates in the US and the UK downturn. Income from the underwriting subsidiaries fell to Pounds 36m (Pounds 46.9m), while interest and investment income fell to Pounds 39.8m (Pounds 52m). Losses from Hurricane Andrew, which caused widespread damage in parts of Florida and Louisiana in August, could lead to increases in US premium rates. Mr Roger Elliott, executive chairman, was cautious about prospects. He said that 'for the moment rates remain depressed and, coupled with the normal seasonal pattern of our business, mean that in the last quarter of this year we are likely at best to break even.' Expenses rose to Pounds 419.1m (Pounds 388.5m), but only by 3 per cent on an underlying basis, largely reflecting the cost of new start-up operations in Europe and North America. Mr Elliott said the figures for brokerage left out earnings from many of these new acquisitions in the last 18 months. 'These are generating business for the group, revenues from which will appear increasingly in our results from 1992 and beyond,' he added. Claims from underwriting activities fell to Pounds 16.8m (Pounds 28.4m). Associated undertakings produced profits of Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 4.2m), while interest payable rose to Pounds 4m (Pounds 3.1m).</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ethyl analyzed the data collected using EPA's previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used statistical tests (43 FR 41424, September 18, 1978) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional tests developed by its consultants to further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterize the data. Its analysis indicated that, on average,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MMT at the requested concentration would result in a 0.018 gpm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in HC emissions and decreases in NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and CO emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The analyses further indicated that, when EPA's previously used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests are applied, the increase in HC emissions would not cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or contribute to vehicles' failure to meet the current HC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standard. The results of Ethyl's testing for materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compatibility, driveability and catalyst durability also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that MMT would have no significant adverse effects on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles' ability to meet current emission standards under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average driving conditions. On that basis, Ethyl claimed that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had made its statutorily required showing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl also submitted data on the catalyst efficiency of the vehicles which it tested. Ethyl performed back-pressure tests <FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>  on all its vehicle fleet except one model group after accumulation of 75,000 miles. Back-pressure tests were also performed on a pair of Ford Crown Victorias, one operated on MMT-fuel and one on clear fuel, at speeds higher than those used in Ethyl's 48-vehicle test program. <FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>  The results of these tests indicated that back-pressure was not significantly different in the MMT vehicles when compared to the clear fuel vehicles. Ethyl also operated two 5.7 liter Corvettes at extremely high speeds (100 mph) for 25,000 miles, one using MMT fuel and one using clear fuel. Although similar in magnitude, the back pressure for the MMT vehicle was slightly higher than that for the clear vehicle. Ethyl also presented catalyst efficiency <FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>  data based on engine-out emissions of its fleet and based on ``slave engine'' testing <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  for half of its fleet. Results of the slave engine testing indicated no statistically significant difference between the catalyst efficiencies for the MMT vehicle components when compared with the clear vehicle components. Finally, four Chevrolet Corsicas were operated to 100,000 miles, two utilizing MMT fuel and two with clear fuel. The purpose of this testing was to investigate MMT's effect on the catalyst for a longer mileage interval than the 75,000 miles over which most of Ethyl's fleet had been driven. Catalyst efficiencies of the MMT vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were not significantly different when compared to the clear fuel vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Back pressure tests are used to determine if significant plugging has occurred in a vehicle's catalyst. The total pressure ahead of the catalyst is back pressure. This pressure is a measure of constriction in flow through the exhaust system caused by flow of the exhaust through the emissions control system and the noise-reducing components of the vehicle. If plugging has occurred in a vehicle, the total pressure ahead of its catalyst, the back pressure, should be greater than expected (e.g., greater than a matching control vehicle). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In this program the maximum speed was 65 mph for the first 25,000 miles and 80 mph for an additional 10,000 miles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Catalyst efficiency is a measure of what fraction of the emissions entering the catalyst are actually removed (or catalyzed) by the catalyst. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Slave engine'' testing is the testing of vehicle components on a single engine which is not in a vehicle. In this case, catalyst efficiencies between control and MMT vehicles were investigated using exhaust gases from this single engine which were routed through the removed catalysts. This would likely result in a more accurate analysis of catalyst efficiency, since one possible confounding factor, vehicle to vehicle variability, would be eliminated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ford presented original test data which Ford said supported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its contention that actual in-use MMT-induced HC emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases are potentially far greater than those reported by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl. <FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>  Ford conducted testing on a more limited scale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilizing eight vehicles, representing two model groups, run for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 105,000 miles. Ford chose two model groups which were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative of its newest technology vehicles at the time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One (the Explorer) represented a technology that Ford believed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be especially prone to exhibit a buildup of manganese, due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly higher operating temperatures and loads than those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of passenger cars. The other model group, the Escorts, had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> close-coupled catalysts, a design which is being incorporated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into many new vehicles in order to meet tighter emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. Like Ethyl, Ford operated part of its test fleet on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clear fuel and part on fuel containing 1/32 gpg MMT. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford's test program differed from Ethyl's program in several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ways. When accumulating mileage, Ford utilized a commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline which contained all of the additives (detergents, etc.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> typically found in such fuels. Ethyl utilized a very high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality test fuel with tight specifications and no additives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Although used for actual emissions testing purposes, Ethyl's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel would not be allowed for mileage accumulation when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifying vehicles since it is not representative of in-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel.) When accumulating mileage, Ford utilized what it called  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its ``durability cycle'' which it had previously developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compared to the AMA cycle used by Ethyl, Ford's driving cycle had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a higher average speed (54 miles per hour (mph) versus 30 mph),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and a higher percentage of high speed driving. <FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>  (As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously mentioned, Ethyl utilized the AMA cycle used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification purposes.) Additionally, in the Ford program,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles were tested for emissions at five mileage intervals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5,000, 20,000, 55,000, 85,000 <FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>  and 105,000 miles) and six  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions tests were done at each testing interval. Ethyl, by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparison, conducted testing every 5,000 miles to 75,000 miles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (15 intervals) and utilized two emissions tests at each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interval. <FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>  Ford's test vehicles showed an elevation of HC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions with MMT that was substantially greater than the 0.018  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gpm reported by Ethyl from its test program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's emissions testing lab and Ford's lab routinely undergo correlation testing and the data indicate that correlation is good between the labs. (See memorandum, with attached data, from Martin E. Reineman, EPA Manager of Correlation and Engineering Services, Office of Mobile Sources, January 3, 1992, Docket A&hyph;91&hyph;46.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Ford indicated that drivers who accumulated mileage in its test program were asked to follow posted speed limits. Ford indicated that the cycle consisted of 5% city driving (25 to 45 mph), 5% gravel or off road driving (25 to 45 mph), 20% rural driving (45 to 55 mph), and 70% highway driving (65 mph). Posted speed limits are shown in parentheses. By way of comparison, the AMA cycle consists of 16.1% of driving at 30 mph, 22.6 at 35 mph, 20.9 at 40 mph, 6.4 at 45 mph, 17% at variable speed and one of the three following options: 16.7% at 50 mph or 16.5% at 55 mph or 8.6% and 7.9% at 55 mph and 70 mph, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In fact, only two of the four Escorts were tested at 85,000 miles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Although Ethyl conducted additional emissions tests at some mileage intervals when the initial two tests showed high variation, these additional tests were not used in Ethyl's analysis of its data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

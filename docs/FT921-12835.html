			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading SPECULATION of a massive stake sale and continuing apprehension over the direction of Wall Street preoccupied the derivatives markets yesterday, writes Peter John. On the Liffe, the March contract in the Footsie futures opened at a healthy 36-point premium to the underlying equity market and up on the previous day's close in response to a stronger market in New York. The contract continued firm and reached 2,574 at one stage. However, the rise was overdone and the equities showed no inclination to follow. Then a strong rumour swept through the markets that Lord Hanson was about to place the 2.82 per cent stake he acquired in ICI back in May. This dual pressure pushed March back to a mere 26-point premium to cash, not far ahead of its estimated fair value of 22. As afternoon trading began there was a general assumption that Wall Street would open easier and March fell to 2,543. However, a late, and decent-sized buy order, helped the March contract to close at 2,557 with 6,600 contracts traded. In LTOM, turnover of 26,495 was comfortably above the previous day's, with BAe, said to be a bid candidate, topping the list of stock option traders.</p>

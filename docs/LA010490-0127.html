			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-MEDICARE CHIEF TO HEAD DISEASE CENTERS  </P> <P> William Roper, a White House adviser and former director of the Medicare and  Medicaid programs, was named Wednesday to head the Centers for Disease Control.  </P> <P> Roper, 41, on March 1 will take over a federal agency with 5,000 employees and  an annual budget of $1.1 billion, including $450 million for AIDS-related work.  </P> <P> The CDC has headquarters in Atlanta.  </P> <P> The American Medical Assn. hailed the selection of Roper for the post, but some  AIDS activists said they knew little about his views on AIDS issues.  </P> <P> "He's sort of an AIDS unknown," said Robert Bray of the National Gay and  Lesbian Task Force.  </P> <P> In addition to tracking AIDS, the CDC is responsible for investigating and  containing other infectious diseases and for finding ways to reduce mortality  and occupational injuries.  </P> <P> Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of health and human services, announced the  selection of Roper and noted the CDC's "leading role" in fighting acquired  immune deficiency syndrome.  </P> <P> Roper will replace Dr. James O. Mason, who left last year to become assistant  secretary for health.  </P></p>

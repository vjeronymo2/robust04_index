			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Business and the Environment: Hotels check out green credentials Hotel groups around the world are getting together to promote good environmental practice by committing more than 1m rooms to an environmental campaign. The scheme will be launched this summer by the Prince of Wales Business Leaders' Forum, a network of international company chairmen and chief executives supporting the concepts of good corporate citizenship and sustainable development. Hilton International, Inter-Continental Hotels, Marriott, Meridien, Ramada and Sheraton are among the groups due to sign an environmental charter for the industry, covering areas such as waste management, product purchasing, air quality, energy conservation and noise pollution. The initiative stems from the work of the Inter-Continental Hotels group, which last year developed a comprehensive reference manual incorporating the environmental practices implemented by its 101 hotels. The manual was made available to the group's main competitors and relevant industry organisations, and now, through a link with the Business Leaders Forum, is being promoted as an international industry-wide handbook. John van Praag, chief executive of Inter-Continental, said implementing environmental measures did involve a financial commitment up front, but this would be recouped longer-term through reduced operating costs. However, environmental responsibility was not being pursued for economic reasons, he said. 'The only business reason that could motivate change is if hotels feel their clientele will stay with them because they are visibly conscious of their effect on the environment.' Shareholders were also increasingly demanding environmentally-responsible practices. Inter-Continental's environmental policy is that the group 'recognises its moral and ethical responsibilities as a global citizen in protecting the environment for this and future generations'. Inter-Continental devotes one half-page of its hotel room brochure to tell clients of its environmental measures. They include re-using and saving water in the hotel laundries (a laundry at a 500-room hotel at 80 per cent occupancy uses about 20m litres of water a year); energy conservation through insulation, improved design and appliance efficiency; auditing products and services purchased for their environmental impact; re-using and recycling products to reduce waste, for example tearing up worn linen for cleaning cloths and dusters. Employee training and commitment is seen as crucial - as is keeping staff informed of environmental achievements. The Inter-Continental group operates a bonus system for employees based on a hotel's environmental rating. Its hotels are subjected to quarterly appraisals and each receives a grade - taking into account such things as the availability of recycling outlets in developing countries. The hotel's environmental reference manual explains in detail such subjects as air emissions, asbestos, CFCs and global warming, and describes how hotels can exercise their environmental responsibility. Practical advice is accompanied by sample checklists, diagrams for energy and waste management systems and even equations to help a hotel calculate how much of its waste paper could be recycled. The Business Leaders' Forum hopes the co-operative venture will become a model for other global industrial sectors. 'The hotel industry is very decentralised with highly centralised controls. It's the best industry in the world for implementing this,' said Robert Davies, the forum's chief executive.</p>

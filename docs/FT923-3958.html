			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Finnish move puts pressure on Sweden THE PRICE of the profligate 1980s, which has plagued Nordic equity markets over the past twelve months, came back to upset Finland and Sweden yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. STOCKHOLM dropped to a year's low as the krona came under pressure from Finland's decision to float the markka. The Swedish central bank raised its key marginal rate to 24 per cent from 16 per cent in order to protect its currency. The Affarsvarlden General Index dropped 22.5 or 3 per cent to 728.2 in turnover of SKr456m after SKr197m. The insurance group Trygg-Hansa cancelled its capital-raising plans because of the turbulence. Its B frees fell SKr5 to a new year's low of SKr27. The forestry sector was one of the main losers. Stora B frees fell SKr17 to SKr205 and SCA B frees lost SKr7 to SKr79. MoDo B frees fell SKr25 to SKr125 on fears that SCA might sell its 16 per cent stake in MoDo. In HELSINKI, the Hex index jumped 27.4 or 5.1 per cent to 568.4 in an initial reaction to the central bank's decision to stop defending the markka, a move which should make Finnish companies more competitive, in the short term at least. FRANKFURT retreated from early highs after the Bundesbank president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, said again yesterday that he saw no room to lower German interest rates. After a 5.20 rise to 609.85 in the FAZ index at midsession, the DAX closed 3.92 higher at 1,544.55. Turnover fell to DM5bn from DM3.4bn. The car sector saw solid gains. Volkswagen recovered DM5.20 to DM319, probably on short-covering following Morgan Stanley's earnings downgrade late last week; Daimler added DM3.50 to DM633.50 and BMW DM6 to DM513. Allianz rose DM34, or just under 2 per cent to DM1,757 after DB Research changed its recommendation to 'neutral'. Karstadt led retailers lower with a DM13 fall to DM534 possibly anticipating poor German retail sales figures later this week. PARIS drifted lower, but individual shares were active. The CAC-40 index dropped 15.63 to 1,763.67 in moderate turnover of FFr1.6bn. Bancaire rose as high as FFr334, following the publication of its interim results, before closing FFr14 or 4.6 per cent higher at FFr322. The share is in demand with investors wanting to increase their weighting in interest rate-sensitive stocks. Carrefour bounced back FFr24 to FFr2,100 after the previous day's slump, as did Accor which rose FFr12 to FFr532. But dealers expect Accor to fall back, since the chairman's gloomy profit forecast should prompt downward revisions of 1992 earnings forecasts. L'Oreal was busy on speculation about Nestle's intentions towards the haircare products group. The stock ended FFr8 lower at FFr991. MILAN closed broadly firmer in a technical rebound, but came off the day's highs on news that Mr Giovanni Agnelli, the chairman of Fiat, expected the group's turnover to be hit by last week's discount rate increase. The Comit index rose 3.95 to 365.48 in turnover estimated at around Monday's L73.3bn. Fiat was fixed L24 higher at L3,595, while one of the session's best performers was Banca Commerciale Italiana, which rose L154 to L2,470 on renewed speculation that the bank would soon be privatised. AMSTERDAM slipped further with the drinks sector again providing most of the interest. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.3 weaker at 109.0. Bols lost Fl 1.00 to Fl 42.40 before reporting a 3.6 per cent increase in interim earnings and forecasting a higher 1992 net profit, after the close. Grolsch, which publishes its first half figures this morning, fell Fl 1.00 to Fl 219 while Heineken was down Fl 1.80 at Fl 165.20. The financial and publishing sectors went against the trend with Wolters Kluwer up 30 cents at Fl 79.60 and AMEV 80 cents higher at FL 55.40. ZURICH was flat overall, the SMI index easing 0.3 to 1,788.1, featuring a SFr13 decline in Ciba-Geigy to SFr612 because of the lower dollar and a drop of SFr90 to SFr1,460 in Ascom on worries over its 1992 earnings. BRUSSELS lacked direction at the start of the new account and the Bel-20 index finished 1.90 higher at 1,068.66 in low turnover of BFr480m. Delhaize advanced BFr19 to BFr1,515 on news that it hopes to develop supermarket chains in Czechoslovakia and Greece while UCB, the chemical group, gained BFr450 or 2 per cent to BFr22,350 ahead of tomorrow's interim results. VIENNA climbed nearly 2 per cent as the ATX index rose 14.81 to 759.98. Radex, in mining and fireproof materials, led the market higher, rising Sch19, or 4.5 per cent to Sch443. MADRID retreated further on profit-taking while the banking sector came under renewed pressure. The general index fell 2.86 to 212.70.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 8                              Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Open   10.30am   11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm      3 pm    close 1032.92  1033.52  1034.13  1032.26  1032.70  1030.78  1030.62  1029.38                 Day's High 1034.59      Day's Low 1029.18              Sep 7      Sep 4      Sep 3     Sep 2     Sep 1             1032.28    1029.27    1031.46   1011.19   1007.79  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

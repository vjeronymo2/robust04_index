In addition, they will  study other ways to promote contacts between lawmakers,  academicians, and entrepreneurs.    Diplomatic teams from Brazil and Argentina ended a meeting  on  Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro. The main issues addressed at the  meeting were the political, economic, and commercial relations  between the two countries; Mercosur [Common Market of the South]  affairs; the coming into force of NAFTA; Argentina's intention  to create a peace operations center; and the Brazilian desire to  study a similar initiative for the purpose of promoting the  approach between the military of the two countries.    The Brazilian team was headed by Foreign Ministry Secretary  General Roberto Abdenur, whose interlocutor was Argentine Vice  Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella. The meetings were also  attended by officials in charge of the economic and political  planning areas of the two foreign ministries.    According to Abdenur, the idea is to create a true system of  consultation so that integration reaches not only the  governments but also other social sectors. In order to show the  degree of proximity between the two governments, Abdenur said  that presidents Itamar Franco and Carlos Menem have already met  seven times.  <H5>  Warren Christopher </H5>   Argentine and Brazilian diplomats also agreed on the  significance of the conference of nations of the hemisphere that  the U.S. Government has proposed for this year. Concerning the  postponement of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's  visit to Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, and Venezuela,  Abdenur said that no specific date had been established for the  tour, and that it should be made in the near future.</p>

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: New issues at record levels in US NEW CORPORATE issues of debt and equity securities surged to record levels in 1992, as companies took advantage of low US interest rates and a solid stock market and put their balance sheets into better shape. According to provisional figures from Securities Data, the financial information group, companies have raised more than Dollars 1,000bn through underwritten debt and equity offering worldwide during the past 12 months. Of this, over Dollars 838bn was raised in the US - a 42 per cent increase on the previous record amount of Dollars 590bn raised in 1991. Over Dollars 282m is estimated to have been raised outside the US, with volumes picking up towards the year-end, as interest rates in a number of European countries fell. The sizzling US activity has meant Wall Street investment banks have enjoyed record fees from underwriting new issues - a fact reflected in employee bonus payments. Securities Data suggests the underwriters will have earned over Dollars 6.7bn in 1992, up by almost 45 per cent from the Dollars 4.7bn which they netted in 1991, the previous all-time high. The biggest winner is reckoned to be Merrill Lynch, earning around Dollars 1.4bn. Goldman Sachs fell into second place with Dollars 909m and Lehman Brothers came in third, with Dollars 631m. Morgan Stanley took fourth place (Dollars 611m), followed by First Boston (Dollars 477m). The surge in corporate issues was spread across debt and equity markets. Domestic debt offerings, excluding mortgage and asset-backed securities, totalled over Dollars 301bn - almost as much as companies raised in this fashion in 1991 and 1992 combined. Helping to boost this figure was the revival of the 'junk bond', or high-yield security; offerings of 'junk bonds' raised around Dollars 38bn, surpassing the previous annual record of Dollars 31bn set in 1986. On the equity front, common stock (or ordinary share) issues raised Dollars 72.4bn, a 29 per cent increase over the previous record figure of Dollars 56bn seen last year. The volume of initial public offerings - or flotations - soared to Dollars 38bn, well in excess of the record Dollars 26.8bn raised in 1986. During the year, more than 600 new corporate listings were established, although the pace at which companies were coming to the stock market did ease in the second half of the year as investors appeared to have reached saturation point.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: China worries fail to halt Hong Kong's rise - Simon Davies discusses the issues which have helped drive the equity market higher Hong Kong equities are enjoying an impressive performance this month. The Hang Seng index registered its fifth consecutive record high yesterday on expectation of strong corporate results from the major index stocks. The index closed yesterday at 7,605.26, up 38 per cent so far this year; most brokers now expect it to break through the 8,000 barrier by the year-end. After hours in London, the index gained a further 21 points. While confidence took a slight blow yesterday, as Hang Seng Bank, a subsidiary of HSBC, announced disappointing results and warned of difficult economic conditions during the next 12 months, brokers do not expect this to have a negative effect on sentiment. Hang Seng Bank lost 50 cents to HKDollars 61. Gone are the worries over the impact of the Chinese austerity measures announced early last month, and concern regarding the continuing Anglo-Chinese stand-off over the political blueprint of Mr Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong; and back is a flood of international money eager to find reasonably valued stock markets which have expectations of high corporate earnings growth. 'Over the next four months, I think the index will reach 8,200,' says Mr Adrian Faure, research director at Baring Securities. 'It got to 7,500 because of strong corporate earnings, which will underpin this market. It will hit 8,200 on announcements on the airport project, the container terminal scheme and political agreement.' Investors have reassured themselves that the direct impact of a slowdown in the Chinese economy on listed companies' earnings will be minimal, since Chinese investments will account for below 3 per cent of current year earnings for constituent stocks of the Hang Seng index. They are confident now that, regardless of the performance of China's economy, the reform programme will continue unimpaired under the patronage of Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier in charge of the economy. Based on the forecasts of broker SG Warburg, the index is currently on a 1993 p/e ratio of 13.1. This remains the cheapest in south-east Asia, compared with 15.4 for Thailand's SET index and 19 for Singapore's Straits Times Industrial index. In addition, although the pace of corporate earnings growth may be slowing, it remains strong and economists expect between 16 and 17 per cent average earnings growth in 1993 and 1994, compared with 23 per cent in 1992. On the positive side, the Chinese have given the go-ahead for two key projects which are part of Hong Kong's HKDollars 165bn airport plan. This has heightened expectations that China will approve financing for the airport. There remain a number of concerns to suggest that the equity market will retain its historical risk rating, leaving it as the cheapest in p/e terms of the Asian markets. Rumours of the death of the Chinese patriarch, Mr Deng Xiaoping, have consistently shocked investors over the past five years. The rising profile of the pro-reformist Mr Zhu should dampen fears of a post-Deng political backlash; but the uncertainty resulting from Mr Deng's demise would strike a blow to confidence. Hong Kong has also become more sensitive to capital movements from China. Baring Securities estimates that HKDollars 50bn in Chinese capital has flowed into the Hong Kong property market in the last 18 months. The austerity programme in China has focused on reining in speculative funds within the country; if this broadened into enforced repatriation of 'speculative' capital in Hong Kong, the impact would be devastating. However, such a move would be difficult to enforce. Finally, Mr Patten has stated that in his opening address to the legislative council on October 6 he wants to give some indication of progress in the Sino-British negotiations on his political blue print for Hong Kong. An aggressive stance would undoubtedly provoke anger from China and fear from Hong Kong.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Price of Signature Is Civil Peace. </F> Process of Signing Document on Public Accord Begins in Kremlin  Tomorrow"]    [Text] Kursk Oblast Administration Head Vasiliy Shuteyev:    Let me say straightaway that as head of the administration  of  a Federation component I will certainly sign the draft "peace"  agreement proposed by the president.    Needless to say, the text needs some adjustments and we will  obviously do that during the discussion. But this is purely a  question of editing: Some provisions that do not duplicate the  constitution can be expanded, while some can be shortened;  however, it is not the details that should be primarily worrying  us today but the essence, objectives, and positive qualities of  the document. And the essence of the document is that the  signatories are making the appropriate commitments, aware that  Russia has no future without the agreement.    Khabarovsk Kray Administration Head Viktor Ishayev:    Everyone has gotten well and truly sick of the constant  wrangling in our society and I think that the Federation  components will favor consolidation in any form. The agreement  on civil accord is essential. And we have already said that it  must be signed.    We, the people of the Far East, are most concerned about the  economic basis for consolidation. Local administration heads  believe that the unequal economic conditions both between the  territories themselves and in relations with the government that  exist for instance for krays, oblasts, and republics within  Russia may become an unpopular political factor. Khabarovsk  Kray, which borders on Yakutia for instance, is cannot help  seeing that the latter receives privileges from the center. Yet  we have exactly the same problems. And we too are an equal  Federation component. So let us create equal conditions for all.    Bryansk Oblast Administration Head Vladimir Karpov:    Along with the other administration heads, I signed an  appeal  to political parties and movements following the meeting with  the president. Accord is vitally necessary in Russia today. I  am convinced that the country has no future unless reforms are  continued, the norms of a civil society are established, and  economic and political stability are ensured. The tasks facing  society are too complex to waste effort on political  confrontation and continue the protracted political games.    A compromise is possible and necessary. Everyone merely has  to be able to get over their arrogance in order to rescue the  country and cast aside their political passions and ambitions.    Novosibirsk Mayor Viktor Tolokonskiy:    I think that most people of Novosibirsk fully understand the  need for the civil accord that the Russian president has  proposed. But at the same time many people are worried that the  conclusion of this agreement might prolong the state of apathy  and inactivity in the parliament and government. And I think  that the proposed form of civil peace and accord should also be  a pledge for all its signatories at once to get down in earnest  to effective work to extricate the country from crisis.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Olympia &amp; York 'resilient' says credit rating agency A CANADIAN credit-rating agency has concluded that the financial condition of Reichmann-controlled Olympia &amp; York Developments - which has interests in London's Docklands - remains resilient despite some severe setbacks to its vast property and natural resources investments. O&amp;Y, involved in London's Canary Wharf development, has seen the market value of its listed investments fall 18 per cent in the past year. The group has taken a hard knock from the property slump in New York, London and Toronto. But the Toronto-based Dominion Bond Rating Service said in a report to clients yesterday that O&amp;Y appeared to have adequate equity to support its debt. Furthermore, it said that some of the Reichmanns' holdings in listed companies could probably be sold at a 25 to 30 per cent premium to their market value of CDollars 5.4bn (Pounds 2.75bn). These holdings include an 82 per cent stake in newsprint-maker Abitibi-Price, and a 35 per cent interest in Trizec, North America's biggest listed property developer. In reviewing one of O&amp;Y's commercial paper programmes, the rating agency concluded that 'whatever O&amp;Y's credit strength was one year ago, it is weaker today. Nonetheless, it is still strong enough to maintain (its) rating', equivalent to a double A. O&amp;Y is a private company, and Dominion emphasised that it had never seen the group's financial statements. The agency's report was drawn up in consultation with O&amp;Y executives, including Mr Paul Reichmann, the family's master strategist. On Canary Wharf, O&amp;Y told the rating agency that signed leases and deals 'close to completion' cover almost 3m of the 4.7m sq ft that will become available over the next 18 months. According to O&amp;Y, 'there has been a substantial increase in tenant interest now that full visual impact has become apparent'. The Reichmanns predict that up to 85 per cent of the space will be committed by the time the first tenants move in. However, the agency's report expressed several concerns about O&amp;Y's property exposure in New York, where it is the biggest office landlord, and in London and Toronto. The concerns include these cities' heavy reliance on the financial services industry, and a concentration of tenants in its portfolio.</p>

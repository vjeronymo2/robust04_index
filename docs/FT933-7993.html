			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: 'Bloody bizarre' goings on at RTZ 'BLOODY BIZARRE stuff, isn't it?' said an RTZ official yesterday after reading a Reuter report about the organisation which said it might arrange a bid for the world's biggest mining company. Mr Raymond Grant, who signed a fax message to RTZ saying a bid was being organised, told the news agency that his group felt mineral wealth should not be controlled by corporations. 'All we do is co-ordinate together for peace for development in the developing world and we believe that mineral wealth is the birthright of each nation,' he added. 'And we do not believe that the birthright of each nation should be held within a corporate structure.' Mr Grant claimed individuals, companies and countries that were members of his organisation held Pounds 200m-worth of RTZ shares. The market was not panicked by Mr Grant's revelations and the RTZ share price ended unchanged at 687p. Even so, Mr Grant and his friends would have to find at least another Pounds 7bn to buy the group. RTZ, which has contacts with many environmental and national groups around the world, said it had no previous knowledge of Mr Grant's organisation. Instead of rushing to hire a merchant bank to mount a bid defence, RTZ passed the fax on to the London Stock Exchange. The Stock Exchange contacted the UK takeover panel as the fax appeared to breach UK bid regulations. 'We will be investigating,' said an exchange official.</p>

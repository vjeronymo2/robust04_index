			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major seeks rapid action to widen EC MR JOHN MAJOR signalled last night that Britain will press its European partners to finalise by the end of this year a detailed mandate for enlargement negotiations with at least four Efta countries. At a working dinner in Downing Street with Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, the prime minister also called for the Brussels executive to speed up the work to define the role of 'subsidiarity' in the Community's decision-making. Mr Major, whose talks with Mr Delors focused on this week's Lisbon summit and the subsequent British presidency of the EC, said he was determined to put enlargement at the centre of his agenda. Senior colleagues said he wanted the Commission to draw up over the next few months the EC's basic negotiating stance with Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, Austria and, possibly, Norway. The aim would be to translate that into a firm mandate at December's Edinburgh summit. Mr Major acknowledges that several other EC governments have been unwilling to contemplate enlargement until the Maastricht treaty is ratified. But he appears determined that their objections should not delay preparations. His government's view is that a commitment to enlargement will be a central element in a package of measures to allow the Danish government to hold a second referendum on the treaty. A second element is a much tighter definition of subsidiarity - ensuring the Community only has authority in areas where national governments cannot operate effectively. Officials said Mr Major welcomed the work that Mr Delors had already instituted but stressed the need to translate the theory into practical decisions. That would involve both a review of areas where the Commission had taken 'unnecessary' powers, and a mechanism to ensure that it did not do so in the future. The prime minister sees tangible progress on both fronts as one of his most potent weapons in efforts to isolate Tory critics of Maastricht, as well as in the Community's attempts to reassure the Danes. As ministers brushed off another attack by Tory Euro-sceptics yesterday, Mr Major underlined his determination not to renege on Maastricht during a meeting with officers of the influential 1922 committee of backbench MPs. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will convey the same message in a much larger gathering of Conservative MPs later today. The government will delay the renomination of a second British EC commissioner until after next month's Labour leadership election. Re-opening speculation about a possible move to Brussels by Mr Neil Kinnock, Mr Major agreed to Labour requests that any decision over Mr Bruce Millan's future should not be taken until after the contest. Sir Leon Brittan will be reappointed as senior British Commissioner.</p>

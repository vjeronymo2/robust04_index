			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG CHARGES IN SHERIFF'S DEPT.  </P> <P> I trust President Bush will be as quick to apologize to those deputy sheriffs  who are eventually exonerated as he was to condemn them as "bad apples" during  his appearance with Sheriff Block at the dedication of the new correctional  facility at Castaic ("President Seeks to Reassure L.A. Deputy Sheriffs" Part A,  March 2).  </P> <P> Once the verdicts are in the only ones who may need reassurance are Block and  the U.S. attorney's office, who will have to explain why they were so quick to  indict these hard-working and dedicated deputies without any concrete evidence  of wrongdoing, except for speculation and innuendo.  </P> <P> LEONARD B. LEVINE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  Levine is attorney for defendant Michael Kaliterna.  </P></p>

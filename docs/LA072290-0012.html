			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> WEDDING TRASH  </P> <P> FOR TODAY'S BRIDE blushing about the state of our environment, there's a  floor-length paper wedding gown decorated with such recyclables as grocery-bag  flowers and dental floss. Made of non-woven interfacing and trimmed with stuff  most people consider trash -- coffee filters, Q-tips, tin-foil -- the dress  looks like a real wedding gown.  </P> <P> The paper wedding dress is a creation of bridal-designer Susan Lane, a 20-year  veteran of the "I do" business.  </P> <P> Lane's most recent nuptials creation was designed to draw attention to  recycling. "A bridal dress represents the most beautiful thing a woman can  wear. My dress shows you can use trash to make something beautiful." But trash  doesn't come cheap. Lane's dress for environment-conscious brides sells for  about $180 plain; additional decoration by Lane herself runs $100 to $600.  </P> <P>  Susan Lane's Country Elegance, 10144 Riverside Drive, Toluca Lake; (818)  985-8968.  </P> <P> MONICA E.

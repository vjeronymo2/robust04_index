			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 19, BNS -- Residents of the former  Soviet military base town of Paldiski at a meeting with Estonian  Population Minister Peeter Olesk Friday [18 February] said they  are opposed to the government's plans to subordinate the town to  the nearby municipality of Keila until local elections can take  place in Paldiski itself.    Olesk, together with a representative of the Estonian Armed  Forces in the town, Colonel Raul Luks, and the government's  special representative Juri Tikk met with an audience of about  300 Paldiski residents.    Participants in the meeting adopted a resolution in which  they welcomed the government's move to register a new the town's  legal residents. "At the same time they say Paldiski shouldn't  be subordinated to the town of Keila for any period of time,"  Olesk said today.    The minister said it was unrealistic to hold early elections  in Paldiski. Estonia left Paldiski out of the list before last  fall's local elections, because of the large number of Russian  military remaining there, as well as for refusal by the local  Russian police office there to turn over the files of legal  residents' and car registers.    Olesk said it was cheaper to put Paldiski under the  authority  of Keila than to set up a temporary governor's office in the  town itself.    The government approved the plan to put Paldiski under  Keila's municipal government on Feb. 15. The temporary scheme of  governing is to remain effective until local elections are held  in Paldiski.</p>

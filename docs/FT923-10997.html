			<p>920728 FT  28 JUL 92 / Dentists strike in Germany NEARLY 3,000 dentists in Germany's populous North Rhine region downed drills and closed surgeries yesterday in protest at the government's plans to cut spending on the state-subsidised health care system. Members of the Free Association of German Dentists are being urged to pull out of the public health insurance scheme, and only accept patients privately, mirroring a move taken by British dentists three weeks ago. At the same time doctors in the wealthy state of Baden-Wurttemberg are organising a mass poster campaign attacking the health minister, Mr Horst Seehofer, who has drawn up plans to save DM11bn (Pounds 3.7bn) a year from the swelling costs of the health service. They include a freeze on doctors' and dentists' fees, as well as on pharmaceutical prices, an increase in hospital fees, and a system to curb prescriptions by doctors: if they prescribe more than laid down in strict budgets, their fees will be cut accordingly. Mr Seehofer denounced the dentists' strike action yesterday as 'absolutely excessive'.</p>

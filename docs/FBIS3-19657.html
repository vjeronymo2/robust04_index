			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] In an article entitled "The  Capitulationists" that appeared in the 11 March Lisbon daily  PUBLICO, commentator Miguel Sousa Tavares praises the United  States for forcefully intervening in Kuwait, Somalia, and  Bosnia. In Kuwait, he writes, President Saddam Husayn's  challenge "represented everything that was unacceptable."  Despite West Europe's past -- "and still present" -- tendency to  capitulationism, in 1991 the United States, which was not  "contaminated" by this virus, solved the problem in "exemplary  military and political fashion," Sousa Tavares writes.  Capitulationists, again upset when the United States decided to  put an end to the Somali "reign of terror," "gloated" when U.S.  and Pakistani peacekeepers lost their lives because their dire  predictions were coming true, he continues. Now it is the turn  of Bosnia, where after two years of "medieval barbarity and  European cowardice" the United States and France forced the UN  and NATO to act, according to Sousa Tavares. The same naysayers  predicted that the ultimatum given to the Serbs would only  "aggravate the situation," Sousa Tavares writes. In the end,  Saddam Husayn was expelled from Kuwait and Iraq no longer is a  threat to the world. Somali warlord Mohamed Aidid was contained  and no Somalis are dying of hunger. Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic  realized that his ethnic cleansing campaign would not be  entirely tolerated and Sarajevo has not been shelled in recent  weeks. The silence that those predicting disaster have kept over  these facts proves the vacuity of their arguments, Sousa Tavares  contends. Where diplomacy has failed and recourse to force may  produce results, the international community should not hesitate  to intervene. Whether it is termed the "right of humanitarian  interference" or something else, "we must not resign ourselves  to situations that are an insult to humanity," Sousa Tavares  concludes.</p>

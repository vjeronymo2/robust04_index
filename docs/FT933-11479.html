			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Local government THERE IS a common fallacy in politics that doing whatever the public says it wants will be popular. The reverse is often the case: seeking to please everybody can produce policies satisfying nobody. The Local Government Commission is discovering this in reviewing local government structures in England outside the large conurbations. The commission has so far produced five reports recommending the replacement of 66 county and district councils with 24 unitary councils. In areas such as Durham and Derbyshire, they will be based on counties; in others such as Somerset and Gloucestershire, local government will be based on smaller districts. To complete the mosaic, two tiers of local government will remain in Lincolnshire, with district councils for street-level services and a county council for strategic services. The commission's chairman, Sir John Banham, says the recommendations are based on people's feelings about where they belong. Since they are based on extensive polling of the population under review, that cannot be denied. Yet the proposals for unitary authorities appear to find little favour in the areas concerned. Unsurprisingly, the loudest objections come from the councils to be abolished under the recommendations. But business leaders have also been scathing about creating small unitary authorities in areas such as Bristol and Middlesbrough unable to think strategically for urban areas forming single economic entities. And local residents' meetings say the larger unitary authorities that are proposed will be too remote to provide responsive services such as street cleaning and refuse removal. Disturbed by the rising hubbub, the government is considering changes to the commission's remit. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, should ruminate on a MORI poll in Derbyshire as part of the review. Only 3 per cent of those questioned said sense of community should be an important factor in shaping local government. Much more important were a structure responsive to the wishes of local people, and the cost and quality of service. This reinforces the need for a more coherent approach to the commission's work. England needs a system of local government that is capable of strategic action, can deliver local services responsively and is locally accountable. A two-tier model is the best way to achieve this, with larger strategic county councils and smaller districts to provide services. Yet this is the model the commission is largely scrapping. In reviewing its remit, Mr Gummer should abandon the opinion poll and reinstate reason as the driving force behind local government organisation.</p>

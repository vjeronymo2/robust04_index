			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOW INCHES UP 0.36 TO 2,239.11, A FRACTION SHY OF ITS PRE-CRASH LEVEL  </P> <P> Profit taking and a weaker dollar took the bloom off a brief blue chip rally  Thursday, holding Wall Street to a marginally higher close just short of its  immediate pre-crash level.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial issues rose 0.36 to 2,239.11 after  picking up 24.11 on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The widely followed barometer had a session high of 2,254.64 Thursday -- the  first time it has surpassed the level where it stood before the October, 1987,  crash.  </P> <P> On Oct. 16, 1987, the last trading day before the crash, the average closed at  2,246.74.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 5 to 4 in New York  Stock Exchange trading.  </P> <P> Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 192.03 million shares, up from  187.54 million in the previous session, and the highest NYSE volume so far this  year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Underlying Health'  </P> <P> Analysts said there were still signs of strength on Wall Street, and they  expected the market's 1989 rally to continue.  </P> <P> "I think it's entitled to at least a day or two of flatness," said Michael  Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. He pointed to the advance-decline  ratio as a indication of the market's underlying health.  </P> <P> The Labor Department reported Thursday that its consumer price index rose 0.3%  in December, bringing the increase in the index for all of 1988 to 4.4%.  </P> <P> The latest inflation report was lower than most economists had predicted and  contributed to the positive atmosphere on Wall Street.  </P> <P> However, brokers say the market's strength has not seemed to derive from  economic news, but rather from a gradual easing of the fears that have  persisted that the Federal Reserve will move interest rates higher.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 9%, up from 8.938% late Wednesday.  </P> <P> In foreign trading, stock prices closed lower in Tokyo, giving back a portion  of the previous day's advance to record highs. The Nikkei 225-share index fell  43.15 points to 31,311.40.  </P> <P> In London, a brisk rally faltered as Wall Street turned mixed and investors  paused to assess the outlook, dealers reported. The Financial Times 100-share  index closed up 18.7 points to a new post-crash high of 1,910.8.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Central banks slammed the dollar lower Thursday, cooling a rally that had  brought the U.S. currency to its highest levels since early October.  </P> <P> Foreign exchange dealers said one round of dollar selling by nine central banks  was unsuccessful, but a second round drove the dollar lower against most  currencies.  </P> <P> Dollar sales were accompanied by West Germany's central bank raising two key  interest rates, a step intended to make yields on German securities more  attractive and keep investors from switching from marks to dollars.  </P> <P> The dollar had gotten as high as 129.8 Japanese yen and 1.88 marks before the  successful attack by the central banks at mid-morning in New York.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the dollar had risen strongly despite two negative reports: a  bigger-than-expected U.S. trade deficit and a record Japanese trade surplus.  </P> <P> The dollar was due for a pullback, at least a temporary one, said Frank Conte,  vice president for foreign exchange at Barclays Bank in New York.  </P> <P> Tables begin on Page 6  </P></p>

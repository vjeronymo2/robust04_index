			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy It is easy to blame Britain's striking propensity to import on structural imbalance in the economy. The harder question is the matter of degree. While yesterday's import figures were made even more horrible by the notorious J-curve effect, the data also show import volume slowed sharply after September's devaluation. The logical explanation is that imports were pushed up by an overvalued exchange rate while the UK was in the ERM. Now that problem has been corrected, one could hope for slower import growth than would normally be expected in a recovery. That depends, though, on how domestic manufacturers use the leeway created by devaluation. If they are determined to push up margins at the first opportunity, they will rapidly lose competitive edge. The example set by exporters is not particularly encouraging. The value of their sales rose noticeably faster in the last quarter than the volume.</p>

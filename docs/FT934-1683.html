			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Hong Kong - the next stage Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, will view the end of Sino-British talks on his democratic reform proposals as double-edged. He has suffered a decisive setback in his efforts to secure China's acquiescence to broader democracy before Beijing assumes sovereignty in 1997. But he is now embarked on the course which, as a report elsewhere in this newspaper suggests, he might have preferred all along: to allow Hong Kong people to take a hand in deciding how far they want to go in broadening the electoral franchise. The problem is that neither he nor they know whether China will accept their choice, even if it is for limited change. Mr Patten's efforts to date have served to heighten uncertainty about the transition to Chinese rule. It is not only the political talks that have foundered. Sino-British discussions on many practical issues of the handover, as well as on the financing for the new airport, are also just about at a standstill. Instead of the closer co-operation which the 1984 Joint Declaration called for during the latter part of the transition period, there appears to be a widening cultural divide. Open discussion This is not to suggest that Mr Patten was wrong to try to broaden the democratic franchise within the limits imposed by the post-1997 Basic Law - and to seek to do this with China's agreement. One effect has been to force open discussion, both in Hong Kong and China, about the true implications of a 'one country, two systems' approach. It is far better that the wrangling takes place now than to have sudden, bruising revelations after 1997. If Hong Kong really is to be allowed to maintain its way of life as the Joint Declaration promised, its 'high degree of autonomy' must mean something. Mr Patten has rightly explored its limits. Now, however, the game has moved on, and Mr Patten is no longer at the centre of events. The Legislative Council will almost certainly prove less willing to confront China than he has been. Passage even of the 'non-controversial' package tabled this week may be in doubt, with the conservative party which favours co-operation with China opting to poll its membership. If this bill were to run into problems, Mr Patten would have little chance of getting the meatier parts of his reforms into law. His Westminster skills will be pitted against the exertion of mighty Chinese influence. In itself, this may not be unduly damaging. Indeed, it is the sort of political debate to which a nascent democracy must become accustomed, even in such constrained circumstances. Electoral uncertainty Less desirable is the uncertainty about the eventual fate of the electoral system which LegCo puts in place. Even if it substantially waters down Mr Patten's reforms, its decision may still be rejected by China and a new political system instituted. However, this will not necessarily be the end for democracy, Hong Kong-style. China has this week reiterated its commitment to enacting the Basic Law, which sets out specific steps towards democracy and says: 'The ultimate aim is the election of all the members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage.' Unless events prove otherwise, these Chinese commitments can be taken at face value. Many Hong Kong people - investors in particular - are doing just that. The stock and property markets have shown great resilience in the face of the Sino-British confrontation. The economy behaves more and more as though it were already part of China. What cannot yet be guaranteed is that it will continue to enjoy such uninterrupted growth through the handover. It will only do so if the nuts and bolts - the legal and judicial framework, arrangements for the civil service, and the other features that buttress Hong Kong's economic success - are in place before 1997. With China and Britain now apparently destined for permanent disagreement on political issues, it is ever more important for both sides to focus on these practical arrangements. If only for this reason, they will have to talk. And although the British approach has suffered a reverse, the UK cannot wash its hands of Hong Kong. lf serious uncertainties about the future are aroused, it will have to reconsider the issue of passports.</p>

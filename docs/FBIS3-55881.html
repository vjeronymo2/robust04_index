			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 11 Jan -- The atmosphere in the State Duma  building deteriorated sharply today immediately on resumption of  work after the daytime break over a conflict concerning the  person in the chair.    A number of deputies immediately demanded that Georgiy  Lukava, a deputy from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  [LDPR], be replaced as chairman of the session as, in the view  of many, his lack of experience meant he was not up to the task.  In accordance with the Constitution, Georgiy Lukava opened the  first session of the State Duma as the oldest of the deputies,  and it was thought that he would chair the session until a  speaker was elected.    Some deputies suggested that Georgiy Lukava should give up  his place to one of the more competent deputies by means of a  Duma resolution. However, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the LDPR  leader, from a microphone in the hall, gave the stand-in  chairman a categorical instruction "to go nowhere, switch off  the microphone, and not allow anyone onto the podium." He  demanded that discussion of the issue of the numbers in a  faction be resumed, having been stopped before the break, and if  necessary that "the militia be called."    The indignant deputies protested and refused to take part in  the electronic registration announced by Georgiy Lukava. As a  result, the electronic board showed that there was no quorum  several times in a row. The first session of the State Duma  continues -- for the time being -- in a less than constructive  spirit.</p>

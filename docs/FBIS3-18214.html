			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that the  downing of four Serbian planes by NATO over Bosnia-Herzegovina  is a legitimate act carried out while implementing UN  resolutions.    Cetin, who is in New Zealand, assessed the latest  developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina for Turkish Radio and  Television.    [Begin Cetin recording] From the beginning, we supported all  the resolutions made for a lasting and just peace, and we  believed that these resolutions must be implemented effectively.  There were reports at a certain stage that not all the heavy  weapons which were supposed to withdraw 20 kms in line with the  NATO resolution were under UN control. At the time we warned  the United Nations and NATO that if these weapons were not  placed under full UN control they could be used in other places.  It is now understood that the cease-fire achieved around  Sarajevo can be violated, and the weapons, unless placed under  UN control, can be taken to other places. Consequently, in  order to achieve lasting peace, NATO and the UN Security Council  must continue with their actions in a determined way. [end  recording]</p>

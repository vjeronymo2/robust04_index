			<p>BFN     [Text] The opposition in the Rajya Sabha [upper house] made  a scathing attack on the government for signing the GATT  agreement. Putting up a strong defense, the treasury benches  asserted that the country's interests will not be undermined in  any manner. They also accused the opposition of launching a  misinformation campaign for political purposes. The GATT issue  dominated the day's proceedings and the house witnessed noisy  exchanges and procedural wrangles. The deputy chairperson, Dr.  Najma Heptulla, allowed a discussion on the suo moto statement  made by the commerce minister. Mr. Pranab Mukherjee told the  house that India has only authenticated the final act of the  Uruguay Round, the outcome of the seven-year-long multilateral  trade negotiations. Mr. Mukherjee said India and a number of  developing countries have decided to work out a joint response  to any attempt to link social policy issues with trade. He also  stated that the preparatory committee of the World Trade  Organization will discuss the future agenda, but the decisions  will be taken by consensus.    Initiating the discussion, Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi, BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party], argued it is against the spirit of  several constitutional provisions and undermines the rights of  the state governments. Dr. Joshi contended that the country  stands to lose even in respect of trade-related patents and  investment measures. Rebutting the allegations, Mr. Jagdish  Desai, Congress-I, said subsidies for farmers will continue  unhindered. Asserting that the GATT agreement will help the  country push up exports in five years, the Congress-I member  said the fears about the unrestricted entry of multinational  corporations are unfounded. The discussion remained  inconclusive.    The Lok Sabha [lower house] was adjourned for the day today  without transacting any business following noisy protests by the  opposition over the signing of the new GATT accord. Trouble  began as soon as the house met this morning and continued even  after its adjournment for one hour. The entire opposition was  on its seats shouting slogans. The National Front, the Left  Front, and AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]  members trooped into the well of the house. Some of them were  seen waiving copies of a Hindi daily. The opposition leaders,  including Mr. L.K. Advani and Mr. Somnath Chatterjee, were  trying to speak but nothing could be heard in the din. The  deputy speaker, who was in the chair, adjourned the house for  the day. The house will meet on Thursday morning after the Ram  Navami holiday tomorrow.    The Janata Dal leader, Mr. V.P. Singh, says the government  should try to get concessions in the new GATT agreement in the  interests of the nation. Addressing a news conference in  Parliament House, he said New Delhi should rally the developing  countries and mobilize public opinion at home for changes in the  GATT accord. The Janata Dal leader expressed the view that  parliament should be empowered to ratify such far-reaching  agreement and it should not be left to the discussion of the  executive.</p>

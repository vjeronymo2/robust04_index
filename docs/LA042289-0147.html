			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: F. LEE BAILEY'S TRAVELING LAW REVIEW COMES TO ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> I dropped by Harbor Municipal Court this week to check out F. Lee Bailey. In  case you don't follow such things, Bailey is certainly one of a handful of  famous criminal attorneys -- if not the most famous -- in the country. He was  flown out here over last weekend to defend Pomona orthopedic surgeon Thomas A.  Gionis, who was accused of ordering the Oct. 3 assault on his ex-wife, Aissa  Wayne, and her then-companion, Roger W. Luby, in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Surprisingly, the spectator area on the first 2 days of Gionis' preliminary  hearing was well-populated but never full, and about half the audience appeared  to be working press and lawyers looking for a short course in  cross-examination.  </P> <P> When I arrived Monday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans had just  finished questioning an employee of Pacific Bell about phone records apparently  showing a number of calls between Gionis and private investigator O. Daniel  Gal, who was observed at the scene of the attack and employed the two men  allegedly involved.  </P> <P> Bailey is a portly, ruddy-faced, avuncular man who approached his  cross-examination with almost cherubic bonhomie. Toying with his glasses, he  spoke extemporaneously, quite remarkable in view of the fact that he had  arrived on the scene less than 24 hours earlier.  </P> <P> Bailey had crossed my life once before, rather obliquely, when I did a magazine  piece about a medical doctor who specialized in hypnosis and told me that he  had worked for Bailey for some years. One of his jobs, he said, was to sit in  the spectator area of the courtroom and listen carefully to the questioning of  prospective jurors.  </P> <P> He said jurors always offered telltale signs that would enable him to flash  signals to Bailey to indicate whether Bailey should accept them. The doctor had  also hypnotized two of Bailey's most famous clients: "Boston Strangler" Albert  DeSalvo and Dr. Sam Sheppard, for whom Bailey won a retrial and freedom after  Sheppard was convicted of killing his wife in Cleveland. (There have been some  spectacular failures too -- the best-known was his unsuccessful defense of  Patty Hearst.)  </P> <P> Stars of Bailey's stature don't often appear in a municipal court, and his  presence had an electric quality, dominating even the imposing Gionis, a  stocky, curly-haired, rather swarthy man in a dark suit who followed even the  most technical questioning intently.  </P> <P> The thing that struck me most about the early part of the proceedings was the  good ol' boy camaraderie of the participants -- rather like an advanced law  seminar. Amid the one-liners, the inside jokes between Judge Susanne S. Shaw  and the attorneys and witnesses, and the general aura of good fellowship, it  was sometimes hard to remember that the man at the defense table was accused of  hiring thugs to assault his ex-wife. I had a feeling that everyone involved  wanted to show Bailey that they could match his sophistication and this was no  backwoods operation.  </P> <P> Christopher Evans -- a tall, rail-thin man with a high-domed forehead and  well-trimmed mustache -- told me before the Tuesday-morning session: "I heard  rumors, but I didn't know until I came to court and saw him that Bailey would  be involved. I wasn't surprised, though, because the Gionis family has lots of  money, and I thought they would come up with a name lawyer.  </P> <P> "(Bailey is) very smooth and competent in every facet of the job -- and he also  seems to be a pleasant guy. I don't have any special strategy to deal with him.  We have some pretty competent defense attorneys in Orange County too --  including the people who represented Gionis before Bailey took over. Let's say  I was whelmed when I saw him, but not overwhelmed."  </P> <P> The good fellowship struck a discordant note with me because I've always found  a courtroom threatening, stirring in me a deep sense of jeopardy that I feel in  few other places. That feeling didn't coalesce with the atmosphere in Judge  Shaw's courtroom until late Tuesday morning when Jeffrey Kendall Bouey -- a  Simi Valley pool cleaner wearing an Orange County jail jump suit -- took the  stand.  </P> <P> Bouey has confessed to being one of the two assailants, and he described the  attack on Wayne and Luby in some detail. Evans' last question was: "Why are you  telling this story here today?" And Bouey -- a remarkably handsome young man  who looks more like an All-American wide receiver than a hired thug -- answered  softly, his voice breaking, that being deprived of seeing his children since he  has been in jail has given him insight into what Aissa Wayne had been going  through in her custody battle with Gionis over their 2-year-old daughter,  Anastasia.  </P> <P> Then Bailey took over to cross-examine, and the whole tone of the proceedings  changed dramatically and drastically. Bailey cut up Bouey with surgical  precision, leading him down paths and then pulling the path from under him,  deriding Bouey's "new-found sensitivity" and challenging his motives for  cooperating with the prosecution. Exchanges between counsel turned rancorous,  and comments from the bench -- still delivered with a kind of fixed smile --  became testy.  </P> <P> This was the Bailey I'd come to see, and he put on a terrific show. Although he  is a consummate performer, he long ago learned the value of understatement and  doesn't use histrionics at all. Whenever he makes a point, he says, "Oh," in a  kind of throwaway signature that says quite eloquently, "Well, now we've taken  care of that matter." He is confident without being arrogant, and knowledgeable  without being supercilious. Everybody's favorite uncle -- with a stiletto in  his shoe.  </P> <P> If Judge Shaw decides there is enough evidence to send Gionis to trial, Bailey  will apparently defend him. If he gets Gionis off the hook at his preliminary  hearing, Bailey can go home in triumph to await the next call.  </P> <P> Have law books, will travel. For lots of money.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DROUGHT LAW BANS WATERING GRASS;  </P> <P> CONSERVATION: SANTA BARBARA IS THE FIRST CITY IN THE STATE TO ENACT SUCH A  MEASURE IN THIS DRY SPELL, AND THE FIRST EVER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE  COUNCIL ALSO BOOSTS WATER RATES SHARPLY.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara is a city known for its Spanish architecture, its variety of  flora, lush gardens and expansive lawns. But soon, tens of thousands of homes  apparently will be framed not by manicured lawns but by straw-colored patches  of desiccated grass.  </P> <P> Faced with a water shortage of almost 50% this year, the Santa Barbara City  Council voted Tuesday night to make watering lawns illegal. In so doing, the  city became the first in the state to ban lawn watering in response to the  current dry spell, and the first ever in Southern California to enact such a  measure to cope with drought, water experts said.  </P> <P> As part of the new ordinance, which took effect immediately, Santa Barbara  residents also are prohibited from using hoses to water trees and shrubs, but  are permitted to keep them alive with hand-held buckets or drip irrigation  systems.  </P> <P> Other conservation measures adopted by the council include a sharp increase in  water rates.  </P> <P> The ban on lawn watering will have a devastating impact on the city's landscape  industry, experts say.  </P> <P> "Nurseries won't be selling lawn supplies, landscapers won't be putting in  lawns and gardeners won't be mowing them," said Martin Senn, president of the  California Assn. of Nurserymen's local chapter. "We're all going to have to lay  low and try to survive this until the drought is over."  </P> <P> Among the hardest hit will be the more than 1,500 gardeners in the city. Up to  20% could lose their jobs, said Henry Camacho, president of the Santa Barbara  Gardeners Assn.  </P> <P> The morning after the City Council's decision, Santa Barbara residents began  searching for ways to keep their gardens alive.  </P> <P> "We just had a sprinkler system man over to tell us about installing a drip  system," said Vasanti Fithian, who has a large garden with 50 trees, as well as  a variety of rose bushes and 75-year-old shrubs. "Some plants we'll keep alive  through the drip system and through saving shower water. Others we'll just have  to let die, along with the lawn. There's only so much water."  </P> <P> To ensure that people don't violate the watering ban, three "drought officers"  from the city's Public Works Department will be responding to violations. A  warning citation will be issued for the first offense; a fine of up to $250 for  the second; another $250 fine for the third, along with the possibility of  water use restrictions, and a possible total shut-off for the fourth violation.  </P> <P> The last time lawn watering was banned in the state was in 1977 in Northern  California's Marin County during another serious drought, said Dean Thompson, a  spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources. Thompson and  spokesmen for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California say that  to their knowledge, Santa Barbara is the first Southern California city to  enact such a ban.  </P> <P> The state's current drought has hit the area from Monterey to Santa Barbara  particularly hard. Unlike Los Angeles and other areas in California that have  access to water from the Sierra, the central coast relies solely on reservoirs  and ground water pumping.  </P> <P> And among the cities of the central coast, Santa Barbara has the greatest water  shortage. Lake Cachuma provides Santa Barbara with the majority of its water,  but it is at its lowest point ever -- 30% of capacity. And Gibraltar Reservoir  near Montecito, which in the past had provided the city with about 30% of its  water, ran dry in November.  </P> <P> Lake Cachuma was designed to tolerate a seven-year drought, the longest known  when the reservoir was created in the 1950s. The city is entering its seventh  year without adequate rainfall -- the worst drought in more than 40 years, said  Bill Ferguson, water development planner for Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> "Our goal now is to keep the big things alive -- like trees and shrubs,"  Ferguson said. "Because the water shortage is so critical, we have to view turf  and lawns as expendable."  </P> <P> Also under the city's new Stage III drought plan, families will be paying much  higher water rates. The average single-family home in Santa Barbara used to pay  about $18 a month for water, Ferguson said. The same amount of water will now  cost $76, he said. And those who use excessive amounts of water will be charged  rates that increase dramatically as water use rises.  </P> <P> The City Council had considered banning the watering of even trees and shrubs,  and landscape professionals, worried that their industry would be wiped out,  lobbied city officials.  </P> <P> "We're all aware of the seriousness of the drought, so we haven't fought the  issue of letting turf and lawns go," said Autumn Brook of the Santa Barbara  Green Industry Council, an association of landscape professionals. "We're all  relieved that trees and shrubs were spared. So now we just have to approach  horticulture in a different way. We'll be planting a lot of drought-resistant  plants and installing low-volume irrigation systems."  </P> <P> The City Council agreed to allow carwashes to keep operating and to let the  city's Botanic Gardens use sprinklers. The council also will allow golf courses  to keep greens and tees alive for four months, until a system using reclaimed  water from the city sewage treatment plant can be implemented.  </P> <P> Cities throughout the state have instituted less severe measures to cope with  the persistent drought, said Thompson of the state Water Resources Department.  Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties have enacted laws to institute mandatory  cuts of 20% in water use. Those who exceed their water allotment can be fined  up to three times the amount of their water bill. The city of San Jose  instituted mandatory water rationing last summer. And El Dorado County enacted  a building moratorium until March, when officials can better estimate their  water resources for the year.  </P></p>

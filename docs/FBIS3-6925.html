			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- Shigeru Yoshimatsu,  representative of Japan's National Council of Societies to save  Japan-born Korean political prisoners in South Korea, recently  issued a statement demanding that Kim Yong-sam release all the  Japan-born Korean political prisoners in South Korea before  visiting Japan.    The statement said that when the Kim Yong-sam "government"  emerged as a "civilian government" the council expected that all  of the political prisoners would be released, but none of the  Japan-born Korean political prisoners has been set free.    Although the abolition of the "National Security Law", an  evil law making people political prisoners, has been demanded  strongly, it still remains, said the statement.    The South Korean authorities must scrap at an early date the  "National Security Law," a leftover of the cold war era, that  defines fellow countrymen as the enemy and suppresses the  pro-reunification movement, urged the statement, expressing  opposition to Kim Yong-sam's visit to Japan.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi will  today personally investigate statements about the police made by  Winnie Mandela, deputy minister of art, culture, science, and  technology.    A statement released by Mrs. Mandela's office said that she  had received an offer of protection from the old apartheid  structures, but that she preferred to be protected by ANC  bodyguards. She did not want entrust her life to a system that  was out to destroy her.    A spokesman from the Ministry of Safety and Security  yesterday said in response to a question that the process was  underway to resolve Mrs. Mandela's issue. Since Mr. Mufamadi  had been at a cabinet meeting yesterday, he would only be able  to handle the matter today.    Responding to questions of whether the safety of President  Nelson Mandela and other ministers could be left in the hands of  the police, whose effectiveness a deputy minister was disputing,  and whether the police were completely exempted from all  responsibility regarding Mrs. Mandela's safety, the spokesman  said he did not have the authority to elaborate on the matter.</p>

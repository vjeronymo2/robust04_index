			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ciba may seek 50% holding in Chiron Ciba, the Swiss chemicals and drug company, has confirmed it is in talks to acquire a 'significant' minority stake - believed to be just under 50 per cent - in Chiron, the US biotechnology company. The deal would include the transfer from Ciba to Chiron of assets valued by analysts at around Dollars 1bn. Neither company would comment in detail, and both stressed the transaction might not take place. However, Ciba said the deal would involve giving Chiron its diagnostic business and its half-share of Biocine, a vaccine manufacturer jointly formed by the two companies in 1987. Analysts speculated that the diagnostics company, Ciba Corning Diagnostics, might be valued at Dollars 800m. The half-share in the vaccines venture, which has vaccines in development against hepatitis, herpes and Aids, might be worth more than Dollars 150m, they said. Neither company would comment on reports that Ciba planned to buy just under 50 per cent of Chiron at Dollars 100 a share. Mr Samuel Isaly, of the Wall Street research firm Mehta and Isaly, said he believed Ciba would buy 13.4m shares in the open market and have a further 13.4m issued to it by Chiron, in return for around Dollars 1bn in assets and Dollars 300m in cash. That would involve Ciba in a cash outlay of around Dollars 1.6bn. The link between the companies was 'a hand-in-glove fit', Mr Isaly said, especially in diagnostics. Ciba has a worldwide marketing network for its diagnostics business, in which the biggest product is its ACS 180 machine for early identification and monitoring of diseases. Chiron has developed new DNA-based technology to measure quantities of viruses such as hepatitis and HIV, but does not expect it to reach the market until 1996. Chiron's shares fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 71 1/2 early yesterday, having leapt on Friday on rumours of the deal.</p>

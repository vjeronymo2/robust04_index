			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Plan to publish NHS death rates Death rates in large Scottish hospitals are to be published next month in a move viewed with concern by some doctors. Talks are taking place about implementing a similar plan in England. One of five 'key indicators' to be published for 30 trust hospitals will be the death rate for patients treated for heart attacks. Doctors warned that the information would have to be presented as fully and fairly as possible to minimise the risk of misinterpretation.</p>

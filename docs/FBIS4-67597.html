			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Thomas Lerner and Lars-Ingmar Karlsson: "Ban on </F> Unleaded Expected"]    [Text] Finance Minister Bo Lundgren and the government are  considering tightening the environmental requirements for  gasoline. In a year there could be a ban on selling ordinary  unleaded gasoline, and only the less environmentally hazardous  class 2 variant would be allowed.    In a DAGENS NYHETER interview on the connection between the  economy and the environment, Bo Lundgren took a generally  positive view on stricter economic control in order to reduce  the environmental problems. But he clearly stakes out the  preconditions. One of the principal demands is that competition  must not be distorted, and he uses the environmental  classification of unleaded gasoline as an example.    "If there were only two producers selling the new  environmental class 2, a complete halt would be wrong. In that  case it would be better to have a tax refund for it."  <H5>  Waiting for the European Union </H5>   Today all companies sell environmental class 3 (in principle  ordinary unleaded gas). The environmentally better class 2 has  been sold only by OK, Uno-X, and Texaco since last year.    But now that the other companies are also expected to start  selling environmental class 2 as soon as within a year, why then  be satisfied with a tax refund? the finance minister reasons.    "When there are good alternatives to a product one cannot  introduce administrative bans," in Lundgren's opinion.    The government does not yet believe it has all the facts in  order to submit a proposal for environmental classification of  gasoline. The study was ready a year ago, to be sure, but the EU  [European Union] must also have time to have its say.    "I could very well imagine that Sweden might be a pioneer in  environmental classification. It could be implemented at the  coming turn of the year," says Bo Lundgren, but points out that  the EU must first agree to the Swedish way.    Bo Lundgren and the nonsocialist government have been the  subject of harsh criticism for not using economic means of  control as a way toward a better environment. A toothless  surcharge on cadmium in commercial fertilizer and higher taxes  on leaded gasoline are more or less all the government has  accomplished, environmental researcher and Social Democrat Per  Kageson recently wrote in DAGENS NYHETER.    "Starting with what we had, we have done a lot," Lundgren  counters.  <H5>  Higher Energy Taxes </H5>   "Look at our reduction of the carbon dioxide tax for  industry. Keeping a high energy tax for industry would both  create economic problems in Sweden and aggravate the global  environment. Our energy tax reform prevents Swedish companies  from becoming established abroad."    Somewhat surprisingly, Bo Lundgren can very well imagine  that  the energy taxes on industry might be raised. He can even accept  that the distribution is changed so that the households assume a  comparatively smaller share of the burden and industry a larger  one. But it is not yet time for that, he says. All countries, at  least in the EU, must also participate.    "If I get the chance, I will work for an orientation toward  more environmentally based taxes."    Will you push these issues in the EU?    "Yes, if I get the opportunity. I think we should have been  able to do more with the coordination internationally than we  have."    So how does one switch taxes from labor to environmentally  hazardous activities, for example? The environmental movement  demands such a change in taxation and the EU has also begun to  discuss it now.    "Many overrate the opportunities for lowering taxes on  labor.  The tax base for work is much broader than the one for the  environment," Lundgren says and describes the difficulties  created by this imbalance.    "A cut in the employer's tax by 5 percent, for example,  costs  20 billion kronor. That is a great deal compared with all  environmental and energy taxes," the finance minister says and  stresses that he is by no means an opponent of this thinking.  Here as well Sweden must keep pace with other countries.    However, it is probably not primarily the tax on work that  will be switched to "green" taxes.    "I think one should begin by lowering the value-added tax.  The damaging effect of the employer's tax could be tackled in a  different way. It is more difficult to do so with the  value-added tax."  <H5>  New Study </H5>   Both the change in taxation and other links between  taxes/fees and the environment will be analyzed in a new study.  Bo Lundgren therefore prefers to wait with inflexible opinions  on what is best.    "I have to think about what I am prepared to do in order to  have whiter snow at my farm in Scania," he says and remembers  that the snow sparkled more in his youth, when the environmental  destruction had not progressed so far.</p>

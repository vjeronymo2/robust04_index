			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Swedish thrifts reaffirm merger plan PLANS to create a new Swedish savings bank group would go ahead, despite concern about the huge losses incurred by one of the 11 banks due to form the enterprise, bankers said yesterday. News that Forsta Sparbanken, a savings bank with business interests concentrated in the Stockholm and Gothenburg regions, had suffered a loss of SKr5.48bn (Dollars 908.7m) in 1991 came as a shock to the banking community. Forsta's credit losses amounted to SKr5.7bn, equivalent to 11 per cent of the bank's total loan portfolio. Government officials are currently discussing the future of Forsta Sparbanken with senior management of the new savings bank group, which will be called Sparbanken Sverige and which hopes to be listed on the Stockholm bourse. Two of Sweden's commercial banks - Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken - said that some of Forsta's retail customers had started to transfer funds to them. Mr Tommy Lindell, Forsta's executive vice-president, admitted some customers were shifting funds, but said there had not been a run on deposits. The government has tried to restore confidence in the troubled bank by saying none of the depositors will lose their money.</p>

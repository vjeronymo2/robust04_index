			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WIDE-OPEN SKIES LURED CARLSBAD WOMAN TO FAME, DARING IN '20S  </P> <P> Custom dictates that 84-year-old women don't charge around town in bright red  Porsches.  </P> <P> But a sports car is actually in a slow league for Bobbi Trout, a world-famous  1920s aviator and friend of Amelia Earhart who today lives quietly, except for  the modest revving of her car engine, in Carlsbad.  </P> <P> Trout always hated the notion of a life of dirty dishes and housework and  instead chose emergency landings in fields, grueling endurance flights and the  glory of an earlier time.  </P> <P> She was a pioneer of aviation's Golden Age, and today, left with her memories,  she's videotaping interviews with other flight pioneers. But most of the women  she knew and competed against are dead now, leaving her among the few who  remember how it was.  </P> <P> "I was flying when it was wide open, you were as free as a bird," said Trout,  who knew of much of the Los Angeles area when it was a vast quilt of fields and  farms, where people stopped what they were doing and waved when a plane  gracefully interrupted the sky.  </P> <P> Of modern aviation, she said, "There are too many in it, you're a number. We  used to be a person. There are too many rules and regulations that take the joy  out of it."  </P> <P> For Trout, making her own rules and regulations has won her a place in history.  </P> <P> She held the women's pilot endurance record of 12 hours, 11 minutes in 1929,  promptly lost it, and won it back. She was awarded the coveted Aviation Gold  Cross from the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, the world honorary  flying organization that issued Trout a license signed by Orville Wright.  </P> <P> At the San Diego Aerospace Museum, Trout's name is engraved in the Women's Hall  of Fame, alongside the names of "women widely known around the world," said  archivist Ray Wagner.  </P> <P> "She was an example of a spirit of adventure and courage some young women  showed in advancing the popularity of aviation," Wagner said.  </P> <P> When Dr. Peggy Baty, associate dean of academics at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical  University campus in Prescott, Ariz., where Trout was recently honored, thinks  about the most courageous early women fliers, she said: "In the '20s and '30s,  I see four names: Amelia Earhart, Louise Thaden, Bobbi Trout and (Florence)  Pancho Barnes."  </P> <P> Earhart vanished into mysterious immortality in 1937, and Barnes and Thaden  died in the 1970s.  </P> <P> Trout sits in her condominium amid flight memorabilia and summons to mind a  snowy day in 1918 when she trudged home from school in Ontario, where she was  then living with her family. A biplane droned overhead. "Oh my god, it thrilled  me to death, I knew someday I'd learn to fly," she said.  </P> <P> That year, she moved back to the Midwest, where she contracted influenza during  a nationwide epidemic that killed thousands. After months of recuperating, her  lungs remained scarred, and the Trouts boarded the train for the better climate  of Southern California.  </P> <P> Ten years later, Trout finally paid $250 to learn to fly, which in retrospect  seems rather expensive for a near-death experience. She and her instructor,  Dale Page, were aloft in a two-seat, open-cockpit OX5 Jenny when he cut the  throttle, failed to lower the nose and the plane spun 100 feet into a field.  </P> <P> Trout suffered a concussion and cuts, and her mother urged her to forsake  airplanes. "Why?" Trout responded with typical aviator logic. "If I'd been  killed, I wouldn't have known about it."  </P> <P> A year later, Trout was world-famous.  </P> <P> She zoomed up in the predawn darkness of Jan. 2, 1929, over Van Nuys Airport in  a Golden Eagle monoplane, hoping to break the women's pilot endurance record of  eight hours. She circled endlessly around the airport for 12 hours and 11  minutes before making her first night landing and encountering a surprise.  </P> <P> "I didn't expect to see photographers and a crowd around me. I just knew I was  running out of gas and should set down," Trout said.  </P> <P> Almost instantly, Trout became a worldwide sensation, although there are some  less-enthusiastic recollections of her feat.  </P> <P> In his memoir of early American aviation, pioneer flier Waldo Dean Waterman  writes that Trout's marathon flight infuriated then-Maj. Carl Spaatz, who years  later commanded the 8th Air Force in Britain and became the first Air Force  chief of staff.  </P> <P> Spaatz was trying to establish an endurance test flight for aerial refueling  and engine operation for the U.S. Army Air Service when his tri-motor craft  approached the field where Trout was circling.  </P> <P> Waterman, who was at the field, noted that, when Spaatz "discovered there was  another plane flying around in his air space, he really raised hell, sending me  a message to 'get that damn plane out of there right now!' "  </P> <P> "My reply was, 'What do you want me to do, shoot her down?' " Waterman said.  </P> <P> When Trout recently learned about this footnote to flight history, she replied,  "I received a nice little letter (of congratulations) from Spaatz." Then she  added with slight annoyance, "Evidently it didn't bother him too much."  </P> <P> However, Trout's triumph was short-lived as another woman pilot, Elinor Smith,  posted a 13-hour flight only a few days later. So, Trout attempted to break the  record again, and, on Feb. 9, 1929, she soared above Mines Field in Inglewood  in her 60-horsepower Golden Eagle and stayed up 17 hours and 20 minutes.  </P> <P> Bored amid the blackness of night and the monotonous engine drone, Trout said,  "I went to sleep a few times, and when I went into a dive, the engine awakened  me." She rubbed her neck and sang to pass the hours.  </P> <P> When she landed, she had shattered records for endurance, mileage and takeoff  weight. "That was the first time a woman had stayed up all night in the air,"  she said.  </P> <P> The flight built her reputation as she grabbed new headlines, such as "Sky Girl  Sets Mark," an account in a Los Angeles newspaper that described the  22-year-old aviator as a "tomboy who took up flying to avoid dishwashing. . .  ."  </P> <P> There was considerable truth in that characterization. Trout has always said  that dolls, marriage and the traditional life of a woman of her era never  interested her. "Mother wanted me to be a lady, and she didn't get one, that's  all," said Trout.  </P> <P> But mother, Lola Trout, touted her suddenly prominent daughter to newspaper  reporters as a "wonderful baby."  </P> <P> Although her actual first name is Evelyn, she was called Bobbi because she  bobbed her hair in 1924. She preferred pants over dresses, used to shoot  rattlesnakes in the backcountry and enjoyed helping run her family's gas  station in Los Angeles. She never married.  </P> <P> It seemed that almost everybody knew her from her photographs, in which she  wore English riding boots, a leather flight jacket, cap and goggles. "I'd go  down the street, and I'd hear people say, 'There goes Bobbi Trout,' " she  remembers.  </P> <P> She even consented to commercial endorsements for Nash cars and Richfield  gasoline and motor oil.  </P> <P> Those were days of heroes, heroines and legends, and Trout met them all.  </P> <P> Remembering Charles Lindbergh, she said he "was rather quiet and distant. He  had a weak handshake. That was one thing everybody talked about."  </P> <P> She was a friend of Amelia Earhart, who became the most famous American aviator  after she crossed the Atlantic alone. Despite the rivalries among women fliers,  Trout said they were cordial and supportive of one another.  </P> <P> "She was a lovely girl, I liked Amelia very much," Trout said. "She was always  sweet and charming."  </P> <P> In June, 1937, Earhart, 38, and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared during  an around-the-world flight as they headed toward a Pacific island. Some have  speculated that she was on a pre-World War II military intelligence-gathering  mission and was captured by the Japanese, but Trout called that "just  ridiculous."  </P> <P> Trout firmly believes Earhart, who "hated trailing antennae," had the appendage  removed from her craft. She was probably near the island but couldn't find it  or maintain radio communication. Trout thinks Earhart made a fatal mistake by  not taking along a navigator who could also operate the radio. "She messed up  when she didn't take a radio operator with her."  </P> <P> When Earhart was lost, "We were all just sick," she said. After all these  years, Trout's voice still drops when she talks about it.  </P> <P> In the '30s, Trout went on to other famous exploits, including a 122-hour  endurance flight with Edna May Cooper, and a fair share of emergency landings.  She also tried to get hired as an airline pilot, but was spurned. They thought  that, if a woman was flying the plane, "they wouldn't get any passengers," she  said.  </P> <P> During World War II, Trout owned a small defense contracting company, quit  flying in 1946 and spent the years until retirement in real estate and other  ventures. She moved to Carlsbad 14 years ago and wrote a biography, "Just Plane  Crazy."  </P></p>

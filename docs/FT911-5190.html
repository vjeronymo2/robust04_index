			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Academics and value for money Harry Beckers, former group research co-ordinator for Royal Dutch-Shell, used to tell his scientists a story about the difference between physicists and chemists. The tale likened the physicists to dragonflies hovering just above a dung-heap, and chemists to beetles burrowing in the mire. Neither kind of scientist quite knows whether to be flattered or insulted by the image. The point is that neither the dilettante dragonfly nor the burrowing beetle has a good overall view of research objectives. Both can read the situation quite wrongly, leaving gaping holes in perspective that management must constantly strive to repair. A textbook example of such academic short-sightedness is unfolding this year in the UK at the Nuclear Structures Facility (NSF) at the Daresbury Laboratory near Chester, where physicists study the make-up of the atomic nucleus. The Science and Engineering Research Council (Serc), which funds the operation, has rightly decided to close it down at the end of next year because its focus is too narrow to warrant the Pounds 6.6m a year needed to keep it running. Nevertheless, Serc has failed to convince the physicists who use the the NSF that its continued operation cannot be justified. These physicists are now appealing to politicians and journalists to help overturn Serc's decision. Unlike the much larger synchotron radiation source at Daresbury - a sort of giant X-ray machine used by scientists of all disciplines - the NSF is used only by nuclear physicists, not by chemists or biologists or medical scientists, and not at all by industrial scientists. Its future concerns only a handful of physicists and perhaps a score of engineering staff who maintain the complex atom-smashing machine housed there. Other countries have shown no interest in sharing its costs: both France and Germany have their own facilities pursuing similar research. In addition, NSF fails to rate even a mention in a 45-page summary of a quarter-century of scientific achievements published last year by Serc. Faced with having to cut the national nuclear research budget by 10 per cent, the council has decided that the funds allocated to NSF have to go. Approximately Pounds 50m of the total nuclear research budget of Pounds 80m is committed to the 12-nation European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Switzerland. The NSF scientists claim it is a case of 'big science' - such as the Cern project - losing to 'small science'. Sir Mark Richmond, Serc's chairman, says the decision is not as simple as that; some of the most expensive instruments of big science are used regularly by other kinds of scientist. The latest ploy of the aggrieved parties is to try to cast doubt on the competence and integrity of Sir David Phillips, chief scientific adviser at the Department of Education and Science (source of Serc's funds). They suggest that he is too old for the job - he is 51. As Beckers at Shell saw so clearly, most researchers are driven not by some grand cosmic dream of explaining everything but by much narrower ambitions to which their own personal discipline and expertise might contribute. Few scientists want to be managers while they are still finding research itself so much fun. Few research managers take the trouble to explain themselves and their decisions to their researchers as well as to their paymasters. However much scientists may wish it were not so, someone must control and audit the very large sums of cash made available for scientific research nowadays. Someone must ask nasty questions like: are we getting best value for money?</p>

Thursday [1400 GMT] (9 A.M. Washington time).    The agreement includes the date for a third round of  high-level talks between the United States and North Korea,  tentatively slated for March 21 in Geneva.    Laney made the disclosure during a meeting with Deputy Prime  Minister and head of the National Unification Board [NUB] Yi  Yong-tok. Laney briefed Yi on the process and the content of  the U.S.-North Korean agreement, according to NUB spokesman Kim  Hyong-ki.    At the meeting, Yi again stressed the South Korean  Government's position that Seoul and Pyongyang must exchange  special envoys before the United States and North Korea can hold  a third round of negotiations.    Yi and Laney shared the opinion that Washington and Seoul  need to consult closely on the issue, the spokesman said.    If South and North Korea failed to exchange special envoys  before March 21, Yi and Laney agreed that North Korea would be  in a difficult position, Kim added.</p>

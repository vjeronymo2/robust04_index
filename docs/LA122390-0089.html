			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROTEST IS FINE BUT OBJECT IS IN QUESTION  </P> <P> Regarding Greg Roa's letter ("Students Who Protest the Gulf Crisis," Dec. 16):  I'm sorry that he misunderstood the nature of the disappointment in my letter  of Dec. 2.  </P> <P> Roa states that he's "appalled" at my "condescending attitude."  </P> <P> Well, if conclusions based on historical data sound condescending, so be it.  But that's the best way to arrive at conclusions, and the method he should be  learning in his social science classes.  </P> <P> I presented no objections to their demonstrating; this is an American right and  they should exercise it. What I'm disappointed in is the object of their  protest -- our President's decision to protect innocent people and stop a  ruthless dictator. The students are demonstrating against the wrong person. The  scenario is clear if Saddam has his way. History has proven that reward and  appeasement never stop a dictator.  </P> <P> It's not a question of war or peace. The war is on. It was started by Saddam in  early August. The only question is, do we stop him now, while we have committed  allies to help, or do we face him a few years down the road when he'll have the  nuclear capacity to start World War III?  </P> <P> The son, brother, or father that Roa is concerned about now will be comparably  insignificant relative to the numbers that will be involved in the next one.  </P> <P> As an ex-teacher, I'm proud to see students participate in peaceful  demonstrations of their convictions. I just wish their convictions were based  on historically proven facts and sound logic. This failure is why I'm  disappointed.  </P> <P> IRVING E. FRIEDMAN, Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

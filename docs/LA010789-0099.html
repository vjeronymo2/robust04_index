			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 279,000 JOBS CREATED IN MONTH; UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS AT 14-YEAR LOW  </P> <P> The nation's unemployment rate remained at a 14-year low of 5.3% in December  while a brisk economy created 279,000 new jobs during the month, the Labor  Department said Friday.  </P> <P> The jobs report, the last that will be issued during the Reagan Administration,  indicated that the economy will grow steadily but not fast enough to rekindle  fears of inflation. Although investors have feared that a tight job market  would cause increases first in wages and then in general price levels, labor  costs have remained fairly restrained.  </P> <P> The latest unemployment estimate and the report of new employment, which  included 34,000 new factory jobs, were in line with the expectations of  economists and market watchers.  </P> <P> "This report was almost perfect," said Allen Sinai, chief economist with the  Boston Co. Economic Advisers. "It was strong, but not too strong. It leaves me  still wondering when Reagan's luck will run out. Maybe when he's out of  office."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Few Negatives  </P> <P> "We're going into the beginning of the year with a lot of momentum," added  David Wyss of the Data Resources economics forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass.  "Unemployment is at a 14-year low, export-oriented industries keep expanding  and there's not much upward pressure on wages. So I'd have a hard time finding  anything negative in this report."  </P> <P> In recent months, as the jobless rate has edged closer to full employment, new  jobs have surged. Monthly job creation surged to an astonishing peak of 463,000  in November. And factory payroll jobs soared by more than 400,000 for the  second consecutive year -- more than 200,000 of them in the last three months.  </P> <P> Although those factors have led some analysts to fear a sharp increase in  wages, Friday's report found the main wage indicators virtually unchanged.  Average hourly earnings edged up 2 cents to $9.44 after seasonal adjustment,  while weekly earnings declined 25 cents to $327.57.  </P> <P> "This report points up a trend present in most of this expansion," noted Irwin  L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Bank in New York. "While  we had a good gain in the number of people at work, the economy is not  overheating and labor is not jacking up wages. That's the key point. Labor  isn't asking for big wage increases because they now recognize the threat of  foreign competition and they know corporations are restructuring to improve  productivity."  </P> <P> Janet L. Norwood, director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the  competitive position of U.S. manufacturers has improved greatly in the last two  years.  </P> <P> "Manufacturing labor productivity has grown at an annual rate of 3.5% over this  period," she said. "Because increases in employer costs for the compensation of  workers have been fairly restrained, unit labor costs fell by over 1% in 1987  and have risen only slightly over most of 1988."  </P> <P> That key statistic, unexpected but crucial, has been a factor in the continuing  manufacturing export boom that has driven economic growth for most of 1988 and  is expected to keep expanding this year.  </P> <P> Of the 404,000 new manufacturing jobs last year, Norwood noted, a third, or  139,000, were in the export-related industries of machinery and electronics,  directly reflecting "increased foreign demand for products manufactured in the  United States."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most New Jobs in Services  </P> <P> As usual, however, the bulk of the 3.7-million new payroll jobs last year were  created in services, with wholesale and retail trade and medical services  leading the way. Of all non-farm jobs in the United States, 76% are now in  service industries.  </P> <P> In California last month, unemployment declined by a substantial 0.6 of a  percentage point to 4.7%. California is one of six large states with  unemployment below 5%. Unemployment in Massachusetts and North Carolina is  below 4%, and the other tight labor market states are New Jersey, New York and  Pennsylvania.  </P> <P> Large states faring less well are Illinois, Michigan and Ohio. Texas, still a  casualty of the oil industry bust, limps along at 7.1%, while Florida, whose  Sun Belt economy has fluctuated widely during the year, is at 5.5%, just above  the national average.  </P> <P> Civilian unemployment, excluding members of the armed services, was also 5.3%  in December, down from 5.4% in November.  </P></p>

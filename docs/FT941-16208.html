			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses limited in response to overseas advances Senior bourses offered a limited response to their counterparts' strength in Asia, and America yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT hailed a return to the 1993 bull market as the DAX index rose 22.15 to 2,233.79, but share prices had the smell of speculation about them and the index eased to 2,225.00 in the afternoon. Turnover eased from DM10.8bn to DM9.4bn. Commerzbank, with news of its rights issue and higher dividend digested, rose another DM9 to DM391.50 on stories involving Swiss stakebuilding and the bank's insurance subsidiary. There was more rights issue news from GEA, the engineering group, which sweetened the pot with a forecast of higher profits for 1994 and rose DM20 to DM625. Metallgesellschaft recovered to an intraday high of DM238.90, but sank back to DM220 in the last few minutes of floor trading, ahead of tomorrow's meeting with its creditor banks. Cars and construction were favoured. Volkswagen, which unveiled its updated Beetle prototype at Detroit's North American International Auto Show, rose DM9.30 to DM452.50; in construction, Hochtief, which forecast a higher dividend, rose DM26 to DM1,276 but Holzmann did better, up DM39 at DM1,099. PARIS took another step into record territory as the CAC-40 index rose 9.70 to 2,317.25. Turnover remained strong at FFr6.8bn. Activity was strong in the automotive sector with both Michelin and Valeo benefiting from rumours that they were planning separately to raise capital. Valeo, the components manufacturer, closed up FFr13 at FFr1,429 before denying the rumours after the close. Michelin was FFr3.00 stronger at FFr229.10, and after the close announced a FFr3.5bn convertible bond issue. Good performances were seen in Accor, up FFr21 at FFr661, and Canal Plus, up FFr18 at FFr1,132, with some analysts suggesting that investors were looking for recent underperformers. MADRID traded higher ahead of today's press conference from the ousted chairman of Banesto, Mr Mario Conde, the general index rising 2.52 to 328.03 in turnover of Pta33.6bn. However, the Madrid bourse bulletin noted that Banesto, trading outside the official market during its suspension, changed hands at Pta1,400 last week against the last official price of Pta1,995; and the banking group's insurance subsidiary, Union y Fenix, dropped Pta315 to Pta1,795 when it was requoted yesterday. ZURICH, after five record highs in succession, turned down late in the day, the SMI index peaking at 3,058.8 before closing 27.0 lower at 3,015.9. Roche certificates shed SFr85 to SFr6,405, although its 11 per cent rise in 1993 sales was in line with expectations. Analysts suggested profit-taking. SMH finished SFr3.50 lower at SFr212 after selling by one small Zurich bank had pushed the share to a low of SFr207, close to the key SFr205 key resistance level. CS Holding was SFr11 lower at SFr717 as rumours returned that it had an agreement to buy the stake in Commerzbank currently owned by RWE, the German utility. MILAN began badly on fresh political problems, but picked up as recent short sellers returned to buy back positions. The Comit index finished 8.05 lower at 588.85. Some strong advances were recorded. Montedison added L27 or 3.1 per cent to L904 and Ferruzzi put on L74 or 5.2 per cent to L1,505 as the companies completed their rights issues. Strong foreign demand emerged for Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the big Turin bank, which took the shares L320 or 3.1 per cent higher to L10,400. AMSTERDAM was active in second line stocks as the broader market fell back slightly on profit-taking, Royal Dutch, for example, losing Fl 1.10 to Fl 208.60. The AEX index closed a marginal 0.4 higher at 424.45, after touching a day's high of 425.64. Oce van der Grinten, the manufacturer of photocopiers, was one of the most active issues, rising Fl 5.30 or 7.7 per cent to Fl 74.30 following better-than-expected 1993 results after Friday's close of trading. KNP BT, the paper and packaging group, put on 50 cents to Fl 50.00 on news that it had sold that its 40 per cent stake in Ahrend, the supplier of office furniture, down Fl 5.00 at Fl 138.00. STOCKHOLM advanced on the stronger crown, hopes for key rate cuts and positive budget signals and share prices hit their third consecutive all-time high. The Affarsvarlden General index closed 18.9 higher at 1,493.9 with strong gains in banking, real estate and construction stocks. HELSINKI was led higher by a 1.9 per cent gain in the forestry sector, the Hex index rising another 25.9, or 1.5 per cent to 1,724.2, mainly on strong domestic demand. TEL AVIV saw profit-taking after a record high on Sunday, the Minshtanim blue chip index losing 5.56, or 2.2 per cent to 251.26, with turnover at an all-time high of Shk623m. ISTANBUL closed at another record high with the composite index breaking through the 25,000 level, adding 1,762.4 or 7.4 per cent to 25,447.17. Last week the index gained 14.5 per cent with turnover averaging some TL3,000bn each day. Among the gainers, Eregli, the steel group, added TL600 to TL8,600.

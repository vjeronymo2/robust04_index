			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 16 Jun (TANJUG) -- The government of the  republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] has done all it can over the past  couple of days to continue the negotiating process with the  Republic of Croatia on principles of equality and respect for  the sovereignty and interests of the RSK, RSK Foreign Minister  Milan Babic said in Knin today.    We did not make the continuation of the talks conditional on  anything, but Croatia yesterday began its blockade of the  negotiating process in a bizarre way--with a banal demand to  allow five Croatian reporters to attend and cover the Plitvice  talks. By substituting form for substance, they set this as the  condition for the resumption of the talks. They managed to  block the negotiations, as they had decided beforehand. They  even proposed a final text of the agreement they wished us to  sign in Plitvice, the ISKRA news agency quoted the Krajina  foreign minister as saying.    We expect international factors to do all in their power so  the peace process with Croatia could resume with the aim of  achieving a lasting peace, which is in the interest of the Serb  people and other members of the international community, Babic  said while commenting on the postponement of the talks with  Croatia.</p>

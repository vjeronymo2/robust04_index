			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Crown in talks with banks after French bar disposal EXECUTIVES of Crown Communications, the troubled radio company, were last night meeting their bankers following the rejection of plans to sell RFM, its loss-making French radio station. The Conseil Superieur de l'Audiovisuel ( CSA ) decided to block the sale to a consortium which included NRJ, another French pop station, because of irregularities concerning RFM's relationship with Crown. The sale was an important part of Crown's strategy for reducing debt and it is not clear how ANZ and Bank of Scotland, the company's bankers, will react to the development. The sale price was expected to be less than Pounds 4m, despite the fact that the French station's radio masthead was in the Crown books at Pounds 12m. The CSA decision is not expected to affect the restructuring of the main Crown broadcasting company LBC, the London station. Completion of that deal, in which members of the family of Dame Shirely Porter, the controversial Conservative politician will take a majority stake is believed to be imminent. Under the deal LBC would float free of Crown and the banks would receive equity in place of debt. It is now much less certain what will happen to Crown. The CSA said it had taken its decision because Crown had broken French law by secretly raising its holding in RFM above the legal maximum of 25 per cent. The CSA said in Paris yesterday that Crown had been ' very dishonest' in its handling of the affair, leaving it with no option but to ban the rescue plan. Crown's stake in RFM, the authority said, now stood at 70 per cent. The CSA criticised the company for failing to disclose the full extent of its investment and for failing to fulfil a commitment to sell 21 per cent of RFM to the station staff. The collapse of the rescue plan leaves RFM in a precarious position and there was speculation that it might have to go into administration. In October the French courts appointed a 'provisional director' to supervise the setting up of a new board. The station, which has the slogan 'Tous les tops, toute la Pop sans les flops ' ( All the tops, all the hits and none of the flops), has performed badly in terms of both audience and advertising revenue. Neither Mr Christopher Chataway, chairman of Crown and chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, nor Mr David Haynes, chief executive of Crown, were available for comment last night. Meanwhile merchant bank Guinness Mahon, which is putting together a bid for the LBC licence, which will be advertised in March, has opened talked with another possible bidder Independent Television News.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Battle of a 'persistent commoner' The last occasion on which the courts overturned the outcome of a parliamentary election was in July 1961 when Mr Tony Benn was barred from the Commons, Ivor Owen writes. After a long campaign to avoid succession to a hereditary peerage, Mr Benn was forced to give up his Commons seat as MP for Bristol South East on inheriting the title of Lord Stansgate in 1960. In a gesture of defiance which won widespread support, he fought the ensuing by-election as the official Labour candidate, topping the poll with a majority double that he had achieved in the 1959 general election. The courts ruled that, as a peer, Lord Stansgate could not be elected to the Commons, and the seat was claimed by Mr Malcolm St Clair, the Conservative candidate, who came second in the poll. A government defeat in the House of Lords resulted in the 1963 act enabling the disclaiming of peerages to take immediate effect - it was originally intended that it should not become law before the end of the 1959-64 parliament. Mr St Clair immediately vacated the seat and Mr Benn, the 'persistent commoner' as he described himself, was returned to Westminster in a by-election in August 1963.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Barclays warns of longer recession: Stock market falls as bank chairman predicts upturn may still be two years away BRITAIN'S recession could go on for as long as another two years, Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays, warned yesterday. His gloomy prediction came as he disclosed the recession had cost Barclays Pounds 1.07bn in charges to cover loan losses during the first half of the year. It follows a series of warnings by business leaders that the economic recovery is some way off. Sir John's forecast was immediately attacked by the government. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said the prediction conflicted with the views of most independent forecasters. 'The important thing is to avoid the danger of talking ourselves into a sense of almost terminal gloom,' he said. He added: 'We must not be panicked by short-term problems. We have to keep our eyes clearly on the medium-term objective of a stable monetary background.' But Sir John, one of Britain's most experienced bankers, said he detected no 'green shoots of recovery'. He had formulated his views from talking to customers and branch managers. He said the economy was 'bumping along the bottom and I expect we could be well into 1993 or even 1994 before there are genuine signs of a revival.' As a result of the loan-loss charges, Barclays incurred an after-tax loss of Pounds 30m, only the second reported loss in its 300-year history. Barclays has been particularly hurt by the recession in the property market. It has suffered large losses on loans to three property companies: Heron Corporation, Olympia &amp; York and Mountleigh. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said Barclays' figures were 'a more accurate guide to our future than the fiddled forecasts of the Treasury'. Sir John's remarks led to a fall in share prices, which was exacerbated when British Petroleum disclosed that it was halving its second-quarter dividend. The FT-SE 100 index closed 15.2 lower at 2,377.6. However, Barclays' share price gained 10p to 334p, in part because some investors had expected the bank to cut its dividend. In the event, Barclays held the payment, although Sir John left open the possibility that the final dividend would be cut. That would damage investor confidence because only one of the clearing banks, Midland, has cut its dividend since the 1930s. The Confederation of British Industry said talk of no recovery for two years was 'unduly pessimistic'. But it added: 'Recovery is likely to take place very slowly and the economy may not get back to the levels of activity prevailing before the recession within two years.' Sir John had no policy suggestions for the government apart from supporting its commitment not to devalue sterling within the exchange rate mechanism. He said devaluation would inevitably lead to a rise in interest rates. When asked what he thought about plans to revive the housing market put forward this week by Abbey National, the retail bank, Woolwich building society and National Westminster Bank, he noted that their proposals had been 'savaged' by the press. He added that the press reaction was 'justifiable'. Why British banks are singing the blues, Page 13 Lex, Page 14 Barclays incurs Pounds 30m after-tax loss, Page 15 London stocks, Page 32</p>

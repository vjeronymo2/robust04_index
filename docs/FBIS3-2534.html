			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xu Zhaorong (1776 0340 2637) and Shen Hongbin </F> (3088 5725 0393)]    [Text] Beijing, 9 Mar (XINHUA) -- Tian Jiyun, vice  chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's  Congress (NPC), this afternoon went to Hongxiang Building to  visit NPC deputies of Guizhou and Jiangxi delegations and hold  cordial talks with them.    Tian Jiyun had worked in Guizhou Province for 20 years. When  he saw old comrades who worked with him before, he intimately  chatted with them and asked them to extend his regards to his  former colleagues. He said with deep feelings: It seems  people's congresses at various levels will need more comrades in  their prime in the future to suit the new situation. Now we are  establishing a socialist market economic structure, and it is  all the more necessary to strengthen the work of legislation and  implementation of laws. Therefore, the work of people's  congresses will be more and more important and the comrades of  people's congresses will have a heavy burden. Tian Jiyun also  held that young comrades can temper themselves in legislative  work at people's congresses and later work on the frontline of  economic work. He said that in this way they could greatly help  economic development.    In meeting with deputies of the Jiangxi delegation, Tian  Jiyun was very glad after hearing news on the steady development  of agricultural production in Jiangxi. He said: Agriculture is  the foundation for the overall national economic development.  If we stabilize agricultural production, we can have stability  in the rural areas; and if we have stability in the rural areas,  we can provide a guarantee for the steady development of reform.  Touching on Jiangxi's village and town enterprises, Tian Jiyun  said: Village and town enterprises started relatively late in  Jiangxi, so it is necessary to catch up with other localities.  To get rid of poverty and promote development, agricultural  provinces and poor areas must develop village and town  enterprises and rely on economic benefits of village and town  enterprises.    NPC deputies from Jiangxi also made a report to Tian Jiyun  on  Jiangxi's progress in adjusting the structure of agricultural  production and in promoting agricultural production. Tian Jiyun  satisfactorily said: I hope Jiangxi can achieve success in  agricultural development.</p>

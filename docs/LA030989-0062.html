			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> CONGRESS, DARMAN PLAN BUDGET TALKS  </P> <P> Democratic congressional leaders announced a two-week period of negotiations  with Budget Director Richard G. Darman to see if a compromise spending and  deficit-reduction package can be worked out between the White House and Capitol  Hill. Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) of the Senate Budget Committee and his  House counterpart, Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), will take part in the  talks with ranking Republican members of their committees, New Mexico Sen. Pete  V. Domenici and Minnesota Rep. Bill Frenzel. Sasser and Panetta said in a joint  letter that their previous private meetings with Darman had been "frank and  constructive" and should move on. "We propose that the budget task force  discussions enter a new phase: an exploration of areas of possible compromise  between Congress and the Administration on a fiscal year 1990 budget," they  wrote.  </P></p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts stage rally as investors reassess impact of Budget UK GOVERNMENT bond prices bounced back yesterday from Tuesday's losses as investors reassessed the impact of the UK Budget. Longer-dated gilts, which had lost more than a point the day before, gained most, leading to a further flattening of the UK yield curve. Helped by a firmer pound, the market shrugged off the unexpectedly large public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn for next year, content that at least the full-funding rule had been relaxed in order to allow purchases of gilts by banks and building societies to count towards the PSBR. In addition, the Budget did not fuel fears of rising UK inflation, which helped to keep a firm tone to the gilt market. Longer-dated gilts gained most, with the yield on the 9 per cent stock due 2011 falling to 8.30 per cent from 8.33 per cent at the opening. Shorter-dated stock, meanwhile, remained virtually unchanged. This was in spite of a widespread belief that a steeper slope will need to be engineered at the shorter end of the yield curve in order to persuade banks to buy more gilts. During the day, the Bank of England put more index-linked tap stocks on sale. These were Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent stock due 2003 and and Pounds 100m of 2 1/2 per cent gilts due 2016. CONTINENTAL European government bond markets eased in cautious trading yesterday following the latest developments in the former Soviet republic of Georgia and ahead of the Bundesbank's council meeting today. The German central bank does not plan to hold a news conference after the meeting, but traders still expect a half-point cut in its leading interest rates. German government bonds fell on remarks by a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making board that German inflation remained high, which dampened the hopes of some traders for an interest rate cut today. The fall in bund prices was steeper at the long end, which saw a drop of just over  1/4 point, but the drop in the five-year area was limited to around  1/8 point, traders said. The June bund future on Liffe fell to 95.88 from Tuesday's close of 96.13. DUTCH government bond prices followed their German counterparts lower. The 7 per cent bond due 2003 fell 35 basis points to 103.18 to yield 6.55 per cent, narrowing the yield gap below 10-year German paper to four from seven basis points. After the close, the finance ministry said that sales of the new Dutch state 10-year bond reached Fl 5.9bn at the end of its third day on offer, putting the amount raised yesterday at Fl 4.5bn. Dealers expect tap sales to reach Fl 10bn by the end of the week. ITALIAN government bonds showed surprising resilience in the face of weakness in other European bond markets. The price of the March BTP due 2003 rose marginally to 94.97 from 94.85. Traders said the market was underpinned by news that wage inflation rose by an annual 2.8 per cent in January after a 2.2 per cent rise in December. This compared with an annual growth of 4.3 per cent in consumer prices in January. US TREASURY prices turned broadly higher yesterday afternoon, recovering from their morning dive, which was triggered by news of unexpectedly high inflation figures for February. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/8 higher at 103 5/32 , yielding 6.860 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was also up  1/32 , to yield 3.927 per cent. The afternoon revival was prompted by the Treasury's announcement that it will sell Dollars 15.25bn in two-year and Dollars 11bn in five-year notes next week, which sparked retail buying.</p>

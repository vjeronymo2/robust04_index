			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Accountancy Column: A new approach to valuation of the intangible THE NEED to resolve the problem of accounting for goodwill is perhaps the most urgent issue currently facing the Accounting Standards Board. A report published this week by the Research Board of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales* argues for a radical new approach to the subject. The report's basic proposition is that intangibles (including parts of what is traditionally termed 'goodwill' and internally-created intangibles) should be permitted to be treated as assets provided that their existence and value can be satisfactorily justified. Any goodwill capitalised should be amortized against profit over its useful economic life. In no circumstances should any part of goodwill be written off against reserves. There should also be stringent disclosure requirements. The ASB has begun to set out its own statement of principles to guide future standard setting in the UK, which is consistent with the approach adopted by the International Accounting Standards Committee. The recommendations in the report are based on those principles. But there is a fundamental problem which is rarely addressed in statements of principles. Corporate managers do not like accounting treatments which result in lower profits or lower reserves. The former may result in lower managerial remuneration, either because pay is linked directly to accounting profit or because managers might increase their value in the labour market by being seen to be involved in running apparently 'profitable' companies. The latter may restrict borrowing opportunities or increase the risk of being taken over. Furthermore, few managers appear to believe in the efficient markets hypothesis, which suggests that the market can 'see through' accounting treatments. So they prefer to adopt accounting treatments which show financial performance and position in the best possible light in the expectation that this will result in the highest possible share price. As a result company managers are unlikely to favour accounting treatments which force them to write-off goodwill against future profits or reserves. Merger accounting and 're-labelling' (calling goodwill something else) are two commonplace methods used to avoid write-offs. Inconsistencies in the treatment of goodwill, both in relation to other types of assets and internationally, can have economic consequences in so far as they affect managers' investment decisions and distort the competitive position of different companies. Treatments of goodwill most often encountered in practice all have serious deficiencies. Merger accounting solves the goodwill problem by effectively making sure a difference on consolidation never arises. But the report argues that, logically applied, merger accounting should involve the recognition of goodwill and of the fair value of other assets in respect of both partners in the merger. Immediate write-off of goodwill against profit seems unduly conservative and would certainly be unacceptable to preparers. Capitalisation and subsequent amortisation appears to be a recognition policy which is markedly less demanding and introduces inter-period allocations of expenses which are even more arbitrary than is usual in accounting. Immediate write-off to reserves would seem to have only one virtue: it makes an embarrassing number go away. A policy which offers the prospect of combining aspects of immediate write-off to profit and capitalisation and revaluation/amortisation would seem to have much to commend it, from the standpoints of theory (in its consistency with the rest of accounting), informativeness, and acceptability to preparers. The report identifies three components of goodwill, as the term is presently used: (a) the fair value of separately identifiable intangible assets; (b) the present value of benefits arising from combining activities such as economies of scale, and from market imperfections such as monopoly position and barriers to entry; and (c) over - or under-payment. The report recommends that intangibles included in the first two components of goodwill described above may be capitalised as assets provided that the company's directors and auditors are satisfied that they meet the necessary ceiling test and that the amount at which they are capitalised is no greater than their recoverable amount. It will be necessary to apply a ceiling test to the written down value of goodwill each year. The third component should he written off against profit if it represents an over-payment, or is transferred to reserves if it is an under-payment. Capitalisation of part of purchased goodwill will result in inconsistent accounting and in an 'uneven playing field' if internally created intangibles are not treated similarly. For that reason, the report recommends that internally created intangibles may be dealt with in the same way as purchased ones - in which case they should be included as assets and depreciated and should be subject to the same ceiling tests. In view of the difficulty often experienced in identifying the cost of internally created intangibles, it is suggested that their inclusion should be at the discretion of managers, subject always to their satisfying the auditors of the reasonableness of the existence and value of the assets. Because the value and sometimes the existence of intangible assets is often more uncertain and almost always less well understood than that of tangible assets, their inclusion in balance sheets will call for a higher level of disclosure to enable users to form judgements concerning the reasonableness of the values used and the benefits and costs of recognising the intangibles. Disclosures might include the basis on which the valuation has been made, the identity of the valuer and the cost of undertaking the valuation. This would enable users to assess the reliability of the valuations and whether the information they provide is worth the cost incurred. The development of appropriate ceiling tests to substantiate the value of any components of goodwill which are carried as assets is of central importance. They should be based either on a direct assessment of the continuing value of goodwill which has not been written off, using discounted cash flow techniques, or on an examination of the rate of return being earned on the net value of acquired assets. A particular problem is that the assets of many acquired companies are redistributed among other companies in the group. In that case, the ceiling tests will need to be applied to identifiable business units rather than to acquired companies. There are inevitably numerous other practical problems. Nevertheless, the results so far of applying the tests to some actual acquisitions are encouraging and do seem to offer a way forward. Many of the report's recommendations are likely to be controversial: the requirement that all write-offs must be against profit rather than to reserves; the recognition of internally-created intangibles; the explicit recognition of over-payment as a cast to be written-off immediately; and the extensive disclosure requirements. It is hoped that the recommendations provide the basis for an acceptable and feasible way forward. The consequences of the ASB failing to find an acceptable solution to the problem of accounting for goodwill could be as dire as were the consequences of the current cost accounting debacle for the ASC. *John Arnold, Don Egginton, Linda Kirkham, Richard Macvea and Ken Peasnell.

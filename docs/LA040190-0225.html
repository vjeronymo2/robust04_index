			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> In the Mood (HBO Monday at 11:15 p.m., Saturday at 2:30 p.m.): In 1987,  writer-director Phil Alden Robinson, whose latest film is "Field of Dreams,"  made this amusing and lively movie about a local legend, Sonny Wisecarver  (Patrick Dempsey), who as a 14-year-old Willowbrook youth eloped with a  21-year-old mother of two (Talia Balsam) a month before D-day. Beverly D'Angelo  plays yet another older woman in Sonny's life.  </P> <P> Sweet, funny and rueful. (1:40)  </P> <P> The Rosary Murders (Bravo Tuesday at 11 p.m.): Fred Walton's engrossing 1987  mystery illuminates a complex and special world of the Catholic Church while  steadily building suspense. Donald Sutherland excels in one of the most  substantial, reflective roles of his career as a Detroit priest confronted with  a serial killer who murders only nuns and priests. With Charles Durning,  Belinda Bauer and Josef Sommer. (1:41)  </P> <P> Monsieur Verdoux (TNT Tuesday at 11:45 p.m.): In Charles Chaplin's staggeringly  pitch-dark 1947 satire, he bids farewell to The Tramp to play a dapper, devoted  family man who systematically marries and murders a series of women --  including, hilariously, Martha Raye -- for their money. Chaplin's point was  that the ruthlessness of his Bluebeard mirrors the values of the world in which  he struggles to survive. (2:45)  </P></p>

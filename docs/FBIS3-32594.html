			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maricarmen Camacho from Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas </F> State, for the "Vector 21" newscast -- live]    [Text] One hundred PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party]  members from Teopisca Municipality this morning closed down the  road to Comitan and demanded Mayor Hector Alvarez Gordillo's  dismissal. The blockage impeded the transit of shipments of  medicine and food destined for communities negatively affected  by conflicts, because the protesters denied passage to all kinds  of vehicles. A commission of deputies this afternoon traveled  to the area to talk with the protesters.    Meanwhile, the Chiapas State government and the Banrural  [Rural Bank] General Directorate agreed to increase the support  recently authorized for the coastal zone to prevent a  decapitalization to include all Chiapas State producers.  Ricardo Lecumberri Lopez, Banrural delegate for Chiapas and  Oaxaca States, said the measure will benefit all the agrarian  and livestock producers accredited to the organization. He  explained the agreements foresee the pardon of accrued  interests, provisional suspension of all sequestration trials,  creation of a fund to renegotiate past due debts, and channeling  of new credit resources. Lecumberri Lopez said the support will  be granted through Banrural's 12 branches in the state.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Manganese Bronze in black MANGANESE Bronze Holdings, the black taxi cabs maker, returned to pre-tax profits of Pounds 577,000 in the six months to January 31, compared with losses of Pounds 492,000. There is an interim dividend for the first time in two years, with a 0.5p payment from earnings per share of 2.19p (2.3p losses). Turnover rose to Pounds 37.8m (Pounds 33.9m). Mr Hugh Lang, chairman, said overall taxi sales were lower than before, but from November they tended to move forward and this trend has continued into the second half. The vehicles division returned Pounds 13m (Pounds 10m) profits on turnover of Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 20.7m) - sales are lower in the first half of the year. The group reported losses on its LTI Homer sub-assembly business and the continued failure of Fairway Nissan, the car dealership, to break even. The Deans Powered Doors division returned to profits of Pounds 9m (losses Pounds 433,000) with turnover up 46 per cent to Pounds 2.78m (Pounds 1.89m). The components side turned in Pounds 778,000 (Pounds 541,000) on turnover of Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 9.77m). Both divisions benefited from the sterling devaluation. Deans Powered Doors exports about 50 per cent of its products and about 30 per cent of components go abroad. Mr Jamie Borwick, chief executive, said: 'The sterling devaluation may have got us in, but its the quality level that will keep us there.'</p>

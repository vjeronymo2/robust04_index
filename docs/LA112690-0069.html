			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> GENETIC TRAIL MAY PUT PANTHERS AT RISK  </P> <P> A new genetic study shows most of the 30 to 50 endangered panthers in the  Everglades are not purebred Florida panthers at all, but hybrids that may not  be entitled to protection under the Endangered Species Act. Scientists compared  the panthers' cells and found two distinct families. One was apparently  descended from South American pumas set free in the 1950s.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES  </P> <P> The April 30 section contained two letters concerned with the increase in  foreign real estate investments in the United States.  </P> <P> I would like to remind the writers that as American citizens, we are not forced  to sell our property -- except during World War II, when the government  imprisoned citizens and forced them to sell their assets.  </P> <P> One letter writer suggested that legislation be proposed to limit foreign  investment in our country. I would like to suggest that the writer organize his  friends and neighbors into a group that will not sell to foreign buyers no  matter how much profit they stand to make. After all, it is his friends and  neighbors who are deciding freely to sell their homes.  </P> <P> I hope the letter writers will stand behind their thoughts when a buyer offers  them hundreds of thousands of dollars for their homes. Slam the door in their  faces and say, "Hell no, we won't sell!" But please, leave the government out  of it. I for one would like to have an option when someone offers me a good  return on my investment.  </P> <P> ANDREW KO  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Rejection of Pounds 500m plan to be fought A GOVERNMENT decision to reject a Pounds 500m package of commercial and residential developments in an unemployment blackspot is to be challenged in the high court by the receiver of a failed property company. Citibank, the large US bank, and Touche Ross, the accountancy firm - the promoters of the development - had estimated that the scheme would have generated about 9,000 jobs on and around the Isle of Sheppey in north-east Kent. Mr Tony Houghton, a partner of Touche Ross and joint administrative receiver of Lionhope (Kent), says decisions to reject the plans by Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, and Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, were 'fundamentally flawed in law'. Mr Howard and Mr MacGregor said the proposals would have harmed nature conservation interests and would have increased traffic congestion. The plan included provision for a privately financed road tunnel linking Sheppey to the mainland, the expansion of Sheerness Dock and the construction of 3,300 homes and more than 1m sq metres of industrial and business space. Plans for the tunnel were welcomed in 1989 by the Department of Transport, which said it would be bringing forward road improvements in anticipation of the tunnel's development.</p>

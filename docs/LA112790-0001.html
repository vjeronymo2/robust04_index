			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILD ABUSE CASES INCREASE  </P> <P> The statistics on child abuse are truly saddening. However, your articles  failed to mention the ultimate child abuse -- killing children before they see  the light of day.  </P> <P> The entire cycle of abortion, child abuse, spousal abuse and abuse of the  elderly and euthanasia are symptoms of growing stress and anxiety in our  society that no amount of money will ever prevent. A spiritual reawakening of  moral values is necessary from the top down.  </P> <P> Our society's values are truly backwards and confused.  </P> <P> JAMES C. CHRISTIANSEN, Los Angeles  </P></p>

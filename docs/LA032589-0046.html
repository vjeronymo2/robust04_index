			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'STAR WARS' SATELLITE PUT IN ORBIT AND QUICKLY SPOTS A TEST TARGET  </P> <P> A Delta Star missile-hunting satellite thundered into orbit Friday and quickly  spotted a target as it began a key months-long test to develop a split-second  "Star Wars" defense against nuclear rockets.  </P> <P> The payload's sensors passed their first trial within two hours after launching  when they successfully tracked the thrusting second stage of the Delta booster  rocket after separation and during its fiery destruction in the atmosphere over  the Indian Ocean.  </P> <P> "We watched that burn with the sensors; we not only got the second stage  burning but we also got the re-entry and breakup," said Air Force Col. Michael  Rendine, program manager for the Strategic Defense Initiative Office.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Perfecting Technology  </P> <P> Over the next several months, the $140-million satellite is to aim its sensors  at a series of ground-based missile and space launches to help perfect the  technology for detecting and destroying enemy boosters within minutes after  they leave their launching pads.  </P> <P> Researchers will seek to gather rocket exhaust data against the background of  the North Pole region, an area through which attacking Soviet missiles would  travel.  </P> <P> Air Force officials said that the Delta Star experiment is part of research  being done for the Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as "Star Wars," to  develop a space-based missile defense system.  </P> <P> The three-ton satellite carries a laser radar, seven video imaging cameras and  an infrared imager. A Laser Illumination Detection System is designed to spot  ground-based laser firings, a capability that would permit future satellites to  take evasive action.  </P> <P> Using a 48-jet thruster aiming system, Delta Star has the capability to  maneuver into position to spot the blazing plume of missiles and rockets to be  launched over the next several months from the space center; Wallops Island,  Va.; White Sands, N. M.; Poker Flats, Alaska; Barking Sands, Hawaii, and,  possibly, from Soviet launching sites.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Identifying Exhaust Signature  </P> <P> In addition to quickly sighting a rocket plume, Delta Star sensors are expected  to gather information to help distinguish the exhaust signature from such  backgrounds as land, ocean, horizon, space, atmospheric effects and the bright  aurora borealis in the North Pole region.  </P> <P> The polar background information is critical because Soviet missiles would  travel through that region in any attack on the United States.  </P> <P> The launching was the third in a series. In a 1986 test, two satellites tracked  each other and one destroyed the other by crashing into it.  </P></p>

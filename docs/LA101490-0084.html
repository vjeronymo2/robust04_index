			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAREERS OF CONTROVERSIAL ARTISTS  </P> <P> Re John and Ernie Feeney's relationship with the Costa Mesa Council and the  arts: I have to say that if I had anything in the least bit controversial to  present to that community, I'd certainly want that couple on my marketing team.  </P> <P> Who could ask for better publicity?  </P> <P> They and judges and juries of Florida (they seem to have replaced being banned  in Boston) have done more to help along the careers of both good and lousy  artists.  </P> <P> One could certainly argue that 2 Live Crew's and Robert Mapplethorpe's names  would have been on the lips of only a few had not such folk made such a to-do  about them.  </P> <P> I wish I could get my adrenaline up about such matters!  </P> <P> But I just seem to find myself concerned about such minor matters as Iraq, the  budget, the health-care crisis, the lack of response from our state and elected  officials, the homeless, the lack of child care and of mental health-care  services, a foundering educational system and that bugaboo that's been  relegated to the back pages and isn't even mentioned on TV any more -- the  savings and loan crisis!  </P> <P> NORA LEHMAN  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

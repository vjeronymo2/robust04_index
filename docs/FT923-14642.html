			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Chilean private pensions act as a magnet - Leslie Crawford reports on the way foreign fund management groups are moving in CHILE'S experiment with private pension funds is proving a strong attraction to foreign investment. Three European groups are entering the business this year: Banco Santander of Spain and L'Union des Assurances de Paris and Les Mutuelles du Mans Assurance of France. They will be joining Bankers Trust, Aetna and American Insurance, all of which set up their own Chilean companies, known as Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones (AFPs), in the mid-1980s. The newcomers have two main reasons for establishing themselves. Managing pension funds is profitable: Chile's 14 AFPs enjoyed a 48 per cent return on assets last year. The newcomers also are gaining a Latin American base in readiness for business elsewhere on the continent. Mexico, Peru and Argentina are presently drafting legislation to replace or complement their state systems with private retirement schemes; other countries may soon follow suit. Governments across Latin America are finally admitting that they can no longer provide adequate pensions, after decades in which state pension funds were plundered to finance government spending or plug budget deficits. Social security reform could open up a market of hundreds of millions of savers. The reforms are being modelled after the Chilean system. This requires all workers to save a minimum of 10 per cent of their earnings with an AFP of their choice. The AFPs now manage Dollars 12bn worth of funds, the equivalent of about one-third of Chile's GDP. The new system is still accruing faster than it is paying out in pensions. AFPs are growing at around Dollars 200m a month and as a result have become the nation's largest institutional investors. In short, they are the engine fuelling the development of Chile's capital markets. Banco Santander's AFP starts up this month with an initial capital of Dollars 12m. It has a target of 55,000 customers in the next three years. L'Union des Assurances de Paris has side-stepped the problem of starting from scratch by buying into AFP Libertador, which is partly owned by the Swiss Schmidheiny group. Les Mutuelles du Mans Assurance, which already owns an insurance company in Chile, has not yet decided whether it wants to start its own AFP or buy into an existing pension management company. Chile's Superintendency of AFPs has also given the green light to four new domestic pension funds.  Significantly, they are being set up by trade unions, in this case in the banking, baking, electricity and petrol distribution industries.  Chile's copper mining supervisors already own an AFP. Chilean trade unions see AFPs as a new way of influencing company decisions. The seven new AFPs entering the market this year are expected to unleash a fierce battle for customers in what is already a highly competitive business. The law allows Chileans to switch AFPs up to four times a year, and over 450,000 people, 10 per cent of the workforce, do so each year. This freedom of choice is the bedrock of the Chilean system, despite the fact that it creates an administrative nightmare for pension management companies. Mr Julio Bustamante, the AFP superintendent, believes that there is ample room for the new AFPs. 'Our main challenge is how to win over 700,000 people, mainly self-employed or migrant workers, who have no pension cover,' he says. The responsibility for finding new investment horizons for the system also falls on Mr Bustamante's shoulders. His main problem is that the Dollars 12bn-worth of assets now handled by AFPs totally outweighs their investment options in Chile. Provida, the largest AFP owned by Bankers Trust, with 1.2m savers and funds worth Dollars 2.3bn, complains that there are not enough companies on Santiago's small bourse to invest in. Last month, Mr Bustamante authorised AFPs to invest up to 1.5 per cent of their portfolios abroad, after a heated public debate on whether Chile could afford to export its national savings. The superintendent also authorised AFPs to take part in project finance. This, he hopes, will reduce Chile's dependence on foreign credit for investments in public works, telecommunications, hydroelectric dams and the mining industry. So far the response of AFPs has been lukewarm. Their main demand is to be allowed to broaden the equity content of their portfolios. Under present law, AFPs cannot own more than 7 per cent of a company, and equities cannot account for more than 30 per cent of overall portfolios. Mr Bustamante believes it would be unwise to expand these ratios. 'I am challenging the AFPs,' Mr Bustamante says. 'They will have to hire international brokers to invest abroad, and create project finance departments to study new investments in Chile.</p>

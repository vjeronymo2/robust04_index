			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Michael Adler] </F>   [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 23 (AFP) -- A senior Bosnian general  charged here Wednesday that Serb forces have failed to withdraw  a third of their heavy guns from Sarajevo. The comments by  General Jovan Divjak, second in command of the mainly Moslem  Bosnian army, came as UN officials said significant amounts of  artillery remain despite the expiration Monday of NATO's  ultimatum to pull out heavy weapons or face air strikes.    "UNPROFOR (UN Protection Force) played a trick on the  Bosnian  government and Bosnian army," Divjak told AFP. UNPROFOR troops  monitoring the situation say Serbs besieging Sarajevo have  honored the ultimatum.    "Even at this moment the Bosnian Serbs have not withdrawn  all  their weaponry," he said. He estimated the amount left at from  30 to 35 percent of what was aimed at Sarajevo before the  ultimatum. Divjak charged that half of the guns deployed were  simply taken to other fronts, namely battlegrounds in Olovo, 30  kilometres (18 miles) north of Sarajevo, and Bihac in northwest  Bosnia.    Serb soldiers in the Sarajevo suburb of Ilidza were "begging  our soldiers to open fire on them so that they could return fire  and not be withdrawn from Sarajevo front lines and sent to  Olovo," Divjak said.    He stressed that Sarajevo was "still besieged" by 12,000  well-armed Serb soldiers. Moslem defenders number 45,000. Only  12,000 of these are armed but still less well than the Serbs,  Divjak added.    UNPROFOR spokesman Canadian Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman  presented reporters Wednesday with a long list of weapons sites  still being investigated. Aikman said there was a "surprising"  amount of Serb heavy weaponry left in "every location  imaginable" around Sarajevo. The problem was that "a lot of  these positions are in deep snow, ice, in rugged terrain," he  said. He said some artillery was literally "frozen in position"  and could not be pulled out until there was a thaw.    But he said this did not mean Serb troops were not complying  with the ultimatum since Sarajevo was no longer being shelled.    UNPROFOR has said the Serbs have handed in over 260 weapons  while the number for the Moslems is over 45.</p>

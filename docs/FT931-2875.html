			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: CME chief in call for trading reform MR JACK Sandner, head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, yesterday proposed that the maze of agencies that oversee US securities trading be streamlined into one body with cabinet-level status. 'Regulatory reform is necessary if the US is going to stay competitive in the global market,' Mr Sandner said. Financial regulation costs the US Dollars 80bn a year, including the cost of insuring bank deposits. He claimed his plan could save Dollars 300m a year in administrative costs alone. Mr Sandner's proposal, outlined at the annual Futures Industry Association conference in Boca Raton, Florida, would create a new 'super' department for financial services regulation. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversees exchange-traded derivatives, the Securities and Exchange Commission governs equities and other securities, while bank regulators account for over-the-counter swaps and derivatives. 'This sounds like a pretty significant proposal,' said Mr Marc Lackritz, president of the Securities Industry Association, the group that led the SEC attack on the CFTC a few years ago. Mr Sandner proposed to consolidate seven Washington agencies into a cabinet-level department. The agencies include the CFTC, the SEC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (which insures brokerage house investors) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. He suggested the department be governed by a nine-member board and operate in eight functional divisions. The divisions would address banking and insurance, risk management, securities markets, and operational aspects such as customer protection, customer insurance, disclosure and reporting and prudential and systemic risk management. The divisions would share legal, accounting and other administrative staffs, and would have a separate administrative court to hear enforcement cases. The plan will be presented to vice-president Al Gore, who heads the 'National Performance Review' that has been charged with reducing duplication and waste in federal regulation. The Clinton administration has not yet made appointments to head either the CFTC or the SEC. The former CFTC chairwoman, Ms Wendy Gramm, stepped down in January, and SEC chairman Mr Richard Breeden plans to leave his post next month. By April, both agencies, which usually have a four-person board plus a commissioner, will be down to just three board members, with one acting as commissioner.</p>

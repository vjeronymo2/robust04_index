			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yeoryios Karelias] </F>   [Excerpts] What was the outcome of Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou's "romance" with U.S. President Bill Clinton? Did it  promote solutions to our national problems? [passage omitted]    It must be made clear that the prime minister has placed  all,  or almost all, of his hopes for help with the national issues on  the United States. His references to the European partners were  ironic and bitter. He did not neglect to blame the European  Union's 12 equal parts exclusively for the tragedy in the former  Yugoslavia. The PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement]  government's decision to "play everything" according to the  "U.S. card" has its risks. Only time will tell whether it will  be "successful."  <H5>  The Ice Has Broken </H5>   The visit had many sides, at least two of which were  positive, one negative, and some neutral. We cannot predict the  final outcome.    1. The visit "broke the ice" that was created during PASOK's  first eight-year term when Papandreou was not invited to the  United States either by Ronald Reagan or George Bush. According  to one of his associates, it has long been clear that the prime  minister "wanted like crazy to visit the White House at last."  This visit helped enough to change Papandreou's "Third World"  image in the transatlantic "friend and ally."    The prime minister may have disagreed, in Clinton's  presence,  with NATO's decision to bomb the Bosnian Serbs if they did not  retreat but all of his other positions and statements were far  from those made during the eighties when the PASOK government  said "no" or simply expressed "reservations."    Much of the mass media may still continue their anti-Greek  attacks (a lot could be written about the false and directed  reports of some newspapers and journalists and the lack of Greek  reaction) but a change can be seen in the handling of Greek  positions. It cannot go unnoticed that Clinton spoke at least  twice of an understanding of Greek sensitivities and concerns.  It is also important that reports in major newspapers and  magazines moved within the same spirit. Without being  pro-Greek, the reports expressed accurately and objectively the  situation in the Balkans and the Greek views. If there was no  "thorn" in our relations with Skopje [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], certainly Greece could have  played a very significant role in the area and influenced  (although this is extreme) the U.S. policy. Something like this  would not leave the major European countries indifferent.  [passage omitted]    2. The most tangible outcome of the visit is economic  relations. It was probably the first time in Greek history that  a Greek prime minister gathered for a speech several hundred  businessmen, including the leaders of giant concerns. There is  U.S. interest in investment in Greece, especially in tourism  (marinas, casinos), in the medical industry (medicine), in the  food industry, and in high technology sectors (electronic  calculators etc.).    There is equally intense interest in establishing  Greek-American businesses in the Balkan region, which is known  to Greek businessmen. The Americans, who do not want to take  risks in an unknown area (U.S. investments in countries north of  our border are almost nonexistent) "place their bets" on the  Greek experience. President Clinton made special reference to  this issue. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Stagnation on Skopje </H5>   3. Those who expected that upon his return from the United  States, the prime minister would announce a solution to the  issue of Skopje were probably disappointed. After 10 days of  meetings there is stagnation--the term deadlock does not express  the reality. Although Greece was discreetly pressured to lift  the embargo against the neighboring state, it was the first time  that its concerns, which are based on historical facts, as  Clinton said, were recognized so openly and so officially.  Perhaps it is the first time that the United States has urged  the neighboring country to change "the angle from which it looks  at the problem," according to the U.S. President's expression.    We must not overlook that all the negotiations are being  held  while the Greek embargo applies, despite the Skopjean  Government's original position that it cannot negotiate under  pressure. It is also clear that the United States has accepted  the Greek embargo as part of the negotiations and despite  discreet objections that are being expressed publicly by some  U.S. officials, it sees the embargo as a measure that can speed  up the solution to the problem.    Of course this does not mean that the Greek side has  achieved  a triumph. There is no such prospect and everyone has accepted  it. An "honest compromise" is being sought, which is not visible  right now as both countries "estimate" the cost of making the  first move. Many people believe that if [FYROM President Kiro]  Gligorov did not have elections next October he would have  agreed to the proposals of UN mediator Cyrus Vance and U.S.  Presidential Envoy Matthew Nimetz: To agree to change his  country's symbols (He has already agreed to an explanatory  statement that the Constitution does not include any  irredeemable pursuits against neighboring countries).    The question that is being raised now is: How long will  these negotiations involving New York, Athens, and Skopje last?  And what will happen in the second phase (if and when relations  are smooth) when the name issue is discussed? We cannot discuss  this now.  <H5>  "Solve the Problems" But How? </H5>   4. Greek-Turkish relations probably represent the only point  in the talks that the Greek side would have wanted to avoid.  Clinton's urging, not to say demand, toward the Greek prime  minister was more than clear and can be summarized in five  words: "Solve the problems with Turkey." The reason is the  neighboring country's escalating domestic problems (dramatic  economic situation, the Kurdish issue). Greece still holds  Turkey's "European passport" but it is unknown how long it can.  The difficulty is becoming more obvious if someone considers  the importance of the Islamic danger, which threatens the  neighboring country, for Europe and the United States.    5. There is no development in the Cyprus issue other than  Clinton's "personal interest." U.S. officials did not rule out  the possibility of upcoming developments in light of the above  evaluations.    The results of a visit must not be magnified and the visit  itself must not be downgraded, because some results are not  immediately visible. The statement made by the prime minister  as he left the United States is true: "Developments will depend  greatly upon our strategy, tactics, and handling."</p>

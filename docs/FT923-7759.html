			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: TransAtlantic declines sharply to Pounds 27m at six months TRANSATLANTIC Holdings, the life assurance and property group, yesterday reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 34.2m to Pounds 26.6m for the first hallf of 1992. The company's dominant shareholders are South Africa's Liberty Life and France's UAP insurance group. The results were TransAtlantic's first since obtaining a listing on the London Stock Exchange in the aftermath of its acquisition of property development group Capital and Counties. Changes in accounting methods obscured comparisons with the previous year. Interest on Capital and Counties' Thurrock Lakeside properties was capitalised in 1991, effectively adding Pounds 15.8m to income in that year. TransAtlantic's board expressed disappointment with the company's share price, saying that yesterday's opening price of 188p reflected poor market conditions rather than the underlying value of the company. Analysts said that its exposure to property and insurance had weighed on the price, despite the underlying health of the businesses. Transatlantic said its property interests, largely in shopping centres, had held up well, although there had been some pressure on rental income. Earnings emerged at 5.08p (9.16p) and the interim dividend is a same-again 6p. Sun Life, the insurance company in which TransAtlantic has a 50 per cent stake, saw a significant increase in new business with total new premium income up 39 per cent to Pounds 886.1m. However, premiums may be adversely affected by Sun Life's decision to limit sales of its single-premium with-profits bond to Pounds 300m this year.</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Embattled Yeltsin weighs options MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian President, retreated to his country dacha yesterday to consider his political future following his bruising battle with the country's supreme parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies. Government sources yesterday said Mr Yeltsin had little choice but to proceed with a controversial referendum or plebiscite on the country's constitutional future, in the face of congressional opposition. Many of Mr Yeltsin's radical ministers are in favour of the declaration of presidential rule, and the carrying of their campaign to reform the economy to the country. However, the powerful heads of Russia's regional authorities, who would normally organise the holding of a referendum and who have already expressed their opposition to it, are now increasingly sceptical of the president's authority. Senior US administration officials have suggested that the US would not formally object if Mr Yeltsin resorted to special powers, including the suspension of the parliament, but would draw the line at a military crackdown. The Congress, led by Mr Yeltsin's rival Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, ended a stormy session on Saturday after voting which appeared to give it the upper hand in the struggle with the president over who rules Russia. On Saturday the Congress adopted a resolution condemning the President for 'adventurism' and has asked the smaller Supreme Soviet to vote on further limits on presidential power, on early elections, and on parliamentary control of television, radio and the main news agency Itar-Tass. Mr Yeltsin is expected to address the country today, although the main television channel has been on the alert for such a broadcast since Friday, when he strode out of the Congress after it defeated his request for an April referendum. Russia yesterday urged the Group of Seven industrialised countries to target their aid in such a way that Mr Yeltsin's reforms could be seen to be working, said officials close to a G7 'sherpas' meeting in Hong Kong. G7 officials said Russian deputy prime minister Mr Boris Fyodorov's message was well received by the meeting, the first gathering of 'sherpas' before the G7 Tokyo Summit in July. One European official noted: 'Balance of payments support and debt relief do not translate into things people can see.' However, officials said they would have to report back to respective governments and take account of an International Monetary Fund investigation of the Russian economy, under way in Moscow, before any concrete initiatives could be contemplated.

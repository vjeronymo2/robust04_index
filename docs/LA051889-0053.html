			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A BREATHLESS VERSION OF BRECHT'S 'BAAL'  </P> <P> A tumultuous production of Bertolt Brecht's "Baal" has been transported to West  Hollywood by the Project III Ensemble Theatre from New York.  </P> <P> The 20-member SoHo troupe is flying its expressionistic colors at the Callboard  Theatre. The tumult doesn't always make sense, but it frequently freezes your  attention. The production careens and slurps through the lustful adventures of  a wandering poet nicknamed Baal (the fertility god) whose degeneracy swallows  up those around him and, finally, himself as well.  </P> <P> The setting is Germany around 1911. "Baal" was Brecht's first play, written  when he was barely 21 (in 1918), and its roguish elements anticipate "The Three  Penny Opera" and, later still, Brecht's formalized theater of alienation.  </P> <P> Unlike Brecht's better-known plays, "Baal" is pure, rampaging hedonism brushed  with an impish, sprite-like innocence orchestrating its voracious central  character.  </P> <P> Director Charles Otte's sense of gesture and style, with cast members  occasionally addressing the audience directly, seems as true to the early,  experimental Brecht as it's possible to get. This company knows what it is  doing even when the material taxes your patience.  </P> <P> Playing the title role demands a reckless hairy ape who is a child at heart.  And Will Kepper's shirtless (at one point totally naked) bulk and life-gorging  spirit fill the stage with an appetite that is vulgar and astonishing.  </P> <P> Kepper's part-monster, part mirthful satyr is an insatiable drinker and  fornicator, irresistible to women, having and discarding them like grapes.  Finally, he's even a murderer, killing his loyal follower and fellow artist  (well played bv Richard Schiff).  </P> <P> The dreamlike ending materializes with a nice symbolic image conceived by  director Otte. A little boy whom we've seen sitting under barroom tables now  stands bathed in light as Kepper's Baal, spent, ruined and, worse, with nobody  to play with, slips into innocence/death and fades into the glade. All Baal  wanted was to gulp down the sky and the moon.  </P> <P> Kepper is especially fine at suggesting the man/child who grabbed all the toys  and was puzzled when they broke apart in his hands.  </P> <P> The play is rarely staged. It didn't show up in this country until 1965. Some  theatergoers may recall Ron Sossi in the title role at the Odyssey (1981),  which was also a rough, vibrant affair, but this SoHo ensemble is notable for  its visual and musical panache.  </P> <P> The show's opening is as deceptively pristine as a church recital. The cast,  with bell-like tones, is lined up a capella style singing the "Chorale of the  Great Baal" from Brecht's prologue (including the telltale "Baal eats all the  grass and smacks his lips"). The 21 scenes that follow are filtered through  fractured, primitive, expressionist art reflecting Baal's inner pursuit and  painted by Jan. Gillen.  </P> <P> Gillen's brother, Theodore Gillen, composed the original music. And the  producer is yet another Gillen, sister Anne Marie.  </P> <P> The ensemble work is carefully crafted and three of the women etch this  Brechtian canvas with lingering color: the softly pale Hilary Rappaport, the  starkly sinuous blond Christine Sang, and the avaricious, auburn Lucile Ford.  </P> <P>  At 8451 Melrose Place, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 2 p.m.  and 7 p.m., through May 28. Tickets: $12.50-$15. (213) 466-1767.  </P></p>

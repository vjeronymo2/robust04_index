			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Investors pledge Pounds 12m for Crest Sixty-nine City institutions, including the London Stock Exchange, have subscribed for shares worth Pounds 12m in CrestCo, the holding company which will own the new electronic share settlement system under development by the Bank of England. The funds are intended to finance the development of the system which is expected to become operational late in 1996. However, none of the shareholders will have voting rights in CrestCo during the build phase. These will be held by the Bank of England and will only pass to shareholders just before the start of live operations. The Bank of England had been under pressure from the Treasury to ensure that the costs of developing Crest were not incurred by taxpayers and had therefore been anxious to obtain financing from the investment community early in the project's develop-ment. No shareholder will have a stake larger than 3 per cent and the biggest investors, so-called Tier 1 organisations, will have subscribed for shares worth Pounds 375,000 or Pounds 390,000. The Bank said the wide ownership base was to ensure that Crest's pricing policy, operating regime or development plans gave no undue advantage to any one commercial interest or to any one community. Tier-2 investors will subscribe for shares worth either Pounds 200,000 or Pounds 210,000, while those in Tier 3 will have committed Pounds 100,000 per organisation. Tier-4 shareholders will have committed Pounds 30,000 each. Participants are subscribing for redeemable fixed dividend shares with a nominal value of Pounds 250. They will give investors a return of 4 percentage points above the 8 3/4 per cent Treasury stock yield as at October 25. The first dividend will be payable no later than 18 months after the start of live operations. Shareholders will first have the opportunity to sell their stakes two years after the start when there will be a 'rebalancing' to adjust shareholdings in relation to usage of the system.</p>

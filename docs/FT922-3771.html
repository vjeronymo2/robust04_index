			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Short rates softer SHORT rates in the sterling cash market ended the day slightly lower after most of the Pounds 1.3bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England was removed in morning operations. One-month money finished  1/8 percentage point down from Friday's close, at 9 7/8 per cent, after the Bank of England bought more than Pounds 1bn of bills from the market in the morning. The move pushed the overnight rate down to a low of 6 1/2 per cent on the day. At least one trader in a discount house expressed surprise that the Bank had allowed the shortage to be taken out so quickly when sterling is at the bottom of the European Monetary System grid and trading two pfennigs off last week's levels. However, other traders said the Bank was doing nothing unusual in its operations. 'I wouldn't say that bolstering up the overnight would lead to a stronger currency,' said one money market trader. 'The Bank would probably want to reserve a tighter money policy for when it is more seriously worried about a sterling slide.' The remaining period rates finished unchanged. Everything from three-month Libor out to one-year closed at 10 per cent. The overnight ended at 9 per cent. In its money market operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 437m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 310m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 280m for resale to the market on June 29 at 9 15/16 per cent. With the shortage later revised to Pounds 1.4m, the Bank bought Pounds 169m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 205m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The Bank did not operate in the afternoon. Trade in sterling futures had a tone that was less technical, and more bearish about base rate movements. The June short sterling contract traded up three ticks on the day to 89.97. But the September contract went down to 90.15 yesterday, its lowest since the half-point reduction in base rates on May 5. This is the first time that the market has effectively dismissed the possibility of a  1/4 point cut in rates between now and the autumn. The low of 90.15 implied that 3-month Libor in September would be at 9.85 per cent. The closing price of 90.18 implies that it will be at 9.82 per cent.</p>

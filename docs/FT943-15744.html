			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late rise in yen leaves Nikkei losing ground A late rise in the yen triggered arbitrage selling and profit-taking, and the Nikkei 225 average lost ground in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was down 205.34 at 20,629.03 after a high for the day of 20,878.78 in the morning, and a low of 20,627.43 just before the close. The yen returned to above Y98 to the dollar, prompting profit-taking in the high-technology sector and depressing the futures market. Volume amounted to 368m shares, against 391m. Small-lot buying by foreigners and institutional investors failed to counter selling by arbitrageurs and dealers. The Topix index of all first section stocks receded 12.84 to 1,670.65, while the Nikkei 300 declined 2.85 to 303.43 and falls led rises by 701 to 330, with 160 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.07 firmer at 1,352.80. Dealers predicted that equities would trade in a narrow range throughout this week, ahead of the Naples Group of Seven summit tomorrow. A Japanese broker noted large-lot buying orders around the Nikkei 20,500 mark, but more investors waiting to sell around 21,000. Arbitrage selling depressed bank shares. Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank declined Y40 to Y1,890 and Bank of Tokyo by Y40 to Y1,560. High-technology issues, which had recovered earlier this week on the brief retreat of the yen against the dollar, were sold. Hitachi, Y1,070, and Fujitsu, Y1,110, slipped Y30 apiece. Terumo, the medical equipment maker, rose by its daily limit of Y200 for the second consecutive day to Y1,220 on continued bullishness among investors over the company's development of a new three dimensional television screen. Speculative investors continued to buy stocks seemingly linked to the 'hot weather' theme. Traders explained that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the most active issue of the day, put on Y6 at Y817 due to its popular air conditioner, while Mitsubishi Shindoh, an air conditioner parts maker, gained Y8 at Y724. Shikoku Chemicals, a pool disinfectant producer, climbed Y40 to Y625. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 91.07 to 23,252.30 in volume of 41m shares. Roundup Uncertainty about the direction of world and domestic interest rates left most of the Pacific Rim region lower. HONG KONG worried about the weak dollar and the impending end of the US FOMC meeting later yesterday, and a late afternoon sell-off left the Hang Seng index down by 168.27, or 1.95 per cent, at 8,454.92, just off the day's low of 8,449.36. Turnover remained below HKDollars 2bn, registering a preliminary HKDollars 1.84bn against Tuesday's adjusted HKDollars 1.60bn. Brokers said investors were betting on higher interest rates in the short term. Meanwhile, worries about the profits of property developers, the focus of the late sell-off, also dogged the bourse. Cheung Kong weakened HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 31.80 and SHK Properties HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 42.20. SYDNEY surrendered recent gains to sink below the 2,000 barrier on the All Ordinaries index, which finished 12.2 points weaker at 1,991.2 and well below an intraday high of 2,010.5. Turnover was nearly ADollars 353m. Trade was marked by Western Mining's announcement of an ADollars 7.5bn alumina merger with Aluminum Co of America and an ADollars 720m rights issue to fund its side of the deal. The stock dipped 50 cents, or 6.7 per cent, to a two-month low of ADollars 7.02. WELLINGTON fell on sell orders just before the close, the NZSE 40 index shedding 13.19 to 1,984.14. SEOUL saw profit-taking in blue chips. The composite index fell 7.01 to 953.48. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index fell 25.07, or 1.15 per cent, to 2,162.88. Brokers said the sliding US dollar in recent weeks had prompted institutions to sell their Singapore investments as a hedge. KARACHI tried to rise on new account buying early in the day, but institutions and investors took to the sidelines, and attendance at the exchange was poor as rains disrupted communications and power supplies. The exchange closed an hour early, and the KSE 100 index lost 3.32 at 2,296.27 in thin volume. TAIPEI, the exception, concentrated on domestic issues, brokers hoping that the central bank may maintain its loose monetary policy after Tuesday's announcement of June inflation at 2.14 per cent, and the weighted index gained 50.23 at 6,115.18.</p>

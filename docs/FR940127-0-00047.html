			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 7 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 7 states that SFAR 36 terminates on January 23, 1999. All authorizations issued under this SFAR will terminate on that date unless earlier surrendered, suspended, revoked, or otherwise terminated. Section 7 also allows previous authorization holders to either surrender their SFAR 36-developed data to the FAA or to maintain the data indefinitely and make it available to the FAA for inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 8 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 8 prohibits the transfer of an SFAR 36 authorization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9 contains the inspection provisions of the current SFAR. It also emphasizes that the FAA must be able to determine whether an applicant has, or a holder maintains, personnel adequate to comply with the provisions of the SFAR and any additional limitations contained in the authorization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 10 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 10 re-emphasizes that an SFAR 36 authorization does not expand the scope of products or articles that an aircraft operator or repair station is authorized to approve for return to service. This section also emphasizes that the authorization allows a holder to approve for return to service a product or article after major repair performed by the holder using data developed by the holder without FAA approval of that data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 11 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 11 contains the provision that each SFAR 36 authorization holder must comply with any additional limitations prescribed by the Administrator and made a part of the authorization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 12 and 13 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 12 and 13 address data review and service experience requirements and record keeping requirements. Section 12 states the circumstances in which a holder will be required to submit the information necessary for corrective action on a repair. Paragraph (b) of section 13 lists the identification information required rather than use the term ``FAA identification,'' which has been the source of confusion in previous versions of the regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, the termination date for SFAR 36 is January 23, 1999. The 5-year extension was chosen to allow enough time for the ARAC to deliberate and forward a recommendation, and enough time for the FAA to deliberate and act upon it. On or about the effective date of this final rule, each FAA office having jurisdiction over a current SFAR 36 authorization will reevaluate each holder in terms of the amended rule. All current holders will be notified in writing as to whether they continue to qualify under the amended rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA will work with those holders that no longer qualify to establish, where possible, means to perform approved major repairs. The means may include submitting repair data to an aircraft certification office (ACO) for approval, utilizing a consultant designated engineering representative (DER) to approve the data, or employing a company DER. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The extension of SFAR 36 will allow uninterrupted major repair activity by the current authorization holders that qualify under the amended SFAR; those authorizations will be extended without the holders reapplying for authorization. The extension will also allow a new, qualified applicant to obtain an authorization instead of petitioning for exemption from the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons were afforded the opportunity to participate in development of this rulemaking by submitting written comments to the public regulatory docket on or before November 22, 1993. All comments received have been reviewed and duly considered in promulgating this final rule; comments received after November 22, 1993, have been considered to the extent possible without delaying this rulemaking action. Ten comments were received; two from foreign aviation industry companies, three from domestic aviation industry companies, and five from domestic aviation industry associations. One of the foreign commenters only requests a copy of the NPRM and does not offer substantive comments. Of the remaining nine comments, one opposes the NPRM and four support it. The other four commenters do not declare agreement or opposition to the NPRM, but submit comments and suggestions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

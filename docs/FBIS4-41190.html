			<p>BFN     [Text] It will not be long before Kyrgyzstan slips down to  the level of African countries, presidential adviser for social  and economic matters Talai Koichumanov told INTERFAX Wednesday  [22 June].    The country's three-year economic restructuring plan may  prove unworkable unless Dushanbe gets credits from the IMF and  donor countries, he said.    Koichumanov said Kyrgyz industry was in need of updating and  some loss-making businesses should be liquidated.    He said the budget was being filled only to half its  requirements and the bulk of expenditure sent to cover social  needs. Taxation rather than industrial earnings is the main  sources of government revenues, he said.    In his view, government resources are being channeled to  meet  social needs such as grain, energy and medical imports with  money spent for "consumption rather than production."    Koichumanov said that nothing short of foreign credits and  investment could help lead the country out of the crisis. For  this to happen, he said, maximum incentives must be set to  attract foreign investors, particularly leading transnational  corporations.</p>

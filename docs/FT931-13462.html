			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Marshall 'might quit' if curbed SIR Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways and heir-apparent as chairman, is likely to resign from the company if he is not allowed to hold both posts, institutional British Airways shareholders have been told. In recent private conversations with non-executive directors, including Sir Michael Angus, big shareholders have emphasised their long-standing unease about boards which allow a single individual to hold both posts, contrary to recommendations of the Cadbury report. Shareholders have said that in light of the Virgin Airlines 'dirty tricks' affair, that unease has increased. 'We talked to Michael Angus and he told us Colin Marshall wouldn't hang around if he couldn't be chairman as well,' one shareholder said. Shareholders said that because they had been impressed with Sir Colin's management of British Airways, they were unwilling to press for action which would result in his resignation. 'They have appointed a managing director and that is supposed to reassure us that the proper checks and balances are in place,' one institutional investor noted. Meanwhile, some shareholders said they are still not satisfied that British Airways had dealt with the matter fully. 'I feel they haven't tried too hard to get to the bottom of this,' said one investor. He noted that BA's solicitors had conducted a previous investigation into dirty tricks allegations a year ago and found nothing. 'What was the quantity of wrongdoing, what was the number of people involved? Was it just in the UK or was it Japan and the US as well?', a shareholder said. Shareholders said their concern was that if BA failed to react forcefully and publicly, it could be vulnerable to adverse commercial circumstances. 'If any of the competitive US airlines start saying we have anti-competitive practices, it could be trouble,' said one shareholder. However, institutions said they had no desire to see any resignations among the members of the board. Moreover, confidence has been bolstered by personal assurances from Sir Michael Angus that steps were being taken to tighten management.</p>

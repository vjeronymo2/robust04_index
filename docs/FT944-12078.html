			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Probe finds flaws in sixth of insurers Around one in six life insurance companies still showed serious weaknesses and flaws in the second round of routine inspection visits by financial watchdogs, the annual report by Lautro on the sector's regulation says. The report, published today, describes the result as a 'disappointment' although it notes that the position has improved since the earlier round of inspections when a third of life insurers failed regulators' scrutiny. Record fines of Pounds 300,000 were imposed earlier this year on Norwich Union and on Premium Life, and the life industry has been warned for several months that continuing failures would be severely penalised. The report from Lautro, which has now been succeeded as life insurance regulator by the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), shows the extent of contraction in the life insurance sector, with the number of sales agents acting directly for life companies dropping by more than a third to below 94,000 at the end of June. In July 1991 it was more than twice that number. The document admits that plans for inspections were disrupted considerably for nine weeks in the spring by the setting up of the PIA. This involved training monitoring staff and then working on the process of approving organisations for acceptance by the new regulator. Lautro says there have been some signs of improvement in standards, citing the shift in the causes of disciplinary action away from harm inflicted on investors towards the risk of harm, and the fact that the number of investigations was only about half that of the previous 12 months. It notes, however, that there has been an increase in the number of complaints - to 7,143 from 5,775 in the period covered by last year's report.</p>

Our roads are bad.  Our phone system doesn't work. Our flights are inadequate.  But nature is on our side. That's why you should come in now  or you may miss the bus..." This was not meant as a threat to  Thai investors. Nor was it an overstatement about Laos'  abundant opportunities. The senior Lao official was stressing  to a group of about 150 Thai businessmen here over the weekend  that this landlocked country of 4.3 million people is in a hurry  to revise all its investment laws to attractive foreign  investors. But the pace of jumping headlong into a free market  economy will be determined by the Laotians, not foreign  investors.    The new breed of Lao leaders, a mixture of French-educated  intellectuals well exposed to the capitalist system and those  with socialist training from the former Soviet Union who had  fought the Americans from their caves in the northeast in the  1960s, is all set to embark on the path of modernization.    "We must face the facts. We don't have the technology. We  don't have the capital. We don't have the management skills.  We don't have the marketing experience. But we do have natural  resources and the will to move ahead and open our country open,"  intones one of the young leaders in charge of drawing up "Laos  in the Year 2000."    The plan represents an ambitious attempt to put Laos on the  world's economic map. But there have been hiccups. "Some  critics say our development plans are too much like Thailand's.  Well, all economic plans have to start somewhere, based on  certain elementary factors. But I am sure that ours will not be  exactly like Thailand's plan. For example, our rural  development plan will be different. Ours will work -- meaning  that we won't allow the gap between the urban and rural areas to  be a wide as that in Thailand," another senior official says.    The tone of self-confidence is unmistakable. So is the keen  awareness to avoid Thailand's blunder of allowing a single  foreign country to dominate its economic landscape. In this  connection, the traditional love-hate relationship between  Thailand and Laos has been invoked, albeit very subtly, by local  critics here, in the wake of the onslaught of Thai investments  pouring into Laos in the past few years.    Thailand's investments in Laos now stand at 47 per cent, the  single biggest in this category. And the pattern is changing  dramatically -- from small traders moving goods across the  Mekong River to multinational firms based in Thailand winning  major contracts in construction, mining, forestry, finance and  all facets of the economy.    The Thai presence is overwhelming. Anti-Thai feelings may  not have surfaced in any significant degree just yet. But the  danger has been lurking. As a Thai academic who took part in a  seminar here on "Thai-Lao Bridge: Economic and Investment  Prospects in Laos" organized by Nation Publishing Group  suggested:    "I can't help but look back 20 years and find a very close  resemblance of how Japan came into Thailand as the biggest  single foreign investor. We wanted Japan's capital and  technology. But we didn't like the way they behaved towards us.  We were against the Japanese but deep inside we envied their  success as an economic power. That's what's happening in  Vientiane when we talk about Thai investors in Laos..."    In private conversations, Laotian leaders would readily  admit  that attempts are being made to preempt such negative  side-effects in the wake of their vigorous push to race against  time to build up its economic infrastructure. Inevitably,  Thailand, with clear advantages over other countries in this  respect, has become the first to ride the wave of foreign  investments in this country.    "We must face the facts. Whether we like it or not, we will  have to deal with the Thais, yesterday, today or tomorrow.  There is no escaping the fact that we are close neighbours and  Thailand is further advanced than Laos and once we open the gate  it is only natural that our big and rich neighbours would be the  first to knock at our door. That's why our initial efforts will  be to accommodate Thai investors, the good ones of course," said  another senior official responsible for attracting foreign  investors into Laos.    Some "bad investors" have been punished and ostracised. But  "good investors" aren't easy to come by. They tend to be more  demanding, posing tough questions and seeking guarantees on  investment that the Laotian authorities aren't quite ready yet  to offer in clear terms. The bad guys would come in on any  terms, hoping to earn a quick buck, exploiting Laos' resources  to the hilt but the real, solid ones are more cautious, waiting  in the wings, weighing the pros and cons to decide whether to  spend the same amount of money in Laos or Vietnam or Cambodia.  The choice is never easy considering the varying degrees of  uncertainty in all the three Indochinese countries.    But some "big names" from Thailand have arrived, waving  their  drafts of MoUs, or "Memorandums of Understanding", as a way to  test the waters. Thai banks have made inroads in Vientiane and  Thai construction companies have lobbied hard to win contracts  through some complicated rules which require both a good  understanding of how things are done and who to talk to before  gaining entry into the game.    "Everything is negotiable," declared a top Laotian official  in charge of drawing up the ground rules for foreign investors,  responding to the growing complaints from Thai businessmen about  unclear laws and regulations on a number of areas of investments.    The pledge to apply flexibility in all areas might have come  as good news to some. But the same statement also spells chaos  and disorder. "If everything can be discussed, it also means  that what applies today may not apply the following day or vice  versa," a Thai trader says.    The teething problems will be there for sometime. But one  should not interpret the new sense of compromise as a gesture of  weakness. The fierce sense of political independence which has  been the hallmark of Laos' political philosophy through the Cold  War remains as strong as ever. Any adjustments in its political  structure will only come very slowly and after very careful  consideration.    "We are quite convinced that our present political structure  of a one-party system is ideal for us. But changes will come if  we consider them appropriate. For example, our parliament,  which used to be a very quiet and inactive body, has lately been  activated. House debates are a common theme and newspapers in  Laos now have become more critical about issues that affect the  country..." the same official says.    The wind of change has arrived but this tiny country of calm  and restraint appears determined to proceed at its own pace and  with its own style. If Laos appeared to have picked up speed in  recent years, that was only because Laos wants to make sure that  it is not left far too much behind.    As one local resident told me: "We have been left behind for  so long that we have to run very fast indeed just to remain  where we are..."</p>

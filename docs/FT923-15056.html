			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Observer: 0 out of 10 Not everyone seems to be sharing the prime minister's enthusiasm for his citizen's charter. The government has only received 296 applications for its 50 annual chartermark awards - the badge of honour for the best provider of user-friendly service. Given that there are 25,000 schools alone which might have entered, not to mention the hundreds of local and central government bodies, it is not a very high strike rate. Must try harder, Waldegrave.</p>

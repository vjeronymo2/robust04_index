			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / China's imports up 42.3% as trade deficit widens Chinese imports climbed by 42.3 per cent in January compared to the same month last year, further widening China's trade deficit, which exceeded Dollars 12bn last year. The import surge underlines the difficulties facing the authorities in their efforts to calm an economy which grew by 13 per cent last year and which shows little sign of slowing. Customs statistics showed that exports grew by 14.5 per cent in January to Dollars 4.7bn (Pounds 3.2bn) compared with imports of Dollars 5.7bn; a Dollars 900m deficit for the month. China's trade deficit of Dollars 12.2bn in 1993 compared with a surplus of Dollars 4.4bn in 1992. In 1993, imports surged by nearly 30 per cent to Dollars 104bn, while exports grew by only 8 per cent to Dollars 92bn. According to western economists, the authorities are unlikely to resort to administrative measures to curb imports. Among factors constraining Chinese action are concerns about the possible impact of such steps on China's efforts to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Beijing was also thought unlikely to want to antagonise the US on the eve of a decision on renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status. China's trade surplus with the US exceeded Dollars 20bn in 1993. Chinese officials, quoted by the official China Daily, attributed much of the import surge to the activities of China's more than 170,000 foreign-funded enterprises. Imports by these ventures jumped by 116 per cent in January to Dollars 1.07bn. In 1993, imports by foreign funded enterprises rose by 58.6 per cent to about Dollars 41.8bn or 40.2 per cent of total imports. China's weak export performance was partly attributable to a diversion of exportable goods to the booming domestic market. The surge in investment spending led to increased domestic demand for traditional export items such as crude oil and oil products, steel, coal and cement. Weak growth in leading export markets and rising domestic costs also curtailed export growth. Steel imports rose to more than 30m tons, valued at some Dollars 10bn. Imports of oil products doubled to more than 14m tons which reflected both the demands of a booming economy, and China's own flagging oil production.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Ministers urge Tories to unite on policies SENIOR MINISTERS yesterday began a concerted effort to unite the Tories behind a strategy of sticking to their policies, after the Conservatives' disastrous showing in the Christchurch by-election. But there were warnings from some Tory backbenchers that the clear message after the overthrow of what was a Conservative stronghold just 15 months ago was that the government should change course. Mr Paddy Ashdown said that his party's emphatic victory showed the Liberal Democrats 'on a clear upward curve'. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, sought to shrug off the party's lost deposit in the Dorset constituency. But other Labour MPs expressed fears about the implications of the result for Labour in the south of England. The Tory fightback was led by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, who attacked the 'incoherence' of Liberal Democrat policies over the social chapter, value added tax on fuel and the role of British forces in Bosnia. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, urged the party not to look for people or policies to blame for the defeat, since it had already suffered so much from appearing disunited. 'No one should write us off. We will come fighting back, stronger than before,' she said. Conservative MPs seemed inclined, however, to ignore her call not to seek scapegoats, putting Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, and the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel clearly in the firing line. There were also longer-term warnings about the position of Mr John Major himself unless the party's fortunes improved. Mr William Powell, MP for Corby, said that at the very least, ministers should not go ahead with raising VAT on household fuel bills to 17.5 per cent in 1995. Other Tories said it was a sign that taxes themselves were so unpopular with erstwhile Tory voters that there should be cuts in public spending rather than any tax increases in the November Budget. Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, compared the prime minister with a door-to-door salesman, telling BBC radio that in politics as in business, 'if people don't like what you're offering they will slam the door in your face'. Mr Ashdown hailed the Liberal Democrats' success as confirmation of voters' determination to see better government in Britain, and said it was fresh proof that in the 'heartlands of the south' only his party could beat the Tories. Mrs Beckett's insistence that across the south of England Labour was far more often the challenger to the Conservatives than the Liberal Democrats, was somewhat undermined by Mr Bryan Gould, Labour MP for Dagenham and a former shadow cabinet member, who said the result had 'disturbing lessons' for the party. He said the party should recognise that it was still not identifying enough with voters in the south and that it needed to develop policies they would find 'meaningful and attractive'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHRISTCHURCH BY-ELECTION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Candidate/party                              Votes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Diana Maddock (L Dem)                       33,164                           (General election 13,612) Rob Hayward (Con)                           16,737                                            (36,627) Nigel Lickley (Labour)                       1,453                                             (6,997)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Alan Sked (Anti-Maastricht Anti-Federalist) 878; Andrew Bannon (Conservative Candidate) 357; Lord David Sutch (Monster Raving Loony) 404; Peter Newman (Sack Graham Taylor) 80; Tara Bardot Jackson (Buy the Daily Sport) 67; Peter Hollyman (Save the NHS) 60; John Crockard (Highlander IV Wednesday Promotion Night) 48; Mark Griffiths (Natural Law) 45; Mark Belcher (Ian for King) 23; Karl Fitzhugh (Alfred Chicken) 18; John Walley (Rainbow Alliance) 16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lib Dem Majority: 16,427 (C: 23,105)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

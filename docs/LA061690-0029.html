			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> JOHNSON, ERRATIC STEINHAUER LEAD  </P> <P> Chris Johnson birdied three of the five par-three holes en route to a  three-under-par 67 Friday and shared the second-round lead with Sherri  Steinhauer in a $300,000 LPGA tournament at Somers Point, N.J.  </P> <P> Johnson, looking for her first victory since 1987, and Steinhauer, a non-winner  in four-plus years on the LPGA Tour, were a contrast in styles.  </P> <P> Johnson, 32, was steady, not making a bogey in reaching the halfway point at  four-under 136. Steinhauer, 27, had six birdies, including five in a row early  in a round of two-under-par 68, but also had four bogeys.  </P> <P> It marked the fourth time this year that a player has made five birdies in a  row. The tour record is eight, set by Mary Beth Zimmerman in 1984.  </P> <P> One year ago, Johnson was also tied for the lead, with Vicki Fergon. Johnson  eventually finished tied for second.  </P> <P> "Coming back here and having good memories helps," Johnson said. "I seem to  think well on this course. It suits my game.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to consciously change the way I play. I'm just going to go out  and try to play my game."  </P> <P> Dale Eggeling, who reached six under midway through the round, faltered down  the stretch with a double bogey and two bogeys and finished tied with Lenore  Rittenhouse, two shots behind the leaders. Eggeling had a second-round 71 and  Rittenhouse a 68.  </P> <P> Defending champion Nancy Lopez, looking for her first victory of the year, was  three strokes behind the leaders, tied with Beth Daniel, a two-time winner this  year.  </P> <P> Dick Hendrickson's eagle gave him a seven-under 65 and the first-round lead in  the $400,000 Senior PGA Tour event at Syracuse for the second consecutive year.  </P> <P> He sank a three-foot putt for an eagle on the par-five eighth hole, leaving him  one shot ahead of Mike Hill, who was tied for the lead but bogeyed the final  hole after landing in a bunker on his approach shot.  </P> <P> Joining Hill at 66 were defending champion Jim Dent, Walter Zembriski and Larry  Mowry.  </P> <P> Bobby Nichols was two strokes behind at 67, despite consecutive bogeys on the  11th and 12th holes. Bill Collins was also at five under.  </P> <P> Hendrickson, who has never won a senior tour event, led for 52 of 54 holes last  year at the Lafayette Country Club before being overtaken by Dent.  </P> <P> The leader was first off the 6,540-yard, par-72 course, but trailed Hill by a  stroke before an eagle on the par-five eighth hole. Hendrickson left his second  shot just short of the cup with a two-iron.  </P> <P> Hill, who had five birdies in a six-hole stretch, led after 12 holes. Starting  on the back nine, Hill was one-under after four holes, but came back with  birdies on No. 16 and No. 17, both par fives.  </P> <P> He parred on the next hole, then started the front nine with three consecutive  birdies. Hill, also looking for his first tour win, added his eighth birdie of  the day on No. 6.  </P> <P> Nichols was the early leader, with birdies on five of his first 10 holes. But  the 1964 PGA champion fell back into the pack with consecutive bogeys. He  finished with birdies on the 14th and 16th.  </P> <P> Dent shot a steady round with six birdies, including three in a row on the  14th, 15th and 16th holes. Dent, known as a long hitter, birdied just two of  the course's five par-five holes.  </P> <P> American Rick Hartmann shot his second consecutive 66 to keep a share of the  lead after two rounds of a European PGA tournament at Rickmansworth, England.  </P> <P> Hartmann and England's Peter Mitchell were at 12-under-par 132, two ahead of  American Bill Malley and Scotland's Colin Montgomerie.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast] </F>   [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota -- While the candidates who  qualified for the 19 June runoff have started to give new life  to their political strategies to attract popular support, the  government and the economic groups made a vehement call on  Colombians to analyze the proposals of the two contenders and to  vote massively.    While Liberal Ernesto Samper Pizano prefers to seek  increased  support from his party, including its former Colombian  presidents, Conservative Andres Pastrana Arango prefers social  aspects such as employment and education in his government  program. Mr. Samper Pizano said he will focus on the  agricultural sector. He said this sector must be saved to  ensure the peasants continue living on their plots.    Although the directorate of the 19 April Movement Democratic  Alliance will decide what political course to follow this  Thursday, in view of the electoral defeat suffered last Sunday,  there have already been contacts with the Samper camp to reach  some agreements.    The two presidential candidates will start a new and  fast-paced race for the Presidency today. They will try to  maintain or increase the electoral support they received on 29  May. The two of them garnered nearly 5.2 million votes.    Liberal statesmen Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala and Alfonso Lopez  Michelsen are expected to renew their support for candidate  Samper Pizano and to urge citizens to vote.    Despite the optimism of the two candidates about winning a  majority of the votes in the 19 June runoff, groups such as  National Exporters Association and Asoexpro [expansion unknown]  predicted a lower turnout in the runoffs due to tiresome  abstentionism, a lack of political culture, the poor definition  [poca identidad] of the parties, and the enthusiasm displayed by  Colombia for the opening of the world soccer championship in the  United States.</p>

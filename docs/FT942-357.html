			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Endesa lifts regional interests Endesa, the partly-privatised Spanish electrical utility, has increased its stake in the southern power company, Sevillana de Electricidad, and agreed to buy Sevillana assets valued at Pta56.06bn (Dollars 433m). The moves, the result of several months of negotiation, represent the latest stage in a far-reaching reorganisation of the Spanish electrical sector. Endesa, in which the state still holds 65 per cent, is to buy a further 5.9 per cent interest in Sevillana from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, raising its stake from 33.5 to 39.4 per cent. It has left open the possibility of a further increase. The deal will reduce Banco Bilbao Vizcaya's stake to 4.1 per cent. Mr Feliciano Fuster, Endesa chairman, said the company would take a more active role in managing Sevillana. The asset sale, which includes Sevillana's half-share in Eneco, a jointly-owned electricity company in Cordoba, will help Sevillana to offset debts related to mothballed nuclear power facilities. Under a draft law for the electricity industry presented earlier this month, the government is to write off Pta730bn of debt accumulated since it put the brakes on nuclear power plans 10 years ago and halted construction of five power stations. However, the government plan covers only Pta170bn of the Pta258bn figure on Sevillana's books with respect to its investment in the unfinished Valdecaballeros power station in south-western Spain, in which it has a 50 per cent share. This leaves some Pta88bn of unrecognised debt. The latest sale will enable Sevillana to post capital gains of Pta35bn, as well as Pta9bn of gains from asset swaps agreed at the end of last year. Mr Fernando de Ybarra, Sevillana chairman, said the agreement with Endesa provided a 'definitive solution' for the problems created by the nuclear freeze. The company would from now on have a healthy balance sheet, he said.</p>

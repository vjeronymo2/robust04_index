			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Hats off to the revolution: Tony Walker returns to China after an absence of 10 years to witness an explosion of pent-up entrepreneurship It is near midnight at the karaoke bar, and on an elevated stage girls are singing a discordant You Are My Sunshine. Meanwhile, the ladies of the night are brazenly plying their trade among visiting Hong Kong and Taiwanese businessmen. Elsewhere in Asia, the scene might be unremarkable, but in the heart of Beijing it seems downright bizarre, especially since the discotheque occupies a site where, less than a decade ago, stood a drab, Soviet-style hotel whose doors would be closed by about 10pm. Coming back to China after an absence of 10 years produces a sensation akin to what it might be like to be placed in a time capsule and jolted forward at tremendous speed. Many times, in the first days, this reporter had considerable difficulty reconciling some of what he was seeing and hearing with memories of the past. Simple things made the most immediate impact, such as the view from the bedroom of the down-at-heel seventh-floor apartment which, as a family, we had vacated all those years ago, never expecting to return. But now, although the surroundings were familiar - perhaps too familiar - the outlook had changed. Whereas, before, the vista was one of endless rows of anonymous workers' dormitories, in their place had sprouted modern, high-rise structures replete with blinking neon lights, including a particularly intrusive Samsung sign. The main thoroughfare outside, which becomes Chang An (Heavenly Peace) Boulevard as it approaches the central Tiananmen Square to the west, is not, alas, nearly as peaceful as it used to be. One of the comforting sounds of the past - muffled hooves of horses and donkeys dragging vegetable carts to market - has been replaced by the roar of trucks through the night. Traffic, hardly intrusive all those years ago since there were few cars on the road, is catching up with the rest of the world. Traffic jams are now a fact of Beijing life, and are certain to become worse if the city is awarded the Olympic Games in 2000, necessitating a huge capital works programme. Among a kaleidoscope of new developments, new impulses, new sensations, including a dramatic alteration to Beijing's physical appearance, it may be that the most profound - indeed revolutionary - change has been one of attitude among ordinary Chinese. Put simply, the entrepreneurial energy of a big slice of mankind has been liberated. The grinding conformity, which prompted some writers insensitively to liken the Chinese to 'blue ants', has gone, to be replaced by a diversity that should augur well for the future if people continue to be given reasonable freedom to test the system's commercial limits. An interesting sign of the times is the disappearance of the word tongzhi, or comrade, from everyday use. Ten years ago, it was a handy all-purpose way of addressing both males and females, but now it is resented, partly, one suspects, because of its odious associations with a politically repressive past. Whatever happens, the freeing of one-fifth of the world's population from the burden of ideology and dogma, assuming that the new flexibility is irreversible, may well prove the most important development of the late 20th century - although it would be foolish to predict that all will go smoothly in China, or that further upheaval will be avoided. In 1983, when I left Peking - this newspaper along with most others had not yet made the shift to Beijing - the Chinese were still wrestling with Mao Zedong's awkward legacy, with its emphasis on debilitating class struggle. At the same time, people hesitantly adopted the new battle hymn of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and his reform-minded supporters embodied in the slogan: 'Practice is the sole criterion of truth.' Ten years later, the flickering debate about Mao's contribution to the revolution - he was judged 70 per cent 'good' and 30 per cent 'bad' by former comrades - has all but been extinguished. And China has developed in ways that would have been unimaginable a decade ago, and were probably unthinkable in the bleak days after the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy activists in Tiananmen Square. Not that one can avoid noticing ominous echoes of the past in some official attitudes, and in restrictions that continue to be placed on foreign reporters. Never mind that Beijing is awash with banners proclaiming that a 'more open' city awaits nomination for the 2000 Olympics. A recent article in an official magazine by the head of the State Bureau of Secrecy - yes, such a body does exist - urging an overhaul of 'secrecy policy', did not argue, as might have been expected, for less secrecy but rather for increased vigilance now that China had been opened to the outside world. These regressive views indicate that, behind the glitter of economic reform and quite bewildering changes in some areas, old habits and attitudes die hard. In one important respect the China of today is not so very different from the one I remember. Even at the grimest moments, there has always been an 'otherworldliness' about the place, as if a visitor has joined Alice in an Oriental Wonderland. Thus, Beijing's elaborate Olympic Games bid has not been without its contrived and farcical moments. While ideology plays a much less conspicuous role in Chinese people's lives, it remains an important prop for China's rulers who have spent much of the past decade groping for a new formula that would allow maximum economic flexibility and yet not be seen as an embarrassing repudiation of the past. Not until October last year at its 14th Congress did the Communist party finally adopt the Dengist formulation - socialist market economy - to affix a formal seal of approval to China's move towards a market economy. For China's reformers, and the diminutive Mr Deng in particular, it has been a long and frequently bumpy road since the reform phase began in earnest at the 11th Party Congress in October 1978, two years after Mao's death. A decade and a half later - a mere blip in China's history - arguments about Mr Deng's primacy have become redundant; and socialism has been given 'Chinese characteristics' - to borrow the inventive Mr Deng's phrase. All this marks a big leap from the bleak winter of 1979 when I arrived in Peking to find that the city's vast Tiananmen Square was still dominated by portraits of the four 'wise men' - Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin; the all-important process of officially demystifying Mao had barely begun; the scars of the Cultural Revolution had far from healed; the Mao-appointed acolyte, Hua Guofeng, was still nominally in charge; and the late chairman's wife and three of her cohorts were awaiting trial for alleged 'crimes' committed during the 10 years of madness to 1976. What was under way in the spring of 1980, however, were the first, faltering steps towards the creation of a market economy; and this had begun, appropriately enough, among the peasants in Mr Deng's own province, Sichuan, then under control of Zhao Ziyang, who was later to become China's premier and party boss before his fall in 1989 at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre. China's first 'free markets', as they were called, attracted a trickle of foreign reporters who came to marvel at this new phenomenon, which involved a fairly daring repudiation of Maoist strictures against commerce - although it is doubtful that any of us appreciated the significance of what we were seeing then, or could have foreseen the consequences. Not much more than a decade later, the streets of Chinese cities, towns and hamlets resemble one big 'free market'; and along with this explosion of pent-up entrepreneurship has come a colossal improvement in the range and quality of produce. In the Beijing of the early 1980s bananas were a scarce commodity and, during the long, cruel winters, about the only green vegetable available - if it could be described as green - was Chinese cabbage. Now, a respectable range of fruit and vegetables is sold on the streets . . . at a price. Beijing's street vendors have shown no lack of enthusiasm for Mr Deng's dictum that to 'get rich is glorious'. Nor have countless other Chinese who have been leaving their farms for work in township enterprises, or who have vacated steady jobs in the bureaucracy or state industry for the private sector: what the Chinese, with their penchant for allegorical phrases, call xia hai, literally put out to sea. China's leaders in the post-Tiananmen Square period appear to have succeeded in quietening for the time being the restlessness generated by the slaughter of the pro-democracy activists. They have done this partly by repression, but perhaps more effectively by diverting people's energies towards the national money-making obsession. Chinese television, which has undergone a revolution in presentation and in choice of programmes - without trespassing from the party line politically - is also playing its part in numbing the populace, as a young Chinese acquaintance put it. It now serves up a steady fare of wildly popular Hong Kong and Taiwanese soap operas; not to mention the old standard, Dynasty, which was meant to portray American life as corrupt and venal, but whose leading characters probably provide a model for the new Chinese entrepreneurs, lauded in the official press. For me, the intervening years have brought one pleasing development. Contacts with Chinese have been made much easier; although again circumstances are far from ideal. Back in the early 1980s meetings with those few activists prepared to acknowledge that they might have dissident views were extremely risky for the individuals concerned, and would involve furtive encounters in odd places, such as the zoo. Among the many changes that have overtaken China in the past decade, undoubtedly the one that will have the biggest long-term impact, is the communications revolution. Satellites have put millions of Chinese in touch with developments outside, and no matter how hard the government might strive to contain the information virus, the authorities are fighting a losing battle. One positive development has been the explosion in the number and variety of new local publications, plus signs that Chinese reporters are being given relatively more freedom to probe and to report; not that restrictions on political coverage are at all satisfactory from a western standpoint. At a practical level, too, life has been made much easier for foreign reporters. Vast improvements in communications have simplified the task. In 1983, there was no international direct-dial phone system. Calls booked through an overloaded exchange would sometimes take hours to come through and, when they did, the other party was often barely audible. Now there are IDD calls, packet switching arrangements and computer links. Satellite television has also made Beijing seem much less isolated. The contrast could not be greater with the early 1980s, when even BBC World Service Radio was difficult to pick up at times, owing to heavy static. One's first impressions of China after a long absence may not be definitive. But there is no doubt that forces are at work that represent something out of the ordinary. It has become a historical cliche, but the Chinese revolution of 1949 did 'shake the world'. It is entirely possible that the new economic revolution will do the same.</p>

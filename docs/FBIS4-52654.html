			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Important Peace Overture for Removing Danger of War" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- The International  Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea (Cilreco)  expressed support for the statement released by the Foreign  Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on April  28 proposing to the United States negotiations for a new peace  arrangement.    In a statement May 2 Cilreco hailed and fully supported the  important peace overture made by the DPRK to defuse  confrontation and tension on the Korean peninsula and eradicate  the danger of a war.    It urged the United States to affirmatively respond to the  DPRK's important peace overture without delay and called on the  regional and national committees of Cilreco, organizations for  disarmament and peace and anti-war, anti-nuke peaceloving forces  across the world to launch an extensive movement in support of  the overture.    The Dar es Salaam Provincial Committee of the Tanzanian  Youth  Union in a statement May 1 said the United States has  persistently rendered the situation of the Korean peninsula  strained, violated the Korean Armistice Agreement and paralyzed  the armistice supervisory machine for nearly half a century.    It demanded that the United States immediately put into  effect the statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry, withdraw from  South Korea at once, taking along more than 1,000 pieces of  nuclear weapons and Patriot missiles, stop joint military  exercises and come out to the talks with the DPRK.    The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea released a statement  on May 3.    Noting that it has become an urgent matter to take practical  steps for a durable peace on the Korean peninsula today when the  Korean Armistice Agreement has been paralyzed, the statement  strongly demanded that the United States accept the proposal of  the DPRK Government unconditionally.</p>

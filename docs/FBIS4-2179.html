			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by staff reporter Li Wenzheng (2621 2429 2398): </F> "Impact on John Major's Position"]    [Text] London, 3 April (RENMIN RIBAO)--British Prime  Minister John Major's inconsistent attitude toward voting  mechanism reform in the European Union has strongly shocked  British political circles and has also seriously rocked his own  status. Because of uncertainty in the political situation, the  money markets were upset, and the pound-mark exchange rate fell  to its lowest point in five months.    On the afternoon of 29 March, Prime Minister Major delivered  an official statement to Parliament, saying that Britain would  accept a package from the Council of Ministers of the EU to  reform the current voting mechanism. In his statement, Major  defended himself by arguing that the EU had made concessions to  Britain by agreeing that, although veto power remained at 27  votes, a resolution could be postponed "for a reasonable time"  if there were 23 opposition votes and that Britain would enjoy  the prospect of additional provisions in the social charter.  Major also explained that this was just "a transitional  arrangement," as the EU would renegotiate the voting mechanism  in 1996. He said that the EU would be expanded according to  schedule in line with Britain's interests.    People remember that only one week ago, Major was still  using  tough words to indicate that he would not make any concessions  on reforming the voting mechanism, and announced that he would  "fight for Britain's interests." Just one week later, he made a  180-degree turnaround and accepted the voting reform package.  Although he tried hard to play down the impact of such a change  in position, he still faced strong criticism from MP's. Labour  MP's said that Major was "struggling in vain as he knew he could  not win" and once again showed the "political stupidity of the  Major cabinet." Conservative MP's put Major in a more  embarrassing position. Conservative MP Tony Marlow, who has  doubts about the European Community, said that this showed John  Major had lost his "credibility" and "ability to lead the  Conservative Party." He demanded that Major step down and give  up his office to a more capable person. His speech was  described by the mass media as the "fiercest attack on an  incumbent prime minister in the past 30 years," and aroused  strong repercussions in the Parliament. Other Euro-skeptics  said that he "said what they wanted to say." Some celebrities,  newspapers, and magazines in Britain also commented and held  that John Major had lost the trust of the Conservative Party and  the British public, and it seems it is hard to restore people's  trust. In British political circles, a gust of strong wind is  blowing to drive Major out of office.    The trend to unseat Major has also appeared inside the  Conservative Party. Not long ago, four or five members of the  British cabinet disagreed with John Major's idea about  "returning to basic values"; after that, in an investigation of  British arms sales to Iraq, Secretary for Trade and Industry  Michael Heseltine, who played a key role as "political assassin"  in the action to topple Mrs. Thatcher, held a different attitude  from Major and other cabinet members, and this attracted  extensive attention from the mass media. It is generally held  that Heseltine has ambitions to "make a comeback" and has become  a strong threat to Major. Reportedly, in a televised interview,  Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke also admitted that  "when Major has no intention of being leader of the Conservative  Party," he would "be willing to succeed Major." Reportedly,  four members of Major's cabinet expressed doubts about the EU  voting mechanism reforms. Although Heseltine and Clarke  indicated separately on 31 March that they would continue to  support Major, differences among senior officials of the  Conservative Party were exposed. Authoritative people here said  that as Major has no definite views of his own, his leading  position inside the party would certainly be challenged at the  party's annual conference next fall and would be in danger.  According to the result of an opinion poll conducted by THE  SUNDAY TIMES, one quarter of Conservative MP's agree that Major  should step down.    In fact, Major was facing unmentionable difficulties when  changing his position from strongly opposing the EU's voting  mechanism reform to making a compromise. Britain has always had  deep misgivings about the process of European integration, and  the skeptics have a strong influence. Although Major upheld the  point of "returning to the center of Europe," he cannot but make  certain concessions to the skeptics from time to time;  otherwise, his cabinet would often run into snags in the  legislative process and his position would become more unstable.  However, while holding a tough attitude toward the European  Parliament, his foreign secretary demanded that concessions  should be made toward the EU, and this forced Major to make the  compromise he was not ready to make. Otherwise, Hurd would have  submitted his resignation, which would have led to a cabinet  crisis and would have also caused discontent in Germany and  France. Moreover, the four new members of the EU would have  been further pushed to Germany's side and Britain would have  made itself more isolated. Recently, Major indicated that he  had no intention of resigning from office; Secretary for Trade  and Industry Heseltine and Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth  Clarke also put on a posture of safeguarding party unity. It  seems that Major has ridden out another crisis. However, as  some people in the ruling and opposition parties still call for  deposing Major, it is also an undisputed fact that Major's  leadership position has been further weakened.</p>

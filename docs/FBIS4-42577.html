			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens, June 3, IRNA -- Iranian and European Union  (EU) officials Friday [3 June] concluded a three-hour meeting in  Athens described by both sides as "good and fruitful."    It was the first high-ranking talks between the Islamic  Republic of Iran and the 12-member European bloc during the  current Greek EU presidency.    The EU was represented by its troika which consists of the  former, the current and the next holder of the rotating  six-month EU presidency -- Belgium, Greece and Germany  respectively.    An official from the European Commission also participated  in  the long meeting.    "Talks were good, frank and useful," one EU diplomat, who  participated in the meeting, told IRNA.    "Talks went very well and we discussed all issues linked  with  Iran's ties with the EU," said another EU diplomat to IRNA.    One Iranian diplomat described the talks as "good and  fruitful," but both sides made no statements to the press.    The Iranian delegation was led by Deputy Foreign Minister  for  Euro-American Affairs Mahmoud Va'ezi, while Greek Foreign  Undersecretary George Papandreou headed the EU-troika. George  is the son of Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou.    Earlier Va'ezi accompanied by the director general of the  West Euroepan desk at Iran's Foreign Ministry 'Ali Ahani and  Iran's Ambassador to Greece Qasem Moheb-'Ali met George  Papandreou and discussed Greek-Iranian ties and international  issues.    "We want our traditional friendly ties to develop more and  more. I had the opportunity to exchange a lot of bilateral views  on our cooperation," Papandreou told IRNA.    The Iranian deputy foreign minister last night met Greek  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, who is also the current  president of the European Union (EU), and conveyed to him a  message from President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, an Iranian  diplomatic source told IRNA.    The source could not disclose the content of the message but  it is thought to be linked with Iran-EU relations.    Va'ezi briefed the Greek leader on the situation in the  Persian Gulf region and underlined the strong Greek-Iranian ties  in all levels, during the 30-minute meeting at the prime  minister's office.    He also extended an invitation to Papandreou to visit  Tehran.    The Greek premier thanked Va'ezi for President Rafsanjani's  message and accepted the invitaiton to visit the Islamic  Republic of Iran, the source told IRNA.    Papandreou assured Greece's help to promote EU-Iran ties and  his Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will discuss all the  phases of Greek-Iranian relations during his forthcoming visit  to Tehran.    Greek and Iranian diplomatic sources told IRNA that  Papoulias  is expected to fly to Tehran Tuesday.    Va'ezi arrived in Athens Wednesday night for a 2-day visit  for talks with Greek and EU officials on Iran-EU relations.</p>

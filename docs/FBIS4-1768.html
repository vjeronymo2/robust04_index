			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Gao Ping (7559 1627): "The Regional Party </F> Committee Holds a Tea Party of Nonparty Personages To Greet the  Spring Festival"]    [Text] On 4 February, leaders of the regional party  committee and government and various democratic party and  nonparty personages gathered under the same roof to greet the  Spring Festival with a cup of tea, to talk freely about the  region's major achievements in reform and opening up, and to  jointly discuss major plans for future economic development.    Wang Qun, Wu Liji, Qian Fenyong, and Wuyunqimuge attended  the  tea party.    On behalf of the regional party committee, the regional  people's congress, and the regional government, Comrade Wang Qun  first extended greetings and thanks to various democratic party  and nonparty personages who contributed to the development of  various undertakings in the region during the past year. Wang  Qun said: During the past year, with the concerted efforts and  hard work of all people, comprehensive progress was made in the  region's social and economic development, the people's living  standards improved, and the people of various nationalities  lived a secure and happy life. All these helped to lay a  foundation for a sustained, rapid, and sound future economic  development in the region and to usher in a crucial year for  expanding the reform strength and accelerating economic  development.    Wang Qun said: During the crucial year of reform and  development, party and government departments at all levels and  all trades and professions should make their work serve the  overall situation of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform,  expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining  stability." We should soberly and objectively understand the  problems emerged in the process of development, advance despite  of difficulties, work hard to make the region strong, accelerate  the building of the socialist market economic structure,  properly handle the relations of reform, development, and  stability, expand the reform strength, carry out a package  reform with breakthroughs in key areas, and promote a sustained,  rapid, and sound economic development in the autonomous region.    In referring to the major work tasks of the region during  this year, Wang Qun pointed out: This year Inner Mongolia must  break through "five barriers" in its reform and achieve  breakthrough progress in five aspects. First, we must make a  new breakthrough in deepening reform in the rural and pastoral  areas and establish and improve the socialized comprehensive  service system in the rural and pastoral areas. It is essential  to orient the rural economy to the market economic structure,  effect a transition from small-scale farming by many individual  owners into large-scale farming and the market economy, and  establish and develop various service systems that link with the  peasant households, enterprises, and the market. Cadres at all  levels should create conditions for peasants and herdsmen to  march toward the market in line with market demands and actively  guide and organize them enter the market. It is necessary to  clearly define Inner Mongolia's advantages in developing  agriculture and animal husbandry, and invigorate its economic  development with local resources. We should take the market as  our guide, regard economic efficiency as the central task and  increase in the income of peasants and herdsmen as the  objective, integrate foreign trade with industry and agriculture  (animal husbandry) and crop cultivation with aquaculture and the  processing industry, actively readjust the production set-up,  develop "high-yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient" farming  and animal husbandry, give play to the advantages of scale, and  achieve a secure place in the market. It is necessary to  actively develop township enterprises, develop things that are  beneficial to economic development, and give priority to  developing the "dragon-type" economy" with the processing of  farm products and animal by-products as the mainstay.    Second, we should achieve new breakthroughs in reforming  the industrial, commercial, grain, and foreign trade  enterprises. Inner Mongolia Region and various leagues and  cities should attend to reform of large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises and of major profit and tax delivering  households and concentrate energy on helping small, poor, and  deficit-incuring enterprises change their operational mechanism.  It is necessary to accelerate the reform strength and reform  progress of enterprises by sustaining the advanced and helping  the backward so as to encourage the vast majority to move along.  The key to helping state-owned, large and medium-sized  enterprises change operational mechanisms lies in strengthening  leadership. All levels of party and government leaders as well  as enterprise leaders should further enhance spirit, advance in  a pioneering spirit, never delay their work or adopt an attitude  of relying on help from the higher level, and seek development  in the course of development. Third, we should make new  breakthroughs in reform of the financial and taxation system.  We must enhance understanding, seek unity in action, and attend  to reform in line with the financial and taxation reform plans  issued by the state. Reform of the financial and taxation  system is aimed at increasing income and solving financial  problems. Financial and tax departments should exert efforts to  strengthen financial and tax workers and raise their overall  quality in line with the demand of developing the socialist  market economy, change the old practice of collecting taxes in  the office, and collect all taxes that should be collected. Tax  departments, in addition to collecting more taxes, should also  pay attention to actively supporting economic development and  cultivating more sources of taxation. Fourth, we should make  new breakthroughs in reform of the banking, investment, and  price systems. To implement the socialist market economy, we  must study the financial issue and give play to the role of  banking departments as a lever in economic development. While  actively introducing foreign capital, we should also exert  efforts to invigorate our existing funds. It is necessary to  manage prices to guarantee market stability and pay special  attention to managing the prices of daily necessities that are  closely related to people's living. Fifth, we should make new  breakthroughs in organizational reform. We should accelerate  organizational reform to meet the demands of economic reform as  quickly as possible. We should pay simultaneous attention to  streamlining the upper layer, changing their functions, and  replenishing the forefront, select cadres and workers from party  and government organs, institutions, and units who are young and  have a good knowledge of management and operation to the  forefront of production and construction to help in work or to  hold a post in an effort to promote economic development in all  localities and to put human resources to best use.    Comrade Wu Liji also addressed the tea party.    Persons from various democratic parties and the Federation  of  Industry and Commerce, and nonparty personages offered positive  and constructive ideas and suggestions for Inner Mongolia's  social and economic development at the tea party.    Also attending the tea party were Cui Weilin, Zhang Zuocai,  Wang Chongren, Chen Jie, Lan Qianfu, Chen Youzun, and Xu Bainian.</p>

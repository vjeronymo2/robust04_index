			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT LIVED IN HIDE-OUT ABOVE STAGE  </P> <P> An 18-year-old high school student lived for the past three months in a secret  makeshift apartment above his school's auditorium in Sun Valley, improvising a  carpeted home with a bed, a VCR, a microwave oven and a telephone, authorities  said Friday.  </P> <P> Robert Davis used his talents as a stage-set designer for the drama class at  John H. Francis Polytechnic High School to create a refuge from his parents in  an attic-like area above the stage, said the school's principal, Virginia Holt.  </P> <P> "Believe me, it was very, very surprising to all of us that a student could do  this. But if a student is creative and enterprising enough, he can do anything  he wants," Holt said.  </P> <P> Davis was arrested at the school Tuesday morning on suspicion of trespassing  after campus police discovered his hide-out when they apprehended three  companions the night before, Holt and police said. Davis is free on $2,500  bail, said Detective Oscar Caraballo.  </P> <P> Holt, who gave reporters a tour of the garret Friday, said Davis took up  residence there during Christmas vacation, apparently because of trouble with  his parents.  </P> <P> "He had problems at home with his parents and needed a place to stay," the  principal said.  </P> <P> Davis and his parents could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Davis attended classes as usual while he lived above the stage, the principal  said.  </P> <P> Holt said the high school on Roscoe Boulevard has more than 2,300 students  enrolled in day classes and about 1,200 in night school.  </P> <P> The principal declined to discuss Davis' academic record in detail but said  that "he was a rather creative kid" who was involved in the school drama club  and enrolled in a stage-crew class, where he excelled at designing lighting,  sound, props and other technical systems.  </P> <P> Because of his school involvement, Davis was entrusted with a key to the  auditorium, and he made at least two duplicates, Holt said.  </P> <P> The small, triangular room he occupied was among several crannies in an attic  space above the school stage.  </P> <P> Davis painted the room's bare, concrete walls white and installed wall-to-wall,  khaki-colored carpeting. He built a loft space to sleep in and installed a  mattress, couch and chair. He hooked up a telephone to the school's system,  Holt said.  </P> <P> The microwave, and some of the other items Davis used, were taken from the  school, according to Holt. A narrow metal ladder offers the only entry to the  room, so Davis must have installed his furniture and appliances by hoisting  them up, Holt said.  </P> <P> Holt said Davis changed the lock on the room's door, confusing school  custodians who tried to enter and who apparently assumed that the  administration was responsible for the change.  </P> <P> Holt said she had not decided whether to take administrative action against  Davis. A spokesman for the Los Angeles district attorney's office, which will  decide whether to file any criminal charges, said Davis' case had not been  reviewed.  </P></p>

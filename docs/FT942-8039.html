			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Post Office chiefs accused of sell-off plot Post Office senior managers were accused yesterday of conspiring with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to try to achieve full privatisation of postal services. Mr Alan Johnson, the UCW postal union's general secretary, told his union's annual conference that Mr Bill Cockburn, the Post Office chief executive, had been involved in a 'pernicious plot' with Mr Heseltine but this had been defeated at the last moment in the cabinet, partly as a result of the union's pressure. Mr Johnson said the union had 'achieved the first objective in the campaign to oppose privatisation' with the government's decision that Parcelforce is not to be sold off separately from the rest of the postal services. At the weekend Mr Cockburn sent letters to the Post Office's 150,000 employees making it clear that he wants to see the Royal Mail's privatisation. 'This is the only way absolutely to guarantee us all the freedom we need to fight off foreign competition, protect jobs and invest more freely in our future,' Mr Cockburn said. But Mr Johnson said a third of all postal workers would lose their jobs if the government eventually decided to break up the Post Office and privatise it. Until now the UCW and the Post Office have worked closely in support of giving the service more commercial freedom. But the union is opposed to any split of the mail and postal services from counter operations, and to giving the private sector a majority shareholding. The union's leaders are increasingly confident that public opinion will deter the government from complete privatisation and that it will agree to the option of leaving the business in the public sector but extending its commercial freedom. The union believes this proposal will be introduced into Mr Heseltine's consultative document on the Post Office's future, expected to be published next month. Replying to Mr Johnson's speech, Mr Cockburn said yesterday that privatisation would 'protect jobs not threaten them', and accused the UCW of scaremongering. 'Leaving the Post Office locked in the public sector would be a recipe for disaster,' he said. 'The union is being profoundly complacent and living in an unreal world. Time is not on our side.' On Wednesday the powerful Federation of Women's Institutes, Age Concern and other pressure groups are due to launch a campaign in defence of existing postal services. They will demand at least six months for consultation when Mr Heseltine publishes his green paper. Delegates questioned at the UCW's conference yesterday were convinced the government would not proceed with any privatisation plans for the Post Office.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: Losses of Y9bn linked to Tokai's brokerage TOKAI BANK, the Japanese commercial bank, has admitted to incurring losses of about Y9bn (Dollars 72m) through arranging investment deals for its clients with Kosei Securities, an Osaka-based brokerage with which it has a close relationship. The announcement from Tokai highlights the links between Japanese banks and brokerage houses, and has raised doubts about the extent to which promises of profits are routinely made to clients. Tokai insists that it made no such guarantee, which would violate Japan's Securities and Exchange Law. Tokai does admit that loans were made to clients for stock purchases through Kosei and that losses have been incurred through their inability to repay those loans, made over two years from 1988. The bank said it was unable to provide further explanation of the arrangement with Kosei as a legal action is pending against the brokerage from a textile trading company demanding about Y8bn in compensation for losses on securities deals. Compensation of favoured clients for losses was at the centre of last year's securities industry scandals, which damaged the confidence of individual investors in Japanese brokers' integrity. Brokerages denied allegations at the time that the compensation was necessary after clients were guaranteed profits, which disappeared with the collapse of the Tokyo stock market. Kosei, in which Tokai has a 4.6 per cent stake, also admits that the clients were introduced by Tokai and used loans from the bank to purchase stocks. However, it said that no promises were made to clients that the stocks would be resold later at a higher price to other clients.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report attributed to ITAR-TASS: "Only A Shadow of the </F> Sector Remains"]    [Text] The situation in Russia's machinebuilding complex  continues to be bad, according to ITAR-TASS. About 230  enterprises are idle and 240,000 persons are out of work.    This information was provided by Anatoliy Ogurtsov, chairman  of the Russian Committee on Machinebuilding, at an expanded  session of the collegium of this department.    A report prepared for the meeting by the committee's experts  notes that production volume in the sector declined by 14.9  percent compared with 1992. The cutback of a number of items was  especially substantial: chiefly trucks (81 percent), bulldozers  (53 percent), and mainline diesel engines (70 percent). The  production of drilling rigs dropped to 45 percent and the  production of mainline electric locomotives decreased to 33  percent.    The chairman of Roskommash [Russian Committee on  Machinebuilding] sees the establishment of financial-industrial  groups as one of the ways to stabilize the sector. The committee  is drafting the plans for 20 such groups.    The department head believes that the government should  implement a selective state policy of support and introduce  protective export duties on foreign machinebuilding output.</p>

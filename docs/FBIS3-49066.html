			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Republic of Kosova Information Center reports  that the Supreme Court of Serbia continues to detain 10 Kosovar  Albanians who were arrested by the Serbian police last November  on the charge that, allegedly, they and some other persons, as  members of the Kosova Defense Ministry, made preparations for an  armed war in Kosova. The counsels of the defendants have  declared that the arrest of the Albanian youngsters runs counter  to Serbian laws and this presents another flagrant violation of  investigation procedures. The counsels of these Albanian  prisoners have also declared that the defendants are  continuously tortured by the Serbian police.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3504(h), FNS has submitted a copy of this proposed rule to OMB for review of these information collection requirements. Other organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments regarding this burden estimate or any aspects of these information collection requirements, including suggestions for reducing the burdens, should direct them to the Policy and Program Development Branch, Child Nutrition Division, (address above) and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Laura Oliven, Desk Officer for FNS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Nutrition Standards in the School Meal Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The primary purpose of the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), as originally stated by Congress in 1946 in section 2 of the National School Lunch Act (NSLA), 42 U.S.C. 1751, is ``to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's children&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' At that time, nutritional concerns in the United States centered on nutrient deficiencies and issues of underconsumption. Over time, meal requirements for the NSLP, 7 CFR 210.10, were designed to provide foods sufficient to approximate one-third of the National Academy of Sciences' Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA). Participating schools were required to offer meals that complied with general patterns established by the Department. These patterns were developed to provide a balanced meal by focusing on minimum amounts of specific components (meat/meat alternate, bread/bread alternate, vegetables, fruits and dairy products) rather than on the nutrient content of the entire meal. Over the years, virtually no substantive changes have been made to these patterns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An array of scientific data now augments our knowledge by documenting that excesses in consumption are a major concern because of their relationship to the incidence of chronic disease. The typical diet in the United States is high in fat, saturated fat and sodium and low in complex carbohydrates and fiber. The meal requirements for the NSLP have not kept pace with the growing consensus of the need to modify eating habits. Given the importance of school meals to the nation's children, especially needy children, the Department is committed to meeting its health responsibilities by updating the nutrition standards for school meals to ensure that children have access to a healthful diet as well as an adequate one. To accomplish this task, the Department is proposing to have school meals conform to the 1990 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (hereinafter referred to as the Dietary Guidelines) as well as provide proper levels of nutrients and calories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although this proposal would expressly incorporate the 1990 Dietary Guidelines into the school meals programs' nutrition requirements, the Department will consider incorporating into the regulations any updates of the Dietary Guidelines or other scientific recommendations. Specific use of the 1990 Dietary Guidelines will allow the Department to review any revisions of the Dietary Guidelines to determine their applicability to school programs, and will avoid any undue burden on State agencies and school food authorities to make the changes without the direction of implementing regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Scientific Studies Leading to Development of the Dietary Guidelines <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Over the past thirty years a large body of evidence based on epidemiological, clinical and laboratory investigation has established that dietary patterns in the United States are associated with an increased risk of chronic disease including coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes and certain types of cancer (Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health, 1988; National Academy of Sciences, Diet and Health: Implications for Reducing Chronic Disease Risk, 1989). Research summarized in the Surgeon General's Report indicates that five of the ten leading causes of death in the United States are associated with diet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of this accumulating body of scientific research establishing diet/disease links, dietary recommendations for the United States population were developed in the late 1970's. The first of these developed in 1977 by the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, established Dietary Goals for the United States. This was followed closely by The Surgeon General's Report: Healthy People (1979). USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) released the first Dietary Guidelines for Americans in 1980. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Dietary Guidelines were subsequently updated in 1985 and again in 1990. Also in 1990, Title III of the National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act of 1990 (NNMRRA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;445), 7 U.S.C. 5301,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was enacted. Section 301 of the NNMRRA, 7 U.S.C. 5341(a), requires that the Dietary Guidelines be reviewed at least every five years by a panel of experts in the various fields that contribute to nutrition guidance. The task of the panel is to decide whether there is sufficient evidence for altering the existing Dietary Guidelines and, if so, to recommend specific changes. The Secretaries of the DHHS and USDA then make the final decision on whether or not to incorporate the recommended changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The process was first established when the Senate Appropriations Committee, in November, 1980, stipulated that a Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee be established to review the first edition of the Dietary Guidelines and to make any recommendations deemed appropriate. The committee consisted of nine members (three from USDA, three from DHHS and three selected from a list of nominees recommended by the National Academy of Sciences). In 1988, a second committee comprised of nine prominent experts in nutrition and health was appointed by the Secretaries of USDA and DHHS. Pursuant to Section 301(a) of the NNMRRA, a Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee will be empaneled in 1995 to determine whether the 1990 Guidelines should be modified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

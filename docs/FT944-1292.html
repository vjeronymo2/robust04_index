			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / People: New chief executive for BACC For the first time in 75 years, the British-American Chamber of Commerce (BACC) is to be run by an American. Daniel Bayer, below, a New York city official, has been appointed chief executive of the BACC's operations in London and New York. Bayer, 46, a former Fulbright scholar who has a doctorate in mathematical logic and philosophy from Rockefeller University, takes over from Peter Felix. The BACC was set up to foster Anglo-US trade and investment; the job of chief executive has traditionally been held by a British national based in New York. However, the organisation has become increasingly involved in two-way trade and investment between the US and Britain. Bayer has been vice-president for economic development of the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry and its affiliate the New York City partnership.</p>

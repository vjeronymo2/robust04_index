			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / OECD urges Belgium to cut benefits system BELGIUM should consider cutting back its generous unemployment benefits, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD's 1992 report on the Belgian economy, published yesterday, says that it is essential that Belgium clean up its labour market if it wants to reduce its large budget deficit. Belgium is straining to get its deficit - which stood at 6.3 per cent of GDP last year - down towards the European Community target of 3 per cent by 1996, as part of the push towards European economic and monetary union. The four-month-old centre-left coalition has already passed a stringent emergency budget for 1992, including much-criticised initial measures to rein in the social security system. The government is likely to produce a draft budget for 1993 towards the end of this month. The OECD says that further cuts will certainly be needed and adds that 'the sooner these measures are taken, the less draconian they will have to be'. The OECD also criticises the Luxembourg government for continuing to support its manufacturing companies through state aids. It says the policy is one reason for the continued deterioration of the Grand Duchy's public finances, the largest black spot on an otherwise reasonably healthy European economy.</p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Case for Russian 'dollars' In an article on January 20, I suggested that the use of western hard currencies - usually known generically as 'dollars' - in the former Soviet Union was a useful lubricating agent in restarting the market economy before governments were able to launch a successful reform of local currencies. Dollars, I remarked, would draw tropical fruits from the Siberian tundra. Instead of frantic attempts to clamp down on their use for such purposes, secondary western currencies, I concluded, should be encouraged; and the west should even help to provide some more. The suggestion was treated with deafening silence by the travelling army of advisers now swarming over the former communist world. I sensed I had broken a taboo of some sort. The silence has been broken by three economists, one from the University of London School of Slavonic and East European Studies and two from Kingston Polytechnic who have explained why the taboo should be disregarded.* The orthodox theory is straightforward. If a substitute for the local currency - say the rouble - becomes more easily available, the desire to hold it declines. Or to put it the other way round: the velocity of circulation of the rouble increases. As the increase in the money supply in such countries depends almost entirely on the government's deficit, the rate of inflation in roubles will - other things being equal - increase, thus making the inflation problem worse. The fallacy of the orthodox theory is that other things are very much not equal. The first thing that is not equal is the level of output. Although monetarists inveigh against high inflation, they tend in their mathematics to overlook its effect on real output. The paper's authors remind us of some of the adverse effects of high and variable inflation. There is enormous information loss as economic agents become confused about how far any particular price rise represents a relative change and how far just general inflation. Thus the price mechanism loses its ability to co-ordinate economic decisions and the level of output falls. The use of secondary western currencies can enable a price mechanism of sorts to function. But that is not all. In the absence of western secondary currencies, commodities such as vodka or cigarettes come to be used as money; their price relative to other goods is further distorted; and the commodities themselves are taken out of normal circulation. If land is held as a store of value, building may be held down as an impediment to its easy transferability. The authors discuss a possible compromise well known from Latin American experience, that is to use a foreign currency as a unit of account, but to make payments in the domestic currency at the current rate of exchange. However, it is more convenient for all concerned to be able to use the same currency both for making a contract and for settling it, thereby saving on transaction costs. Another compromise is the indexation of contracts. Although better than nothing this too has disadvantages. For the more that prices are automatically marked up in line with a general price index the less scope there is for relative price changes, which again inhibits the functioning of the price mechanism. Indeed, indexation may be more expensive in terms of real resources. In Poland before the currency reform, hard currency transfers, which were the source of the economy's 'dollarisation', accounted for considerably less than 3 per cent of GNP. In Brazil, by contrast, widespread indexation and high inflation resulted in the expansion of the banking sector from 5 to 13 per cent of GNP in the 1980s. There are many more subtle effects. In high inflation countries over half the real money supply may be in hard currencies. But if dollar transactions are illegal, they will not be taxed. Making them legal reduces the budget deficit even in terms of the local currency. Tolerating dollar transactions need not prevent an eventual currency reform. It can even help credibility. For if local citizens are not forced to hold roubles as a store of value they will be less inclined to suspect that the government will deliberately resort to inflation as a way of taxing these holdings. Of course, dollarisation is not a panacea. It does not get round the big political and institutional difficulties involved in privatisation and price reform. Nor does it create resources out of thin air. But as it is in line with local habits and inclinations there is a presumption in favour of it at least as a transitional device. Indeed there may be a case for western governments providing hard currencies not just as a stabilisation fund or for governments to use in buying imports, but directly in loans to local business to put into the circulation. A little unorthodoxy can go a long way. * P Auerbach, G Davison and J Rostowski, Secondary Currencies and High Inflation, Centre for Economic Performance, LSE.</p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Payout near on Maxwell life policy: Pounds 6.5m no-liability offer likely SEVERAL insurance companies are understood to have agreed an out-of-court settlement involving a Pounds 6.5m payout on the death just over a year ago of Robert Maxwell. Final agreement is being held up, however, because some insurers involved in the original policy are arguing about the cause of Maxwell's death. Under the terms of the policy - broked by Willis Wrightson, the subsidiary of Willis Corroon - the full claim of Pounds 20m was payable if Maxwell died from accidental causes or murder. But most of the 150 insurers involved in the policy - mainly Lloyd's syndicates and London market companies - are now thought to be in favour of paying out Pounds 6.5m without accepting liability. Insurance companies and the main beneficiaries have disagreed for months about the cause of Maxwell's death. The main beneficiaries are two companies in the private Maxwell business empire - Robert Maxwell Group and Headington Investments, which are in administration - and the public companies Mirror Group Newspapers, which is trading, and Maxwell Communication Corporation, which is in administration. The proposed settlement, which is believed to have the firm backing of 75 per cent of the insurers and beneficiaries, has been agreed as a way of avoiding a potentially long and costly legal battle. Some companies still holding out against the revised settlement could opt for court action, but insurance sources believe this unlikely because of the costs involved and the uncertain outcome. Some companies have argued that the policy is invalidated because Maxwell said he had no health problems. According to Maxwell's doctors, he was healthy before starting his final cruise. But he is known to have had part of one lung removed, and had been suffering for years from fluid and respiratory ailments. Loss adjusters acting for the insurers remain convinced that the most likely cause of Maxwell's death was suicide, but investigators acting for the beneficiaries believe he drowned after accidentally falling into the sea. Accountants pursuing the assets of the Maxwell empire have identified a further property which they are preparing to sell. Buchler Phillips, administrators to Maxwell's personal estate, have asked property agents and auctioneers Weatherbys to organise the sale of a large apartment block owned by Maxwell and his wife Betty in the French ski resort of Tignes. No price has yet been fixed although the final asking price for the flats is expected to be between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m. The building consists of six apartments bought over several years and consolidated into one property. It is thought that Buchler Phillips and Mrs Maxwell have yet to agree on how the proceeds of the building should be shared.</p>

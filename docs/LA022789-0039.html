			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Linda Gray, who recently announced that she is leaving the cast of "Dallas,"  says that she doesn't want her character, Sue Ellen, to be maimed in a car  crash (the way Victoria Principal was written out of the story) or die and then  step out of the shower a year later to say it was all a dream (the way Patrick  Duffy was revived as Bobby Ewing). Instead, Gray, who plans a feature-film  career and hopes to star in a situation comedy someday, has asked the producers  to keep Sue Ellen alive, hoping that she can continue to make trouble for the  Ewings next season in occasional guest appearances. "I said that I would like  to leave with dignity -- no showers, no auto accidents, no  disease-of-the-month," Gray said. "I really wanted not to die." Shauna Snow  </P></p>

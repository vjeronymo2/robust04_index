			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Hobby-Horses: Gone, but not forgotten TODAY IS the centenary of one of the most momentous struggles of modern European history. The date you may have forgotten: the battle, surely not. May 4 1891 was, of course, the day when Professor Moriarty, the 'Napoleon of crime', grappled above the Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland with the world's wisest detective, Sherlock Holmes. To mark the centenary, a party of 100 Sherlockologists has been journeying towards Meiringen and the Reichenbach Falls. The pilgrims are clad entirely in late-Victorian and Edwardian costume: en route to the Falls, they will have stopped at various Swiss stations, and been greeted by local mayors and brass bands. Negotiating Alpine paths in spats and knickerbockers must be more than compensated by celebrity in those immaculate Swiss railway stations; and it is right to call these people pilgrims, for they are bound for the site of a miracle. Holmes was declared dead; he returned to life, and as far as anyone knows, is agelessly pursuing apiculture somewhere on the Sussex Downs. It has been put about by one of the many learned members of the Sherlock Holmes Society that the death and three-year disappearance of the detective was really a severe nervous breakdown, brought on by the strain of tackling Moriarty and his henchmen. This hypothesis is typical of the Sherlockologists: like Holmes himself, they like to produce the occasional monograph. The Swiss excursion is the most ambitious of their activities; otherwise, they meet up for an annual dinner on January 6, to honour the sleuth's birthday, and stage jaunts to inspect the locations of his cases. Conan Doyle always left a few clues: a house embroidered with wisteria here, a suspicious thicket there - enough to get the Sherlockologists rifling through back numbers of The Times, and checking Met Office records, to quibble over exact dates and places. The Sherlock Holmes Society has a membership 1,000 strong. Its secretary would rather his name were not given here: he can hardly cope with the volume of correspondence he receives as it is. This doesn't surprise me. The Holmes stories are, as George Orwell memorably categorised them, Good Bad Books; I don't think there are any Better Bad Books, in fact. The formulaic writing nauseated even Conan Doyle himself, but in many respects it has worn more hardily than the style of Conan Doyle's disciple, PG Wodehouse. We still like to read with frissons of horror about crimes in Upper Norwood and althoughBaker Street is now infested with tarts in our imaginations it still contains a drug addict with the sharpest of wits, a scholar who can go five rounds of fisticuffs with the biggest bar bully - a hawkish physiognomy over a violin or Bunsen burner. He is so much more rounded than modern demi-gods: it is no wonder we will not let him die. But a sort of immortality is secured for Sherlock Holmes on a firmer basis than pure literary charisma. As the Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg has demonstrated, the detective techniques of Sherlock Holmes epitomise modern faith in scientific inquiry. The powers of deduction with which Holmes so frequently amazes Watson, and the stolid coppers of Scotland Yard, amount to a method of determining truth through minutiae: discarded cigar butts, scuffs on a boot heel, a singular ear lobe. As a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles, of things that the less observant overlook, Holmes aligns himself to Giovanni Morelli, who in the last century established the science of connoisseurship and attribution in art, by identifying unsigned Botticelli paintings according to the tiny anatomical similarities shared with figures in pictures actually signed by Botticelli; and Holmes joins Sigmund Freud, who revealed the subconscious as the fount of personality. Detective, art connoisseur, psychologist: each requires the same expertise of decipherment, each assumes that there are clues to knowledge which need interpretation. How many Sherlockologists are doctors I don't know: but MoreIIi, Freud and Arthur Conan Doyle all had medical backgrounds, and I imagine that Sherlock Holmes will remain popular for as long as we respect his model of clinical detachment.</p>

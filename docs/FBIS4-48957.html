Focusing on the 20-character working  guideline--seizing the favorable opportunities, deepening  reform, expanding opening up, promoting development and  maintaining stability--worked out by the central authorities,  the participants analyzed the situation, sought ideological  unity, and clarified their thinking in light of the practical  reality, and especially the new situation and problems arising  in the course of implementing the state's series of reform  measures this year.    A total of more than 40 people attended the study class,  including responsible comrades of the provincial party  committee, the provincial people's congress standing committee,  the provincial government, and the provincial committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; the party  secretaries of various cities; and the responsible persons of  relevant departments directly under provincial authorities.

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Debt talks need patience and trust - The mechanics of complex reconstructions Shareholders in Queens Moat Houses may not believe it, but they are relatively lucky to get proposals to resolve their company's financial crisis so quickly. Compare the 20 months it took Barclays to guide all but one of Queens Moat's 74 lenders towards agreement, with the three years which shareholders in Heron Group have had to wait. The long delays are symptomatic of the increasingly complex nature of debt reconstructions over the last decade. 'The corporate crises of the early 1970s were easier to deal with because there were fewer companies with multi-bank facilities,' said Mr Eddie Theobald, who led the Queens Moat reconstruction talks for Barclays Bank. Multi-bank facilities are a legacy of London's rapid expansion as a financial centre in the 1980s. With more foreign banks anxious to establish a presence in London, companies had no difficulty in raising loans from a variety of sources. This makes untangling the financial web when companies fall into difficulty a Herculean task. 'If you are dealing with a multi-bank company and the area of lending covers a number of jurisdictions, you know you have a problem in putting a reconstruction together,' said Mr Theobald. Debt reconstructions are generally sparked by a cash crisis which puts the company in danger of insolvency. The first step in a reconstruction involving a number of lenders is to appoint a lead bank. In general, the bank with the largest exposure, if it is a UK clearing bank, will be asked to adopt the lead position. In Queens Moat's case, this role was given to Barclays. 'The first thing the lead bank must do is maintain stability,' said Mr Theobald. 'It has to keep things even so we do not witness an undignified scramble, with the banks cutting their lines and running for cover.' The lead bank will then call for an all-bank meeting, preferably within seven days, at which the lenders will be briefed on the financial situation and offered proposals for solving the difficulties. This is where the reconstruction is likely to hit its first wall. If the lead bank cannot offer proposals in time for the all-bank meeting, it will have to ask the lenders to agree to a debt standstill. Some lenders will be reluctant to do so until they have all the financial information. Generally, however, even if some refuse to sign, the principles of a standstill are adhered to until the information is available. Nevertheless, this increases uncertainty in a situation where all the lenders must trust each other not to pull the plug. The first all-bank meeting is also important as it appoints a steering committee to represent all the different types of lenders, both large and small. In Queens Moat's case these included lessors, debenture stockholders and straightforward term lenders. The meeting will also begin to establish the blueprint for the ranking of creditors, their strengths and weaknesses in relation to each other. The so-called dividend model is maintained throughout the debt negotiations and will determine the returns to various lenders when a reconstruction package is devised. One of the most difficult tasks facing the steering committee will be to get each bank to agree its relative position. This is where the Queens Moat reconstruction could yet fall down. One creditor is unhappy with its position in the dividend model and is vigorously resisting the package unveiled last week. . This is understood to be Trust Company of the West, the California-based debt trader. TCW bought its share of the Queens Moat debt in the secondary market. The emergence of the debt trading industry, largely out of the US, is the greatest threat to what bankers in the UK call the London Approach. The heart of the London Approach is described by Mr Theobald as 'exercising forebearance'. When a company faces insolvency the lenders decide to support it until enough information is gathered to determine whether it is viable. Debt traders, however, have different agendas. Their interest is in making a quick turn on the investment, and the potential loss will be much less than that facing the original lenders. 'There is only one or two cases where debt traders bought debt from an unhappy bank and increased the stability,' says Mr Theobald. 'Our experience is that it leads to additional complexity.' If the debt traders are particularly unco-operative, the company could fail. So far, Queens Moat's bankers and advisers are confident the outstanding lender will eventually come on board. However, the temptation for TCW to look out for its own interests could yet bring the company down.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: TOP TROMBONIST ANDERSON BRINGS QUARTET  TO ELARIO'S  </P> <P> Serious jazz buffs know about Ray Anderson, but a casual listener might well  ask "Ray who?"  </P> <P> Anderson finds himself in the role of the underdog, trying build a career as a  leader around the trombone, an instrument that hasn't always fared well in a  leadership role.  </P> <P> Yet Anderson, who plays Elario's Monday and Tuesday nights, is forging ahead.  He has been voted best trombonist in the Downbeat Critics Poll for the last  four years. His newest album, "What Because," includes pianist John Hicks, whom  many believe to be one of the underrated greats. Anderson is quick enough and  imaginative enough to carry a solo as well as a trumpet or sax player. He sings  in a raspy growl reminiscent of Louis Armstrong and has played or recorded with  Carla Bley, Charlie Haden, John Scofield, Anthony Braxton and Henry Threadgill.  And for years, Anderson made his living in funk-band horn sections and recorded  an album with a group called the Slickaphonics.  </P> <P> At Elario's, Anderson will be joined by pianist Amina Claudine Myers, who also  worked with Haden, plus bassist Mark Helias and drummer Dion Parson. There will  be two shows nightly, at 8:30 and 10:30.  </P> <P> Pianist-keyboard man David Benoit proved his musical prowess once and for all  with last year's "Waiting for Spring." On that album, he departed from his  usual dreamy, electric light jazz for some stirring acoustic jazz. Benoit's  next album will mark a return to the electric mode. Benoit, a staple of light  jazz radio, plays Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay this Sunday at 7 and 9.  </P> <P> Del Mar guitarist Peter Sprague is everywhere this week. Today, he plays the  San Diego Museum of Art's "Jazz After Work" series at 4:30 on the steps of the  museum, in Balboa Park. Vocalist Coral Thuet will be featured on several  Brazilian tunes by such musicians as Antonio Carlos Jobim, Milton Nascimento,  Djavan and Joao Bosco. Tonight, Sprague's trio plays the Full Moon Cafe in  Encinitas; Friday night, the city of Carlsbad's TGIF Jazz series at Stage Coach  Park (3420 Camino de los Coches); and Saturday night, Diego's Loft in Pacific  Beach, above Diego's Mexican restaurant.  </P> <P> These days, the trio's sets include several Brazilian-flavored songs written by  guitarist Pat Metheny, with whom a young Sprague studied in Boston during the  late 1970s.  </P> <P> "They have such strong melodies, they can be done in a lot of contexts,"  Sprague said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the business side of his career is on a new path. He recently signed  with a new manager, Dick Deutsch, who formerly managed the late guitarist Emily  Remler. Deutsch's first task will be to shop around Sprague's demo tape in  search of an album deal.  </P> <P> Top local pianist Randy Porter, who works regularly with singer Diane Schuur  and behind several top players at Elario's, is moving to Oregon in September.  </P> <P> Porter, wife Cindy and month-old daughter Rachel Emily will live in a suburb of  Portland, which Porter thinks might be a great place to raise a family.  </P> <P> "A lot of people wonder why, when things seem to be going so well here, I would  want to move up there," Porter said. "It's kind of a personal thing, for  creative growth I want to achieve, which even takes priority over playing with  other people. Being in a natural environment for me is more stimulating. Some  people thrive around cement, but I like being around trees.  </P> <P> Porter hopes to maintain his association with the young San Diego  straight-ahead jazz band Common Ground, which also includes Steve Feierabend,  Dave Marr and Tim McMahon. He hopes to return to Southern California often to  play with Schuur and others. Porter plays the San Diego Museum of Art's "Jazz  After Work" series with saxophonist Charles McPherson Aug. 16 at 4:30. He  appears with Schuur Aug. 9 at The Strand in Redondo Beach; Aug. 10 at  Humphrey's in San Diego; and Aug. 11 at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> During the Korean War years, Joe Franc played French horn with the 93rd Army  Band, attached to the AAA (Anti-Aircraft Artillery) branch of the Army. Among  his band mates: San Diegans Rod Cradit, Tony Higgins and John Pecoraro.  </P> <P> The band played military marches, but also swing jazz for USO dances. Franc is  putting together an Oct. 18 band reunion. If you were in the band or know  someone who was, give him a call at 279-0844.  </P> <P> San Diego guitarist Hank Easton hasn't been signed by a major label yet, but  his self-produced CD, "San Diego Sunset," has won favor from local jazz writers  (not just this one) and airplay on KIFM.  </P> <P> Easton jammed with jazz celebrity Bob James two weeks ago at the San Diego  Hilton. James was in town for a vacation, and Easton was sitting in with San  Diego band Real to Reel. James joined the group for a version of his theme from  the television show "Taxi."  </P> <P> Easton and his band play tonight from 6 to 11 at the Mission Bay Hilton and  Saturday from 5:30 to 7:30 at the Coronado Ferry Landing.  </P> <P> RIFFS: Pianist Rob Schneiderman, appearing with saxophonist Jimmy Heath at  Elario's, has a busy career of his own. A new album with drummer Billy Higgins  and bassist Rufus Reid is due this fall. Drummer Sherman Ferguson is taking the  place of John Guerin in the second and final week of Heath's stay that ends  Sunday night. . . .  </P> <P> Legendary guitarist Barney Kessel, who now calls San Diego home, may sign with  local management group Brady &amp; Associates. Longtime KSDS-FM (88.3) disc  jockey Tony Sidotti, who recently went to work with Brady, is working on  cementing a deal. . . .  </P> <P> Dick Braun and his Orchestra play Chula Vista's Music in the Park summer music  seres at 4:30 p.m. Sunday in Friendship Park, behind the public library (365 F  St.). . . .  </P> <P> This Saturday night's edition of "Club Date," the jazz show on KPBS-TV,  features singer Anita O'Day, backed by locals Bob Magnusson on bass, Randy  Porter on piano and Jim Plank on drums. . . .  </P> <P> Most Valuable Players plays light jazz at the B St. Cafe tonight through  Saturday night. . . .  </P> <P> Fattburger plays the "Jazz Nite" at the Catamaran Resort Hotel next Wednesday.  </P></p>

This demand is not new. In previous working-level  talks held in Seoul in early March, the United States also  demanded that the ROK call off its differential tariff and tax  rate system as well as lower tariff rates to promote imports of  large U.S. cars. However, we are particularly concerned with  the upcoming talks because the United States has implicitly  warned that "it may invoke the Super 301 provision unless the  ROK opens its auto market." The U.S. Government announced in  March that it will revive the Super 301 provision in two years.  It intends to spot by 30 September "countries that are unfairly  controlling imports of U.S. goods" as "target countries for  priority negotiations" and demand that they call off or adjust  their "unfair import controls." The United States also intends  to take retaliatory procedures against them unless these  countries meet demands.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor insists that the  revival of the Super 301 provision coincides with the principle  of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] and it is  not aimed at a specific country. Countries interpret his  insistence differently. Japan, is particularly opposed to this,  saying that it will file a lawsuit to the GATT if the United  States imposes trade retaliation according to the Super 301  clause. Our government also criticized the clause for clearly  contradicting the spirit of the Uruguay Round [UR] negotiations.  In the GATT Board of Governors meeting held last week, major  member nations of the Board of Governors denounced the Super 301  provision as a means for unilateral trade retaliation and  criticized it for threatening the inauguration of the  multilateral UR trade system.    The United States is searching for excuses in saying that it  intends not to close U.S. markets, but to expand free trade by  opening other countries' markets wider. The U.S. intends to  remove trade barriers to open the market of each of its trade  partners, through multilateral agreements whenever possible, and  through bilateral negotiations, when neccessary. The United  States sees the Super 301 clause as coinciding with UR  principles since it considers the conclusion of UR negotiations  a step towards market opening.    The U.S. insistence, however, must be based on an objective  and universal view for the treaty to be proved fair and just.  The UR negotiations have been concluded for this purpose. As  the Super 301 clause unilaterally insisted upon by the U.S. as  aiming only to open the markets of its trade partners does not  exclude trade retaliation, it is hardly convincing to the  international community. In addition, one cannot help but point  out that the GATT has a tendency of attaching more importance to  results in free trade than on principles and procedures for  expanding free trade since it is based on principles of  pragmatism.    We should, in particular, take notice of the clear fact  that,  although the United States denies it, the Super 301 clause  targets certain countries. While the United States seems to  consider Japan as its main target, the ROK is not exempt from  being a target, either.</p>

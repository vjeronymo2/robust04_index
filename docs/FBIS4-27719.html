			<p>BFN     [Text] International media, especially the Cable News  Network [CNN], should focus its coverage on the injustice the  Bosnian people face, instead of making false reports on the  issue. Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said the  media should see the injustice that prevails there, namely the  continued arms embargo faced by the Bosnians, while Serb  terrorists continue to receive arms from Belgrade. This is the  current injustice the Bosnians face and the media must fight  against it.    The minister was speaking to reporters after he met local  UMNO [United Malays National Organization] leaders in Johor  Baharu today. He was commenting on a CNN report, the effect of  which was that Malaysia had been providing arms to Bosnia. The  minister also reiterated Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir's denial of  the report. He said he could not understand why CNN carried the  incorrect report. He added that 50 million ringgit has been  allocated to upgrade military camps nationwide.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET JOHN CRUDELE: HAAS SCANDAL TAKING TOLL ON INVESTORS BIG AND SMALL  </P> <P> When Pauline (as we'll call her) met an executive of Haas Securities at a  dinner party in 1984, she considered herself well off. Still, she felt that her  portfolio wasn't getting the necessary attention, and she had recently lost  money in a Keogh account at Shearson Lehman. So Pauline decided to turn over  all of her money -- about $185,000 -- to Haas. She even persuaded her elderly  parents to give Haas $400,000.  </P> <P> The accounts seemed to grow and, at one point, Haas told Pauline her account  was worth more than $300,000. Her parents' had grown as well.  </P> <P> Today, Pauline not only is broke -- but owes $40,000. She says it is because of  unauthorized and fraudulent trading in her account by Haas. Her parents are  $300,000 in debt.  </P> <P> "I didn't know what was going on. I trusted this guy," Pauline says. "People  much more sophisticated than I am were involved in this and lost money."  </P> <P> Dr. John Cogan of Houston was contacted over the phone by a Haas representative  in late 1983. After one face-to-face meeting, Dr. Cogan invested $200,000.  Cogan says he never heard from the representative again. When he tried to call  Haas' office in Houston a year later, he found it had been shut down. No one in  the New York office would return Cogan's calls.  </P> <P> Both Cogan and Pauline are suing Haas, which was a small but seemingly  legitimate brokerage that was a market maker (whose official role was to keep  trading orderly) in 73 over-the-counter securities until it went bankrupt after  the crash. What was really going on at Haas -- and why as many as 3,000  investors may have lost money -- is now unfolding.  </P> <P> Stanley Aslanian Jr., the firm's 29-year-old former president, recently pleaded  guilty to stock manipulation. He's also said to be cooperating in the  prosecution of others. And investigators are now looking into whether Haas  artificially drove up the price of five securities -- Big O Tires Inc., Cliff  Engle Ltd., Flores de New Mexico, TS Industries and Fountain Power Boat  Industries -- by trading illegally and disseminating false information about  the firm. Sources familiar with the case say Haas may have been manipulating  other stocks as well.  </P> <P> Besides Aslanian, Frank Shannon, an investor, has been charged with filing  false information with the government about TS Industries, for which Haas was a  market maker.  </P> <P> Investigators are moving quickly on the case, sources say, and they also report  that the U.S. attorney and the FBI are widening the inquiry. Others say the  Securities and Exchange Commission recently expanded its own probe and is  issuing subpoenas. A grand jury is said to be looking at evidence now. "A lot  of people are in trouble," says one source.  </P> <P> That would include people who did business with Haas, as well as the possible  involvement of a broker at E. F. Hutton &amp; Co.  </P> <P> John Lang, attorney for Eugene Laff, former chairman of Haas, says that his  client has answered questions in other investigations of Haas but that he has  not been called before the grand jury.  </P> <P> "Based on Aslanian's guilty plea, it is clear to everyone, including Mr. Laff,  that laws were violated," Lang says, adding that an investigation by the  National Assn. of Securities Dealers concluded that Aslanian manipulated  stocks. It also said Laff's only mistake was that he didn't adequately  supervise Aslanian.  </P> <P> If Laff is asked by the grand jury to appear, "at that point (he) will make up  his mind whether it would be in his interest or in the interest of justice to  testify," says Lang.  </P> <P> James Davis, a lawyer for the trustee of Haas, has questioned certain trades by  members of Laff's family, according to court documents. Davis refused to say  whether he spoke to investigators about these trades.  </P> <P> Lang says "friends, associates and relatives of Laff's" invested in some of the  stocks recommended by Haas that they thought were good investments. "And for  the most part, they had very substantial losses," says Lang.  </P> <P> The possible involvement of Henry Lorin, a major investor in TS Industries, is  also being looked at. A published report said Lorin was in a transaction with  Shannon involving TS stock.  </P> <P> Investigators are said to have heard evidence that 387,600 shares of TS  Industries stock were bought from a broker at Hutton in July, 1987. This was  before the firm merged with Shearson Lehman and about the same time, sources  say, as Aslanian admits to manipulating the price of TS Industries stock.  </P> <P> Insiders acknowledge that the Hutton broker -- who wasn't identified -- could  be in trouble if his trades with Haas were intended to artificially drive up  the price of TS Industries stock.  </P> <P> Some people have also questioned the role of L. F. Rothschild &amp; Co., which  handled the paper work for all of Haas' trades. In their bankruptcy filings,  Haas officials charge that the brokerage was forced into bankruptcy shortly  after the October, 1987, crash because Rothschild suddenly refused to accept  its trades.  </P> <P> At least one Haas customer has said she was told that Rothschild would not  process sell orders from Haas customers after the crash unless they were  accompanied by a comparably sized order to buy.  </P> <P> An attorney for Rothschild says his client was a victim of Haas' alleged  misconduct and is out $26 million as a result.  </P> <P> How much did investors lose? Investigators estimate that more than $100 million  in TS Industries alone was lost when the stock fell from its inflated pre-crash  price of about $30 a share to its current price of 50 cents. "And that's just  the one stock," says one person familiar with the case. "It gives you an idea  of the money involved."  </P> <P> What's going on with the dollar? "Everyone is worried about another October,"  says Peter Rona, head of IBJ Schroder, a subsidiary of the International Bank  of Japan. "They're afraid of the thing tipping over."  </P> <P> "The thing" is the stock market. "Everyone" is the central banks around the  world.  </P> <P> Rona, who is an authority on world interest rates and is well connected with  major central banks around the world, says the banks are concerned that a  further weakening of the dollar will cause U.S. interest rates to go higher.  </P> <P> Interest rates here are already high, thanks to the Fed's fight against  inflation. Even lowly money-market accounts in the U.S. are paying 7.41% these  days. While rates may have to go up if inflation gets worse, the authorities  don't want to boost rates to prop up the dollar.  </P> <P> Rona says that's why central banks, including the Federal Reserve, have been  buying dollars lately in hopes of boosting their value. (Most recently, they've  been selling dollars, but only because developments like the rise in oil prices  appear to have overly strengthened the dollar.)  </P> <P> Intervention can't keep the dollar strong for long, Rona says, though as long  as the markets are in a good mood over the new Administration, they're likely  to play along with the central banks.  </P> <P> But once Bush's honeymoon with Congress is over, Rona says, trouble could  start.  </P> <P> Appearance, attitude and body language are more important in making a good  first impression than what you say. Motivational Systems, a specialist in  management development and sales training, says 72% of the 12,000 people  surveyed said they were most influenced by non-verbal communications . . .  </P> <P> Traders have been carefully watching the recent movement of Digital  Communications stock, which has had one heck of a January. It's up about $5 a  share in the past 16 days on four times the normal volume. There have been  takeover rumors, but nothing specific enough to cause this type of activity . .  .  </P> <P> What people can't figure out is why the stock market went up last week after  Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan threatened to raise interest rates to fight  inflation. A jump in interest rates is always bad for stocks.  </P> <P> Meredith Berkman contributed to this column.  </P></p>

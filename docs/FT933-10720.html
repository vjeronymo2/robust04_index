			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Romanian miners in pay strike TENS OF THOUSANDS of Romanian coal miners (above) began an indefinite strike yesterday after the government had refused to give in to demands for big pay rises, Virginia Marsh reports from Bucharest. All but a few hundred of the 43,000 miners in the Jiu Valley, which produces more than 90 per cent of the country's black coal, joined the strike, the industry ministry said. The miners, who led anti-reform riots in Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are demanding an average monthly wage equivalent to nearly Dollars 400 (Pounds 268.40), four times the national average, and lower income tax. Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu, prime minister, said the state did not have the funds to meet the demands. It would be unfair to approve 'over the top' pay awards, given that miners already earned more than 90 per cent of the population. Mr Vacaroiu, who met miners' leaders last week, refused to go to the Jiu Valley to continue negotiations after unions hadfailed to appear for scheduled talks in Bucharest.</p>

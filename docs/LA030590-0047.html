			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: EXCEL: THE OTHER KIND OF LOS ANGELES METAL  </P> <P> Excel is the best metal band you've never heard of, a bunch of Venice  skate-dudes with crunchy riffs, tightly structured songs and politically  charged lyrics whose alienation can remind you of great punk-rock. This is the  other kind of Los Angeles metal, more akin to such former local bands as Slayer  and Metallica than to the coiffured hard-rockers who throng the Sunset Strip.  </P> <P> At the Country Club on Saturday, in front of a Venice wild-style graffiti  mural, Excel played its first local show in ages. The sound was as clear as on  both of its albums. The people in the slam pit chanted along to everything (the  band didn't even bother shouting the choruses) and guys dove into the crowd  both from the stage and from the tier of tables behind the pit. The club was  hot enough to steam broccoli.  </P> <P> Still, Excel's showmanship isn't up to its musicianship: In the five years it's  been together, the band has only performed live a handful of times, and it  shows. The interminable waits between songs all but destroyed the momentum of  the set.JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Putting the colour back into art's faded cheeks: Antony Thorncroft questions Sotheby's timing in raising its buyers' premium just as a selection of important items are coming under the auctioneer's hammer SOTHEBY'S shocked and angered the art world this week by raising the premium it charges to buyers at its sales from 10 per cent to 15 per cent of the hammer price on lots which go for Pounds 30,000 (Dollars 50,000) or less, which means the vast majority. Lord Gowrie, the London chairman, was quick to point out that, with the 10 per cent remaining on anything paid over Pounds 30,000, the maximum additional charge for a buyer will be Pounds 1,500. But in the current market, when auction houses are seeking desperately for new collectors to make good the loss of bidding by the debt-ridden dealers, any extra expense looks suicidal. Sotheby's has been forced into raising its prices - which, added to the 10 per cent that sellers pay (in theory), means that it takes a weighty 25 per cent of any object sold - because it continues to trade at a loss and the hoped-for improvement in business in the autumn has proved a chimera. Michael Ainslie, its president, said: 'Although we have succeeded in cutting our costs by 20 per cent in the last two years, the market has not bounced back as quickly as we expected.' Also, in today's intensely competitive climate, anyone offering a valuable collection at auction would be mad if they did not negotiate a reduction in the seller's charge, so buyers are, in effect, being asked to subsidise sellers. Christie's and Phillips are holding off for the moment but will probably follow suit and raise their premiums, but Bonhams, which is riding the recession better than its bigger rivals, is pegging prices. Sotheby's timing is surprising because in recent weeks there have been signs of green shoots in the art market. Even those rare words 'auction record' have crept back into the language, admittedly usually in such specialist areas as Chinese modern paintings (Pounds 614,000 was paid in Hong Kong for a work by Zhang Daqian), and 20th century photographs (Pounds 115,500 at Christie's for a portrait by Rodchenko). But some popular artists have also achieved records, like the Dollars 528,000 paid in New York for a work by the French 19th century Salon painter Bouguereau and, this week in London, Pounds 66,000 for a sculpture by Eric Gill. By all accounts, the London and Provincial Antique Dealers Show in London last month was not at all bad and there was brisk buying at the Contemporary Art Society's supermarket of inexpensive art at Smiths last weekend. Even the London dealers are beginning to think the worst is past, and, more to the point, are starting to get out and sell. Sixteen of the galleries left in Cork Street are co-operating on an open weekend on November 28 and 29. Throw in the Olympia autumn antiques fair, from November 18, at which almost 200 dealers will be looking to make pre-Christmas sales; the Barbican fair from November 26 with another 200 dealers offering antiques valued at Pounds 25 million; and Artmart at the Business Design Centre in Islington from November 19, and the supply side is well taken care of. Serious connoisseurs, who were frozen out by the spiralling prices of the late 1980s, are now at least attending fairs and, as prices continue to fall, especially for pictures, this really is the time for bargains. All that is missing is confidence, which can best come from keen bidding at auction, where works of art are publicly seen to be in demand. In the next month, some really important items arrive on the market. They will confirm that the art world slump, which in areas such as Impressionist paintings has reduced prices by 50 per cent in two years, is over, or whether there is more misery to come. The Grim Reaper has been kind to Sotheby's and Christie's. Few owners of masterpieces are keen to sell in today's lacklustre market place (unless they are badgered by Lloyds of London or their banks), but the auction houses have some fine offerings thanks to death and executors - and the mounting inheritance problems in maintaining the UK's stately mansions. Lord Mountbatten's former home at Broadlands and the new heirs to Luton Hoo are among the consignors in London this month. Death has particularly favoured New York's major winter Impressionist and modern art sales next week. Dorothy Rodgers, the widow of the popular composer, has died and Christie's is offering 26 works on Wednesday from her collection, including a Cubist Picasso 'Guitare et journal' estimated at up to Dollars 4 million and a cheerful work by Picasso painted aged 20 in 1901 while he was still in Barcelona (estimated at up to Dollars 2 million); plus paintings by Vlaminck and Matisse which might also top Dollars 1 million. The previous night, Sotheby's big occasion is boosted by paintings from two more dead collectors, Mollie Livingston, who designed clothes for the wives of Presidents Eisenhower and Johnson, and Wright Ludington. The highlight from the former's collection is another Matisse, 'L'Asie', a 1946 portrait of an oriental girl which could make Dollars 8 million, and a Dollars 4 million Picasso, while Ludington contributes his 1905 Matisse, estimated at around Dollars 1.5 million. In terms of quality of stock, next week's Impressionist and modern sales in New York are the best for over two years, but, even if the art sells on target, prices will only have returned to the levels prevailing five years ago, before the short-lived boom. London can hardly compete with this array of costly art, but there are re-assuringly familiar British names in the auctions of Victorian pictures next week. Sotheby's and Christie's have sadly accepted that they cannot sell 19th century British artists alongside French, Spanish and the rest in general 19th century European art catalogues - their attempt to create a common market for art among European collectors has failed - so Leighton and Burne-Jones, Rossetti and Alma-Tadema have been restored to their exclusive catalogues. The highlight of Christie's sale on Friday is 'Moorish garden: a dream of Granada' by Lord Leighton, which depicts a young girl in eastern finery leading two peacocks. It is being sold by an Australian museum, the Armidale in New South Wales, which should be at least Pounds 500,000 richer as a consequence. Lord Leighton's 'oriental' pictures rarely appear at auction. This one has actually appeared twice before at Christie's. In 1903, it went for 888 guineas and in 1931, with the Victorians out of favour, for just 190 guineas. Another work by Leighton, 'The bracelet', showing a Greek maid examining a bangle, also reflects the vagaries of taste for Victorian pictures. It made just 21 guineas at Christie's in 1956; now it could top Pounds 500,000. The sale contains Frederick Watts's famous portrait of Lord Tennyson and one of Alma-Tadema's rare female nudes. 'A sculptor's model' caused a sensation when it was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1878 and the Bishop of Carlisle described it as 'mischievious'. To deflect criticism, Alma-Tadema rather unsatisfactorily added a smock, not to the model but to the watching sculptor. Estimated at around Pounds 250,000, it is being sold by a Japanese company, confirming that these days the Japanese are sellers rather than buyers. The highlight at Sotheby's is one of Leighton's rare nudes, 'The antique juggling girl', which could make Pounds 500,000. And there are more goodies to come. . . The first dispersal in a general Pounds 30 million clear-out by one of Europe's richest families, the Princes of Thurn and Taxis, at Sotheby's Geneva on November 17, when a gold and hardstone snuff box created for Frederick the Great should sell for Pounds 1 million; the seven works by Cezanne at Christie's on November 30, which should make Pounds 12 million between them; the Pounds 5 million Pieter de Hooch view of a Delft courtyard at Christie's on December 11, with a 'lost' Rubens portrait in the same sale; a rare bullfighting scene by Goya at Sotheby's on December 9 which has been in the same family since it was painted in 1824 and should sell for around Pounds 5 million; one of the two finest Kandinskys to appear at auction in 30 years is also in the Pounds 5 million class at Sotheby's on December 1; and a Turner watercolour of Venice, which when it last appeared in the saleroom in 1988 set an English watercolour record of Pounds 440,000: on November 19 at Sotheby's it is modestly expected to make Pounds 500,000, reflecting the convalescent market. In the same sale is a Constable view of Salisbury cathedral, despatched to raise Pounds 1 million to ease the financial problems at Luton Hoo. The most important Mountbatten picture up for grabs, Joseph Wright of Derby's 'An Iron Forge', has thankfully found a permanent home in the Tate, thanks to the generosity of the National Heritage Fund and the National Art Collections Fund. If there are rich buyers out there, they must be tempted by these master works. Already Italian and Swiss furniture dealers have been bidding heavily again at furniture auctions in the UK, one area which has largely ridden out the recession; the Americans are definitely coming back, thanks to the fall in value of sterling. There could still be problems for the London art market if Brussels succeeds in imposing VAT on the import of works of art but a combination of excellent items with international appeal in the salerooms and competitively priced general antiques at the fairs and in the dealers' windows should provide the combination to lift the art market out of its two-year malaise.</p>

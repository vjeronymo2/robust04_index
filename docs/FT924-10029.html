			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Manufacturing industry prospects pick up THE US Purchasing Managers' Index moved back above 50 per cent last month, indicating slightly improved prospects for manufacturing industry, but remained far below the levels normal in a healthy recovery, writes Michael Prowse in Washington. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 1.3 per cent in September, following a revised decline of 1.1 per cent in August. Construction spending was up 5.5 per cent compared with the same month last year. The Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 50.6 per cent in October after a sharp decline to 49 per cent a month earlier. The index is now just above the 50 per cent threshold that indicates expansion of the manufacturing industry, but still well below levels recorded earlier this year. The improvement mainly reflected a rebound in the component of the index measuring new orders, which rose from 49.6 per cent to 55 per cent. The component measuring production rose from 52.6 per cent to 54.3 per cent. But the index for jobs dropped from 45.2 to 44.8, indicating that employment prospects remain dismal. Mr Robert Bretz, for the National Association of Purchasing Management, welcomed the overall improvement, but said the pace of growth remained modest as the economy entered the fourth quarter.</p>

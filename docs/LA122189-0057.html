			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE REVIEW;  </P> <P> NO COHERENCE IN CENTER PLAN;  </P> <P> DESIGN: THE SECOND PHASE OF ESCONDIDO'S CIVIC CENTER COMPLEX APPEARS TO HAVE  ATTRACTIVE OUTDOOR SPACES, BUT OTHER ELEMENTS APPEAR PROBLEMATIC.  </P> <P> The problem of designing a large theater has challenges similar to those in  creating a convention center: A boxy large space must somehow be concealed  within a graceful shell.  </P> <P> Architect Arthur Erickson, using bold repetitive forms in concrete, has made  the gigantic new San Diego Convention Center a fine piece of design. His  excellent exterior detailing makes this building attractive to those arriving  by car or foot. It's a landmark project for downtown San Diego.  </P> <P> Architects Moore Ruble Yudell have not been nearly as successful in their  design of the second phase of Escondido's Civic Center, a $55.4-million complex  that will include 1,500- and 400-seat theaters for stage productions, an arts  complex and a community meeting center.  </P> <P> The final design for the project, to be built in Grape Day Park downtown, site  of the new City Hall completed in 1988, was unanimously approved by the  Escondido City Council this month. The city hopes to break ground next fall,  with completion expected in 1993.  </P> <P> Although the architects have created wonderful outdoor spaces, the bulky  100-foot-tall "fly tower," which houses the mechanical equipment above the  stage, sticks out like a sore thumb, unbroken by architectural detailing or  other visual devices that could make it attractive. Other potential problems  include jarring combinations of roof treatments and a confusing variety of  window and wall treatments used in an attempt to break down the mass of he main  theater.  </P> <P> There is also a possibility that the Civic Center complex will have  insufficient daytime attractions such as food stands or recreation  opportunities to make the park a success as a people place.  </P> <P> Months of refining should have resulted in a well-composed treatment of the big  box that will house the necessary stage equipment over the main theater; at 100  feet, the "fly tower" will be the Civic Center's most noticeable feature.  </P> <P> Instead, the theater, at least as depicted in model form, will sit hard by  Escondido Boulevard, its bulk unbroken by details that could tie it to the rest  of the Civic Center complex. Its flat roof, for instance, sets it oddly apart  from the pavilion and gable roofs used on the other of the new buildings.  </P> <P> Project architect Renzo Zecchetto said that softening the impact of this  looming box was the architects' single toughest challenge.  </P> <P> The designers elected to place most of the design interest at the middle level  of this and the other buildings in the second phase of the Civic Center  project. Groups of small windows, varied wall angles and assorted architectural  detailing will break these facades into forms a human being can get close to  without feeling overwhelmed.  </P> <P> City officials and community leaders have expressed a desire for some softening  of the theater's stark appearance. Suggestions include a screening wall in  front of the building's prominent northern face, detailing on the building wall  itself or a system of vine-covered trellises and palm trees.  </P> <P> Zecchetto said the architects favor the last approach, partly because it is  most economical.  </P> <P> At this stage of the design game, though -- when at least a year has already  gone into the project -- one expects a more polished design solution.  </P> <P> Other aspects of the architecture are also disappointing. The choice of roof  forms is puzzling. Some roofs will have the traditional pitched form, while  others, as on a few small towers, will be flat. The flat towers don't always  merge well with the slanted roofs nearby. It is difficult, though, to make a  final pronouncement on these. The material has not been chosen, and these could  make the actual buildings look much different from cardboard models. Flat tiles  or a seamed metal are among the choices being considered.  </P> <P> There is other evidence the architects did not arrive at a consistent, coherent  design vision: Pedestrians will not notice from the ground level, but there is  something jarring about the way the big theater's northern wall drops from a  flat roof on top to a slanted roof above the first floor, with twin buttresses  flying above it.  </P> <P> It is at the level of the pedestrian, in fact, that the architects appear to  have done their strongest design work.  </P> <P> All along, the design of the entire Civic Center complex, including City Hall,  has been driven by its situation in the 17-acre Grape Day Park, a huge open  space in the heart of the city. The intention was always to keep this setting  park-like, even with the addition of several buildings.  </P> <P> Moore Ruble Yudell put their buildings at the edges of the property, near the  streets, preserving the interior as open space. A walk through the complex  should prove to be an interesting stroll among the various plazas and  courtyards.  </P> <P> The main entrance to the new theater complex will be off Escondido Boulevard on  the western edge of the project. Here, a wide plaza of slightly ascending  levels will lead pedestrians in between the large theater to the north and the  nearby community theater, set behind a pergola at Escondido Boulevard and  Valley Parkway. The pergolas, along with many rows of trees, will soften the  experience of entering the complex.  </P> <P> The pergolas here and elsewhere are the same sort of vine-covered  column-and-trellis walkways that became the trademark of legendary San Diego  architect Irving Gill early in this century. Some modern architects even use  arches like the ones Gill favored.  </P> <P> In the Civic Center project, every building has at least one courtyard related  to it, and most have several. Some are intended to be used for various  gatherings. A courtyard off the back of the smaller theater could, for example,  become an outdoor performance space, Zecchetto said. He said that he hopes that  the city will eventually have the money to add doors to the back of this  theater's stage so that it can open onto the courtyard.  </P> <P> Aside from the architecture, a larger concern has to do with the programming of  the Civic Center complex -- the kinds of uses selected for this public park.  The City Hall and theaters will dominate the site, with the community meeting  building and arts complex as secondary uses. What will the new complex offer  the person who comes to the park in search of a recreational or cultural  experience during daylight hours?  </P> <P> A library might have been a good choice, but the city just built a new one  three blocks away at 2nd Avenue and Kalmia Street in 1983.  </P> <P> There are now no concrete plans for the kinds of things that make Balboa Park  so successful: food pushcarts, small cafes, and many  </P> <P> choices of exhibitions, performances, films and museums.  </P> <P> Both Zecchetto and Rolf Gunnarson, assistant executive director of the  Escondido Community Development Commission, say they have considered such  ideas. A small food outlet and bar in the lobby of the larger theater might be  open during daylight hours, and a kitchen in the community meeting building  could be used to produce food for park visitors as well as for those attending  meetings at the building. Food vendors are also a possibility.  </P> <P> These kinds of people-oriented things will be essential to animating the  well-planned outdoor spaces, which will undoubtedly be the new complex's  triumph.  </P></p>

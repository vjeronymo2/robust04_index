			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Vodafone's UK growth offset by start-up costs abroad Vodafone, the UK market leader in cellular phones, returned better than expected interim profits in spite of the impact of fraud and international losses. Pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of September were Pounds 186.4m, against forecasts between Pounds 175m to Pounds 185m and 7 per cent ahead of the Pounds 174.5m in the same period last year. Turnover rose 44 per cent to Pounds 560.7m against Pounds 389.8m this time last year. Earnings per share were 3.92p (3.90p in 1993 after adjustment for the July 1994 capitalisation issue). The interim dividend was raised 20 per cent to 1.64p, reflecting the underlying growth of the business, according to Mr Ken Hydon, financial director. He said the company had continued to develop its operations overseas. Strong growth in the UK had been substantially offset by increased start-up costs overseas, amounting to Pounds 40m in 1993 against Pounds 19m a year ago. In the UK, the number of subscribers rose by 263,000, an increase of 140 per cent over the growth in the same period last year. Vodafone has more than 1.45m subscribers connected to the network, but the 'churn' rate - a measure of the proportion of subscribers who leave the network - rose from 21.5 per cent to 26.5 per cent. The company said much of the churn was the result of fraud which had cost the company some 1 per cent of UK turnover in addition to ordinary bad debts, also about 1 per cent of turnover. It blamed sub-dealers, acting between clients and retailers, who secured commissions on the connection of phantom customers to the network. Others causes included cloning or re-chipping of cellular phones, which is still legal in UK law. Of Vodafone's overseas operations, only those in Hong Kong and Malta are profitable. Depending on how successful the company proves in bidding for further overseas licences, there could be further large start-up costs in the second half. Capital expenditure and investments in the period amounted to Pounds 179m, of which Pounds 115m was spent on overseas start-up operations. The group has no net debt.

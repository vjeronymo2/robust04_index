			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Swedish foreign debt rating reduced by S&amp;P STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, yesterday downgraded Sweden's senior long-term foreign currency debt rating to AA+, from AAA. It said the decision, which affects Dollars 14bn of debt, reflected the size of Sweden's budget deficit, its rising foreign debt, and the risk of slow and uncertain economic recovery because of political pressures and the banking crisis. The move follows last month's downgrading by fellow US rating agency, Moody's, which cut Sweden's long-term debt rating from Aa1 to Aa2. S&amp;P said Swedish government debt was set to reach 80 per cent of GDP at the end of 1994, after nearly doubling in four years, while external debt would rise fourfold to 75 per cent of exports over the same period. Plans to cut spending had been hampered by unemployment outlays and assistance to the banking sector. However, S&amp;P revised its outlook for Sweden from negative to stable as an expression of confidence in its measures to tackle economic problems. Mr Staffan Crona, director-general of the Swedish National Debt Office, said S&amp;P's downgrading came as no surprise and would have only a marginal effect on the country's borrowing costs.</p>

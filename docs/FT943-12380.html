			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Politicians catching up with Japan's military: Post-cold war adjustment has preceded its new legal right Vice admiral Kazuya Natsukawa, commandant of Sasebo naval district, covering the vital sea lanes off southern Japan, has just been given the legal right to do his job. It was granted by his commander-in-chief, the new socialist prime minister Tomiichi Murayama, who last week clarified nearly 50 years of muddled debate on Japan's pacifist constitution by declaring that his party had dropped its belief that Japan had no right to maintain armed forces. Mr Murayama's about-turn, supported by just more than 60 per cent of his party members, makes little practical difference to the role of vice admiral Natsukawa's ships. The vice admiral confesses in any case to polite scepticism over the prime minister's pronouncement. Nor does it affect the big changes among Japan's pragmatic defence planners, as they start to adjust, irrespective of Japan's political turmoils, to the regional instability that has followed the end of the cold war. That much was clear when vice admiral Natsukawa led his ships on manoeuvres off the southern port of Kagoshima recently, honing their ability to respond to whatever threat an unstable north-east Asia might throw at them. He admitted, with a frankness that might startle his political masters, that his forces are technically ready to support a US naval blockade of North Korea, should there be call for one. 'We would rather call it a sea intervention than a blockade,' he adds, in a nod to political delicacy. For the first time, a national self defence agency white paper published this year singles out North Korea - 'a serious destabilising factor' - rather than Russia as the main threat to regional security. What this means for the practical organisation of Japan's military should become clearer early next month when a government panel, appointed by former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa in February, is due to publish the first overhaul of defence policy for 18 years. One message, according to an early draft of the report, is that Japan must be less reliant on the US - which keeps 24,000 troops on the archipelago - for its protection, because the end of the cold war has reduced Japan's strategic value to Washington's security. That implies more spending on defence electronics, such as anti-missile systems and the possible acquisition of Japan's first spy satellite, say officials. The panel will also encourage the government to follow other world powers in cutting the overall defence budget. Pacifist Japan has become in recent years the world's second-largest defence spender after the US, with a defence budget this year of Y4,679bn (Pounds 30.6bn). This is, however, purely a reflection of the yen's strength and the self defence force's high wage and pensions bill. The forces actually in use are in line with Japan's low military profile, even if hard to reconcile with the strict wording of the constitution's pacifist article 9, that 'war potential will never be maintained'. Less than a quarter of Japan's defence budget goes on equipment, about 80 per cent of which is made by Japanese companies, often under licence from the US. At just less than 1 per cent of gross domestic product, conveniently below the mark considered a political flashpoint, Japan devotes less of its wealth to defence than do Germany or Italy. The total tonnage of its 160 navy ships makes the Japanese navy smaller than that of Britain or France. Its 150,000 troops, already well below the authorised ceiling of 180,000, makes the Japanese army slightly larger than Britain's. The government has already started to trim military spending and both the dominant Liberal Democratic party and its Social Democratic party allies are keen to continue this process. This year's defence budget marks a 0.8 per cent nominal rise over 1993, the smallest increase in 34 years, and a fall of about 1 per cent in real terms. Despite Mr Murayama's conversion to reality, a more self-reliant defence force could pose political problems among constitutional die-hards. 'Devoting thought to building an appropriate defence capability, much less putting it to actual use, has been a public taboo and a high political risk domestically,' explains a recent paper by Major Atsumasa Yamamoto, a member of the defence agency's intelligence division. Defence agency planners interpret article 9 to mean a ban on the purchase of instruments of overt aggression such as aircraft carriers and ballistic missiles. This is much harder to interpret in battle. The dividing line between what vice admiral Natsukawa and his colleagues may or may not do to defend their ships is almost impossible to define. They may shoot at incoming missiles; but do they have to ask parliament's permission to shoot at the ships, aircraft or launchers that fired them? Article 9 has also been taken, by a 1960s cabinet resolution, to rule out participation in 'collective security' arrangements beyond its own frontiers. This is supposed to limit the ground forces to defending the Japanese islands in case of invasion, and to restrict the navy to policing sea lanes up to 1,000 nautical miles from Japan. The rule against collective defence could complicate any attempt to take part in one of America's theatre missile defence programmes, ideally suited to counter the North Korean threat, as suggested in the panel's draft report. But the 1,000-mile rule does mean North Korean waters are legally in the navy's reach - especially now that the self defence forces themselves are constitutional.</p>

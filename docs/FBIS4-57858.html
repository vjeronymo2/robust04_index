This candidacy faces considerable difficulties. Quercia's  image as a politician and administrator, which has been  surrounded by doubts and suspicions for a long time, is now  exposed to a still more serious threat resulting from the fraud  charges filed against him by the Federal Prosecutor's Office.  As if this were not enough, the Superior Court may decide to  uphold the charges right in the middle of a campaign in which  there will be more concern about ethics and honesty than before.    Quercia is also facing problems inside his own party.  Despite  his power over the PMDB machinery, there is serious resistance  to his candidacy in several states. The large number of  abstentions during the voting in the party primaries and the  party convention indicate that Quercia can hardly count on the  party's overall support. In addition, the fact that the PMDB is  still the largest Brazilian party will no longer be important if  its members are not effectively devoted to ensuring the  candidate's victory in the elections.    The Democratic Social Party members' lack of interest in  Cristiano Machado's electoral campaign in 1950, when most of the  party decided to support Getulio Vargas' candidacy, gave birth  to the term "Christianize." Ulysses Guimaraes' defeat as a  presidential candidate in 1989, when he was abandoned by the  PMDB during his presidential campaign, is the most prominent  example of similar behavior in recent years.    Quercia, however, is entitled to comparatively long, free  electoral propaganda time on radio and television. Many believe  he will use this time to involve the campaign in such an  exchange of accusations that he will neutralize suspicions  hanging over his head. An old-fashioned politician who is  personal and addicted to the most traditional sort of political  patronage, he has already started the campaign with a populist  and aggressive attack against his adversaries. All that remains  to be seen is whether this will be enough to reverse his weak  performance in the electoral polls.</p>

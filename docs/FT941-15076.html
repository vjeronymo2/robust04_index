			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / FT Guide To The Week MONDAY John Major at Scott inquiry John Major, the hard-pressed UK prime minister (left), joins the growing line of officials and government ministers required to give evidence in public to Lord Justice Scott's arms-for-Iraq inquiry. Mr Major set up the inquiry himself in November 1992 in response to the row over alleged government complicity in the illegal arms sales. He was foreign secretary and chancellor of the exchequer under Lady Thatcher. The European Parliament holds its first full session of the year. The 518 deputies will be preparing nervously in Strasbourg for June's Euroelection, likely to be dominated as much by domestic issues in the 12 member states as by pan-European themes. Textile squabble: The US is due to cut China's textile and clothing import quotas by more than Dollars 1bn for alleged cheating. The Clinton administration says China has tried to skirt limits by shipping goods into the US through other nations. Mercosur summit: The presidents of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, the four countries which will make up the planned Mercosur free trade area, are due to meet in Uruguay. Mercosur is planned to come into effect next year, but some matters are undecided, for example, a common external tariff. Lloyd's offer: Names on Gooda Walker and Feltrim syndicates - two of the biggest loss makers at Lloyd's of London - meet this week to discuss the Pounds 900m offer to settle litigation at the insurance market. Both groups are likely to reject the deal, making their disputes dependent on legal cases coming to court later this year. In these, Names are suing their agents for alleged negligence. Gooda Names, who meet today, have been offered Pounds 223m, compared with a claim of Pounds 580m. Names have until February 14 to vote on the package. Thorp licence: The licence for the Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, north-west England, comes into effect. The plant will not be fully operational for another month, while preliminary tests continue. In early February, the government faces a legal challenge on its decision to grant the licence from Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, and Lancashire County Council who are worried about emissions. Holidays: US federal government offices and banks will be closed for Martin Luther King day. TUESDAY Patten consults in London Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, leaves for London for a series of meetings with British ministers about the colony's political development. It is expected that the governor will seek approval to push ahead with his original democracy proposals in the form of a second bill to be put to Hong Kong's legislature in March. On Thursday, he will appear before the foreign affairs select committee of the House of Commons. The committee is preparing a report on Anglo- Chinese relations. Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, who is on a trip to Asia, arrives in Thailand. He is expected to call for an opening of the Thai financial and services sector to more foreign competition. Burmese constitution: The country's national convention is due to sit. It mostly comprises delegates hand-picked by the military junta and is charged with drafting a new constitution. It may feel its hand has been strengthened now the Karen, one of the regime's main opponents, have decided to hold peace talks. Bosnia negotiations resume: The leaders of Bosnia's three warring communities will resume partition talks in Geneva under the international mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. Last week, Nato renewed warnings that the Serbs would risk air strikes if they blocked the opening of the airport in Tuzla, the biggest Moslem stronghold. Hope for a settlement is slim. Bosnian prime minister Haris Silajdzic (above) has said that if the Serb shelling of Sarajevo does not stop, his delegation will stay away. Aluminium smeltdown: Trade representatives from the world's leading aluminium-producing countries meet in Brussels with industry representatives to consider ways of reducing global surpluses of the metal. This might lead to co-ordinated cuts in production. UK trade survey: The monthly distributive trade survey from the Confederation of British Industry should give the first insight in retail trade over Christmas and the New Year. Media reports and anecdotal evidence point to a spending spree in late December, although this may have been exaggerated by focusing on the hitherto depressed south. Official figures on Wednesday will provide further details of retail trading in December. WEDNESDAY Crunch-time for Hosokawa In a decisive week for Japan's prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa, his ruling coalition is trying to get parliament's upper house to vote on the four political and electoral reform bills in a plenary session. This is the final stage before they become law. Procedural delays and splits in its own camp have forced the coalition to aim for a vote in the upper house political reform committee mid-week, paving the way for a plenary vote by Friday. Hosokawa is expected to succeed in the end by a narrow margin. If he fails to get agreement by January 29, the end of the extended parliamentary session, he may resign. Bentsen in Beijing: US treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen is due in the Chinese capital. At a meeting of the US-China joint economic committee, he is expected to discuss China's economic reforms, opening up its markets, and US concerns about human rights. On Friday, he travels to Shanghai. Allies in Ankara: British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd visits the Turkish capital for talks with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller (left). Tomorrow he is joined by his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel. The Turks' European partners will try to reassure them that the Greek accession to the presidency of the European Union will not upset Turkey's plans to deepen its trade and political relations with Brussels. Theodoros Pangalos, Greece's deputy foreign minister, outlines to MEPs in Strasbourg his government's priorities for the EU presidency during the next six months. Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, is expected to convene a strategy session on the economy to try to find a way to reduce unemployment. Ungagged: The Irish government's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army terrorist organisation, is due to lapse. UK retail price index: Budget increases in tobacco, petrol and vehicle excise duties are set to push up inflation. The headline rate for December is expected to rise from November's 1.4 per cent year-on-year rate to about 2 per cent, which would be the highest level since December 1992. Forecasters expect only a modest upturn in underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, to 2.7 per cent last month, from 2.5 per cent in November. THURSDAY Bundesbank ponders rates The Bundesbank council holds its regular fortnightly meeting. The German central bank has not cut interest rates so far this year. Although money supply growth may be abating, the recent weakness of the D-Mark has added to uncertainty over the timing of German monetary easing. The Bank of England will announce the terms of its first extended repo and secured loan facilities to provide funds to the UK banking system to February 10 and to February 24. The move is a step towards liberalising the London money market. South African elections: The African National Congress publishes its official list of candidates for the April 27 elections, delayed from Tuesday because of computer problems. President FW de Klerk opens the National party election campaign with a trip to Northwest Province. Ukraine's parliament convenes: Ukraine's parliament, the rada, reconvenes for its last session before elections in March. Many of its members have already voiced their opposition to the accord signed by President Leonid Kravchuk in Moscow last Friday under which Ukraine is to eliminate its nuclear missiles over the next three years. This will be their first chance to attempt to derail the deal described by President Boris Yeltsin of Russia as 'putting the last full stop in the last chapter of the cold war'. Vietnam's Communist party is scheduled to hold a special conference that has been delayed from December. The party is expected to discuss the successes and problems of economic reform (to Jan 24). There may be a leadership reshuffle. Inman takes charge: Bobby Ray Inman is due to take over as US secretary of defense. Inman will be the first former career officer to serve as secretary of defense since General George Marshall, who held the office under President Harry Truman. Inman also has the distinction of having voted for George Bush in the election won by President Clinton. FRIDAY Belgian Guy to face music Belgium's political establishment continues its painful self-examination about allegations of bribery and corruption relating to the award of a helicopter contract to Agusta, the Italian aircraft manufacturer. Today, a special committee of the Belgian parliament is expected to question Guy Coeme, deputy prime minister, and the most senior of three French-speaking Socialist politicians. The magistrate investigating the affair wants to examine them. All three have denied any wrongdoing and opposed calls for their parliamentary immunity to be lifted. Lloyd's meeting: Names belonging to Lloyd's of London loss-making Feltrim syndicate meet to discuss the offer to settle litigation at the insurance market. They have been offered Pounds 237m, just under 40 per cent of their total claim. Turkey's president Suleyman Demirel attends a summit of Turkic republics in Baku, Azerbaijan (to Jan 22). Turkey hopes its cultural ties will help it increase trade with and influence in central Asia. WEEKEND Venezuela congress meets Venezuela's congress, elected last month, on Sunday begins its five-year term. In a sharp break with the country's democratic history, the two parties which have long dominated politics - Democratic Action (AD) and the Social Christian Copei party - will be forced to share power with other blocs. President-elect Rafael Caldera will thus be hard-pressed to put together a majority. ANC policy conference: The African National Congress, widely expected to play a leading role in South Africa's government after April's election, debates its future policy at an economic reconstruction conference. Party in Weimar: Manfred Brunner, founds a German anti-Maastricht party in Weimar on Sunday to contest this year's European election.

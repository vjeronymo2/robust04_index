			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFICER CHARGED WITH MOLESTING 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL  </P> <P> A veteran Los Angeles police officer was charged Tuesday with molesting a  14-year-old girl after talking his way into her home in the middle of the night  by pretending he was conducting an investigation.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Officer Stanley Yorikazu Tanabe, 32, was identified by the  girl as the policeman who terrorized her family at their Hollywood home on Jan.  29, then returned on March 1, both times off-duty but in uniform.  </P> <P> During the second incident, other officers were called to the scene and seized  Tanabe, a 6 1/2-year officer assigned to the 200-member Metro Division, as he  left the home. Tanabe was released at the time without being booked, but was  ordered confined to his home pending an investigation of the case.  </P> <P> After the filing of charges, Tanabe surrendered to authorities late Tuesday and  was ordered held on four felony counts in lieu of $250,000 bail by Los Angeles  Municipal Judge David Milton. He was charged with two counts of burglary and  one each of child molestation and assault with intent to molest.  </P> <P> His attorney, Paul DePasquale, said Tanabe will plead not guilty at his  arraignment, which was scheduled for April 4.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Posed a Danger  </P> <P> The defense asked that Tanabe be released on his own recognizance, but Deputy  Dist. Atty. Kenneth Freeman argued that the officer posed a danger to the  community.  </P> <P> "The point is it's absolutely outrageous that an off-duty officer would use his  uniform, badge, gun, and baton . . . to force his way into a house . . .  terrifying these people."  </P> <P> "I don't think the amount is unreasonable," Milton said in setting the bail,  noting that Tanabe is charged with committing serious crimes "under color of  authority."  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Tanabe selected the girl as his victim after spotting her on  the street and asking her where she lived.  </P> <P> According to police records, the girl told authorities that the officer had  driven by her house several times before she awoke about 3 a.m. on Jan. 29 to  find him standing by her bed and shining a flashlight in her face.  </P> <P> He allegedly had gained entry to the house by telling her parents -- who speak  only Spanish but awakened their 7-year-old son to translate -- that he was  responding to a call about someone screaming for help. When they explained  there was no problem, he threatened to kick the door in to check the residence,  according to police records.  </P> <P> The girl told authorities the man lifted her nightshirt, ordered her to put her  hands on her head and molested her. When she resisted, he placed one hand on  his gun, she said. Apparently thinking that he was impersonating an officer,  the girl told Tanabe she would call the police, according to the report. He  reportedly said he was just doing his job and checking for weapons.  </P> <P> Tanabe left, but allegedly returned a few minutes later with a photograph of a  man he said was wanted for murder and who purportedly lived at that address. He  insisted on speaking with the girl in private in the bedroom, where he accused  her of selling drugs, associating with gang members and having information  about hidden weapons -- all of which she denied, records indicate.  </P> <P> Tanabe allegedly returned to the home about 8 p.m. on March 1. After learning  that the girl's parents were not home, he went to her bedroom, found her  talking on the telephone to a friend and told her to hang up, according to  police reports. Speaking in rapid Spanish, she told her friend to call the  police, then ran to a neighbor's house and called them herself.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Taken Into Custody  </P> <P> Tanabe was taken into custody as he walked from the house. He was placed on  administrative leave with pay and ordered confined to his north Los Angeles  County home while the Police Department's internal affairs division completed  its investigation.  </P> <P> Police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said the investigation had found "possible  strong evidence" against Tanabe.  </P> <P> Like all applicants for police jobs, Tanabe had undergone a battery of  psychological tests before he was hired, Booth said.  </P> <P> Defense attorney DePasquale said he has not yet had an opportunity to review  the case.  </P> <P> "There is some sort of an awful confusion," he said. "There is nothing in this  fellow's background that would lead you to believe he could have done something  like this."  </P> <P> He said Tanabe had offered to submit to a polygraph test, but that the district  attorney's office declined the offer.  </P> <P> Tanabe is married and the father of an infant, DePasquale said.  </P> <P> He could be sentenced to nine years in state prison if convicted on all counts.  </P></p>

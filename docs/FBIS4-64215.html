			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- One of the three German CH-53 Bundeswehr  helicopters used for UN missions in Iraq has been out of  operation following a stone-throwing attack by an angry mob on  27 March. This was confirmed by a Defense Ministry spokesman on  Friday [29 April].    The transport helicopter, which takes inspectors and other  UN  personnel to operation sites, was to pick up two Austrian blue  helmets in Mossul and evacuate them to Kuwait. On the landing  field next to Mossul hospital, some 20 UN blue helmets securing  the area were overrun by an angry crowd. The crew and the two  Austrians saved themselves with a speedy takeoff, but they had  to touch down in Baghdad, where three windows were found to be  cracked and one of the two engines and the rotor blades damaged.    As there was no imminent danger, the matter was treated as a  technical accident at the time and thus the incident was not  reported to the public, the spokesman said. He pointed out that  every UN flight is agreed upon by the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Nikolay Geronin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 15 TASS -- Russia is completely  satisfied with its talks with South Korea's Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu, whose official visit to Moscow was concluded on  Friday. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov told  ITAR-TASS that the talks had proved very productive.    First of all, Panov said, the two countries have begun  laying  the groundwork for South Korean President Kim Yong-sam's visit  to the Russian capital in June. A package of bilateral  documents will be prepared for the Russian-Korean summit  meeting, and will include a political document. Moscow and  Seoul have also begun preparing a series of bilateral  agreements, some of them economic.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's negotiations with  Han Sung-chu contained a substantive exchange of opinions  concerning the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula. The two  sides agreed to maintain close cooperation in that question.    The South Korean delegation positively responded to Russia's  proposal to call an international conference on the security and  nuclear status of the Korean peninsula. Seoul considers it  possible to widen the proposed conference's possible agenda.  Another possible topic of discussion for the conference is  cooperation in various fields with the sub-region, Aleksandr  Panov said.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Warhorses and gadflies in Russian race: Contenders line up for next Sunday's democratic parliamentary elections Russian politicians competing in the campaign ahead of the parliamentary elections on December 12 speak for constituencies as yet largely unformed. A propertied class is still in the making; it has not differentiated itself fully from a working class. 'Liberals' and 'conservatives' do not come with a package of beliefs and policies - reflecting the still fragile existence of parties which, in settled democracies, package such policies and use party discipline to impress them on their members. There is only a small number of professional politicians, and they are conscious of their unpopularity. The 13 groups and parties presently registered to participate in the elections thus seek to bring in to the political fold public figures from the intelligentsia, from literature and the arts, and from the stage and television. The result, in many of the blocs, is a rich mixture of warhorses and gadflies, each of whom is concerned to express his or her individuality. This first parliamentary election in Russia may also be the last before the minders, media managers and massagers of the message move in: it is thus a blessed time for the voyeur of the political scene, even if, probably, the individuals contending for office are unlikely all to make serviceable deputies.</p>

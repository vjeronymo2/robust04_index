			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: NOW PLAYING: AVANT-GARDE MOVIE 'BOUTIQUES'  </P> <P> Searching for an architecture to express the style of his small but rapidly  expanding independent film and TV production company, Propaganda Films  president Joni Sighvatsson told designer Frank Israel that "we need to project  a young and funky image."  </P> <P> Sighvatsson wanted at all costs to avoid what he described as the stuffy  corporate look of established movie studios. "Our business is selling images,"  he said, "and we needed to show in our architecture that we are different from  the old-style Hollywood-Burbank operation."  </P> <P> Propaganda Films' new headquarters is distinctly young and funky. The raw and  airy space of an old prop storage warehouse hidden away in a Hollywood back  street has been transformed by Israel into a free-form stage set filled with  miniature scenarios.  </P> <P> The free-standing conference room, painted a deep rust, resembles a tiny round  fort out of Antonioni's "Red Desert." A boat-shaped core of offices floating  under the old warehouse's bare timber bow trusses has the air of a beached hull  left over from a World War II sea battle epic. The espresso bar that replaces  the reception area found in more conventional commercial layouts seems like a  prop from a New Wave "La Dolce Vita."  </P> <P> "Propaganda's design promotes the myth of Hollywood," Israel explained. "And  making myths is what Hollywood is all about."  </P> <P> Inside Propaganda, the Hollywood New Wave image-projection is everywhere.  </P> <P> Hip-punk directors such as David Lynch and John Landis presided over noisy and  casual casting sessions recently in Propaganda's espresso-bar entry. A constant  stream of young men and women in outre Melrose Avenue outfits scurry among the  architecture as if their every action were being taped by invisible cameras.  </P> <P> Said Propaganda Films co-founder Steve Golin: "In our space we want to create a  scene where people feel alive and energized, and -- if you'll pardon the cliche  -- on the cutting edge."  </P> <P> The company's lively design is typical of a host of independent film and  television "production boutiques" that have sprung up in the past five years.  As the motion-picture industry's major studios come under the control of  conglomerates, a legion of lean and hungry young producers has spun off to set  up their own companies in spaces designed to express an active avant-garde  image.  </P> <P> Golin said that the secret of the success of the independents is "low overheads  and high energy, low profiles and high style." He claims his company can make  feature films for $5 million that the studios could not match for double the  budget.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Three-Year Growth  </P> <P> Since its start in 1986, Propaganda has become the largest producer of music  videos in the United States. In three years, the company has sprung from  nothing to an annual gross of around $40 million.  </P> <P> Sighvatsson and Golin find their new Hollywood location convenient as well as  mythical. The area is stocked with prop-rental houses, post-production studios  and film-supply outlets. Commercial rentals, at around $1 per square foot per  month, are still cheap compared to elsewhere on the Westside.  </P> <P> In the last few years, Venice and Santa Monica have also become popular  locations for new production boutiques. Drawn by the area's adventurous upscale  ambience, these young companies have transformed a variety of spaces, from old  warehouses to conventional office buildings, into New Wave fantasias.  </P> <P> The Venice commercial production house known simply as Pytka, one of the first  of the new breed to create its own space in 1985, commissioned architect Bill  Adams to convert an old Main Street streetcar repair barn into a  "mini-village."  </P> <P> "Joe Pytka wanted to develop a space where a series of separate small  production outfits, including his own, could share a communal feeling," Adams  explained. "The village idea, in which we laid out an interior 'Main Street'  complete with trees linking the separate areas, came out of our discussions.  The style retains the ruggedness of the old trolley barn played off against the  sleeker finishes of the new partitions and furnishings."  </P> <P> The notion that independent film producers and small production companies can  band together to share a building is catching on. The Lantana Center, a  development under way on Olympic Boulevard in Santa Monica designed by Arthur  Pereira, is recycling an old office structure into a studio "garden complex."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Privacy for Redford  </P> <P> Heavyweight independents such as Robert Redford are also creating their own  architectural enclaves. Redford's secretive new Sundance office suite on Ocean  Avenue in Santa Monica is rumored to feature bullet-proof glass partitions and  pass-key elevators as protection against eager sightseers and unsolicited  scripts.  </P> <P> The four-story Santa Monica Studios building on Arizona Avenue, built by  architect-developer Vito Cetta for rental as standard office space, was snapped  up by two production houses, Media Design West and Visual Eyes.  </P> <P> Visual Eyes executive Alan Kozlowski told Bret Thoeny of Boto Design Inc. that  he wanted something "very Venice, yet suave and muted" to characterize his  company's style.  </P> <P> Like Propaganda Films, the design of Visual Eyes sacrifices status and  executive privacy for the noisy rough-and-tumble of open-plan spaces where  everyone in the company may meet to argue out issues, hold rowdy casting  sessions or simply hang out. Obscured patterned glass mutes the sunlight that  pours in from the studio's central atrium. The subdued tones in the bleached  oak finishes and the gray and pastel colors create an open atmosphere that  expresses an informal, non-hierarchical style where everyone is free to  suggest, challenge and collaborate on equal footing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rush of Juices  </P> <P> "Studio execs love to leave their plush Century City or Universal City suites  and come slumming here," Propaganda's Golin said. "Our scene's a real rush for  them, it juices them up and sends them back to work lit up."  </P> <P> A prominent Universal Studios executive, who wished to remain anonymous,  confirmed that a visit to one of the young independents "leaves me so juiced  I'm tempted to jump ship and lead the wild life."  </P> <P> Distinctive architecture for offices and production facilities is a  surprisingly new idea in the movie industry.  </P> <P> In the old days the studios, mostly vast sheds linked to strings of offices,  were seldom distinguished in design. Classic Hollywood's reputation for style  comes from the flair expressed in the movie sets rather than the architecture  that housed them. Famed 1920s and '30s designers such as Erte and Norman Bel  Geddes created Art Deco and Streamline Moderne settings that were masterpieces  of opulence and grace.  </P> <P> "The wonderful thing about the myth of Hollywood is its constant re-creation,"  Propaganda architect Israel said.  </P> <P> "The reality may grow stale, as the major studios show, but the idea continues  to inspire new energies and new styles that renew the story."  </P></p>

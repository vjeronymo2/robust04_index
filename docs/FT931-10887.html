			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: DTI clears Suter chief of insider share dealing SUTER, the industrial conglomerate, said yesterday that Mr David Abell, chairman, had been cleared of insider dealing by the DTI. Mr Nigel Blyth-Tinker, company secretary, said Clifford Chance, Mr Abell's lawyers, had received confirmation in writing from the DTI that investigations under section 177 of the Financial Services Act, which relates to insider dealing, had been completed and the DTI did not intend to bring any prosecution against Mr Abell. The DTI refuses publicly to comment on insider dealing investigations and would not confirm Suter's announcement. The apparent clearance of Mr Abell comes two weeks after DTI inspectors found no evidence that he and other parties acted in concert in taking stakes in a number of companies in the mid-1980s. However, the inspectors, who were appointed in July 1988, expressed severe reservations about one of the cases, when Mr Abell acquired 100,000 shares in Metal Closures, the final purchase being made on January 8 1987. Later on the same day Mr Abell authorised the purchase on behalf of Suter of 350,000 Metal Closures shares.</p>

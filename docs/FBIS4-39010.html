			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Zasurskiy report under the "Finances" rubric: </F> "Federation Council Recommends To Hike Spending. The Military  To Get 55 Trillion"]    [Text] In a closed session yesterday, the Federation  Council accepted as a basis the decree "On the Course of Shaping  the 1994 Federal Budget," which calls for a notable increase in  the number of defense and social-sphere expenditure items.    The decree recommends to the State Duma "to increase in the  expenditure part of the budget financial aid to the other levels  of power up to 23 trillion rubles [R], including the financing  of outlays for the maintenance of facilities in the social  sphere and the housing stock which is being turned over under  the authority of local bodies of state power in 1994, by R7.3  trillion," "to increase defense spending to R55 trillion," to  regard it as necessary to replenish the financial aid fund  through Central Bank emission credits rather than through  transfers from the federal budget, "to regard it necessary to  accept R4.3 trillion as the sum to cover the creation of  regional food funds in the budget to be distributed among the  specific regions." One of the recommendations to the State Duma  asks it "to establish a system of priorities for the  distribution of emission credits so as to provide finances in a  timely manner to those regions that lack them."    As regards an increase in defense spending, the Federation  Council suggests itemizing the funds thus: R12 trillion for  arms purchases, up to R5.5 trillion for research and development  work, and up to R8 trillion for capital construction, while  outlays for the maintenance of the Armed Forces should be cut  from R28 trillion to R25.8 trillion.    Thus, the decision so far accepted "as a basis" restores the  Defense Ministry's and the military-industrial complex's share  of participation in the budget to the one initially planned  during the Finance Ministry's drafting of the budget message,  which, however, was reduced before having been put before the  State Duma.    The Federation Council asked the Duma to increase the budget  deficit attributed to defense items to R18 trillion in all.  Commenting on this decision by the upper house of parliament,  Senator Nikolay Gonchar stated that the Federation Council  "wants no standoff with the government; it weighs the interests  of the government and the country as a whole, and if the  country's interests tip scales, this is normal." If the State  Duma fails to consider the Federation Council's expenditure  recommendations, the senators would go back to discussing their  budget amendments after the budget has been put to the upper  house of parliament for approval. According to Nikolay Gonchar,  the Federation Council decision is not in recognition of  Glazyev's budget, although there are constructive aspects on the  Duma economist's stance. However, "Glazyev's additional incomes  can go to patch up the holes in the old budget."    More critical of the decree were Yuriy Chernichenko and  Boris  Nemtsov, who talked to journalists. A chagrined Mr.  Chernichenko said it was guns before butter. Boris Nemtsov  thought it necessary to hold an independent item-by-item study  of the budget expenditure, because it could yield rather  unexpected results. Arguing against the funds for military  capital construction, Boris Nemtsov stated that he "has no use  for Defense Ministry funds to build a home for some officer  named Ivanov, for example, in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast," while it  would be sensible to arrange for personal bank accounts to  transfer the money that can only be spent by its owner for  housing construction. "Eight trillion means 400,000 officers  would be able to have decent homes built for them." To  illustrate the justice of the claims made by Nemtsov, who spoke  at the session, it suffices to recall the recent con jobs in the  United States where hammers ordered by the government were sold  at a thousand bucks each.</p>

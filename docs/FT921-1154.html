			<p>920325 FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: FT Election Share Index THE prevailing pattern since the election was called reasserted itself yesterday, as shares that might benefit from a Labour win outperformed those that might do better if the government remained unchanged. 'Labour gainers' rose by less than the FT-SE index, but are still less than a percentage point below the level at which they started.</p>

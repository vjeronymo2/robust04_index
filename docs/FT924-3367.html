			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report LME base metals largely built on earlier gains in the afternoon and closed steady, while nickel prices ended firmer. Dealers said NICKEL continued to trade within a wide range, with short covering emerging in the afternoon after Chinese buying in the morning. COPPER ran into some late option-related selling, which prevented three-month metal moving above the Dollars 2,220-a-tonne resistance level. But prices still closed firmer after early Chinese buying, with final business at Dollars 2,219, up Dollars 19. London's COCOA closed near the day's lows as sterling's continued advance kept the market under pressure in quiet conditions. Dealers said the physical market was also subdued with little sign of any further origin activity after small-scale Ivorian sales towards the end of last week. Robusta COFFEE futures closed marginally lower with the market experiencing a temporary halt in its upward trend. Dealers said it would probably now take buying from roasters to generate further gains. Compiled from Reuters</p>

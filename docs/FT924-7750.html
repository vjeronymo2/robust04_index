			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Insurers challenge proposed regulator THE ASSOCIATION of British Insurers, the main trade body for the insurance industry, yesterday advised its members to steer clear of the Personal Investments Authority, a proposed self-regulatory body for financial services. It said it wanted to wait until 95 per cent of potential members of the new body had joined it. The ABI said yesterday that, if the industry did not give full support to the new authority on a voluntary basis, 'there is a strong case for legislation to remove the Securities and Investments Board's powers of direct regulation'. That statement further undermines the prospects of the proposed body, which is intended to include not only life insurers and independent financial advisers, but also banks and building societies which sell financial services. Most UK banks and building societies are members of SIB's own direct self-regulatory body, known as Sibro, and of Imro, the self-regulatory body for the financial services industry. The life insurers and independent financial advisers are members of Lautro and Fimbra. The association said that SIB's announced intention to treat the Personal Investments Authority as the 'lead regulator' for firms which were members of Sibro did not go far enough. Banks and building societies and several of the larger independent financial adviser networks have expressed great reluctance to join the new authority and say that retail regulation should be best accomplished by merging Lautro and Fimbra. Meanwhile, the association has spelled out a number of changes it wishes to see to the charter of the new authority, which is intended to be produced in final form in January.</p>

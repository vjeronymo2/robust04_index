			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Profits continue to fall at Japanese banks: Bad loans and higher costs take toll at year-end THE leading Japanese commercial banks yesterday reported a decline in annual pre-tax profits for the third year in succession, due to the impact of the plunge in Tokyo financial markets, an increase in costs and a rise in write-offs on bad loans. These effects more than offset a substantial increase in income from lending operations, which benefited from a sustained decline in interest rates and a widening in lending margins. Net business profits - a measure of profits from lending operations - increased 31.5 per cent to Y1,922bn (Pounds 8.24bn) but pre-tax profits for 11 leading banks fell 14 per cent on a non-consolidated basis to Y1,426bn. After-tax profits fell 26.9 per cent to Y647.6bn. The results are in line with Ministry of Finance estimates published a month ago to reassure investors and financial company managers about the health of Japanese banks. Combined bad-debt provisions rose fivefold to Y344.1bn. The levels remain low in relation to estimates circulating in Tokyo of total bad and doubtful loans, including loans made to the troubled Japanese property market. The finance ministry has estimated publicly that the 21 largest Japanese banks (including the 11 commercial banks) had bad loans of between Y7,000bn and Y8,000bn at the end of March. This covers loans on which interest has not been paid for six months or more. Other estimates have run as high as Y30,000bn and more. However, these estimates ignore the potential value of collateral. Japanese banks do not generally write off debts if there is a possibility of eventually recovering the money - even if that recovery is several years away. This accounts for the discrepancy between estimates of problem loans and the actual provisions revealed yesterday. Three banks made separate provisions for losses arising from fraudulent loan cases which came to light last year. Fuji Bank set aside Y142.8bn, Tokai Bank Y49.5bn and Kyowa Saitama Bank Y8.2bn. Mr Ryuichi Kato, Tokai chairman, resigned his title (though not his board seat) to take responsibility for the bank's poor performance. Three other Tokai board members also resigned. Losses on securities portfolios were 11 times more than in 1990-91 to Y828.7bn, reflecting continuing stock market weakness. Because banks count a portion of their stock portfolios as capital the fall in portfolio values reduced capital reserves. As a result, there was a deterioration in banks' ratios of capital to assets calculated under Bank for International Settlements rules. But only Sakura, with a ratio of 7.92 per cent, failed to make the 8 per cent minimum the BIS will bring into effect next year. Meanwhile, as the bankers grapple with the problems of past loans and investments, their efforts to improve returns from current business is bearing fruit - as shown in the increase in net business profits. Mitsubishi Bank said the increase was due to a substantial fall in interest rates coupled to the adoption of an improved system for pricing loans and better marketing of high-margin consumer loans. The banks, which are trying to limit asset growth to meet BIS ratios, restricted loan growth to 2.9 per cent. Loans fell at Sakura by 0.9 per cent and at the Bank of Tokyo by 1.2 per cent. Sumitomo Bank kept its place as the most profitable bank, followed by Sanwa Bank and Fuji. The Bank of Tokyo was the only bank to post an increase in pre-tax profits, albeit marginal. Sumitomo retained its lead in international revenues, with the Bank of Tokyo in second place.

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 FIRMS LINKED TO RECRUIT ACCUSED OF DISCRIMINATION  </P> <P> Two Los Angeles-based companies linked to Recruit, the Tokyo firm at the center  of a scandal that has rocked Japanese politics, are under investigation by the  U.S. government on charges that their employee recruitment businesses have  engaged in "a shocking pattern" of race, age and sex discrimination.  </P> <P> The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in court documents filed Tuesday,  alleged that Interplace/Transworld Recruit, a job referral agency partly owned  by Recruit, used a secret code in internal documents to specify employers'  preferences for workers of a particular race, sex, national origin or age.  </P> <P> For instance, if an employer only wanted to hire whites between the ages of 30  and 40, a notation would be placed on a job order that read, "Talk to Mary;  Suite 30-40," according to an Interplace memo filed in U.S. District Court in  San Francisco by the commission. If the employer sought a black, the code would  read, "Talk to Maryanne," the memo says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Memo on IBM  </P> <P> A second memo filed in court describes a meeting between top executives of IBM  Japan and Recruit U.S.A., the Tokyo firm's U.S. subsidiary. The memo describes  Recruit's plans for a hiring campaign on behalf of IBM in which non-Asian  applicants allegedly would be denied consideration.  </P> <P> That April, 1988, memo, written in Japanese, says, "Foreigners, no good -- IBM  current rule. . . . White people, black people -- NO, but second-generation  Japanese or others of Asian descent OK."  </P> <P> The commission launched an investigation of the two firms after former  employees told the San Francisco Chronicle of the alleged practices. In a  relatively uncommon step taken when the victims of alleged discrimination are  unknown, the formal charges were filed last week by the commission's vice  chairman, E. Gaull Silberman.  </P> <P> John Shiner, an attorney in Los Angeles for the Recruit firms, said Wednesday  that when former employees confronted company officials with charges of  improper practices, steps were taken to make sure the firms' policies complied  with U.S. law. Shiner declined to comment on the commission's charges, however,  saying he had not had time to review the stack of documents filed by the  government.  </P> <P> IBM has not been publicly charged, and commission lawyers declined to say if  the computer maker is under investigation. Mac Jeffery, a spokesman in Tokyo  for IBM Japan, said the firm does not discriminate and that the memo does not  accurately reflect the instructions IBM gave Recruit.  </P> <P> "At no time in that meeting did we even hint to them we wanted to screen out  anybody," Jeffery said. Jeffery said there was no indication IBM was a subject  of the job commission's investigation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Restraining Order Obtained  </P> <P> Normally, commission charges and investigations are confidential until action  is taken against an employer. The charges against the Recruit firms became  public Tuesday, however, when commission lawyers -- fearful that the companies  would destroy documents critical to the inquiry -- obtained a restraining order  from U.S. District Judge Stanley A. Weigel directing Recruit not to alter any  records or remove them from the country.  </P> <P> Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and 52 other top officials in Japanese  government, business and journalism have been forced to resign amid disclosures  that they accepted millions of dollars in payments from Recruit, a firm that  began as a tiny job referral agency and became a sprawling information and real  estate empire.  </P> <P> The company's U.S. operations are far more low key.  </P> <P> Interplace primarily operates in the domestic American market, recruiting  employees in the United States for American firms. Recruit U.S.A. publishes  help-wanted magazines in which Japanese and other companies run ads soliciting  job applications from bilingual Americans interested in working in Japan. For  an additional fee, the firm also will screen and refer applicants.  </P> <P> In addition to their downtown Los Angeles headquarters, the firms have offices  in New York and several California cities, including Costa Mesa, Torrance,  Gardena, San Francisco and San Mateo.  </P> <P> The charges, which could subject the Recruit companies to fines or orders to  make restitution to job applicants, reflect the employment commission's growing  attention to the conduct of Japanese firms in the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agreement on Hiring  </P> <P> The Big Three Japanese car makers -- Nissan, Toyota and Honda -- all have  agreed in the last two years to alter their hiring practices and give jobs to  minority applicants following commission investigations. Clarence Thomas,  chairman of the commission, has declared that the agency will be especially  vigilant that Japanese firms not try to import to the United States hiring  practices acceptable under Japan's far weaker discrimination laws.  </P> <P> However, the kind of activities allegedly engaged in by Interplace and Recruit  U.S.A. hardly are confined to Japanese personnel agencies. Civil rights lawyers  long have complained that it is widespread practice for employers to use  personnel agencies to screen out job applicants on the basis of age, race or  sex, said Linda J. Krieger, a senior trial attorney for the commission in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW RECRUIT CODED ITS JOB ORDERS  </P> <P> When a company hired Interplace/Transworld Recruit to screen and refer  potential employees, the job agency allegedly used a code on the job order to  indicate the client's preferences regarding the age, sex, race and nationality  of job prospects. The codes, and their meaning, are outlined in an Interplace  memo disclosed in court by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission:  </P> <P> SUITE 20 THROUGH 35 or SUITE 20-35: ages 20 to 35  </P> <P> FLOOR 40: person in his/her 40's  </P> <P> TALK TO MARIA or SEE MARIA or MEET WITH MARIA: prefer/will accept Hispanics  </P> <P> TALK TO MARY or SEE MARY or MEET WITH MARY: prefer/will accept Caucasians  </P> <P> TALK TO MARIKO or SEE MARIKO or MEET WITH MARIKO: prefer/will accept Japanese  </P> <P> TALK TO ADAM or SEE ADAM or MEET WITH ADAM: prefer/must be Male  </P> <P> TALK TO EVE or SEE EVE or MEET WITH EVE: prefer/must be Female  </P> <P> TALK TO MARYANNE or SEE MARYANNE or MEET WITH MARYANNE: prefer/will accept  Blacks  </P> <P> Source: Court filing by Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  </P></p>

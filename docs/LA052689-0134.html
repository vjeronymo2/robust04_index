			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> About 75 death penalty opponents, including the mother of executed John  Spenkelink, held a protest rally in Tallahassee, Fla., on the 10th anniversary  of Spenkelink's death. Lois Spenkelink, now 78 and confined to a wheelchair,  said she traveled from California in hopes of changing public opinion on  capital punishment. "I think only God has the right to take another life," she  said. Spenkelink's former pastor, Tom Feamster, said the anger he felt 10 years  ago has yielded to sadness. "We really don't need to pray for John, he's OK,"  Feamster said.  </P></p>

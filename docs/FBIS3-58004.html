			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In a sweeping criticism of all parties  involved in the Yugoslavia conflict, today in Bonn European  Union mediator Lord Owen apportioned equal blame for the  continuation of the war to all the leaders. Together with the  other co-chairman of the Geneva Yugoslavia conference, Thorvald  Stoltenberg, Lord Owen spoke with [German] Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel about the civil war situation. While Kinkel  expressly warned against optimism, Lord Owen went a step further  and said that the leaders of all the warring parties were  indifferent to the fates of the people "because they have lost  touch with reality." They still thought that advantages were to  be derived from continuing the fighting.    The discussion with the two Yugoslavia mediators followed a  meeting between Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, in the  run-up to a two-way conference between Presidents Franjo Tudjman  (Croatia) and Alija Izetbegovic (Bosnia-Herzegovina), who  planned to meet at their own request in Bonn on Saturday [8  January].    Stoltenberg, too, spoke of a "deterioration in the  situation." He regretted the lack of UN forces to enforce the UN  Security Council resolutions, and warned against further force  withdrawals.</p>

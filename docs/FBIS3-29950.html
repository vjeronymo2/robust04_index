A political essay of the paper headlined "We Have Great  Theses" reads in part:    Socialist Korea is a great country, the first country in  history to successfully solve the difficult and outstanding  socialist rural question on the basis of the great rural theses.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said:    "`Theses on the socialist rural question in our country'  authored by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is our party's  programme of building the countryside and a bright blueprint for  a final solution of the rural question."    The great rural theses is the only programme for a solution  to the rural question, the first of its kind in history which  was authored by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and has  been successfully implemented by our party.    This great theses clearly indicates the way of finally  solving the rural question by vigorously carrying on the three  revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural, in the  countryside, realising the leadership of the working class to  the peasants, assistance of industry to agriculture and support  of towns to the countryside, strengthening the guidance and  management of the rural economy and the [words indistinct]  between property of the whole people and cooperative property  and eliminating the class distinction between the working class  the peasantry. It is a great programme of rural construction  which could be provided only by Comrade Kim Il-song, who founded  the idea greatest ever in history and looks behind the curtain  of time with a strong sense of responsibility for the destiny of  our peasants and other people.    The changes which have taken place in the socialist  countryside of our country thanks to the rural theses are a  brilliant fruition of the iron will and the revolutionary  practice of the great leader and the illustrious leader, who  have [words indistinct] the idea and principles of the great  theses in any circumstances and have guided our people along the  road indicated by it.    Though there are many roads in the world, the way indicated  by our rural theses is the most correct and shortest one. We  have our own way. Our respected leader and dear leader are  great and our rural theses is entirely just.    We will follow the road of chuche, the way of the rural  theses, no matter which way the wind may blow and no matter what  others may say.    We will move up the day of the complete victory of socialism  and realise the idea of communism without fail from rice along  the road indicated by the great rural theses, which was authored  by Comrade Kim Il-song and has been implemented by Comrade Kim  Chong-il.    We have great rural theses.</p>

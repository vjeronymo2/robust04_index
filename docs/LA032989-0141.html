			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH VOWS PAY HIKE ACTION SOON  </P> <P> President Bush said today he will send Congress "in the next few days" his  specific recommendations for pay hikes for top federal officials, members of  Congress and judges.  </P> <P> Bush made the commitment as the private National Commission on Public Service  suggested raises of about 50% over two years for federal officials, virtually  as high as the increases that Congress killed amid a public outcry in February.  </P> <P> Neither Bush nor White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater indicated what Bush's  recommendation would be, but Bush is known to favor some sort of raise.  </P> <P> The commission, which has former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker as  its head and former President Gerald R. Ford and former Vice President Walter  F. Mondale among its 36 members, also suggested pay increases for lower-ranking  government workers.  </P></p>

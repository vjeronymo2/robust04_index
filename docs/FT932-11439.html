			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / International Company News: Record loss for Hafnia HAFNIA Holding, parent company to the Hafnia insurance group, established a record in Danish corporate losses last year, with a deficit of DKr9.14bn (Dollars 1.5bn), against one of DKr1.31bn in 1991. The previous biggest loss was reported by Unibank in 1992, when the bank was in the red to the tune of DKr1.7bn. Hafnia Holding's equity capital was turned from a positive DKr3.12bn at the end of 1991 to a negative DKr4.13bn last year, while assets tumbled from DKr9.48bn to DKr2.40bn. Hafnia's collapse was caused by its investments in Baltica, its Danish rival, and Skandia, the Swedish insurer. Creditors in Hafnia Holding are due to meet on May 6 to decide whether to force the company into bankruptcy. Among the biggest creditors are Den Dansk Bank and Germany's Commerz bank.</p>

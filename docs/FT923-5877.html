			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Marketmakers widen margins on Ecu bonds A GROUP of a dozen marketmakers yesterday decided unilaterally to widen the margins quoted between bid and offer prices on Ecu Eurobonds, in an effort to shore up the market's diminishing liquidity, as prices went into another downward spin. A spate of opinion polls showing a majority of French voters against the Maastricht treaty in next month's referendum sent Ecu bond prices tumbling. For example, Italy's Ecu bonds due 2011 have dipped four points so far this week. Selling of Ecu bond holdings by central banks, in order to raise funds for intervention in the foreign exchange market, added to the downward pressure, according to dealers. The market is 'struggling with the fact that we may be heading for a no vote,' said one trader. It has virtually stopped functioning.' Many Ecu bond traders have not been picking up telephones this week, in an attempt to avoid accumulating further dealing losses, but leaving investors unable to liquidate their holdings. Although the International Securities Market Association, the self-regulatory body which oversees the Eurobond market, still recognises 44 marketmakers, only a small proportion of that number are still active in the sector. 'The market is once again examining the appropriate liquidity in a difficult situation,' said Mr David Ovenden, who heads the International Securities Market Association's Ecu sub-committee. Yesterday's move to wider spreads, orchestrated by Paribas, is designed to encourage marketmakers to continue making prices. However, a similar agreement reached by all marketmakers only two weeks ago has already failed. If the latest agreement fails, a further suspension of marketmaking is likely to be considered. Marketmaking was stopped for a day last month, after chaotic selling of Ecu bonds was triggered by Denmark's rejection of the treaty.</p>

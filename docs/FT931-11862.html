			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Management: Executives forced to buy slice of pie It is an acknowledged truth that managers with large parts of their personal wealth tied up in a business will tend to be more concerned about its performance than those without. This simple fact lies behind a new trend in US executive pay policy which could eventually spread to Europe: some companies have begun to insist that their senior managers acquire a specific and sizeable amount of the business's shares. Last week Union Carbide announced that its senior managers would be required to own shares in the chemicals company in proportion to their salaries. Kodak, the photographic equipment manufacturer, did likewise last month. Xerox, the copier company, introduced a similar scheme a year ago. Other companies have started actively 'encouraging' managers to hold specific amounts of stock. For example CSX, the transport group, organised a successful scheme last year which offered over 160 of its executives loans to buy shares at market prices. So far the movement is limited to a handful of companies, but many experts believe this is just the beginning. Howard Sherman of Washington-based Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which advises large investors on corporate governance, says it is the start of a 'major trend over the next few years'. Schemes to align managers' financial interests with those of shareholders are hardly new. Many companies have always encouraged executives to buy an unspecified number of shares in the business. And the past 10-15 years has seen a boom in two particular kinds of carrot supposed to enhance executive performance. These are annual bonuses pegged to a company's financial performance; and share option schemes which allow executives to buy stock at today's price at some point in the future. However, there is growing evidence in the US that share option schemes are not binding managers to the long-term interests of the company as strongly as they might. Far from holding on to the shares received when they exercise options, managers tend to cash in quickly. Brian Dunn, who specialises in executive compensation at New York consultants Towers Perrin, suggests that managers tend to hold over the long-term less than 25 per cent of the shares they acquire under option schemes. And it is mainly to counter this 'take the options money and run' attitude that companies are now starting to demand specific levels of shareholding. This is partly enlightened self-interest, partly a response to shareholder pressures. ISS, for example, has recommended for the past two years that stock option plans be written in ways which limit managers' ability to sell their shares. Companies implementing schemes range from those that tend to be at the cutting edge of management issues, such as Xerox, to those facing pressure from shareholders for a big improvement in performance, such as Kodak. Kodak's scheme requires each of the company's top 40 executives to invest certain multiples of their pay in the company over the next five years. Kay Whitmore, the chairman, will have to acquire stock amounting to four times his base annual salary (which in 1991 was nearly Dollars 1m), while the more junior end of the range will have to invest the equivalent of one annual salary. 'Five years from now, no senior manager of this company will own less than the equivalent of one-year's base pay,' says Whitmore. 'The result: all our senior managers will act and behave like owners of this company, because they will be substantial owners.' Union Carbide's scheme sets similar targets and the same time-frame. Xerox required its top 50 managers to hold only one year's base salary, but to reach this level over a mere 18 months. The idea is one whose time has come, but some top US executives have qualms. Mr Dunn says a number of clients have told him they feel their company has 'no right to intrude into people's personal financial circumstances'.</p>

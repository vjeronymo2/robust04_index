			<p>BFN     [Text] The Right Honorable Prime Minister Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle  says the Lesotho Government established the Ministry of Defense,  which will be responsible for all matters relating to the  Lesotho defense force. He was responding to a question by  Senator Patrick Motha, who wanted to know how soon would the  ministry that would deal with the matters relating to the  Lesotho Defense Force be established.    The prime minister said the British Government assisted the  Government of Lesotho in setting up the Ministry of Defense and  would send a civilian advisor, who will be in Lesotho for one  year. He said since the offices of the new ministry have not yet  been constructed, the ministry will be temporarily accommodated  at the offices of the Lesotho Tourism Board.    The prime minister said for security reasons the number and  names of the personnel in the Defense Ministry would not be  disclosed.</p>

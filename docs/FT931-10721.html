			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Tenants over-stay I LET the ground floor and basement of my house as an art gallery. The last tenants occupied these premises on a five year lease which expired on August 22. By virtue of a court order, this lease was excluded from the Landlord and Tenants Act 1954, sections 24-28 inclusive. The tenants did not vacate the property at the end of the lease but remained in occupation until October 5, when the keys were handed over. In fact, their builders were there, carrying out repairs and decorations which were the tenants' liability under the lease terms. Am I entitled to claim rent until October 5, when the premises were handed back, or until the next quarter day, December 24? You can claim a sum for use and occupation for the period from August 23 to October 5. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in thses columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

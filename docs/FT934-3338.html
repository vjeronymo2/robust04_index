			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Indexation alteration iniquitous Sir, Mr Clarke's proposed change to the indexation of the cost of investments which are sold at a loss (or small profit) is a nonsense, if not iniquitous. In the case of an investor with, let us say, a net chargeable gain of Pounds 10,000, made up of a profit of Pounds 15,000 and a loss of Pounds 5,000, why should he be allowed to increase the cost of the profitable investment but not that of the unprofitable one? Wherein lieth the difference, pray? Being a pessimist by nature, I don't suppose he can be persuaded to change his mind, but might I suggest to him that at the very least, the book cost of all investments held at November 30 1993 should be revalued to the November RPI level, whether they are eventually sold at a profit or a loss? This would eliminate the element of retrospectivity in his proposal, which is thoroughly unfair, particularly to those who may have held an investment for many years. John Marsh, 6 Heatherdale Close, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey KT2 7SU.</p>

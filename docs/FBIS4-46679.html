Vasilyev  <H5>  On the Results of the All-Russian Conference "Problems of </H5> Completion of Check Privatization and Development of the Stock  Market"    From 29 March through 1 April 1994 in Izhevsk there was an  all-Russian conference of check investment funds called  "Problems of Completion of Check Privatization and Development  of the Stock Market." The purpose of the conference was to  resolve the following problems:    1. Completion of check privatization and solving problems of  check investment funds and the development of the stock market  in the regions.    2. Consideration of problems of forming the state investment  program under conditions of the emerging capital market.    3. Discussion of problems of the development of the  infrastructure for the stock market.    4. Consideration of the prospects for privatization of  defense industry enterprises.    Participating in the conference were more than 100  representatives of various regional check investment funds and  representatives of the State Committee on Administration of  State Property of Russia, the Ministry of Finance of Russia, the  Federal Property Fund of Russia, and the Ministry of Economics  which, as a result of the discussion, adopted recommendations  for further regulation of the activity of check investment funds  after the expiration of the validity of the privatization check  and further establishment of this institutional investor on the  Russian stock market.  <H5>  Recommendations of the All-Russian Conference "Problems of </H5> Completion of Check Privatization and Development of the Stock  Market" (Izhvesk 29 March-1 April 1994)    Participants in the all-Russian conference think that the  check privatization that was conducted contributed to the  creation of a foundation for a national stock market. At the  present time more than 600 check investment funds are  functioning, making up an institutional basis for the market for  shares of privatized enterprises. A network of depositories in  all regions of the country has been formed.    The conference thinks that effective development of the  securities market is possible only through consolidation of the  efforts of all of its participants and also organs of state  power and administration, and it recommends:    1. The Commission on Securities and the Stock Market in  conjunction with the Ministry of Finance of Russia, the State  Committee on Administration of State Property of Russia, the  Ministry of Economics of Russia, and the Russian Federal  Property Fund should analyze the socioeconomic consequences of  check privatization and develop proposals for conducting  monetary privatization.    2. The Federal Assembly of Russia should consider as a  priority the legislative acts on regulation of the securities  market in the activity of joint-stock companies, which should  envision a procedure for issuing demand securities and  protection of the rights of all stockholders in questions of  paying dividends.    3. The State Committee on Administration of State Property  and the Ministry of Finance of Russia should consider the  question of reducing by 50 percent the profit tax on check  investment funds when selling shares in privatized enterprises.    4. The State Committee on Administration of State Property  of  Russia should make changes in the normative documents regulating  the activity of check investment funds, particularly:    --remove bans and restrictions on investments in securities  of a single issuer, promissory notes, term contracts, and real  estate;    --permit the purchase of one's own shares;    --bring the standard regulations of the public joint-stock  company approved by Edict No. 721 of the President of 1 July  1991 into line with the "State Program for Privatization of  State and Municipal Enterprises in the Russian Federation,"  approved by Edict No. 2284 of the President of 24 December 1993  with respect to determining the composition of the council of  directors.    5. To approve on the whole the concept of state regulation  of  the investment process on the basis of the utilization of  instruments of the stock exchange. It should be recommended to  the Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation that it  create a work group for developing the concept with parallel  testing of it in a number of regions and publish it in the press  for widespread discussion by the scholarly community.    6. The Commission on Securities and the stock exchange  should  conduct a work conference in order to develop general principles  of depository and information activity and prevent the market  for depository and information services from being monopolized.    7. Stock market professionals should be guided in their  activity by the Code of Professional Conscience of the  Participant in the Securities Market.    8. The check investment funds should create work groups for  developing a program for the participation of the check  investment funds in the development of the organized security  market. The Central Check Investment Fund should be instructed  to act on behalf of participants in the All-Russian Conference  on Parliamentary Hearings in the State Duma of the Federal  Assembly of the Russian Federation concerning the state  privatization program.    9. Recommendations of the All-Russian Conference should be  published in the central and regional mass media.    Participants in the conference consider the most important  factor in the establishment of the stock exchange to be the  development of depository service on the basis of the  utilization of modern communications systems, and they note the  positive work experience in this area of the Eurasian Regional  Depository. Participants in the securities market may be  interested in a new system of satellite communications developed  with the participation of the production association Izhevskiy  Radiozavod. It should be deemed expedient to increase the number  of members of the group for developing a telecommunications  system for the stock market, created in compliance with Edict  No. 1186 of the President of October 1992, to include  representatives of regional check investment funds, the Eurasian  Regional Depository, and the main developers of satellite  communications systems.</p>

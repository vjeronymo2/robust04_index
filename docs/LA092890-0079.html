			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ICE CREAM TRUCKS BECOMING A HOT SAFETY ISSUE  </P> <P> Michael Holloway remembers when as a kid he used to chase after the ice cream  trucks in his Inglewood neighborhood, clutching a handful of coins. Today,  Holloway is 27 and he's the one being chased.  </P> <P> In his first day on the job as an ice cream truck driver earlier this month,  Holloway parked outside Woodworth Elementary School in Inglewood -- the same  school he once attended -- and waited for the children to come streaming out.  </P> <P> The weather was hot, and Holloway soon had a line of pint-sized customers  inquiring about his ice cream and candy treats.  </P> <P> One girl in pigtails asked to examine the Starbursts, Butterfingers and  Ghostbusters chewy candies. None of them were just right. After finally  settling on two 50-cent candy pops, the girl left the truck, strolled down the  street, spun around, came back and said, "Can I have my dollar back?"  </P> <P> "Sure," Holloway said, giving her the refund and accepting back the pops. "Come  again."  </P> <P> Indecisive youngsters are one of the minor problems facing ice cream truck  operators.  </P> <P> A big one is the increasing number of traffic accidents involving their young  customers.  </P> <P> Area legislators are considering bans or restrictions on ice cream trucks, and  the trucks' electronic bells, that irresistible lure to children, are getting  on the nerves of some adults too.  </P> <P> "We cite kids for going down the street with their car radios blasting, but  these ice cream trucks have the same sound and we allow them to do the same  thing," said Inglewood Councilman Garland Hardeman, who has called on city  officials to regulate the noise and investigate the safety issue.  </P> <P> Carson, calling the trucks "a clear and present danger to children," in 1986  became the only South Bay city to ban ice cream trucks after a young girl was  killed in an accident.  </P> <P> Carson officials say the community is making do just fine without the trucks.  Residents call the city, not to complain of the ban, but to report renegade ice  cream trucks to the authorities, said Larry Olsen, Carson's public safety  director.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, the safety issue came up last fall when a 6-year-old Wilmington  girl's leg was broken in a double hit-and-run. She ran across Marine Street to  join her 10-year-old sister and was struck by an ice cream truck backing down  the street. After knocking the little girl down, the driver pulled away,  apparently unaware of what had happened. Then a second vehicle hit the girl,  and that driver sped off.  </P> <P> Harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores said at the time that the city  should consider more regulation of the trucks or even an outright ban. Talks  between Los Angeles city officials and representatives of the ice cream truck  industry have continued since.  </P> <P> Aides say the two sides have reached general consensus on some safety measures:  requiring an audible backup alarm, increasing the distance from schools where  the trucks may be parked, requiring the truck operators to set out traffic  cones when stopped, mandating special police permits for the trucks and raising  fines for violators.  </P> <P> George Iwai, who runs an ice cream truck business in downtown Los Angeles and  is trying to form a local association of operators, said improving safety  around the trucks is in everyone's interest. Banning the trucks is too drastic  a step, he said.  </P> <P> "We've had ice cream trucks ding-a-linging on the streets for 50 years or  more," he said. "Banning them would take a little culture and heritage away. On  hot days, the kids are out waiting for us."  </P> <P> Many cities have found a way around banning the trucks from the streets.  </P> <P> After a fatal accident in Santa Ana in 1984, city officials required ice cream  truck operators to carry $1 million in liability insurance and provide  photographs and fingerprints of drivers for background checks.  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Transportation took up the issue in 1978. Its study of  ice cream truck safety in Detroit said that installing flashing lights on the  trucks and a swing-down arm saying "Stop -- If Safe, Then Go" decreased  accidents significantly. The city had an average of 48 pedestrian accidents per  year before the ordinance and 11 after it was put into effect.  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach has its own unique regulation method.  </P> <P> It requires the trucks to find a regular parking place while dispensing ice  cream. City officials say the trucks, like the parking spots, are hard to find.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- The Fair Trade Commission  (FTC) issued a warning to 12 agricultural cooperatives Thursday  [3 March] about their suspected pressuring of wholesalers to  keep high the prices of rice offered on the free market in 1990  and 1991.    FTC officials said the commission suspects the cooperatives  directed wholesalers to adopt certain prices and volumes with  the aim of sustaining the price of rice not subject to  government control.    It is the first time for the commission to issue a warning  in  a case involving rice deals.    A system of bidding for free-market rice was initiated in  1990 but the auctions have been suspended since last fall  because last year's harvest was the worst in the postwar period  and foreign-grown rice had to be imported on an emergency basis.    Agricultural cooperatives, which virtually monopolize the  supply of domestic rice, allegedly decided the prices and  volumes of rice put up for auction on the free market during the  first two years.    Most of Japan's rice is bought by the government from  cooperatives at highly subsidized prices and sold to the public  at government-set prices.    Some of the cooperatives are suspected of promising  kickbacks  to wholesalers under the guise of sales promotion expenses in  return for making higher bid prices, the officials said.    In the wake of higher-than-expected prices in the bidding  for  rice in 1990 and 1991, the commission started investigations  into agricultural cooperatives and wholesales nationwide and  determined they had violated the Antimonopoly Law, the officials  said.    The cooperatives cautioned by the commission are located in  Akita and Niigata Prefectures, northern Japan, where popular  brands of rice like Koshihikari and Sasanishiki are produced.    About four million tons of rice are allowed every year to be  traded outside of government price control.    The prices of one million tons of this rice are set through  auctions in local rice markets nationwide and the prices of the  remainder are decided in direct deals between the national  federation of agricultural cooperative associations and  wholesalers.</p>

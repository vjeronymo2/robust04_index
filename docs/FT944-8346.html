			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Japanese drinks regime comes under fire again Japan's practice of taxing its domestically produced shochu spirit more lightly than whisky, gin and other internationally made drinks comes under attack again today, writes Roderick Oram, Consumer Industries Editor. In two days of talks with Japanese officials in Tokyo, a delegation of producers from the EU, the US and Sweden will urge the government to use its 1995/96 budget to harmonise its liquor taxes. Seven years ago, Japan accepted the finding by a Gatt panel that its taxes discriminated against non-shochu drinks, but so far it has only partly amended them. Whisky and brandy are still taxed between four and seven times more heavily than shochu. Shochu's share of the distilled drinks market has risen from 61 per cent in 1989 to 74 per cent today, according to Mr Tim Jackson of the Scotch Whisky Association, who is leading the delegation. Imported drinks account for only 8 per cent of the market, compared with more than 30 per cent in most other developed countries.</p>

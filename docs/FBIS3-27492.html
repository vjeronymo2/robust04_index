The two parliamentary leaders said: The broad contact  between the Pakistan Senate and National Assembly and the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and National  People's Congress reflects Pakistan-Chinese friendship.  Pakistan-Chinese friendship is time-tested and China is a  reliable friend of Pakistan. The Pakistan people appreciate  China's aid to their country and hope that, at various levels,  the two countries increase contact to promote mutually  beneficial cooperation in every field.

Our friendly bilateral relations have a  strong foundation on the basis of the five principles of  peaceful coexistence.    He said: "Pakistan is an important country in South Asia.  We appreciate Pakistan's efforts to maintain peace and  stability in the region.

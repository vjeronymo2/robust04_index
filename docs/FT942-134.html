			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Observer: Sense of schnell The London Stock Exchange's regulatory news service is always being blamed for being late with the news. But for once it excelled itself yesterday. It announced the name of Edzard Reuter's successor at Daimler-Benz a few minutes before it should have done.

Twenty-one minutes later, Schrempp got the job. Those Germans move fast when they have to.</p>

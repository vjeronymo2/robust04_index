			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / International Company News: Green Property seeks IPounds 25m Green Property, the Dublin-based property investment company, is calling for IPounds 25m (Pounds 24m) via a 3-for-4 rights issue at 150p a share. The proceeds will be used to partly finance the acquisition of a IPounds 42m property portfolio in the Irish capital. The balance will be raised through bank borrowings, which will lift gearing from 47 per cent to 56 per cent. The property portfolio, which is being bought from the Merchant Navy Officers' Pension Fund in Ireland, consists mainly of office buildings in Dublin's city centre. Mr Michael MacCormack, Green Property's chairman, said 98 per cent of the portfolio was let - mostly on 35-year leases, with five-year rent reviews. He said: 'The attraction of the deal is that most of those reviews will happen between now and 1996, and many are currently at below market rates'. Annual rental income is currently IPounds 3.69m. On completion, the acquisition will result in a near-doubling of Green's property assets with 77 per cent of them being held in Ireland. The remaining assets are in the UK. Some 80 per cent of Green's shares are held by institutional investors. Mr MacCormack said: 'The view of these institutions was that they wanted our main assets to be held in Ireland, as they are thinking in terms of their Irish pension fund obligations'. The cash call is being fully underwritten by the Investment Bank of Ireland.</p>

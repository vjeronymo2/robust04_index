			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Ferruzzi tells creditors of lower debt: Industrial group may extend legal action against former bosses as mood of suspicion hangs over most companies FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the troubled Italian industrial group, reduced total borrowings to L28,838bn (Pounds 12bn) at the end of May from L31,073bn last December, according to new figures prepared for bankers yesterday. The new data, presented to Ferfin's foreign bank creditors, came hours after the board of Montedison, Ferfin's main industrial subsidiary, called a shareholders' meeting to consider extending legal action against the previous bosses. A Milan court is due to rule on Monday on the temporary order granted to sequester L500bn in assets from former Montedison executives and the heirs of Mr Raul Gardini, who shot himself last month. Montedison and Ferruzzi are now run by new managers imposed by Ferfin's main bank creditors. Montedison said the previous management had included in last year's accounts L243bn in royalties expected from the Erbamont pharmaceuticals subsidiary, sold to Sweden's Procordia in March. These royalties should only have been recognised when they were paid. The previous management had been trying to reduce 1992 losses of L1,679bn. Montedison's 1993 accounts will now only show a capital gain of about L98bn from the Erbamont sale, rather than L341bn. At the bankers' presentation, to be repeated to Italian creditors today, it was emphasised that Ferfin was functioning normally at the operating level. First-half sales had risen 19 per cent to L11,489bn, while gross operating profits jumped 33 per cent to L1,391bn. Adjusted for the lira's devaluation, sales rose 3 per cent and gross operating profits 18 per cent. Most operations had improved their performance, notably the Edison energy subsidiary. Chemicals had been mixed, while Calcestruzzi (cement and building materials) had suffered a 10 per cent fall in sales, to L782bn. Fondiaria, the insurance company controlled by Ferfin, recovered to a net operating profit of L12bn from a L104bn loss. Premium income rose 13.4 per cent to L2,439bn. Trading in Ferfin and Montedison shares, suspended on Tuesday, resumes today.</p>

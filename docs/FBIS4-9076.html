			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Democratic Party [PD] Chairman Eduard  Selami held a news conference today. Let us follow a report by  our correspondent Zamira Koleci:    [Koleci] PD leader Selami considered the changes that have  occurred during these two years of Government in Albania to be  unimaginable, in a positive sense. During the news conference,  he defined the program followed by the democrats and its  social-democratic and republican allies to be the best and only  alternative to set the country on the road of pluralistic  democracy, market economy, and integration with the world.    Proceeding from the reality of the last two years and the  transformations and progressive changes, as well as the present  political reality, the PD considers the demand for new elections  to be baseless and destabilizing. The PD leader expressed his  regret that the Socialist Party and its leadership cannot  dissociate themselves from the past and that the socialist  leaders oppose justice to defend corruption. Meanwhile, he said  that his party has continuously condemned corruption as a  phenomenon that injures democracy.    At the news conference Selami gave attention to the  situation  in the region, which he considered to be very complicated.  According to him, the worsening of the situation in Bosnia and  the fall of Gorazde [as heard] have cooled and weakened the  hopes for peace and have shaken the stature of the United  Nations and the people's belief in it. After the Serbs evicted  the international observers, the situation of Albanians in  Kosova is becoming increasingly worse.    The news conference continued with reporters' questions.    Asked about the government coalition, Selami answered that  the PD assesses the results of this cooperation to be very  positive. However, he said, in democracy it is natural not to  agree with everything.    Regarding the Council of Europe's reaction to the criminal  incident of 10 April on the border with Greece, Selami, who was  there heading an Albanian delegation, informed the reporters  that the Albanian Government's note found complete approval and  the problem has now entered the road of dialogue.    Selami assessed the possibility of the creation of a right  of  spectrum party to be completely normal in democracy. Meanwhile,  he mentioned the PD's strict stance against the right-wing  extremist forces. The victory of Berlusconi is a very positive  phenomenon for the PD and an advantage to expand cooperation  with Italy. We are parties of the same spectrum, continued  Selami, and that makes communication easier.    After greeting the fact that Italy is presently going toward  new political solutions, he said that Albania wants good  relations with its coastal neighbor. Optimistic about the  future, Selami assured them of positive relations not only at a  party level, but also between the Albanian and Italian  Governments.</p>

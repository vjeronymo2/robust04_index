			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / India gets a big bout of Asian stock market fever 'EVERYONE here is watching the stock market 24 hours a day,' says the senior partner in a Delhi chartered accountants' practice as he surveys his employees across the desks of an open-plan office. Stock market fever in the wake of partial deregulation of the financial sector has gripped India as in the past it gripped South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and other East Asian markets. In the first two days of trading after Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, presented his budget on Saturday, the Bombay Stock market index (Sensex) climbed 25.8 per cent to 3,472. Since the beginning of the year it has shot up 83 per cent. Some brokers think the bull market could continue soaring through the 5,000 or 6,000 barrier. In South Korea the market at its peak expanded fivefold in three years. Others believe shares are already grossly overpriced with companies such as Tata Iron and Steel (Tisco), India's largest private steel manufacturer, trading on a price/earnings ratio of 50 and others much higher. In an effort to cool the market and to prevent what the Ministry of Finance considers an 'irresponsible' pushing up of prices by the bulls among the brokers, the Bombay Stock Exchange closed the market yesterday and Wednesday and has imposed far tougher conditions on trading. It banned all forward trading in the 86 most actively traded stocks and said all purchases must be against cash. In addition each broker can now only purchase Rs1m (Pounds 21,760) of shares a day in any one stock and Rs10m in the shares of the 86 most traded stocks. The boom in the stock market coincides with a continuing fall in industrial output and with a slowing of the rate of economic growth. Industrial growth is expected to be negative in 1991-92 compared with a growth of 8 per cent the year before, while the increase in real gross domestic product has slowed to 2 per cent. The rise in corporate earnings for 1991-92 has also slowed. 'The market is very excitable and is likely to remain so. A correction is inevitable and would be healthy,' says Ms Asha Wagle, a director of Perpetual Chescor, which is promoting offshore funds to invest in the Indian market. The government hopes a rise in stock market values will switch savings from property and gold to productive assets. The market has climbed since July when Dr Singh took over as Finance Minister and presented his first budget. Brokers aggressively brought blue chips in the belief that deregulation must push share prices skywards. The other main factor that has driven prices up is that mutual funds and other big purchasers have been flush with money while new issues have been few. State-owned mutual funds have been draining savings away from bank deposits. New private sector mutual funds are now being set up to compete with the state-owned institutions. But what turned bullish sentiment to fever was the weekend budget which was unexpectedly favourable to the middle class and the capital markets. The budget exempted financial assets (shares and bonds) from the calculation of wealth tax. This helped fuel the stock exchange with funds from the commodity, real estate, diamond and bullion businesses. It also removed a damper on the market's upward path. Mr Sevanti Lal Shah of Stewart and Co says: 'Earlier on the managers of certain companies usually discouraged a rise in their share prices because this entailed a bigger wealth tax liability for them. That constraint is no longer there.' The finance minister also announced a major measure of deregulation in allowing companies to fix themselves the price and timing of new share issues. Brokers see the lifting of the government's control over the issue price as a providing a stimulus to the market. Finally Dr Singh boosted the market by announcing that foreign pension funds will be allowed to make direct portfolio investments. The most worrying aspect of market's present dizzy climb is that the Indian stock markets lack a disciplinary body with the teeth to police trading. Insider dealing is common. Recent moves to provide a more effective watchdog through the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) have failed to reassure critics.</p>

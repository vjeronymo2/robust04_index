			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Kooijmans Wants Major U.S. Role in </F> Bosnia Talks"]    [Text] The Hague/Brussels -- The Netherlands Government has  asked the United States to play a more active role in the  negotiations on a peace settlement in Bosnia. Foreign Minister  Kooijmans called for this position in a letter to his U.S.  counterpart Warren Christopher.    Kooijmans has also called on his European partners to end  the  continuing speculation about the withdrawal of their troops from  Bosnia. Earlier this week Defense Minister Ter Beek said that  the withdrawal of UN troops from Bosnia would mean the "moral  bankruptcy" of the international community.    So far Washington has only been an observer at the Geneva  negotiations led by the mediators Owen and Stoltenberg. Greater  U.S. involvement and pressure is vitally important in getting a  settlement accepted by the warring parties, Kooijmans said.    In the letter to Christopher, Kooijmans said that in his  opinion the negotiations had entered a critical phase. The  threat of failure in Geneva brings the danger of a total war  with far more victims ever closer.    The minister said that the absence of the United States from  the negotiations could be an alibi for the warring parties to  back out of an agreement on the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The Bosnian Muslims attach great importance to U.S.  participation in the implementation of a possible peace  settlement.    Kooijmans wants to discuss the Bosnia question on Monday [7  February] in Brussels with his 11 EU [European Union]  colleagues. He wants at any cost to prevent the withdrawal of  the UN peacekeeping force from Bosnia-Herzegovina. The United  Kingdom and France in particular are constantly making veiled  threats to withdraw their troops after this winter.    Kooijmans pointed out to his colleagues that the presence of  the UN peacekeeping force was still serving a purpose. The UN  troops were making the life of the Muslim population in the  so-called safe areas bearable, he said. Kooijmans hoped that  the 12 EU members would declare unanimously on Monday that there  will be no possibility of the withdrawal of UN troops from  Bosnia.    The Netherlands minister also presented plans to his  European  colleagues for additional EU commitments to encourage the peace  talks which are to be restarted on 10 February in Geneva. Under  the plan, the Union would administer some areas which are  sticking points between the warring parties until arbitration  had found a solution. In fact that is an expansion of a  previous offer by the EU: In case of a peace settlement, it  would manage the contested town of Mostar on a temporary basis.    Most representatives of the 12 member states in Brussels  have  little enthusiasm for sanctions against Croatia, which is said  to be intervening with its own army units in the struggle for  Bosnia. Denmark will request sanctions on Monday. But even  Kooijmans is reserved on the issue. Like Germany, he wants to  wait for concrete proof that Croatia is intervening massively in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    If it were proved that Croatia is intervening massively in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, then virtually all the governments seem to  be prepared to impose sanctions. Greece, currently president of  the Union, is an exception. Athens is calling for the embargo  against Serbia to be lifted, but has no support for this  position among its European partners.    Up to now the EU has been "punishing" Croatia by withdrawing  additional economic support to the country, which the Croats are  entitled to under a trade agreement with the EU. Brussels could  further reduce trading relations with Croatia. Kooijmans warned  that great care was necessary. Croatia is very important as an  interim post for aid to Bosnia.    European diplomats in Brussels do not believe that the EU  will take a hard line on Monday. It is very probable that  Kooijmans will be able to achieve the "gain" of a commitment to  the maintenance of UN troops in Bosnia. British Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd has at least said that he agrees with  Kooijmans's vision.    The Netherlands has given two million guilders to Slovenia  to  handle refugees from the Bosnian civil war. Slovenia will use  the money, to be sent via a Council of Europe emergency fund, to  set up refugee centers.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / February hint for Sunday trade reform RESEARCH into the likely impact of Sunday trading reform is to be completed by the end of next month, indicating that the government may decide to press ahead with the proposed bill as early as February. The research will form the basis of a study on the financial impact of the three reform proposals that the government plans to include in the bill. The analysis will be set out in an explanatory paper that the government has promised to publish before the proposed legislation has its second Commons reading. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, told Tory MPs last week they would be offered a free vote on the three options, which range from full deregulation of Sunday trading in England and Wales to a tightening of existing laws. According to a covering letter signed by Mr Peter Lloyd, Home Office minister, which has been sent to retailers asked to provide information for the survey, the analysis will be of 'the impact on costs and prices, and on employment and trading patterns' of each option. London Economics, the company commissioned to conduct the research, is seeking information from every retailer with an annual turnover of more than Pounds 12m and from more than 250 single-outlet shops. The timing of the study suggests that its results will not be available in time for a private member's bill proposed by Labour's Mr Ray Powell. This advocates the tightening of existing, widely flouted laws and is due to be debated by MPs early next year. New legislation must await a decision by the European Court on whether the present law is overridden by the free-trade articles of the Treaty of Rome. Mr Clarke said last week that the ruling was unlikely to be available before next month. He made clear that work on getting the bill ready would proceed before the EC judgment.</p>

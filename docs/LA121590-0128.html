			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BIAS AGAINST OCBCA  </P> <P> After reading the article by Mark Pinsky on the Orange County Business  Committee for the Arts ("Support Doesn't Always Mean Cash," Nov. 17), I was  left with a very uncomfortable feeling and a rather sour taste in my mouth. In  trying to figure out why I reacted this way I had to read the article several  times and then I came to the conclusion that there was bias and innuendo  written into nearly every paragraph.  </P> <P> I could not figure out why and still cannot.  </P> <P> My own relationship with the OCBCA, through the Decorative Arts Study Center in  San Juan Capistrano, has been only positive and that of unfailing support. As  acting president of the Executive Board of Trustees of the DASC, I know how  important board development is to a fledgling organization such as ours. After  hearing of our financial problems, (Business Committee executive director  Betty) Moss placed two very knowledgeable men on our board; one from Ernst  &amp; Young, the other from Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher. Their expertise has  enabled us to grow as rapidly as we have, and we are extremely grateful to Ms.  Moss and the OCBCA for recognizing our need and moving so quickly to get us the  necessary help.  </P> <P> I nonetheless keep wondering why the bias in the Nov.17 article. The purpose of  the OCBCA is to encourage business support of the arts in all manners. In my  book, that's exactly what they are doing.  </P> <P> KAY EVANS, Newport Beach  </P></p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Money Markets: Lombard unchanged SHORT-DATED Euromark futures fell back sharply yesterday after the Bundesbank decided to leave its official rates unchanged, writes James Blitz. Most money market dealers had expected that there would be no change in the Bundesbank's official rates yesterday. The discount rate, which sets the floor for all money market rates, was some 74 basis points below call money yesterday, making another cut impossible. There had been some expectation of a lowering of the Lombard rate, currently at 9.00 per cent. But this sets the ceiling for money market rates, and policy is clearly being eased - so dealers were mainly unperturbed by the fact that this had been left unchanged. Nevertheless, there are now three weeks between now and the next Bundesbank council meeting and that clouded the atmosphere yesterday after-noon. The June Euromark contract fell 9 basis points from its opening level to close at 92.76, while the September contract declined 7 basis points to 93.63. Call money returned to a more normal level of 8.24 per cent, following the very soft conditions that came on the very last day of March. In contrast to Germany, there had been strong expectations of an official rate reduction in France yesterday. Both one-month and three-month French francs had fallen sharply in recent days in the belief that Mr Edouard Balladur's new administration would take the opportunity to ease policy in its first week in office. However, guided perhaps by the knowledge that the Bundesbank would leave policy unchanged later in the day, the Bank of France left its intervention rate unaltered at 9.10 per cent. One-month money remained more or less unchanged on the day at 10.20 per cent. The June French franc contract slipped 3 basis points to finish at 91.53. Sterling futures continued to fall, swayed by the governor of the Bank of England's comment the previous day that he was seeking a stronger exchange rate. The June contract closed at 94.17, down 3 basis points on the day. Three-month money ended a touch firmer at 5 15/16 per cent, possibly due to the very large shortage of Pounds 2.05bn forecast by the Bank of England. The cost of overnight lending in the interbank market was as high as 7 per cent at one stage.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Arts: Heart and soul of the National - Colin Amery admires the gallery's refurbishment of its Central Hall National triumphs are thin on the ground at the moment, but one that offers more than due cause for celebration was unveiled last week. At the National Gallery the opening of the refurbished Central Hall (the gift of Lord Rothschild) marks the completion of a major stage in the reordering and redecoration of the main galleries. Visitors to the National Gallery are now able for the first time to stand in the new hall and comprehend at a glance the whole plan of the building. If you want to undergo an amazing architectural experience, stand in the gleaming new hall and look to the east and then to the west. It is now possible to enjoy a vista of what must be one of the finest enfilades of great rooms in Europe. This architectural triumph has two roots. First of all the architect of the Sainsbury Wing, Robert Venturi, immediately grasped the possibilities of axial views throughout the whole building when he made the decision to plan the new extension as a wing of an existing palace. He aligned the approach to the Sainsbury Wing from the main gallery floor so that the existing axial plan coincided with the main route to the new wing. His circular bridge with its screen walls can now be seen as a focussing element that leads the eye without distraction into the vistas of both the old and the new buildings. The second root of this triumph was the decision to commit the building policy of the gallery to a refurbishment programme based upon the recognition of the architectural virtues of the mainly 19th-century galleries. Last week, at the dinner held in the Central Hall to mark its reopening, Lord Rothschild spoke of the beginning of the battle for the architectural soul of the National Gallery, which began more than a decade ago. 'The question was whether or not to re-create the marriage of Victorian art and architecture which, in the post war period, had been thought somehow improper and shameful and distracting from the pictures.' It was in the set of galleries known as the Barry Rooms (designed by EM Barry 1867-76) that the policy of authentic restoration was first carried out to remove the whitewash that had been applied after the war to hide the Victorian polychromy. This successful precedent encouraged the National Gallery to proceed along the path that has gradually revealed the best qualities of the existing building. Thus the Central Hall was restored to the original decorative scheme designed by Sir John Taylor with John Crace. Lord Rothschild's generous gift has created a calm centre at the heart of the galleries where, visitors can meet and rest and feel immediately that they are at the central point of a new logical hang which divides the collection into four easily identifiable wings: the Sainsbury Wing, with paintings from 1260 to 1510; the West Wing, paintings from 1510 to 1600; the North Wing, paintings from 1600 to 1700; and the East Wing with paintings from 1700 to 1920. The Crace/Rothschild scheme has been carried out by the gallery architect, Michael Morrison of Purcell Miller Tritton with Milinaric, Henry and Zervudachi as the interior decorators. The brilliant team of Hare and Humphries carried out much of the specialist gilding and painting. The well-scaled pattern of acanthus leaves on the wool damask walls make a reticent background to the four battle scenes by Horace Vernet painted for the Duc d'Orleans, later King Louis Philippe. The intention was not to create another gallery here, but to keep the hall as a breathing space and a point of reference for the whole building. The particular success of the colour scheme in the hall is that it links through to the redecorated vestibule and makes visual sense of an area that was once so confused. But there is another modest triumph which visitors should not miss. A handsome new staircase has been created to take visitors to the lower floor from room 13 with stone steps and railings, based on a William Wilkins design. It was an inspired idea to hang the Domenichino (1581 - 1641) frescoes from the Stanza di Apollo in the Villa Aldobrandini at Frascati on this staircase. They tell stories of Apollo, the patron of poetry, music and the arts, and have a light and festive quality. But the heart is lifted by the whole success of the rejuvenation of the National Gallery. More remains to be done - the vestibule and the lower restaurant floor and of course the costly but vital need to redesign the interiors of the grim Northern extension. Surely donors will flock to ensure the completion of the settings for this, one of the finest national collections in the world. The success of the National Gallery demonstrates that it is possible to offer the public the highest possible standards of both collection and display. Underlying it all is a clear understanding of the enlightening potential of the visual arts. The gallery has been fortunate in its patrons and its helpers. It stands as it should, as a national exemplar of breathtaking quality, a model for the world.</p>

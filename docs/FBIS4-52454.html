			<p>BFN     [Text] National Security Council [NSC] Deputy Secretary  General Khachatphai Burutphat yesterday urged the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] to speed up repatriation  of Laotians by setting up more reception centres in Laos.    "It is up to the UNHCR to speed up the repatriation of  Laotians, not to allow it to drag on as at present," Mr.  Khachatphai said.    The UNHCR "succeeded to repatriate some 300,000 Cambodians  in  one year," he said. "There are now only an estimated 25,000  Laotians left in Thailand and they want to go home."    The setting up of more reception centres in Laos would speed  up the repatriation process and support Thailand's plan to close  the last refugee camp for Laotians by the end of this year.    There are two reception centres in Laos, in Vientiane and  the  southern province of Savannakhet. In last week's repatriation  movement, a group of 442 Hmongs from the last Thai camp at Ban  Napho in Nakhon Phanom province went to the reception centre of  Hatsaifong in Vientiane.    The NSC deputy secretary expressed confidence that the UNHCR  would receive financial support from private donors. The  remaining Laotians were a comparativeIy small number, he said.    Laos is trying to speed up development and has achieved  economic growth of no less than six-seven percent a year in the  past three years.</p>

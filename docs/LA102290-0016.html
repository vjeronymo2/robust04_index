			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANA HILLS' SULLIVAN ADDS PLENTY OF DISTANCE TO HIS DRIVES;  </P> <P> CROSS-COUNTRY: AFTER LEAVING GOLF BEHIND, RUNNER GAINS CONFIDENCE AND PICKS UP  THE PACE.  </P> <P> Brendan Sullivan of Dana Hills High School is a champion cross-country runner,  but nobody expected him to be one, including himself.  </P> <P> Sullivan set out to be a golfer, having played the sport since he was 7. After  all, Sullivan and others thought he didn't have any running ability -- that he  was too slow.  </P> <P> At the Orange County Cross-Country Championships on Oct. 13, Sullivan, a  senior, placed fifth in the boys' seeded race. He covered the three-mile course  in 15 minutes 39 seconds, 20 seconds behind the race-winner, teammate Daniel  Niednagel. Niednagel is one of the best runners in the state. Sullivan is no  longer considered slow.  </P> <P> Sullivan's transformation from golfer to runner began four years ago -- before  his freshman year of high school -- when he moved to California from New  Jersey. He ended up in a spring physical education class taught by Tim Butler,  Dana Hills' cross-country and track coach. Sullivan ran a 6:07 mile in the  class and Butler invited him to try out for the cross-country team, which would  compete in the fall.  </P> <P> "I try to encourage all the kids in my P.E. class to come out for  cross-country," Butler said.  </P> <P> Sullivan was "bored" and looking for a team sport, but didn't know anything  about cross-country.  </P> <P> "I never thought I'd be a good runner," said Sullivan, 17. "That wasn't my  motive for going out. I just did it because I wanted to do a sport and I  figured if the coach thought I could make the team, I might as well try it."  </P> <P> When Sullivan told his family he was going to join the cross-country team, he  received a less-than-enthusiastic response.  </P> <P> "They (my sisters and mother) laughed at me," Sullivan said. "But my dad  didn't."  </P> <P> Sullivan's father, Kevin, competed for the state championship team at New  Canaan High School in Connecticut in 1961.  </P> <P> "He is the one who came up with the idea of running cross-country and I  encouraged him to do so because I knew the sport required as much mental  toughness as fitness," Kevin Sullivan said. "But his sisters and mom didn't  think it was the sport for him."  </P> <P> Sullivan's sisters, Molly, 18, and Brigid, 21, who is a coxswain for the  University of San Diego crew team, were athletic in high school but didn't  think their brother could run well.  </P> <P> "They just said, 'You aren't cut out to be a runner,' " he recalled.  </P> <P> Perhaps his family was mindful of the time when, as a toddler, Sullivan broke  two bones in his right foot. He was sitting on his uncle's lap on the family's  porch when the two fell off the porch, his uncle landing on top of him.  </P> <P> Sullivan says the injury didn't affect his mobility, but his parents disagree.  </P> <P> "It made him slow as far as learning to walk and run," his father said.  </P> <P> But after Sullivan made the cross-country team, he made up for the slow start.  He started on the junior varsity team, steadily improving each week in the 1988  season. Although he was a lot slower than others on the team, it didn't bother  him much.  </P> <P> "I didn't really get down on myself because each race I was running 30 seconds  faster than the previous one. I just kept picking it up," he said.  </P> <P> So much so that Sullivan ended the season as the fifth man on Dana Hills'  Division I state championship team. But Sullivan, who ran a personal best of  16:42 over the 5,000-meter course at Fresno's Woodward Park, finished in 89th  place -- far behind the team's other runners. In contrast, Dana Hills' No. 1  runner, Mike Tansley, was fifth in 15:21, more than a minute faster. Sullivan  proved he was a good runner, though far from great.  </P> <P> Sullivan made little progress his junior year when the Dana Hills' team  finished ninth in the 4-A Southern Section Finals. Sullivan, who competed on  the junior varsity golf team his freshman and sophomore years, attended a  tryout for the varsity team, but failed to make it. Butler convinced him that  putting some extra mileage in on the track team would improve his running.  </P> <P> During the spring, Sullivan ran 4:27 for 1,600 meters, finishing second in the  South Coast League finals.  </P> <P> Sullivan's new-found confidence carried over to this year's cross-country  season. At the Dana Hills Invitational on Sept. 29, Sullivan surprised Butler  again. He finished second in a time of 15:00, nine seconds behind Niednagel,  moving to sixth on Dana Hills' all-time list.  </P> <P> "I simply didn't think of Brendan as a guy who could run with the top four or  five guys on our all-time list," Butler said. "I didn't think he was in the  same class."  </P> <P> Neither did Niednagel.  </P> <P> "I finished the race, turned around and he was right behind me," Niednagel  said. "I knew he was good and he was getting better, but not that much better."  </P> <P> Sullivan, who holds a 3.5 grade-point average, is the senior class president  and wants to attend an Ivy League school. He has also caught the eye of college  coaches. Bob Rothenberg, the men's cross-country and track coach at Brown  University, is one.  </P> <P> "He seems to have improved an awful lot since last year -- the difference is  considerable and I think part of that is due to training with good people,"  Rothenberg said. "That is an advantage he has."  </P> <P> Rothenberg, who coached former University High runner Greg Whiteley, a  five-time National Collegiate Athletic Assn. All-American in cross-country and  track, said he prefers working with a "late bloomer."  </P> <P> "There are two ends of the spectrum," he said. "For instance, take a runner who  has worked many years and has been doing double workouts for years. He knows  how to train hard, but is he a finished project? Or there's the runner who is  just starting to improve and it's exciting to see. I would rather see someone  who has a long way to go."  </P> <P> Rothenberg sees Sullivan as such a prospect.  </P> <P> "Cross-country is the type of sport that if you work hard, you will improve,"  Rothenberg said. "If your heart is big and you are into running, you will be  successful. And I have a feeling that Brendan has an awful big heart."  </P> <P> Sullivan's goals this year include helping Dana Hills, which has won six  consecutive South Coast League championships, qualify for the Nov. 10 Southern  Section prelims in Walnut. He hopes to run faster than his best time of 16:41.  </P></p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: US group buys Kraft Foodservice Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, the US leveraged buy-out specialist, has agreed to buy Kraft Foodservice, the second-biggest food service company in the US, from Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group. The price was not disclosed, but is believed to be about Dollars 700m. Kraft Foodservice is part of Kraft General Foods, Philip Morris's food company. It distributes industrial-size packages of foods to restaurants, hospitals and other non-retail outlets. Annual revenues are about Dollars 4bn. The company distributes more than 160,000 products from different suppliers, including Kraft General Foods. As part of the deal with Philip Morris, Kraft Foodservice will remain the exclusive distributor of Kraft-branded food service products to most customers for five years. Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, a private investment firm, specialises in acquiring divisions of big corporations and working with their managements to improve returns. In the past year it has bought Wesco Distribution from Westinghouse Electric, Remington Arms from Du Pont, and Allison Engine from General Motors. The firm seeks to increase the profitability of acquisitions by asking managers to a take a stake in the business so that they have an incentive to improve its performance. Kraft Foodservice's management is believed to be participating in the Kraft transaction. Under Philip Morris, Kraft Foodservice had been closely associated with Mr Michael Miles, the former chairman and chief executive who resigned earlier this year. He turned it into the biggest food service company in the US after Sysco. Mr Geoffrey Bible, the new chief executive of Philip Morris, is under pressure to improve the company's performance, as its share price has been battered by fears about possible consequences of anti-tobacco litigation.</p>

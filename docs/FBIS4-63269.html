			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- Lieutenant General Lev  Ihnatenko, chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' armaments staff,  told a briefing for journalists on 18 May that, in compliance  with accords on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from the  territory of Ukraine, it is planned to send 200 nuclear warheads  to Russia this year. Thus far, he said, 180 nuclear warheads  have already been removed. As for the future destiny of  strategic bombers, with 42 heavy bomber aircraft remaining on  the territory of Ukraine -- 19 Tu-160's and 23 Tu-95M's -- the  lieutenant general stressed that in exchange for the transfer of  these aircraft to Russia, Ukraine would like to be able to have  other aircraft of the Ukrainian Armed Forces technically  maintained and spare parts supplied for various weapons systems.  A settlement of this issue by the Russian side is forthcoming.    Lev Ihnatenko also noted that although only 25 percent of  the  research and development institutions's requirements have been  met, work on the creation of up-to-date armaments systems,  including precision weapons, is continuing.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire-Tyne Tees set to contain deficit Shares of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, the lossmaking ITV company, rose by 2p to 163p despite the delay in announcing year-end results and the decision to pass the final dividend. The company also confirmed yesterday that pre-tax losses for the year to September 'will not exceed Pounds 9.5m'. The share price was almost certainly held up by the fact that the forecast losses were not as large as some analysts feared, and by the interest from London Weekend Television in an agreed takeover. Mr Ward Thomas, chairman of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees - a company in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake - conceded yesterday that 'everybody is talking to everybody', and that included LWT and Yorkshire. In fact, the Yorkshire board on Friday gave LWT permission to begin due diligence on an agreed bid. LWT, which is the subject of a hostile takeover bid from Granada - the television, rental and leisure group - is expected to publish a defence document this week. The company will outline the 'quartet' theory in the hope of finding an alternative to being swallowed up by Granada. Under the proposals, LWT would take over Yorkshire and Anglia Television would take over Tyne Tees. Under proposed government ownership changes one company can own two licences but no more. The hope would be that eventually further liberalisation of ownership rules will come, allowing a grand alliance of LWT, Yorkshire, Anglia and Tyne Tees. The shares of those involved changed remarkably little yesterday, with LWT down 4p at 588p and Anglia down 2p at 418p. Mr Thomas said yesterday he thought the quartet theory 'makes a lot of sense' in that it would balance the growing dominance of Carlton Communications, which has made an agreed bid for Central, valuing the Midlands ITV company at more than Pounds 800m. Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, insists that the offer for LWT - worth more than Pounds 600m  - is the 'cleanest and clearest' and above all is 'available now'. All the signs are that Granada is considering a modest 'sweetener' to clinch the LWT deal. Yorkshire-Tyne Tees promised yesterday to announce audited year-end results by the end of January. The delay came because negotiations with customers on the repayment of oversold advertising time had not been completed. The final pre-tax loss is likely to be about Pounds 8.5m rather than the contingent figure of Pounds 9.5m, and it is likely that most of the problems of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees have been dealt with in the 1992-93 accounts, with hopes of a return to profit in the current financial year. Industry speculation suggests that Yorkshire-Tyne Tees has had disappointing advertising sales in November and December. See Lex</p>

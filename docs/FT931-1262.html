			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: FAA looks into two USAir site incidents The US Federal Aviation Authority, the government agency responsible for airline safety issues, yesterday confirmed that it was investigating allegations of maintainence irregularities at USAir, the US carrier into which British Airways recently invested Dollars 300m for a potential 19.9 per cent stake. The FAA said that the irregularities were alleged to have occured at the company's Indianapolis maintainence base. It declined to discuss the situation further while the investigation is continuing. However, the charges are thought to involve the signing-off on maintainence records for repairs which were not done. The FAA also acknowledged that it had looked into a second incident last year, at Charlotte, North Carolina, where USAir has a 'hub' airport operation. The US agency said that one USAir maintainence supervisor had his licence suspended for 180 days as a result of the Charlotte incident, which occured on May 29. The pilot involved in the same situation also had his licence suspended for 30 days. The FAA added, however, that it found 'no reason' to take any action against the airline itself. USAir said last night that none of the alleged irregularities at Indianapolis related to air safety. It added that, as a result of this episode, it had conducted an internal investigation and believed 'the activity was confined to two individuals and isolated to one facility - Indianapolis'. Mr Lewis Jordan has resigned as president and chief operating officer of Continental Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier which is expected to emerge from bankruptcy shortly. Meanwhile, Continental, which recently cancelled orders for 20 Airbus jets, is still holding discussions with Seattle-based Boeing over future deliveries of new aircraft.</p>

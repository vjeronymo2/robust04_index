No one was hurt in the firing, which caused the pupils to  retreat to their classrooms. Police then sealed off the school,  situated some 500 metres (yards) from the home of President  Pascal Lissouba. The students said they would go on strike  Wednesday if the identity checks, said to be for security  reasons, were not stopped.    The Chaminade, one of Brazzaville's leading schools, has  more  than 2,000 students.</p>

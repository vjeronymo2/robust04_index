			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRECIOUS METALS INVESTMENT FIRM RAIDED  </P> <P> Federal, state and local law enforcement officials Tuesday raided the offices  of Innovative Holding Co., an Irvine company specializing in precious metals  investment partnerships.  </P> <P> Armed with search warrants, officials from the FBI, the state Department of  Corporations and the Irvine Police Department seized documents, records and  other material.  </P> <P> No arrests were made.  </P> <P> According to Irvine police, the search was for "any and all records relating to  limited partnership investments in the processing of precious metals . . . that  Innovative Holding Co. Inc. has claim to in the Mojave Desert."  </P> <P> Glenn R. Hammond, Innovative Holding's president, said his company's operation  "is honest. We are mining gold." Hammond, who sat inside his office during the  raid, declined further comment, saying: "I want to find out what's happening.  There's no need talking until I do."  </P> <P> According to a police statement, the Irvine firm sold investments in a dozen  limited partnerships set up to develop a gold recovery process. The company's  recovery plant is in a section of the Mojave Desert known as "Robber's Roost,"  police said. The partnerships were supposed to profit equally in the recovery  operation, police said, adding that the minimum investment was $30,000 for a 1%  ownership in a partnership.  </P> <P> According to police, the Mojave Desert recovery plant is operated by Oro Ltd.,  a company believed to be owned by Innovative Holding. Federal agents also  searched the offices of the recovery plant on Tuesday, police said.  </P> <P> "There appears to be reasonable cause (to believe) that there has been some . .  . fraudulent involvement," said Irvine Police Lt. Mike White. "I assume  somebody complained."  </P> <P> FBI and other officials declined further comment.  </P></p>

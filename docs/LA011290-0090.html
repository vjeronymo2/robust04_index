			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ANGELS CAMP;  </P> <P> GOLIATH FROGS: THE JURY IS OUT  </P> <P> Directors of the Calaveras County Fair have postponed a decision on allowing  African Goliath frogs to compete in the annual frog-jumping contest after the  state attorney general's office told them it would be illegal to meet in secret  on the matter. Instead of a secret executive session Friday on a possible rules  change that would ban the huge frogs from the contest, the directors will use  the gathering to solicit public comment, said Diane Baumann of the 39th  District Agricultural Assn., which hosts the May 17-20 contest. A Seattle man's  plan to win the $1,500 in prize money by entering Goliath frogs, which are up  to three feet long and reportedly can jump 30 feet or more in a bound, has  attracted worldwide publicity to the contest, made famous in a Mark Twain short  story.  </P></p>

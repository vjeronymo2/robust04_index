			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Demonstration Projects/Cash-Outs in Other Benefit Programs_7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR 273.9(c)(1) and 273.10(d)(1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 340 of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the interim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule amended 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1) to specify that in-kind or vendor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments which would normally be excluded as income but are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> converted in whole, or in part, to a direct cash payment under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the approval of a federally authorized demonstration project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall continue to be excluded from income. These federally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized demonstration projects include demonstration projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> created by waiver of the provisions of Federal law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, conversion to direct cash payment does not change the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-deductibility of the expenses paid with these funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, in order to ensure that an excluded vendor payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which has been converted to a direct cash payment is not excluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> twice (once as income and once as expenses) the interim rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i) to specify that an expense covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by an excluded vendor payment which has been converted to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct cash payment under the approval of a federally authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstration project remains non-deductible as a household  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department received no comments regarding these provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the interim rule. Therefore, this action adopts the interim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions as final with no changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Reporting Responsibilities_7 CFR 273.12 and 273.21  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 323 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 and the interim rule, State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies are required to provide a household, at the time of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification and recertification, with a statement describing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the household's reporting responsibilities. Moreover, State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies must provide all households with a toll-free telephone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number or a number where collect calls will be accepted in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the household to reach an appropriate representative of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agency. The interim rule amended 7 CFR 273.12(b)(1) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically require that the ``change report'' form include a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement describing the household's reporting responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, 7 CFR 273.12(b)(1) was amended to specify that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``change report'' form must contain the number of the food stamp  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> office and a toll-free number or a number where collect calls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be accepted. (Reporting requirements remained unchanged for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households subject to MRRB provisions of 7 CFR 273.21.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim rule also amended the provisions relative to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of Eligibility, the Notice of Denial, the Notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adverse Action, and the requirements for bilingual notices. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations at 7 CFR 272.4(b)(3)(ii)(B), 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 273.10(g)(1)(i)(A), 7 CFR 273.10(g)(1)(ii) and 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 273.13(a)(2), respectively, were amended to specify that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notices must also include either a toll-free number or a number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where collect calls will be accepted for households living  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outside the local calling area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department received one comment on these provisions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim rule. The commenter pointed out that the legislative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intent of the toll-free or collect telephone number was to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase households' access to the State agency in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain information or report changes. The commenter felt this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement of purpose should be incorporated into the rule itself  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to help guide State agencies' implementation efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes including a statement of purpose in 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 273.12(b) is unnecessary. Congress was clear that its intent in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passing the Hunger Prevention Act was to make it easier for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible households to apply and obtain benefits (Senate Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 100&hyph;397, p.25). On its face, the implementation of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision demonstrates its purpose without additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explanation. The interim provisions are adopted as final without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Special Provisions for Farm Households_7 CFR 273.8, 273.11, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 273.21  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to two provisions of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the interim rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended Program regulations to extend eligibility to farm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households which are in need of program assistance. Section 341  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Public Law 100&hyph;435 specified that self-employed farm households  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are subject to MRRB have the option to annualize their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> self-employment income and expenses over a 12-month period. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision was implemented in the interim rule by amending 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 273.21(f)(2)(i) and 273.11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

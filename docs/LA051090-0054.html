			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH, CONGRESS OK DEFICIT TALKS;  </P> <P> BUDGET: THEY WILL SEEK TO AVERT AUTOMATIC SPENDING CUTS. 'SEVERE ACTION' IS  NEEDED 'TO KEEP THE ECONOMY ON A SOUND TRACK,' WHITE HOUSE SAYS. SESSIONS BEGIN  TUESDAY.  </P> <P> After three days of urgent meetings, President Bush and congressional leaders  agreed Wednesday to begin a series of top-level budget negotiations because  "severe action needs to be taken to reduce the deficit and keep the economy on  a sound track," the White House announced.  </P> <P> Faced with signals of a weakening economy and a ballooning deficit, Bush,  senior economic advisers and key members of Congress responsible for budget  legislation will begin debating their options for raising government revenue  and trimming spending from the 1991 budget.  </P> <P> Their goal is to find a way to avoid the automatic spending cuts that would be  triggered if they do not meet the $64-billion budget deficit target established  in the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law.  </P> <P> But their task has been made more complicated -- and urgent -- by rising  interest rates, a recent increase in unemployment, slower economic growth and  the burgeoning costs of the federal bailout of ailing savings and loan  institutions.  </P> <P> Richard G. Darman, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget,  has predicted that unless quick action is taken, stark, across-the-board budget  cuts of up to $100 billion could be required in the $1.2-trillion spending plan  for 1991.  </P> <P> The sudden focus on the budget -- and the agreement to try to tackle the  deficit with no "preconditions" -- has opened debate over tax increases, which  Bush pledged during the 1988 presidential campaign to block. It also has raised  the politically charged issue of whether to allow Social Security  cost-of-living increases to go unchecked.  </P> <P> Republicans who met Tuesday with Bush raised the prospect of higher gasoline  and cigarette taxes, and threw into the discussion the possibility of a  national sales tax. They discounted, however, the possibility of increasing  income taxes.  </P> <P> With the "budget summit" scheduled to begin Tuesday at the White House,  Democrats and Republicans in Congress have made it clear that they are  unwilling to initiate formal talk of tax hikes -- let alone endorse them --  unless Bush takes the first step.  </P> <P> White House aides, meanwhile, have refused to signal whether the President is  ready to step back from his highly visible campaign pledge of "no new taxes."  </P> <P> "Some people have said that raising taxes has to be on the table. But no  preconditions means just the opposite. It means the table is clean," said White  House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, dampening speculation that Bush might  be ready to support a tax increase.  </P> <P> The potential stalemate was reflected by Rep. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), who said: "The  President feels a lot about taxes the way he feels about broccoli: You can put  it on the table in front of him, but he's not gonna eat it."  </P> <P> Creation of a bipartisan budget group is intended to provide enough political  protection for both parties to enable Republicans and Democrats, President and  Congress, to share the responsibility for distasteful budget cuts or tax hikes  without paying a political price.  </P> <P> But just the possibility, raised at Bush's first budget meeting with  congressional leaders Sunday evening, that a tax increase could be thrown into  the mix brought out a partisan uproar on Capitol Hill that so far has shown no  signs of abating.  </P> <P> House Republicans emerged from a meeting Wednesday morning virtually united  against higher taxes as part of any budget deal, opting instead for spending  cuts or stretching out the balanced-budget targets for several years.  </P> <P> "If Democrats want higher taxes, we expect them to put higher taxes on the  table," said Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House  Ways and Means Committee, and one of the congressional budget negotiators.  </P> <P> "The President's negotiating position will be no new taxes," he predicted.  </P> <P> Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley), chairman of the House Budget Committee  and another member of the negotiating team, has urged Bush to begin seeking  public support for the politically sensitive decisions that the meetings could  produce to make eventual congressional approval more likely.  </P> <P> "Strong proposals coming out of a summit would face a very tough time in the  House and Senate" because of election-year concerns, he said.  </P> <P> With the pressure of the November elections growing and the somber economic  signals mounting, White House and congressional officials acknowledged a need  to act quickly. Some expressed hope that an agreement could be reached before  Congress begins its July 4 recess.  </P> <P> That would throw the complex budget talks into a busy White House calendar that  already includes the May 30-June 3 summit between Bush and Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev as well as preparations for a later North Atlantic Treaty  Organization summit meeting and an international economic conference scheduled  for early July in Houston.  </P> <P> As outlined by Fitzwater, the goals of the budget negotiators are to achieve a  substantial reduction of the projected budget deficit in fiscal 1991, which  begins Oct. 1, and in several subsequent years and to devise a plan that will  allow continued economic growth.  </P> <P> The group also will seek to revise the process by which Congress acts on the  budget and find a way to avoid the economic pitfalls that could stem from a  budget stalemate between the Republican White House and the  Democratic-controlled Congress.  </P> <P> But how those goals will be accomplished remains obscured by the fog of  partisan debate and concerns that unpopular decisions could be used against  either party in the upcoming congressional elections.  </P> <P> "The only decision that's been made is to begin discussions in good faith and  attempt to reach a solution of the problem," said Senate Majority Leader George  J. Mitchell (D-Me.).  </P> <P> "It's premature to speculate on what might be in the agreement, and then to  speculate on top of that speculation as to what someone might say about that  speculated agreement, and then to speculate as to what someone might respond to  that speculation about that speculated agreement," Mitchell said.  </P></p>

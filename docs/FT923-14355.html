			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Weak construction sector pulls Nikkei down RUMOURS of bankruptcy at a construction company listed on the over-the-counter market depressed sentiment, construction and real estate-related issues fell, and the Nikkei average declined for the third consecutive day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei fell 197.52 to 16,459.55. Small-lot arbitrage buying pushed it up to a day's high of 16,709.86 in the morning, but jitters over the construction company then spread throughout the market, and the index fell to the day's low of 16,420.81 on mid-afternoon selling. Volume remained low at 170m shares, rising marginally from 161m. Investment trusts, which had supported the market last week, were absent. Declines led advances by 706 to 211 with 173 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks fell 16.39 to 1,271.15 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.87 to 995.57. Concerns about financial problems at Royal Construction shook investors, as the Japan Securities Dealers Association suspended afternoon trading in the shares on the OTC market. After the market closed, Royal announced that it would seek court protection. Investors were also worried over reports that Shuwa, the land and stock speculator and leading shareholder of Isetan, the department store, had used Isetan shares as collateral for loans. Property-related issues and construction stocks plunged. Daikyo, the condominium builder, which had previously retreated on rumours of financial problems, fell Y47 to Y733, and Misawa Homes, which was recently sold on similar concerns, declined Y48 to Y951. Leading construction companies fell, with Obayashi down Y10 to Y542, Taisei losing Y24 to Y660 and Shimizu Y30 to Y911. Isetan plunged Y190 to Y1,540. Other retailers were also weak, with Seven-Eleven Japan plunging Y340 to Y6,900 and Ito-Yokado losing Y190 to Y3,920. Penta-Ocean Construction, which surged on Monday on reports that the company had won an order to expand a section of the Suez Canal, lost Y55 to Y828 on profit-taking. Matsushita Electric Works fell Y30 to Y1,040. The company forecast a 30 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the current year to November this year, the first fall in six years. Mitsubishi Materials advanced Y6 to Y416 on reports that the company was likely to win an order to supply pipes and tanks for a nuclear facility in northern Tokyo. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 258.40 to 19,309.01 in volume of 7m shares. Roundup DECLINES led advances in the region yesterday, although Bombay stayed in suspension and Manila was closed for a public holiday. HONG KONG finished sharply lower, reflecting political worries after three days of high level talks in Beijing on Hong Kong's massive airport project ended on Monday with no agreement on funding. The Hang Seng index fell 112.85 or 1.9 per cent to 5,911.92 after an intraday low of 5,857.47. Among blue chips, HSBC was the most active stock as it lost HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 49, followed by Sun Hung Kai Properties, down HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 32.75. Turnover dropped from HKDollars 6.1bn to HKDollars 3.6bn. SEOUL closed at a 53-month low for the second consecutive day, and while the composite index only fell 0.38 to 535.34, a land scandal involving former military officers continued to dampen depressed sentiment. Police were tracking promissory notes issued by First Life Insurance, believed to be trading in the black market at a discount. TAIWAN fell as hopes for an early interest rate cut faded, the weighted index ending 79.75, or 1.8 per cent lower at 4,432.22, turnover staying active at TDollars 25.7bn against Monday's TDollars 28.7bn. AUSTRALIA closed slightly lower in dull trading as investors waited for a cut in interest rates. The All-Ordinaries index lost 3.2 to 1,660.5 in modest turnover of ADollars 200.6m. Banks were lifted by the rate cut hopes, with Bank of Melbourne and Bank of Queensland gaining 4 cents to ADollars 4.33 and ADollars 5.00 respectively. NEW ZEALAND closed at its best level in almost four weeks, as investors took heart from the prospect of lower interest rates. The NZSE-40 index rose 17.18 to 1,559.07 but turnover was a modest NZDollars 21.76m. Among active second-liners, PDL rose 25 cents to NZDollars 6.85 while Michael Hill rose 17 cents to NZDollars 2.00 and Transmark rose 20 cents to NZDollars 3.00 after publishing its annual report. KUALA LUMPUR was pushed higher by afternoon buying of second- and third-liners by retail investors. The composite index rose 0.95 to 596.70 in volume of 56.5m shares. Sungei Besi led the actives with 4.6m shares traded, rising 10 cents to MDollars 4.52. South Malaysia Industries closed up 24 cents at MDollars 3.18 on talk that the privatised Sabah Shipyard would be injected into SMI. KARACHI fell further as textile mills threatened to cut production. The 100-share index fell 19.71 to 1,460.60. DHAKA receded further in dull trading, the all-share index ending 8.18 lower at 374.22.</p>

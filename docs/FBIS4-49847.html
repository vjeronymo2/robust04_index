			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article from the "Opinion" page by Wen Jing, vice minister </F> of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission: "Ethnic Groups  Flourish With More State Funds"]    [Text] Ethnic minorities have benefited greatly from  preferential policies the government gives to their regions.    Last year, gross national product (GNP) in provinces and  autonomous regions with a high density of ethnic groups -- Inner  Mongolia, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Tibet, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou and  Qinghai -- reached 293.8 billion yuan ($33.8 billion). And the  annual per capita income of farmers and herdsmen in the eight  areas exceeded 720 yuan ($83).    China has 55 minority nationalities with a total population  of 91 million. Most live in remote mountain areas where the  economy has traditionally lagged behind other parts of the  country.    But since 1949, the government has worked out a series of  preferential policies to promote economic growth in these areas.    In 1984, a law governing the regional autonomy of minority  nationalities laid the foundation for the development of  relationships between all nationalities as well as economic,  cultural, scientific and technological progress.    There are five autonomous regions, 30 autonomous prefectures  and 123 autonomous counties.    To advance local industry, the government started 1,400  large  and medium-sized enterprises in the eight autonomous regions and  provinces. These enterprises have since become the pillars of  the local economy. And industry is now complementary to the  traditional agriculture and animal husbandry.    Last year, the total output value of agriculture and  industry  in these areas hit 540 billion yuan ($62 billion). Industry  accounted for 59.8 percent of the local economy, up from 14.8  percent in 1949.    In recent years, township enterprises in ethnic areas have  progressed steadily. Relying on local natural resources, labour  and State loans, these enterprises are engaged in a diverse  range of industries.    From 1991 to 1995, the State will allocate 100 million yuan  ($11.5 million) in low-interest loans to these enterprises.    State subsidies have been promoting economic growth in  minority nationality regions.    In 1955 a special subsidy for minority nationality regions  was set up. In 1964, two reserve funds were established for  these regions. By the end of 1979, the State had allocated more  than 3 billion yuan ($344 million) to minority regions through  the three projects.    From 1980 to 1987, grants increase by 10 percent under a new  State subsidy system. By 1991, the grants totaled 80 billion  yuan ($9.2 billion).    In 1980, the government set up a development fund for  economically backward regions. By 1991, half of the fund, 4  billion yuan ($459 million), went to minority nationality  regions.    Ethnic regions also topped the State agenda for poverty  relief. The poverty line in these areas was set lower than other  regions so that more counties would benefit from the State  subsidies.    Eleven years ago the government provided 200 million yuan  ($23 million) in annual loans to the agricultural development  fund in Hexi and Dingxi, of Gansu Province, and Xihaigu, of  Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The loans will continue until  the end of the century.    To create a favourable environment for economic development,  the State spent 10 billion yuan ($1.15 billion) on materials for  the regions to upgrade infrastructure.    And in 1990 the State set up a special fund to provide  minority people with sufficient, food and clothing; the fund  covers 143 poverty stricken counties in ethnic areas.    As a result of government efforts, minority living standards  have greatly improved. In 1992, the per capita income of  farmers and herdsmen in the autonomous areas hit 548 yuan ($63),  six times that of 1978.    Minority nationality regions, however, took longer to open  up  to the outside world compared to coastal areas.    But since China has developed friendly relations with its  neighboring countries, the government has encouraged minority  regions to make the most of their geographical positions and  boost their border trade.    China has 22,000 kilometres of border land, of which 19,000  kilometres are in minority regions.    Last year, trade in the eight autonomous regions and  provinces reached $5.7 billion. And trade with Russia, Myanmar  [Burma] and Vietnam is especially active.    Due to diverse traditions and customs, minorities have  different kinds of daily necessities.    Before 1949, ethnic regions suffered a shortage of daily  necessities. They had problems exporting the locally made  products, and consequently, prices for these goods were very low.    Over the past four decades, the government worked hard to  rectify the existing price structure, subsidizing grocery stores.    And companies producing goods for minority groups enjoy  preferential loans, investment and taxation policies. Special  low-interest loans have also been set up to help the technical  innovation of these enterprises.</p>

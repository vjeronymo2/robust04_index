			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, April 11 (AFP) -- Germany has decided to  freeze 83 million marks (49 million dollars) in planned  development aid for Rwanda in the light of developments in that  strife-torn country, the Economic Cooperation Ministry said here  on Monday [11 April].    Cooperation Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger said cooperation  was currently out of the question because of fighting.    The aid, promised at the end of 1993, relates primarily to  agriculture, infrastructure work, health, and education.</p>

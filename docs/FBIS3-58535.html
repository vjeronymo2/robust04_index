			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Spanish Defense Minister [Julian] Garcia Vargas, has  been, or rather is, in Germany today and he has been talking  with his German counterpart precisely about the situation in the  former Yugoslavia. The Spanish Government has expressed its  support for carrying out actions in the area to serve as a  warning, such as selective strikes against the Serb aggressors.  Also on the defense minister's agenda: the details of Spain's  joining of the Eurocorps. Our correspondent in Berlin, Aurora  Minguez, has the details. Good afternoon.    [Minguez] Good afternoon. The press conference has just  ended here at the German Defense Ministry building and Julian  Garcia Vargas has just told RNE that he is opposed to the  withdrawal of the blue helmets stationed in Yugoslavia, although  he does favor the idea of reducing contingents.    [Begin Garcia Vargas recording] That would mean that a  particular country could leave for good or temporarily, with the  system of rotation operating as one supposes will happen, and  concentrating the remaining blue helmets in certain zones where  they were essential -- in Sarajevo, of course -- but, at the  same time, giving a very clear indication to all the parties  that the current situation cannot continue, and therefore that  presence may be reduced drastically or, in certain cases as in  the case of a particular country, may disappear. [end recording]    [Minguez] The Spanish defense minister also expressed  support  for selective strikes on the Bosnian city of Tuzla in order to  break the Serb siege and thus allow humanitarian aid to reach  the civilian population, which is protected -- on paper -- by  the UN, which considers this Muslim enclave an international  protection zone.    Yugoslavia was one of the topics in the talks between Garcia  Vargas and his German opposite number, Volker Ruehe, but it was  not the only one. The two ministers expressed their support for  continuing to make a cheap version of the European fighter  aircraft and their support for NATO opening up to the countries  of East Europe, with whom joint military manoeuvres are in fact  going to be carried out this year.</p>

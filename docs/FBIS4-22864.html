Adamov, A.Ye. Domoradov, Yu.V. Mironov, </F> Yu.M. Nikitin and Yu.M. Cherkashov (NIKIET [expansion not  given]); received  uly 15,1993; UDC 621.039.562.3]    [Abstract] Immediately after the Chernobyl AES accident a  large number of design and analytical studies of the development  of the accident and the role of various factors in that  situation were performed at NIKIET and other research centers,  including foreign ones. This has made it possible to perform  numerical studies of the origin and development of the Chernobyl  AES accident. The article presents initial results of such  analysis using the Relap 5/mod 2 program; the standard version  of this program is widely used abroad in studies of NEPUs  [nuclear electric power units] safety. The article examines two  problems: 1) studying the effect on the system of operation of  emergency protection equipment A3-5 and short-term insertion of  positive reactivity into the core when moving emergency  protection rods during a pre-accident condition of the reactor,  and 2) studying the consequences of turning off the  turbogenerator and of run-out operation of two of the four  operating main circulation pumps [MCPs] in each loop.  Calculations performed for a reactor condition that was close to  the condition of the 4th unit reactor of the Chernobyl AES  immediately before the accident demonstrated in the first  approximation that operation of the emergency protection system  in and of itself does not cause reactor runaway. On the other  hand, operation of two of the four MCPs in each half of a  running out turbogenerator can result in the development of a  catastrophic process even without the effect of positive  reactivity of old style displacing rods.

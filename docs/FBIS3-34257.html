But officials are declining comment on  whether there was any evidence to indicate that a single group  was behind the two blasts.    Interior Minister Salamah Hammad confirmed the arrest of  five  people on Wednesday [2 February], one day after a bomb tore  through the Salwa movie theatre in al-Zarqa, injuring two  people, one of them seriously.    The minister said investigations were continuing and that  investigators were keeping all possibilities open. Other  sources said more arrests were made but did not disclose any  details.    The Salwa blast followed a similar explosion on Jan. 26 at  the Rivoli movie house in downtown Amman which injured seven  people, one of them seriously.    The common features of the two bombings were that both  occurred at establishments screening X-rated moves and the  nature of the explosive devices were the same. In addition, the  exact place where the bombs, described as crude homemade devices  lacking any sophistication, was also the same--near the  projection rooms.    More importantly, however, according to sources, the bombs  were of the same type as that of devices removed and defused  before they exploded at two liquor stores over the past six  months. In turn, those devices appeared to have been built with  the same technique that was used by the extremist underground  group called Jaysh Muhammad (Muhammad's Army), the sources said.    "It is premature to point the finger at any specific group  despite the common features of the explosive devices," said one  source. "Anyone who ever worked with the Afghan Mujahidin could  have learnt the technique."    Jaysh Muhammad is believed to comprise mostly of Jordanian  volunteers who fought with the Afghan rebels and returned home  after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1990.    Eighteen members of the group were found guilty of carrying  out or plotting attacks against government officials, security  officers, state buildings and foreign diplomats as well as  liquor stores and night clubs in 1992.    Eight of them, including two in absentia, were sentenced to  death. The death sentences, except those on the two at large,  were commuted to life terms by His Majesty King Husayn.    Jaysh Muhammad was at one point alleged to be the "military  wing" of the Muslim Brotherhood, but the Brotherhood has  categorically denied any such link with the group.    According to experts on the Islamic movement in Jordan,  Jaysh  Muhammad was set up by hardliners who belonged to the  Brotherhood who were disillusioned with what they saw as the  leadership's moderate approach and confining the group to the  mainstream political process in Jordan.    The Islamic Action Front, the political arm of the  Brotherhood, has denounced the Jan. 26 bombing saying violence  was not the means to prevent cinemas from showing films that  many see as incompatible with the conservative Jordanian society.</p>

The investigation in  the case has been going on for 13 years now, with evidence on  record already filling two rooms.    Two years ago the Bulgarian investigating magistrates were  allowed access to the archives and the information database of  the National Intelligence Service, the Security Service, the  Military Intelligence Service and the Military  Counterintelligence Service, i.e. all the secret services which  theoretically could have been involved in some way or another in  the assassination attempt. "We have found no evidence  whatsoever of some Bulgarian connection in the assassination  attempt," Mr. Andreev said. According to him, the investigative  proceedings have been suspended because Bulgaria requested the  Italian and Turkish investigative authorities to give it access  to the materials related to Oral Celik's extradition to Italy.    Visiting Bulgaria in January this year, the director of  Italy's Central Investigation Magistracy, Dr. Simone, was asked  to hand over the records of the investigation reopened in Italy.  The case can be closed only after the Bulgarian investigating  magistrates are acquainted with those documents, the news  conference was told.</p>

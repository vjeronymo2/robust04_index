			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Premium bonds rise again - Diary of a Private Investor / Kevin Goldstein-Jackson did not win Pounds 1m this week. But he's hoping On Tuesday morning, I raced to turn on Channel 4 television's Big Breakfast Show. Chris Evans, the presenter, was talking to Kermit the frog. Would this bring me luck? Newspaper advertisements had said the announcement would be made between 8am and 8.30. Tension mounted. And, at 8.17, it happened. The first winner of Pounds 1m on the premium bonds was announced. It was not me. I knew that the odds on a single Pounds 1 premium bond winning the big prize were 'only' 3.37 billion to one - but I did hold 8,000, so my chances were somewhat improved. This year started well for me, with four Pounds 50 prizes in January and another of Pounds 50 in February. I was even considering increasing the size of my holding again. I had held premium bonds for many years but it was not until 1985, when my wife and I had reached the then maximum of Pounds 10,000 each, that I started to keep a record of what we made. What drew us initially to this National Savings product was the prospect of tax-free winnings - especially attractive to high-rate taxpayers - and the knowledge that, unlike most other forms of gambling, the initial stake money would be returned if needed. Theoretically, each Pounds 1 bond had a 15,000-1 chance of collecting a prize in the monthly draw, even if it was only Pounds 50. With average luck, we thought we would do reasonably well. That was the idea. In practice, what each of us got from our Pounds 10,000 holding up to 1992 was disheartening (see table). Last year, she won Pounds 450; I got only Pounds 250. Returns like these depressed us. We felt it was easier to make money elsewhere, such as from tax-free gains on shares held via personal equity plans. Even a letter from NS last August, pointing out that we could increase our holding to the new maximum of Pounds 20,000 each, did not impress us - although it pointed out that 'holdings of Pounds 20,000 can be expected to win an average of 16 prizes a year.' In November, I reduced my holding to Pounds 8,000 and my wife to Pounds 7,980. But things have changed. Uncertainties on the stock market have made it more difficult to produce excellent returns. Low interest rates have reduced the attractions of cash on deposit. And tax can still be levied at rates rising as high as 40 per cent on certain capital and other gains. No longer do bonds have to be held for a full three months after purchase before they are eligible to enter the prize draws; the wait is now just one calendar month (although, if you buy bonds at the beginning of a month, you still have to wait for a full, clear calendar month before they enter the draw. Thus, it is best to buy them towards the end of the month). The total prize fund equates to 5.2 per cent of the value of all the bonds held. With average luck, that compares very favourably with interest rates elsewhere and is especially attractive to higher-rate taxpayers (although experience shows that 'average luck' is rather like the statistician with his head in the oven and his feet in the refrigerator: his average body temperature is warm). The minimum purchase of bonds is now Pounds 100, which buys 100. While the previous maximum prize of Pounds 250,000 has been abolished, there are many other prizes each month including two of Pounds 100,000 each, three of Pounds 50,000, four of Pounds 25,000, 10 of Pounds 10,000, 25 of Pounds 5,000, and 435 of Pounds 1,000 - plus many of Pounds 500, Pounds 100 and Pounds 50. The number of smaller prizes is adjusted each month to take account of how many bonds are held. The more eligible for the draw, the greater the number of prizes, although the total paid out will still equate to 5.2 per cent of the value of all the bonds entered. This month, for example, there will be 209,047 prizes of Pounds 50. Although there is now only one draw each month, instead of the weekly draw that used to be held for the smaller prizes, it can take up to two weeks from its date for the Pounds 50 cheque to arrive through the letter box. Still, I am keeping my fingers crossed that I will be one of those winners. And if next month's Pounds 1m number is also announced on live television, I shall again be an avid viewer.  -------------------- PREMIUM BOND WINNINGS  -------------------- (Pounds) Date     Self  Spouse  -------------------- 1985      550     300 1986    1,150     200 1987      650     700 1988      750     500 1989      350     750 1990      550     700 1991      300     750 1992      400     750  --------------------</p>

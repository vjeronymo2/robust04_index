			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Unionist tensions surround NI talks NORTHERN IRELAND unionist leaders presented their position papers in talks with the Irish government yesterday amid the first visible signs of the tensions the London negotiations have caused in unionist ranks. Three local councillors in Cookstown, County Tyrone, announced their resignations from the hardline Democratic Unionist party of the Rev Ian Paisley in protest at the Lancaster House talks. Their action was dismissed as a 'stunt' by the DUP - which said that two had been lapsed members - but it highlighted the pressure Mr Paisley would face if he appeared to be making concessions to the Dublin government. A DUP official emphasised that Unionists were not negotiating about the Irish government's role in Northern Ireland. They were talking to Dublin about relations between a proposed devolved Northern Ireland government and the south. Devolution was the subject of earlier negotiations in the talks process to which the Irish government was excluded. 'We are on a higher moral ground. Resigning on something like this is playing into the hands of Dublin,' the official said. Mr Paisley's presentation called for the Irish government to end its constitutional claim on Northern Ireland. It also set out how Unionist feelings had failed to be incorporated into the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, which gives the Irish republic a say in the affairs of the province. The Ulster Unionist party's presentation was made by Mr Ken Maginnis, MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, and is believed to have covered similar areas to the DUP's. The meeting then turned to discussion on the participants' opening positions. Also taking part in the talks are the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and the UK government. Talks, under the independent chairmanship of Sir Ninian Stephen, former governor general of Australia, resume today and are expected to transfer to Belfast next week.</p>

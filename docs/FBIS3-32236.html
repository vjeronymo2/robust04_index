Although there is no evidence of it, the complaints are being  investigated and have resulted in a discussion of the Army's  function and responsibility.    [Begin recording] [Deputy Commander Marcos, identified by  caption] Until now, war was just for them and peace for you.  Now, war will be for the two of us. Before, war killed them and  not you. Now, it could kill anyone from either side. [video  shows Deputy Commander Marcos from his waist up wearing a ski  mask then cuts to recorded interview with 31st Zone Commander  Miguel Anel Godinez, identified by caption] [Godinez] The only  thing the Army has done is defend itself from attack. We were  attacked. We did not attack anybody. We did not leave our  garrison to seek out these people. They came to our garrisons to  attack us.    Who is the bigger criminal, the soldier who shot a man  carrying a wooden rifle, when he saw him at a distance of 100  meters at night and did not realize it was a wooden rifle, or  the person who brought that individual with the wooden rifle?  [end recording]    Today, alleged human rights violations by the Army in  Chiapas  State have become a matter to be judged by segments of society.  Moreover, the issue has been raised in U. S. Congressional  committee meetings. As yet, there is no evidence these rights  were violated. The inquiries begun by the National Human Rights  Committee and the Attorney General's Office have not yielded  results yet, but some insist on discrediting the country,  without even asking what is the Army's constitutional duty.

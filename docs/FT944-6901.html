			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Hong Kong railway lets off its head of steam: Contracts are coming fast after years of Sino-British wrangles Senior managers of Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) are having a busy fortnight. Last week they let contracts valued at HKDollars 6.6bn (Pounds 544m) for the corporation's HKDollars 35bn railway connecting the colony's new airport to the business district of Hong Kong. This week managers hope to let a further four contracts for tunnelling and railway stations. Mr Hamish Mathers, the corporation's chairman and chief executive, likens the process to shaking a bottle of champagne for a long time and then removing the cork. 'In two weeks we have had (a Sino-British) agreement on overall funding, land has been made available for the railway and the Legislative Council has approved HKDollars 23.7bn of funds.' The railway, like the airport at Chek Lap Kok which it is designed to service, has been a hostage to more than five years of bone-breaking Sino-British talks on, first, whether to build the project and then, how to finance it. In between, talks became enmeshed in Britain and China's long running dispute about Hong Kong's political development. Unlike the airport, the construction of which has proceeded apace, physical work on the railway had to wait until China gave its approval to the overall financing for the project. Although the MTRC was unable to begin construction until a formal Sino-British agreement it has not been idle. The contracts awarded last week, and those to be awarded during this and successive weeks, were negotiated to a stage where they could be formally awarded the minute a Sino-British deal was sealed. Indeed, in the whole project there is just one major contract - a HKDollars 3bn-plus mandate for the Hong Kong island terminus to the airport railway - that is still open for competitive bidding. According to Mr Russell Black, project director for the airport railway, more than a year ago the MTRC decided to embark upon a tendering process that concluded with the corporation identifying successful bidders and issuing them with 'option' letters. 'The successful bidder agreed to keep the price bid open for 12 months,' he said. 'We identified him as the preferred contractor and we assumed the risks of price escalation due to labour and materials costs, the risk on currency if that was relevant, and the risk that statutory enactments might affect costs. We accepted these risks only during the period of delay.' Mr Black conceded that this was 'a little unusual' but cited a parallel with London Underground's Jubilee line. The airport railway constitutes a major expansion for the MTRC. Currently the corporation runs a rail service of 43km; after completion of the airport railway the length will rise to 77km. The corporation hopes to offer a service that takes arrivals to Chek Lap Kok on an 135km an hour journey from the airport north of Lantau island, to the central district on Hong Kong island in just 23 minutes. The additional track will also help relieve congestion on the main rail service. At present the Nathan road section of the railway on Kowloon is the most extensively used railway in the world, used by 80,000 people per route kilometre per hour. The MTRC expects that 25 per cent of users of the current system will switch to the Kowloon section of what will be known as the Lantau line. More than a railway is being built. Above the stations the MTRC in partnership with local developers, will build 24,000 flats, 16 office towers, nine hotels (of 5,000 rooms in total) and five large shopping centres. Private property developers pay for the costs of construction but share the profits with the MTRC. Hopes, however, that the airport railway could be completed by mid-1997, when China resumes sovereignty, may not be realised. Mr Mathers says the corporation, once China approves borrowings of HKDollars 11.4bn, will finalise an internal study on when the project can be completed. In the meantime he is sticking to a previous forecast that the line from the airport to Kowloon will open in April 1998, and the line to the central district some time after. Mr Roger Moss, finance director, is confident that the airport railway can be built for less than the HKDollars 35bn allocated for the project. He is equally confident that he can raise the HKDollars 11.4bn of debt for the project for which final approval is dependent on China's agreement to a financial accord between the MTRC and the Hong Kong government. The corporation has investment grade credit ratings from the main rating agencies. This is because the MTRC is one of the few public rail systems in the world which actually makes money. In the first six months of this year it had a profit after depreciation and interest of HKDollars 500m. It pays no tax due to accumulated losses currently standing at around HKDollars 1.8bn. Mr Moss is wary of forecasting when the corporation will return to public debt markets - it has a requirement to raise HKDollars 6bn a year for the next four years - but it is clear that he has been engaged in the financial equivalent of Mr Black's pre-tendering. When China bestows its final blessing on the airport railway, expect to see equally quick activity in the capital markets.</p>

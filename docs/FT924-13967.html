			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei, Hang Seng rise against the trend SHARE prices firmed in quiet trading on index-linked buying towards the end of the session, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei index rose 242.23 to 17,302.01 after a low of 17,086.66 and a high of 17,307.02. Investment trust funds and public pension funds moved in to support share prices late in the afternoon, and foreigners were seen buying in small lots. Volume totalled 150m shares, the lowest since August 17, falling sharply from Friday's 483m. Settlements for October option prices had boosted activity at the end of last week. Advances led declines by 520 to 370 with 186 unchanged. The Topix index of all first-section stocks gained 10.68 to 1,309.33 and, in London trading, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.11 to 1049.5. While public fund managers have provided a floor for share prices by indicating buying interest below the 17,000 level, analysts said that this in turn seemed to be causing the stagnation in the market. 'The price-earnings ratio is currently too high and buyers are waiting for an adjustment,' said Mr Yuichi Kohashi, strategist at Daiwa Securities. The dollar firmed against the yen, lifting some high-technology exporters. NEC rose Y30 to Y715 and Sony advanced Y80 to Y4,030. Ito-Yokado, the supermarket chain, rose Y110 to Y4,040 on reports that the company expected a 4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the current fiscal year, despite a fall in consumer demand. Hanshin Department Store fell Y78 to Y527 on profit-taking. The issue had surged previously on the strength of Hanshin Tigers, the Osaka-based baseball team. However, failure to win the league series prompted heavy selling. Other Hanshin group companies were also lower, with Hanshin Electric Railway down Y34 to Y431. Environmentally-related issues were actively traded by speculators. Chugoku Marine Paints, the leading paint maker, finally fell Y3 to Y685 after rising on hopes of higher orders of its pollution-free ship bottom paints. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 59.25 to 18,953.14 in volume of 6m shares. Investors dabbled in low-priced theme stocks, but overall activity remained low. Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y60 to Y9,850 on the rise in the dollar against the yen. Roundup SPECIAL circumstances took Hong Kong up against the trend in the region yesterday. HONG KONG had an exuberant opening in the wake of the Sino-US trade agreement which concluded on better terms than had been rumoured on Friday. The Hang Seng index ended 128.86, or 2.3 per cent higher at 5,725.57, after hitting 5,790.70 at the opening. Turnover was a relatively heavy, at HKDollars 3.58bn. Property developers were the most active stocks on the day, with Sun Hung Kai and Cheung Kong gaining HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 33.50 and HKDollars 0.60 to HKDollars 21.20 respectively, while HSBC led the banks up with a rise of HKDollars 1.00 to HKDollars 13.40. NEW ZEALAND fell 1.1 per cent to a new 1992 low in early trading, the NZSE-40 index dipping to 1,366.88 before a recovery to 1,375.56 at the close. The five major companies that make up around 70 per cent of the exchange's capitalisation have run foul of US and European pessimism with forestry combine Fletcher Challenge, which has lost half its market value in the past three months. BANGKOK saw a technical correction, after recent rises and on investors' concern about volatility in New York. The SET index ended 14.63, or 1.65 per cent lower at 871.71, its largest daily loss for four months, in turnover of Bt9.40bn. AUSTRALIA was subdued by overseas uncertainties, and even the ADollars 1.23bn bid for the biscuit manufacturer, Arnotts, by Campbell Soup of the US failed to generate enthusiasm. The All Ordinaries index closed 3.3 lower at 1,463.0 and Arnotts, after suspension, was unchanged at ADollars 8.00 against Campbell's ADollars 8.80-a-share offer. SEOUL wobbled on the departure from the ruling Democratic Liberal Party of its co-chairman, Park Tae-joon. The composite index shed 10.87 to 514.90, with turnover of Won152.09bn, against Won137.34bn for the half-day on Saturday. MANILA's blue chips weakened as second liners rallied and the composite index fell 16.25 to 1,391.88. Combined volume surged from 5.79bn shares to 7.81bn, but turnover eased from 342m to 331.6m pesos. BOMBAY fell sharply after a World Bank report warned India about a possible balance of payments crisis; the market was also hit by a rise in inflation to 9.2 per cent for the week ended September 26, from 7.4 per cent two weeks earlier. The BSE index fell 109.05, or 3.3 per cent to 3.166.52.</p>

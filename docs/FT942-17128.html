			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei up 2.3%, Tokyo stocks rise across the board The Nikkei 225 average gained 2.3 per cent, heartened by Monday's intraday recovery in New York equities, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index ended 440.99 ahead at 19,563.21 after a day's low of 19,184.04, and high of 19,580.32 just before the close. Mr Nobuhiro Kaneda, general manager of Daiwa Securities' equity division, said the Nikkei would move in a range of 19,000 to 20,700 in the near term. However, he added that the downside risk remained low and expected Japanese investors to start purchasing stocks in May and June. But some investors remain cautious due to the political situation and the expected negative impact of the high yen against the dollar. 'If the budget isn't approved by mid-May, it could start to have a negative affect on the economy,' said Mr James Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Volume was 220m shares. The Topix index rose 28.45, or 1.8 per cent, to 1,588.83 and the Nikkei 300 advanced 5.87 to 291.08. Gainers overwhelmed losers by 872 to 172, with 122 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.73 at 1,302.40. Shares firmed across the board. High-technology issues were higher in spite of the yen's rise to the Y102 level against the dollar. Ricoh, the day's most active issue, gained Y36 at Y855, while NEC moved ahead Y30 to Y1,100. Arbitrage buying supported banks, with Industrial Bank of Japan rising Y110 to Y3,110 and Fuji Bank Y100 to Y2,200. Some short term speculative stocks were lower on profit-taking. Yamazaki Baking, which had risen previously on hopes that the company would benefit from the current rice shortage, lost Y20 at Y2,080 and Iino Kaiun Y14 at Y661. In Osaka, the OSE average strengthened 319.55 to 21,686.43 in volume of 9.4m shares. Roundup Wall Street's overnight performance held the key to trading in many of the regional markets. Hong Kong, Seoul and Taiwan were shut for national holidays. AUSTRALIA was lifted off the session's lows by late bargain hunting and the All Ordinaries index finished only 3.1 off at 2,050.0, having been down some 2 per cent earlier. Turnover was ADollars 673.6m. BHP, the most actively traded stock, closed 12 cents down at ADollars 16.36 after some 11m shares changing hands. News Corp bounced sharply off the day's low of ADollars 8.76 to end 17 cents higher at ADollars 9.12. Among gold stocks, interest from overseas investors pushed Newcrest up 16 cents to ADollars 6.34, while Plutonic firmed 7 cents to ADollars 6.77 and Poseidon Gold 5 cents to ADollars 3.30. SINGAPORE was slightly firmer but trading was thin and confined to a few index-linked blue chips. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 22.37, or 1.1 per cent, to 2,061.49 in volume of 112.9m shares. Gains were seen in bank, property and shipyard shares. DBS Foreign advanced SDollars 1.10 to SDollars 14.50. OCBC Foreign put on 70 cents at SDollars 12.30 and UOB Foreign 40 cents at SDollars 11.50. KUALA LUMPUR ended a volatile session higher as investors moved in to pick up bargains after Monday's fall, and the composite index added 10.98 at 939.31. BANGKOK edged ahead on bargain hunting in the banking sector, after big fluctuations in morning trade ahead of a public holiday today. The SET index rose 5.36 to 1,201.95, but turnover was the lowest of the year at Bt2.3bn. MANILA was lower overall, although oil issues rose. The composite index declined 20.69 to 2,633.01 as analysts suggested that the market was likely to fall further to the 2,550 to 2,600 range. NEW ZEALAND finished at its lowest level for the year as falls in world markets caught up with the local bourse. The NZSE-40 capital index lost 35.41 at 2,049.17 after a day's low of 2,030.56. Among leaders, only Carter Holt, up 1 cent at NZDollars 3.45, was unaffected. Telecom was hardest hit, falling 16 cents to NZDollars 4.96. KARACHI closed sharply lower in spite of rallying towards the end of the day on institutional support. The KSE 100-share price index lost 35.72, or 1.5 per cent, at 2,413.11 in an extended session, recovering from a dip of 64.98 an hour before the close.

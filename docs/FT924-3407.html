			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Radio Clyde on song with 30% advance RADIO CLYDE Holdings, the USM-quoted broadcaster which has the lion's share of Scotland's independent airtime, increased pre-tax profits by 30 per cent from Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 1.83m in the year to end-September. Turnover jumped 38 per cent to Pounds 13m (Pounds 9.45m), reflecting the merger with Radio Forth in April last year and increases in local and national advertising revenue, which contributed two thirds of overall income. Earnings per share improved to 13.2p (12.4p), the modest increase reflecting the larger number of shares in issue after the all-share payment for Radio Forth. A final distribution of 5.25p (5p) is recommended which lifts the total to 8.5p (8.25p). Mr James Gordon, chief executive, said the group was increasingly successful in convincing 'advertisers south of the border that things are not so gloomy in Scotland'. Local advertising revenue rose 6 per cent, but national advertising climbed 10 per cent, and overall advertising revenue in the past two months was 10 per cent higher than a year ago. He said the results would have been even better had it not been for a Pounds 468,000 extraordinary write-off and losses at Buzz FM, a Birmingham station in which the group had built up a 97.5 per cent stake. Clyde could no longer support the drain on its cash reserves, and by cutting off financial support, had opened the way for a new backer or outright buyer for Buzz. Mr Gordon said the outlook for Clyde was good, but it was not clear yet whether rising advertising revenue would return to the levels of 1989 and 1990. The group had a strong balance sheet and was eager to expand, planning to tender for two out of five newly-advertised regional licences, having missed out so far on national tenders.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KINKAJOUS' TALE HAS MANY TWISTS EVOLVING FROM OWNERSHIP BATTLE  </P> <P> When four missing kinkajous -- cuddly, long-tailed members of the raccoon  family -- were returned to UC Irvine Wednesday by order of a Texas court, it  was only the latest chapter in a months-long saga involving animal rights  activists, a Ph.D. candidate and the Texas Rangers.  </P> <P> The tale is a complicated one with many twists.  </P> <P> In addition to ordering the animals returned to UCI, U.S. District Judge  Charles Gonzalez in San Antonio last week granted visitation rights to animal  rights activists and temporarily halted experiments on the animals.  </P> <P> Gonzalez's temporary restraining order was a result of a lawsuit that Primarily  Primates Inc., an animal center in San Antonio, filed against Ph.D. candidate  Cary Chevalier, charging that the UCI researcher had abandoned the kinkajous  and was therefore not their rightful owner. A full hearing on the case is  pending.  </P> <P> Chevalier and an attorney UCI hired to defend him say the animals were stolen  from him by groups opposed to the use of animals in scientific research.  </P> <P> By hiring a lawyer to represent Chevalier, UCI probably has become one of the  first institutions to stand up to animal rights activists who are becoming more  vocal in their protests, lawyers for the university said.  </P> <P> "It is UCI's intent to get a message to the animal rights activists that if  they are going to obtain custody of animals, they do so properly, legally and  without victimization of those people whose animals they have taken without the  right and legal authority to do so," said Dr. Paul Sypherd, UCI's vice  chancellor of research and graduate studies.  </P> <P> "We don't want to do anything illegal," said Wally Swenn, director of the San  Antonio center. "We're not stealing animals. There's a lot of sneaky things  going on, and it's not right, and it's not fair to the animals.  </P> <P> "I just find UCI just being totally wrong here. They're taking it as an attack  on their biomedical practices, and that's not it."  </P> <P> Chevalier, a doctoral student in biology, has spent the last two years studying  the effects of changing climate on kinkajous, which are native to the tropical  rain forests of Mexico and South America. His research was part of a broad  field of study on how wildlife adapts to changes in the environment.  </P> <P> Among the experiments he has performed are ones that subjected the animals to  temperatures ranging from 32 to 113 degrees. Chevalier said the kinkajous,  which are like pets to him, are not being harmed by the research. His  experiments, which are closely monitored, could ultimately ensure the survival  of their species, he said.  </P> <P> Last year, Chevalier took a sabbatical to both write his dissertation and take  a job with the Arizona Game and Fish Department. He had to find a temporary  home for the kinkajous as he waited to obtain the necessary permits to keep the  animals with him in Arizona.  </P> <P> By inquiring about in the network of animal care services, Chevalier was told  about the Animal Rehabilitation Center of Midlothian, Tex. He sent his  kinkajous there last May, checking on them periodically.  </P> <P> In October, Chevalier said, Karen Wakeland, director of the center, called him  in Arizona to say that the animals had escaped. Alarmed, Chevalier sent flyers  to various state and local agencies about the missing animals.  </P> <P> A few weeks later, Chevalier said, a sheriff's deputy from Ellis County in  northern Texas who had seen the flyers told him that Wakeland had hired him to  transport the kinkajous to Primarily Primates, an animal center in San Antonio.  </P></p>

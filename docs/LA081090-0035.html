			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CYCLING;  </P> <P> WHEN THE CAMERAS ROLLED, SO DID DENMAN  </P> <P> What started as a two-week stint in California -- to accommodate his work as an  extra in a remake of a Shirley Temple film -- has now become an 11-year stay  for Rick Denman, 32, program director of the Encino Velodrome.  </P> <P> While an engineering student at the University of Michigan in 1979, Denman was  recruited for his ability to ride on a banked, wooden indoor track that he  frequented in nearby Southfield and that was moved to California for a scene in  the film "Little Miss Marker."  </P> <P> The indoor track in Michigan was banked at 58 degrees, compared to 34 degrees  at Olympic Velodrome at Cal State Dominguez Hills and 27 degrees at Encino  Velodrome.  </P> <P> "That track was so steep that you could put your feet at the base and reach out  and touch the wall," said Denman, who lives in North Hollywood. "There weren't  too many people who could ride it or (were) willing to."  </P> <P> By the time filming was over, Denman had become fascinated with the operation  of motion-picture cameras and began answering casting calls requiring  bicyclists.  </P> <P> "As a competitive cyclist, I was able to understand the needs and the camera  angles to document them realistically," said Denman, the winner of the points  race in the 1982 Far West championships and who recently placed seventh in the  masters national championships in San Diego.  </P> <P> Denman's expertise gained the attention of the makers of the 1985 film  "American Flyers." Denman fitted the bikes with cameras and rode the cycles  while the bicycle footage was being filmed. He also was the technical  coordinator for "Quicksilver," recruiting and training the actors and cyclists  involved in the film.  </P> <P> Denman, who was a coach at the 1987 U. S. Olympic Festival, has now helped  coordinate more than 100 commercials, including the recent Miller Tour de Lite  commercial in which he worked with the rap group RUN DMC and "Cheers" star  Woody Harrelson.  </P> <P> "The situation is getting better and better all the time," Denman said. "There  seem to be more and more offers. There have been no regrets (about leaving  engineering) whatsoever."  </P> <P> Cross-training: If Brad Kearns is in good cycling shape, there is a distinct  possibility that he also will be in good triathlon condition.  </P> <P> "Throughout my career, when I'm doing well in all three areas, my cycling has  been right up there," said Kearns, 25, who will compete in the National City  Corp. triathlon in Cleveland on Saturday.  </P> <P> "Most of my training is on the bike. I spend about two to three hours' riding a  day compared to only an hour running and in the pool. The cardiovascular  effects of it transfers to my swimming and running."  </P> <P> And lately, based upon recent performances, Kearns, a former Taft High  cross-country and track standout, has been spending a lot of time on his wheels  in preparation for the NCC, which will serve as the 1990 national championship  for the Triathlon Federation of America.  </P> <P> Kearns, who said that he often cycles as many as 300 miles a week during heavy  training, won the Oxnard Sports Festival triathlon last month and the Orange  County Performing Arts Center triathlon in June. In the latter, he topped a  field that included Scott Tinley, the defending champion and four-time winner.  </P> <P> The top five finishers in Cleveland -- the competition consists of a  1.5-kilometer swim, 40-kilometer bike and 10-kilometer run -- will qualify for  the world championships Sept. 15 at Disney World in Orlando, Fla.  </P> <P> Prize money totaling $20,000, including $3,500 for first place, will be at  stake.  </P> <P> "I think I'll qualify, no problem," said Kearns, who plans to push the pace on  the bike portion. "There's no holding back. The best times come when you go all  out on the bike."  </P> <P> Trivia time I: The leaders in the ninth Race Across America are nearing the  halfway point of a 2,922-mile course that began Sunday in Irvine and will end  sometime next week in Savannah, Ga. This year marks the first time the race  will finish in Savannah.  </P> <P> In which other cities has the race finished?  </P> <P> Blue-collar bicyclists: A Working Man's division was launched at Encino  Velodrome last Saturday.  </P> <P> The new category is designed to supplement the existing four divisions and help  promote parity among riders. Previously, the categories ranged from Division I  (advanced) through Division IV (beginning).  </P> <P> Denman said that in the Division III races, masters riders (age 30 and older)  often were overmatched by former national-class riders in that age bracket.  </P> <P> "It was instituted in order to keep the guys in the 40s and 50s coming back and  at the same time keep the fields competitive," Denman said. "It also helps  educate the newcomers from the working class with a lot of speed but no  experience to hash it out against the real top pros."  </P> <P> Seven riders participated in the Working Man's division last week and Denman is  expecting a bigger turnout Saturday, including 10-time national champion and  two-time Olympian (1972 and 1976) Ron Skarin of Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Skarin, a gold medalist in the 1975 Pan American Games in the team pursuit,  holds the world record for distance traveled in one hour in a human-powered  vehicle (slightly more than 47 miles).  </P> <P> Trivia time II: Which country has won the most consecutive gold medals in  Olympic team-pursuit competition?  </P> <P> Triple threat: Matt Rayner of the Montrose Cycle Club has been dominating  competition for the omnium at Encino Velodrome the past two weeks and will be  seeking his third consecutive title Saturday.  </P> <P> Points are awarded each night for three races -- the points race, the  miss-and-out, and the scratch race. In winning the past two omniums, Rayner,  27, of Sylmar, has won five of a possible six races.  </P> <P> Rayner, a member of the 1987 national team pursuit champion, recently returned  from competition in Europe. He is gearing up for the Madison national  championships on Aug. 31 in Allentown, Pa., where he will team with Chris Gaido  of San Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> Trivia answer I: Past RAAM routes, all of which originated in Orange County,  ended in New York City; Atlantic City, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> In remembrance: A 10-mile race to commemorate one of the founders of Encino  Velodrome will be held at the venue Aug. 25. The event will be coordinated by  the San Fernando Valley Bicycle Club.  </P> <P> Jack Kemp, 84, one of the founders of the nonprofit velodrome that was  constructed in 1960, passed away last week after suffering a massive heart  attack.  </P> <P> Trivia answer II: Italy won the team-pursuit in four Olympiads, spanning the  period from 1908 through 1920.  </P></p>

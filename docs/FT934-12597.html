			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Audi aluminium car a questionable 'Vorsprung' Sir, John Griffiths (Technology: 'On the road to the future', October 22) portrays the use of aluminium in the manufacture of cars as an innovation. While this is true of the use of a space-frame in a high-volume car, other carmakers such as Land Rover and Rolls-Royce have used aluminium for some time. What has made cars heavy over the years are safety features such as anti-lock brakes, air bags and side-intrusion protection beams, as well as the use of electric motors to power just about anything that moves, while car bodies have increased comparatively little in weight. The argument that aluminium bodies will last much longer than their steel counterparts is certainly valid - witness the longevity of Land Rovers - but Audi body shells already outlast the mechanical components. Is Audi addressing a problem that does not really exist? Higher manufacturing costs and presumably a higher purchase price will also affect insurance premiums. A car requiring such complex production is likely to require complex repairs. Aluminium body panels are usually replaced rather than repaired. While the ASF Audi is an interesting experiment, it does give the impression that Audi is rather desperate to upstage its technological feats of the 1980s - the low drag Audi 100, the five-cylinder engine and the Quattro - at any cost. But is it a real 'Vorsprung' that will put cash in Audi's till? Christian Etzel, Am Salteich 64b, 21465 Reinbek, Hamburg, Germany</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HENPECKED COWPOKES;  </P> <P> RAISING OSTRICHES RUFFLES FEATHERS OF OLD-TIME CATTLEMEN  </P> <P> Life hasn't been the same the last couple of years on the 1,800-acre Flying S  Ranch in Northern California's sparsely populated Colusa County, where Ray  Williams runs a herd of Brahman cattle.  </P> <P> Williams, 47, has been a cowboy all his life, all over the West, working many  different breeds of cattle and even buffalo and sheep.  </P> <P> "When I first came to this country nobody had Brahmans, but everybody's  accustomed to them now. It's these damn birds that's changin' things around.  Biggest birds on earth," allowed Williams.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clowns of Bird World  </P> <P> He was surrounded by the clowns of the bird world, enormous, eight-foot, 300-  to 325-pound, flightless ostriches with skinny limber necks nearly half their  length and funny, fuzzy small heads with duck-like bills, soft brown eyes and  thick black eyelashes.  </P> <P> "Whoever thought ranching would come to this," sighed the cowpoke as one of the  ostriches began pecking at his jacket buttons. Williams raised his finger in  the air, admonishing the bird to cut it out.  </P> <P> Another big bird uncorked its neck and in a flash with its bill grabbed the cap  off the cowboy's head. "Give that back," shouted Williams sternly, and the  ostrich dropped his lid. "Playful critters aren't they?" mused the cowboy.  </P> <P> The Flying S is one of a dozen ostrich farms and ranches in California, one of  about 200 growers in the nation with a total of about 5,000 birds, mostly in  Texas and Oklahoma. Ostrich farms are an answer to trade sanctions against  South Africa imposed in 1986.  </P> <P> Until then, this country had been importing upward of 90,000 ostrich hides a  year from South Africa. The soft grained leather is used to make purses, belts,  shoes and boots.  </P> <P> Now the big push among ostrich growers is to build up numbers. The birds  command a lot of money: $2,000 for a chick, $25,000 to $35,000 for breeding  adults.  </P> <P> "Ostriches are going to be big business in America within a few years, just you  watch and see," said Svend Steffen, 54, owner of the Flying S who also owns and  operates a steel company in Redwood City. "Not only for the hides, but for the  meat and feathers as well," he added.  </P> <P> An ostrich yields 90 pounds of cholesterol-free, beef-like meat. "Ostrich meat  is a popular dinner item in South Africa. I never tire of eating ostrich. It  tastes great," insisted Steffen. He has 22 ostriches and plans to have as many  as 200 within a few months.  </P> <P> "These birds are similar to chickens in many ways," chimed in Williams. "Males  are called roosters, females, hens, babies, chicks. Like chickens they roost at  night and males, like barnyard roosters, make a lot of noise at sunup. Male  ostriches make a booming noise. It makes your hair stand on end. It's like  something you've never heard before."  </P> <P> The cowboy laughed and said, "Imagine eating an ostrich drumstick. One  drumstick is enough to feed nearly a dozen people. One ostrich egg weighs three  pounds and equals 26 chicken eggs." An ostrich hen lays an egg every other day  with a total of 40 to 60 eggs in a laying season. Eggs hatch out in 42 days.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ostrich Runways  </P> <P> The big birds on the Flying S Ranch are kept in two acres embraced by a  six-foot high fence. Eight 200-foot-long runways are in the ostrich yard. The  birds exercise by racing back and forth at speeds at times in excess of 40  m.p.h.  </P> <P> "You don't cowboy ostriches. No way is anybody going to lasso one of those  characters," observed Williams, who begins his day at sunup feeding his birds  corn, barley and alfalfa pellets.  </P> <P> "They're waiting at the gate to greet me. I kind of take a shine to some of the  friendlier birds like Big John over there and Sam and this hen I call Lucy,"  said Williams, scratching Lucy on her long neck.  </P> <P> The rest of the day, Williams is out on the ranch cowboying like most cowboys  do -- with cows, not birds.  </P></p>

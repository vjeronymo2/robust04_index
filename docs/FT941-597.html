			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hutchison Whampoa forms port offshoot Hutchison Whampoa, the conglomerate controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, yesterday took a step closer to floating its disparate interests in ports when the company said it would bring together all its port-related interests into one company. The company, to be called Hutchison International Port Holdings, will be headed by Mr John Meredith, the current managing director of Hongkong International Terminals (HIT). HIT is the principal operator of Hong Kong's container port and is 77.5 per cent owned by Hutchison. Over the past two years Hutchison has aggressively expanded its port-management interests in mainland China. It is an equal partner with the Shanghai Port Authority, where it operates three container terminals. It also has port interest in Zhuhai, a special economic zone abutting Macao. Last year it took the largest share in the development of a Y5bn (Dollars 574.7m) container port at Yantian, on the western fringe of Shenzhen. Yantian is one of the five ports on China's coast which the government has nominated for accelerated development. There has been speculation that the company might want to realise some of the value in its ports operations by seeking a separate stock exchange listing.</p>

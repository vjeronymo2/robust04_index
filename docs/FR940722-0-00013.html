			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Basis for Senior Officer Compensation Disclosures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters stated that FCS institutions are not parallel to commercial banks or thrifts, or analogous to other Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). Therefore, commenters adamantly believe that FCS institutions should not be required to make similar executive compensation disclosures. Commenters stressed four main points in support of their position. First, the compensation disclosure requirements for commercial banks, national banks, thrift institutions, and state member banks are applicable only to financial institutions subject to the registration requirements of section 12(b) or (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Second, equity securities in FCS institutions are owned only by borrowing members of the institutions, not purchased primarily for investment, and not publicly traded. Thus, the investor concerns addressed by the 1934 Act are not present in the case of FCS institutions. Third, although formally exempt from the registration requirements of the 1934 Act, other GSEs report as if they were subject to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) statutes, in part, because their securities are subject to the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. Fourth, the disclosures provide limited benefits to investors in FCS debt obligations because the banks are jointly and severally liable on these obligations. Consequently, investors generally rely on the strength of the System as a whole. Rather, commenters contend it would be more appropriate, in their judgment, for the FCA to compare the treatment of FCS institutions under the proposed rule to Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and credit unions, as the ownership structures of those entities more closely parallel those of the FCS banks and direct lender associations. Unlike commercial banks and thrifts, credit unions and FHLBs are not subject to executive compensation disclosures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Public companies with at least 500 shareholders of record and assets of at least $5,000,000 must register with the SEC pursuant to SEC regulations implementing the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCA agrees with commenters that a comparison of ownership structures between FCS institutions and credit unions and FHLBs has some validity, and that FCS institutions are notably different from commercial banks, thrifts and other GSEs. Nevertheless, the FCA did not intend to imply or draw a direct parallel between FCS institutions and any other type of financial institution or to use a comparison between the institutions as the sole basis for establishing or modifying the senior officer compensation disclosure requirements. The primary comparison being made was that the FCA's proposed compensation disclosure requirements were similar in many respects to those imposed on commercial banks and thrifts by other regulators. As stated in the proposed rule, the FCA believes that more detailed compensation disclosures, such as those imposed by the SEC, would satisfy the objectives of section 514 of the Act, <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  and the proposed disclosures would benefit FCS shareholders by providing them with senior officer compensation information that was comparable to that available to shareholders of other financial institutions. The proposed disclosure requirements were still, however, markedly less extensive than those established by the SEC, partly due to the many differences between commercial banks and FCS institutions. The final regulations deviate further from the SEC's compensation disclosure requirements in consideration of the uniqueness of the FCS institutions. For example, the $100,000 compensation threshold established by the SEC for individual senior officer compensation disclosure was one area where the FCA chose to differ. Instead, the FCA decided to adopt a $150,000 compensation disclosure threshold that applies only to FCS institution CEOs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The stated objective of section 514 is ``to ensure that information reported by directors, officers, and employees of Farm Credit System institutions under regulations of the Farm Credit Administration requiring the disclosure of financial information and reporting of potential conflicts of interests_(1) provides the stockholders of all Farm Credit System institutions with information to assist the stockholders in making informed decisions regarding the operations of the institutions; (2) provides investors and potential investors with information necessary to make investment decisions regarding Farm Credit System obligations or institutions; and (3) provides the Farm Credit Administration with information necessary to allow the Farm Credit Administration to effectively and efficiently examine and regulate all Farm Credit System institutions and thus enhance the safety and soundness of the System.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Enron thrives in an open market / Charting the rise of 'the US's biggest natural gas group' Deregulation of the tightly controlled natural gas business in the US has opened up opportunities for energy companies, none more so than for Enron, based in the US oil and gas capital, Houston. Non-existent 10 years ago, Enron has mushroomed to the point where it claims  -with some justification - to be 'the nation's largest natural gas company'. Its status is embodied in the shiny skyscraper it occupies in the city centre next to other giants of the energy business. Enron was born in 1985 from the merger of a natural gas and a pipeline company. It owes its rapid growth largely to decisions taken by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to lift decades-old controls which restricted the operations of gas companies and put a lid on prices. In particular, the 'unbundling' of gas transportation and sales services gave greater freedom to companies to compete. But two other factors also played a role. One was the changing perception of gas from a by-product best flared off at the wellhead to an efficient, environmentally friendly fuel ideal for power generation. Another was the view of Mr Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, of the gas market as one of boundless opportunity. Today, Enron is in all important stages of the gas business. It has an exploration and production arm through its 80 per cent interest in Enron Oil and Gas; it owns a 40,000-mile network of gas pipelines extending up towards the Great Lakes and outwards to Florida and California; it provides gas supply and distribution services, and downstream it builds and operates power stations. The area of the market where Enron has been specially successful is in exploiting the new freedom to market gas. Its gas services division has built up a speciality in designing tailor-made long-term supply contracts for customers using sophisticated hedging and financing techniques. It also trades heavily in the gas market: 10 per cent of all the gas bought and sold in the US passes through Enron's hands. This gives it a liquidity few competitors can match. Although the biggest part of Enron's growth has come in the US, it has also exported its vision of a gas conglomerate. In April, the company opened a 1,875MW power station on the UK's Teesside. Enron owns 50 per cent of the Dollars 1.2bn facility, which it expects to be the pre-cursor to others in the UK. It is also negotiating projects in India, Germany, Turkey and Kuwait, and it has bought a stake in a pipeline network in Argentina. The strong expansion in electricity demand predicted for the Third World over the next decade is all factored into Enron's growth plans. The wave carrying Enron forward has been reflected in its results. Earnings have risen at a compound annual rate of nearly 30 per cent since 1988, reaching Dollars 306m last year. And Mr Lay is confidently predicting growth of another 20 per cent this year. 'All our businesses are doing a bit better,' he says. Mr Lay bases this optimism on the strength of the US gas market. After years of glut, he reckons that supply and demand have finally come into balance, and this is reflected in the rise in gas prices to as much as 60 per cent over last year's levels. According to US government statistics, US gas demand rose 4.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year, but production went up less than 1 per cent. However, further out, Enron expects US natural gas growth to be strong well into the next century. Its latest forecast puts demand at 22,000bn cu ft in the year 2000 (it was 18,000bn last year), rising to more than 25,000bn in 2010. Enron's estimates of US gas reserves are also rosy: they suggest there is enough to last 71 years. Much of the rest of the US energy business seems to share Mr Lay's enthusiasm for gas. Other large companies such as Mobil, Shell and Exxon see a good part of their future growth coming there as well. Not everyone, however, is as optimistic about the level of reserves. Mr Robert Hermes, president of Purvin &amp; Gertz, a Houston firm which specialises in oil and gas research, says: 'The attitude is that we've got all we want. People are over-optimistic. We have been living off a surplus, but that day is over.' He points out that the strength of the gas price has not sparked a surge in exploration activity because people are worried about the volatility of the market. Another potential cloud on Enron's horizon is the energy tax being proposed by President Bill Clinton. Although it is still not clear what form it will take, Mr Lay says he is confident it will be a tax on energy consumers rather than energy companies. That, he says, is 'a tax we can live with'. But can Enron keep up the pace now that the initial flush of deregulation is over and strong competitors are moving into the market? Mr David Fleischer, gas industry analyst at Goldman Sachs, believes it can. He is predicting long-term earnings growth for Enron of 15 per cent. 'It's an even better managed company than most people think it is,' he says. 'Mr Lay has turned it round during a period which buried many other companies.' Mr Lay's response to concerns about Enron running out of steam is that it is wrong to view the last five years as ones of exceptional growth for the natural gas business. For much of that period there was still regulation and uncertainty, and Enron's success came in spite of rather than thanks to events. 'The market growth will be bigger in the next five years than in the last,' he forecasts.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / This Week: Film/Video Twenty-seven film-going days to Christmas, and distributors are bringing out the heavy artillery. Lord Richard Attenborough, long suspected of being Santa Claus in disguise, comes clean in Miracle On 34th Street. The film, opening this week, updates the 1947 comedy about a department-store Father Christmas who doesn't quite behave according to plan. Miracle has had a 10-gun critical salute in the US, where they enjoy the sight of distinguished Limey actors forced to remake Hollywood classics. For Britain, it may provide Yuletide cheer in a thinly-supplied season. Though Macaulay Culkin and Danny DeVito are back with us in soon - one in a cartoon/live-action fantasy, the other in a comedy about Arnold Schwarzenegger getting pregnant (sic) - the only sure treat to date is last week's commendation: the Gothic and glorious Nightmare Before Cristmas. Alternatively, you could pile up the videos by the flickering VCR. Snow White and Jurassic Park are current chart-toppers. But why not be adventurous and try John Sayles's Passion Fish, the moving, quirky tale of a Louisiana-dwelling TV actress (Mary McDonnell) rediscovering her life after a paralysing accident; or Kieslowski's White, the bleakly funny second part of his 'three colours' trilogy, all about corruption, longing and l'amour fou. If adventurousness fails, there is always the two-year-old Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Jim The Mask Carrey puts in an early bid for superstardom, helped by a dog and a dolphin. For children of all ages, or anyone house-bound by the Christmas spirit. And a postscript for repertory cinema lovers. The National Film Theatre begins two piquant seasons: one devoted to women screenwriters - yes, they were up and running in Hollywood long before feminism got started - and the other to 'Shakespeare: The Musical' - Kiss Me Kate, West Side Story, The Boys From Syracuse. As Verdi realised in Otello and Macbeth (also present): just because a man is the world's greatest playwright doesn't mean he can't be improved by a good tune.</p>

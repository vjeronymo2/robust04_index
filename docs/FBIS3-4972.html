The amendments are expected to become law after clearing an  upper house plenary session Friday.    The House of Representatives on Tuesday approved the  amendments, which feature changes in the lower house's election  system and revised regulations on corporate donations to  political fund-raising organizations.    Under the amendments, 300 seats will be allocated in  single-seat constituencies and 200 by proportional  representation based on the popular vote in 11 electoral units.  Currently, lower house members are elected from multiseat  constituencies.    The original government package called for 274 single-seat  districts and 226 seats allotted by proportional representation  on a nationwide basis.    The original package banned corporate donations to  politicians and their fund-raising organizations, but the  revised bills will allow firms to donate up to 500,000 yen per  year during the next five years as a temporary provision.    The original package was passed on January 29 at the  extraordinary Diet session shortly after Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and opposition Liberal Democratic Party president Yohei  Kono had agreed that the amendments and date of enforcement  would be discussed during the current ordinary session.    Lower house elections based on the new political reform  legislation can be held once a bill identifying the 300  single-seat constituencies clears the Diet.</p>

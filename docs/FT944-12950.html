			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Shares can't go into a Pep I am a 25 per cent taxpayer, and I hold a modest portfolio of blue-chip shares. Can I transfer Pounds 12,000 of these into a personal equity plan? Apart from new issues, it is not possible to transfer stock into a Pep. You would, therefore, have to sell Pounds 12,000 worth of shares and re-invest the proceeds for yourself and your wife. (Murray Johnstone). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

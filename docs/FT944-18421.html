			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Companies House plans attacked London users of Companies House said yesterday that plans to contract out its services to the private sector threatened the availability of corporate information in the capital. About 50 users specialising in company formations and searches met in London to question SRU, the private-sector consultants seeking views on contracting out. Companies House, the official repository of corporate information in England, Scotland and Wales, is based in Cardiff and has five regional offices. It holds the details of nearly 1m companies and last year handled the incorporation of nearly 100,000 new ones. A campaign led by the Civil and Public Services Association aims to kill the plan announced by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in July this year. Mr Kevin Brown, managing director of Marriots Company Services, said: 'SRU did not appear to have any idea about the structure of the market. They simply have not thought the process through.' Mr Graham Cowan of Access Company Information said many small businesses were worried that carrying out daily company searches would be impossible and that the London service would be scrapped. Business information companies feared that data might be concentrated in the hands of between two and four large operators. Mr Peter Scott of SRU said it planned to meet more customers and that no final decisions had been taken. A final report to Mr Heseltine is due later this month.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA QUAKE;  </P> <P> INSPECTORS HAD RATED NIMITZ SOUND;  </P> <P> SAFETY: REGULAR CHECKS HAD TURNED UP CRACKS AND CHIPS IN THE CONCRETE PILLARS,  BUT A CALTRANS AIDE SAYS THEY DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE FREEWAY'S COLLAPSE.  </P> <P> Regular state inspections of the section of the Nimitz Freeway that collapsed  in Tuesday's earthquake found the structure to be in sound condition, despite  the presence of numerous cracks and chips in the concrete pillars supporting  the elevated highway.  </P> <P> The reports show that some of the cracks exposed the steel inside the  structure's concrete casing, allowing water to seep through and rust the  reinforcements.  </P> <P> But a top California Department of Transportation maintenance official said the  items cited in 32 years of inspection reports released Thursday in no way  contributed to the catastrophic collapse, which killed at least 18 people who  were crushed in their cars when the roadway's upper level fell onto the lanes  below. The drivers and passengers in an undetermined number of other cars  remain unaccounted for.  </P> <P> "Nothing I have seen in these reports either gave the writer of those reports  or me any concern" that it would not withstand a quake of Tuesday's magnitude,  said Elvin Klein, branch chief of Caltrans' structural maintenance office.  </P> <P> Klein said the cracks are typical of freeways everywhere. "It is not cause for  alarm," he said.  </P> <P> Jim Drago, a Caltrans spokesman, added: "The collapse of the freeway was in no  way related to any of the normal wear and tear that was listed in these  inspection reports over the course of the years and addressed."  </P> <P> The annual inspections began in 1957, the year the eight-lane, double-decked  freeway opened as a state-of-the-art facility near the Bay Bridge in Oakland.  The reports detail everything from sagging of the freeway decks to bumpy  roadways, from drainage problems to the presence of graffiti on the structure.  </P> <P> In 1957, the freeway was reported to be in "excellent condition throughout." In  1960, an inspector found the Nimitz to be "in good structural condition." Later  reports itemize the cracks and other flaws but give no overall assessment of  the freeway's structural integrity.  </P> <P> Typically, the reports use technical language and it is unclear what  conclusions can be drawn from the findings.  </P> <P> In 1959, for instance, an inspector found "vertical cracks" in a column near  where the freeway collapsed Tuesday. "Water seeps through the column and has  rusted the reinforcing," the inspector wrote. No corrective action was  recommended.  </P> <P> Three years later, Caltrans found "numerous diagonal tension cracks" in the  exterior girders. "The size and number of cracks on the easterly side of the  structure appear to have increased considerably during the past year," the  inspector wrote.  </P> <P> In 1966, an inspector said that the back wall of one of the bridge abutments  was cracking and said it appeared that the "superstructure is transmitting  higher than anticipated . . . forces on the abutment back wall."  </P> <P> The Times asked several earthquake experts to evaluate the reports. One of  them, Vitelmo Bertero, UC Berkeley professor of earthquake engineering, said  the cracks inspectors found in reinforced concrete girders are "structural  cracks."  </P> <P> "I have been one of those who has called attention to these," Bertero said,  adding that he had sent his students to look at the cracks before the collapse.  "I've been scared about these."  </P> <P> But even though Bertero has long been concerned about the apparent cracking,  after inspecting the collapsed structure, he said he is convinced that the  cross-beam cracks were not the cause of the failure during the quake. "What  failed are the columns," he said.  </P> <P> An engineering professor at another California university, who asked not to be  identified, agreed with Bertero's assessment of the bridge inspection reports.  He said that failure to do proper maintenance can cause structural problems.  But, he said, "Nothing clearly points to that." The description of structural  cracking is more troublesome, he said, but may not prove to be relevant to the  collapse.  </P> <P> A UC San Diego earthquake engineer said Thursday that the collapse of the top  deck of the freeway was caused by failed joints that linked the roadway with  reinforced columns. Nigel Priestly, a structural engineering professor, said  there was "virtually no reinforcement" in the joints even though the design was  "state of the art" for the 1950s.  </P> <P> It is not clear whether the inspection reports found maintenance problems  related to the joints.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Gov. George Deukmejian announced the formation of an independent  commission to conduct an inquiry into the freeway collapse. He named Ian G.  Buckle, deputy director of the National Center for Earthquake Engineering  Research, to head the task force.  </P> <P> "I want answers to the pertinent architectural questions as soon as possible,"  the governor said in a statement. "This independent team comprised by leading  structural engineering experts from throughout the nation will give us these  answers."  </P> <P> Other members of the commission have not been named, but will include  representatives from the National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal  Highway Administration, research institutions and private corporations, the  governor's office said.  </P> <P> Buckle, in an opinion article published in The Times on Thursday, defended  Caltrans' record in upgrading the state's freeways to prevent destruction in an  earthquake. He said the department had followed a proper strategy of fixing the  simplest problems first and saving the most difficult problems -- such as the  San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and the Nimitz Freeway double-decking -- for  last.  </P> <P> "Now is not the time for knocking Caltrans," Buckle wrote.  </P> <P> Despite Buckle's statement, Deukmejian Press Secretary Kevin Brett said the  governor was confident that the earthquake expert from Buffalo, N.Y., would  conduct a thorough investigation of the freeway collapse.  </P> <P> "We believe he is going to be objective in his evaluation," Brett said. "We are  certain he is going to be critical where he needs to be critical. We want the  facts, and those facts may not be pretty, because we don't want to see this  tragedy happen again."  </P> <P> Times staff writers John Hurst, Paul Jacobs and Richard Paddock contributed to  this story.  </P></p>

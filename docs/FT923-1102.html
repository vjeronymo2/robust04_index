			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway seeks to sweeten its energy policy - Moves to counter the interest in emerging oil and gas sectors Norway is considering important energy policy changes to maintain the interest of foreign oil companies which have shown signs of turning their attention to emerging oil and gas sectors such as Vietnam, Angola and China. Although the government argues that operating in Norway is predictable, and risks are identified and manageable, it admits that its energy policy is outdated and needs to become more streamlined. Even Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, says the next phase of its development will aim at turning the company's vision of becoming a global business into reality. Two years ago Statoil teamed up with British Petroleum (BP) to form a so-called strategic alliance covering exploration and production outside the North Sea, co-operation in gas marketing and collaboration in research and development. Since then, Statoil and BP have pursued opportunities in the CIS, Vietnam, China, Nigeria, Congo and Angola. The pair also linked up with Norsk Hydro and established a British gas company called Alliance Gas. 'Our vision is that Statoil should develop into a leading international oil company. Statoil's position in Norwegian waters gives both the company and the nation a unique base for international activity,' explained Mr Harald Norvik, Statoil president and chief executive. After more than two decades, Norway has become the fourth biggest exporter of oil in the word. Soon, oil production will reach 2.5m barrels a day while gas production, now at about 26bn cubic metres (bcm) a year, will rise sharply to between 60bcm and 65bcm a year during the next decade. According to proven reserves' estimates, Norway can remain an oil producer for another 20 years while gas production at current levels can continue for a century. But foreign oil companies have increasingly become circumspect about Norway's energy policy and were outraged when carbon taxes on emissions from oil and gas platforms were introduced two years ago. Mr Finn Kristensen, Norway's energy minister, has reacted to criticism by removing the so-called carried interest obligation under which foreign oil companies had to carry the burden of the state's exploration costs. 'To increase effectiveness further, I am prepared to consider evaluating other changes in the licensing terms,' said Mr Kristensen. 'A more flexible system - working in both directions - for state participation would in my opinion be better than the present system.' Mr Kristensen has not, however, clarified whether he is prepared to scrap or amend the long standing sliding scale agreement, which allows the state to increase its stake in oil and gas fields once a development plan has been approved. The Norwegian state has in the past taken a 50 per cent stake in licences during the exploration phase, but this stake can rise under the licence terms to a share of about 65 to 75 per cent during the development phase. Statoil's president agrees with foreign oil companies that the sliding scale was appropriate when Norway was a young nation. 'I would not be surprised if the government removed it . . . it probably carries too high a price tag in today's overall commercial picture,' Mr Norvik said. In the country's 13th licensing round the energy ministry awarded acreage to smaller groups of oil companies, giving them bigger individual shares of licences. This was well-received by the industry which had grown dissatisfied with sharing small slices of licences with numerous companies. Norway recently announced 50 new blocks in the 14th licensing round and oil companies have until the turn of the year to submit applications for acreage with awards being made in the second or third quarter of 1993. Mr Norvik argues that it is more important than ever that Norway remain attractive for exploration and production in a world where competition is increasing. 'We must ensure that the leading international oil companies stay with us . . . I see no conflict between Norway's desire for a strong national industry and international companies having access to the Norwegian continental shelf,' he said. But in the 14th round, foreign oil companies will be expected to show a keen interest in acreage, a start in boosting gas reserves so that increased demand for gas from the continent can be met. Foreign oil companies, however, have been dissatisfied with the way the state has organised gas sales. This has been done through the Gassforhandlingsutvalg (GFU) - gas negotiating committee - which is a sales team comprised of Norwegian companies Statoil, Saga Petroleum and Norsk Hydro. The three companies negotiate gas sales contracts with potential buyers, on behalf of the owners of gas fields. Foreign oil companies have sought to be included in the gas marketing/sales strategy of GFU, but the state has always argued that Norwegian companies are better placed then foreign oil companies to serve the country's economic interests. But Mr Kristensen says GFU was established to maintain an efficient exploitation of gas resources and that future policy should continue to be based on co-ordination. 'However, I am not dogmatic about maintaining the present organisational frame,' he said. Norway's gas reserves currently cover about 12 per cent of west European demand, or one-third of European Community demand from non-EC gas producers. However, there seems to be no immediate danger of a mass exodus by foreign oil companies in hot pursuit of greater opportunities in emerging oil and gas nations. Statoil estimates that about NKr205bn (Dollars 34bn) will be invested over the next five years to cover Norwegian oil and gas development projects that have already been approved by the parliament. The company warns, however, that with oil prices at Dollars 20 a barrel and no real belief in sharp increases - and with the current weakness of the dollar - there is little to encourage large major capital expenditures to develop new oil fields.</p>

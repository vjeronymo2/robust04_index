			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the News Division: "Elchibey Next in Line"] </F>   [Text] Speaking at a regular session of the Azerbaijan  parliament, Speaker Rasul Guliyev reported that the Azeri  leadership intends to appeal to Moscow with the request that  Abdulrakhman Vezirov and Ayaz Mutalibov be handed over to  competent republic organs. It is known that Vezirov and  Mutalibov, at one time the top officials of the country,  presently reside somewhere in Russia and are not advertising  their specific location.    A. Mutalibov, first secretary during the waning days of  perestroyka, is accused of effecting a state coup. By state coup  is meant the unsuccessful attempt to return to power following  his unlawful overthrow by the People's Front. Accusations  directed towards his predecessor, A. Vezirov, are more serious.  Vezirov was caught participating in the events of the end of  January 1990, when hundreds of people perished as Soviet troops  were brought into Baku.</p>

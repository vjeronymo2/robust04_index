			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Higher compensation for water customers is urged HOUSEHOLDS should receive higher compensation for poor service from water companies, Ofwat, the water industry's economic watchdog, told the government yesterday. Ofwat said that customers had made only limited use of the compensation rules introduced in September 1989 when the 10 water authorities of England and Wales were privatised. Ofwat now recommends that the compensation rate should double to Pounds 10 if the water company fails to: Keep service appointments. Give written notice the day before any planned interruptions lasting more than four hours. Install a meter requested by a customer within 15 working days. Repair leaks or bursts in strategic mains within 48 hours (not 72 hours as now). Restore supply after unplanned interruptions within 24 hours. There are two changes to compensation: where sewers flood into a household, customers may claim a rebate of the sewer charge part of their water and sewerage bills. Also, most compensation payments will become automatic. In 1991-92 water companies received only 1,078 claims and made only 887 payments under the Guaranteed Standards Scheme, Ofwat said. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, said: 'An Ofwat survey has shown that only about 13 per cent of customers are aware of the scheme's existence. This suggests that under 2 per cent of customers eligible for payments submit a claim. Automatic payment and higher compensation should prove more helpful for customers.' Mr Mike Carney, secretary of the Water Services Association, which represents the 10 water and sewerage companies, said: 'We have been discussing this for a long time with Ofwat. It is arguable whether automatic payments are the best way of compensating customers, but so be it. 'The whole intention is that these sums should never need to be paid out,' he added.

			<p>BFN     [Text] What is going on within the Revolutionary Front for  the Promotion and Progress of Haiti [FRAPH]? In a press release,  the front has forbidden Mr. Louis Jodel Chambelain from making  any statements on behalf of FRAPH. The general director of the  front, namely Paul Arthur Fleurival Lahens, was contacted by  phone and he spoke of polarization within the administrative  staff.    [Begin Lahens recording, in Creole] In any political  movement  in gestation, there is something called polarization. As you  know, the front includes Emmanuel Constant, secretary general of  the organization; Louis Jodel Chamblain, national coordinator;  and Paul Arthur Fleurival Lahens, general director of the front.    There is no problem. As I told you, there is only a  polarization problem. But once it is a question of cooperation,  everybody can get together. Certainly there are some mistakes.  As the saying goes: To err is human. People may make mistakes,  but they must not be grave mistakes. There is always a way to  reconcile. We are only waiting for the appropriate time so there  can be rallying cry. Then you will see that there is really  nothing wrong. [end recording]</p>

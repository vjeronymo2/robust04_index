			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / A very slow bamboo boat from China . . .: Columbus? A mere new boy in America, or so Tim Coone hears WERE the first civilised discoverers of America Chinese mariners, ordered by their emperor to cross the Pacific on bamboo rafts more than 2,000 years ago? This question, which has puzzled archaeologists and anthropologists for decades, is to be put to a daring test by Tim Severin, the explorer and travel writer. In May, he plans to sail eastwards on a flimsy raft similar to that used by those Chinese sailors to show that they could have completed the 6,000 mile voyage to America. The idea that the ancient Chinese exported some of their developed culture to the Americas is strongly supported by Professor Joseph Needham, the eminent orientalist and historian. Modern archaeological techniques, such as radiocarbon dating, have established that the first real 'discoverers' of the continent, were Stone Age hunter-gatherers from Asia who crossed the Bering Strait around 12,000 to 15,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age, when sea-levels were much lower than today. These then dispersed throughout North and South America. As the world's climate warmed and sea levels rose, contact was broken. There the agreement on the cultural evolution of the AmerIndians ends. Academic debate now centres around two antagonistic groups. The first, dubbed the 'transoceanic culture diffusionists', claims that the many similarities that have been observed between Asiatic and AmerIndian cultures are the result of subsequent maritime contact between the two continents. The second group, which believes in 'independent development' claims that the similarities are coincidental, and the culture, science and technology of the Americas developed independently . These achievements include the highly accurate Mayan calendar and their pictographic scripts, impressive stone temples demonstrating sophisticated geometric and engineering skills, the cultivation of maize and cotton, and ornate metalworking of gold and silver. Severin's 'China Voyage' as it is to be called, will challenge the 'independent developmentalists' viewpoint. His voyage across the Pacific ocean from Hong Kong to Mexico, will be aboard a specially built 60-foot bamboo raft which is a replica of the sailing craft used by Chinese fishermen and mariners 2000 years ago. Taking the east-going Kuroshio current across the north Pacific, which was used by the Spanish galleons in the 16th century, his aim is to follow the probable route of an expedition of 3,000 Asian mariners of the Ch'in dynasty in 218 BC, who are recorded as having been despatched by their emperor to find a land across the ocean. There they believed a drug which would give long life could be found. Severin believes they may have succeeded although they never returned. Severin, aged 52, is no novice to such expeditions. His Brendan Voyage in a leather-hulled boat across the Atlantic in 1976, tracing the probable course of an eighth century Irish monk, was followed by further voyages in replica ancient boats; first in the Black Sea to trace the journey of Jason and the Argonauts, in the Mediterranean following Ulysses' 'Odyssey', in the China Sea after Sinbad the sailor, as well as two horseback treks - one following a Crusade route and another through Mongolia on the trail of Genghis Khan. The raft for the China Voyage has been designed by Colin Mudie, who worked on three other replica craft for Severin's previous expeditions. It is being built at Sam S'on on the Gulf of Tonkin in Vietnam, the only place in the world says Severin, where such vessels are still in use. A precursor of the later Chinese junks, the raft consists of three layers of bamboo lashed together with rattan string and bamboo skin. Two small cabins, which will be 'home' to the five-man crew for the six-month voyage, are made of plaited bamboo strips sealed with a mixture of sawdust and tree lacquer. It is powered by three Chinese battened lugsails set on bamboo masts and steered by an arrangement of rudders and centreboards. When fully-laden, the deck will be only a foot above sea-level. The crafts's seaworthiness is based on a 'wash-through' principle, allowing it to absorb the power of heavy seas by letting waves percolate through the fabric of the hull. Severin says that prolonged exposure to the elements will be a major problem for the five-man crew. Other perils they may have to face are fog and typhoons. He said 'previous attempts to reconstruct voyages in bamboo rafts have never gone so far without sinking, breaking up or being eaten up by shipworm'. However, Severin is no stranger to hardship. He braved storms, killer whales and pack ice in the north Atlantic in a small leather-hulled curragh during the Brendan voyage. He was surrounded by sharks and becalmed in the Doldrums on his Sinbad voyage. The China Voyage will have the benefit of modern navigational aids, liferafts, radio, and warm clothing unlike the ancient Chinese mariners. 'Anything that will enhance safety will be aboard, but will only be used as backups. We shall be eating similar foods to those used then and be using replicas of early Chinese compasses and star-angle measuring devices to navigate'. So what drives this slightly-built Englishman who settled happily in a small village in the west of Ireland 20 years ago, to continue undertaking such risky expeditions? He says: 'I enjoy doing them. It is as simple as that. It is an intellectual challenge rather than a physical one. I hope this voyage, like the other ones, will demonstrate that the technology existed then to enable travel from one side of the ocean to the other'. As with the Thor Heyerdahl's Kon Tiki expeditions, and his own previous adventures, Severin recognises that a successful conclusion of the China voyage will not necessarily prove that maritime contact across the oceans was achieved in pre-Christian times. 'What it will do is symbolise that various voyages could have taken place. We are focussing on one that was recorded as having set off in the Annals of China, although nothing was ever heard of them again.' 'What those mariners would have carried with them, are not so much archaeological artefacts that would have survived through time but their intellectual baggage - their knowledge of calendars and astronomy, their writing and art, and their building skills. These could have been passed on and survived if they reached their destination,' he said. Severin hopes to make his own landfall in the New World in October.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HOUSE OF DESIGN' WILL OPEN ITS DOORS IN APRIL  </P> <P> The 1990 Pasadena Showcase House of Design, a 9,000-square-foot mansion on the  east bank of the Arroyo Seco, is "French in feeling, similar in character to a  minor chateau," according to an account written in 1916, the year the house was  designed by the architectural firm of Allison &amp; Allison for Mr. and Mrs.  Julius C. Daniels of Chicago.  </P> <P> In contrast to the European-oriented exterior -- with its green-slate roof and  creamy concrete walls -- the architectural firm created an interior influenced  by the American Federal period.  </P> <P> The house sits on a two-acre site -- room enough for eating areas and arts and  crafts boutiques, which will be in place when the house is opened to the public  April 22 through May 20.  </P> <P> This represents the 26th year the Pasadena Junior Philharmonic Committee has  chosen an estate in the Pasadena area and assigned about 30 interior or  landscape designers to design specific areas of the house and grounds.  Thirty-eight designers are involved this year.  </P> <P> Viewing is on a reserved-ticket basis only, according to Susan Clayton of the  sponsoring Pasadena Junior Philharmonic Committee. Proceeds benefit the  orchestra and youth music appreciation and education programs in the San  Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> This year marks the second time the reserved-ticket system has been used.  </P> <P> Benefit chairman Shirley Goldsmith and her committee have chosen Baltimore  Blue, Cranberry Red, Empire Green, Old Virginia Gold and Independence Ivory as  this year's color pallette for the American Federalist interior.  </P> <P> Tickets ($10 through April 22, $15 after that date and at the door) may be  obtained through Ticketmaster at May Co. or Music Plus stores; visitors can  obtain information on the ticket system and parking arrangements by calling  (818) 792-4661.  </P> <P> The house will be closed Mondays and Tuesdays. It will be open 10 a.m. to 8  p.m. Wednesdays through Fridays and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays.  </P></p>

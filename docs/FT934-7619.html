			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Clinton hails Nafta vote by Congress - US now has 'economic, political and moral standing' to push for conclusion to Uruguay Round A JUBILANT President Bill Clinton flew off to his Asian summit in Seattle yesterday on the wings of a famous victory in Congress and promising new initiatives to liberalise word trade. Approval on Wednesday night by the House of Representatives of the North American Free Trade Agreement was, he declared on the White House lawn, 'a long step in the right direction' of more open markets and more vigorous international competition. The Nafta vote gave the US 'the economic, political and moral standing' to make its case, he said, not only with the Asian leaders but also in the final push successfully to conclude a new Uruguay Round of global trading talks. Vital Gatt talks are to be held next week in Washington between Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner. The US Senate is expected to approve Nafta next week, as is its Mexican counterpart. Mr Clinton said President Salinas had invited Vice President Al Gore for the Mexican side of the ratification process. The new trading bloc, which also includes Canada, is to take effect on January 1. The House victory, on a vote of 234-200, was far more comfortable than had appeared likely even as the House debated the agreement until late in the evening. The majority was composed of 132 of the 175 Republicans and 102 of the 258 Democrats, with the sole independent voting against. Before he went to bed, Mr Clinton signed letters of thanks to all who had voted in favour and hoped that the bipartisan spirit that had carried the day could be applied to other great upcoming issues, such as health care reform. But the president also went to great lengths to compliment the opposition and to heal the open wounds in his own Democratic Party, especially with organised labour. He promised new initiatives on education and worker retraining, while Mr Gore said the administration was 'uncomfortable in being in disagreement with the folks we normally fight along with, side by side.' Trade union leaders, however, were unmollified. The full hierarchy of the AFL-CIO, the umbrella union organisation, held a press conference to regret Nafta's passage. 'It has little to do with the national interest,' said Mr Lane Kirkland, AFL-CIO president, but was 'a secure means of escape' from US laws for US and multinational corporations. Mr Bill Bywater, head of the electricians, warned those Democrats who voted in favour: 'We're gonna make sure we get even at the polls.' Mr Owen Bieber, of the car workers, said Senate votes next week would be duly noticed, too. Mr Ross Perot, a loser in the Nafta debate, also threatened retaliation by his independent movement. Mr Jim Jontz, director of the Citizens' Trade Campaign against Nafta, promised similar scrutiny of a Uruguay Round agreement. 'I feel we already won because clearly Nafta could not be sold on its merits and the president had to start dealing to get votes.' Republican leaders were generally pleased with the co-operation with the White House over an accord first negotiated by President Bush. Several said Nafta would have failed without overwhelming Republican support and that, therefore, the party could no longer be accused of perpetuating 'gridlock' in Washington. But a Congress staff member predicted 'serious disagreements' with Mr Clinton on health care and spending cuts. Another one under his belt, Page 25; Lex, Page 26</p>

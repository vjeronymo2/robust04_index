			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 13 May (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Deputy Ramiro  Barrenechea, of the Pachacuti Axis Movement, has said that the  supreme decree authorizing the industrialization of coca leaves  is further evidence of the government's inopportune actions, as  it breaks all existing laws by penalizing the use of this  product.    He added critically that "this decree proves that the only  thing the government wanted in the negotiations (with the COB  [Bolivian Labor Federation]) was to delay the resolution of this  central problem. It is a deliberate lie, because when the  lifting of the highway blockade was conditioned on the issuance  of the decree, it was said that the text of the decree would be  the one that was drawn up with the peasants, who honestly and  loyally lifted the blockade. The peasants believed the  government's word, but the government has now done exactly the  opposite."    He added that this decree penalizes coca leaves and goes far  beyond Law 1008, because while this law made no provisions on  the subject, such provisions have now been made. We can see  that the agreement that was reached with the peasants was  ignored, based on a decision by the U.S. Embassy which said that  it would not permit implementation of a different policy for  coca, and this is what we are now seeing.    He said that "this is an unbelievable provocation, because  the government could have said this before. Instead, it has  deceived peasants with a decree that despite enforcing the  regulations that were agreed upon, has also penalized coca."    To justify his assertion, Barrenechea mentioned Article 2 of  the decree, which reads: "The regulations approved by this  decree apply to legal coca, and do not entail the legalization  of coca. Specific quantities of coca leaves should be  industrialized in the traditional zones that are described in  Article 9 of Law 1008."    The government should have been more sincere, and should  have  said that it did not need to debate with peasants, as there is  an order that must be fulfilled no matter the agreements we may  have reached, Barrenechea said.    He added: "This decree will probably cause a wave of  unbridled reactions by peasants, because maintaining that a  government position can be negotiated is very different from  accepting a proposal, finding consensus on it, and then doing  exactly the opposite. It is like a hidden dagger carried by  those who are not sure even of their own program."</p>

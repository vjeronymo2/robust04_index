			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It should be noted that the guidance provided in &sect;658.3(c), as amended by this rule, regarding the providing of federal assistance to convert farmland clearly applies beyond situations where a federal agency has been requested to provide assistance. Federal activities that are the result of federal initiatives, rather than requests for federal assistance, necessarily involve the same farmland protection policy considerations. In a situation where a Federal agency is contemplating an action that would convert farmland to a nonagricultural use and which is not the result of a direct request for federal assistance, the federal agency may decide, after conducting the analysis required by the FPPA, not to proceed with the action in order to achieve the objectives of the FPPA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of the policy objectives of the FPPA in the manner discussed above and as contained in this final rule not only respects the traditional deference to state and local land use decisionmaking reflected in the FPPA, but also comports with and furthers the principles of federalism contained in Executive Order No. 12612 of October 26, 1987, 52 FR 41685. Local zoning and land use plans will be considered in determining if a site has been committed to urban development. Further, a federal agency may support state and local efforts to protect farmland by deciding not to provide federal assistance that would be used to convert farmland. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The wording of &sect;658.3(c) has been slightly modified from that of the proposed rule to clarify that any agency policies or procedures for implementing the Act may be considered by an agency in deciding how to proceed with an activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Additional Considerations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some federal agencies raised concerns as to actions subject to the Act. The current regulation, at &sect;658.2(c), provides an exemption for federal permitting, licensing, or rate approval programs. Federal regulatory activities are not considered as federal assistance that could convert farmland. Therefore, federal regulatory activities are exempted from the Act. For example, in cases where a Clean Water Act section 404 permittee is required by the Corps of Engineers to perform compensatory mitigation on farmed wetland, thereby converting the wetland actual or potential use of farmland to a nonagricultural use, that conversion is not subject to FPPA. In complying with &sect;658.7 (a) and (b), Federal agencies may identify those programs that they determine are not subject to the Act and provide details on how other programs will be implemented consistent with the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As further clarification, it should be noted that only those actions that will or could convert farmland to nonagricultural uses are subject to the Act. Assistance provided to purchase, maintain, renovate, or replace a structure that already exists is not subject to the Act, because any conversion of farmland took place at the time the structure was constructed. The addition of minor new ancillary structures, such as garages or sheds, to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> serve  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> existing structures is also not included under the Act. Even in cases where loans are made for new houses, that action is not subject to the FPPA if the request for assistance and commitment by the federal agency was made after the house was constructed. Likewise, once one Federal agency has performed an analysis under the FPPA for the conversion of a site, that agency's or a second Federal agency's determination with regard to additional assistance or actions on the same site do not require additional, redundant FPPA analysis. Section 658.4(h) is being added to the final rule to reflect this clarification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Ecuador (6): Bold steps taken to open the doors to trade ECUADOREANS have long been terrified of the prospect of opening up their economy to international competition. It was widely assumed that a small predominantly agricultural economy of 11m people with a small, presumably inefficient group of import substitution industries would fare badly if the borders were opened. The new government of President Sixto Duran Ballen has, however, taken a bolder approach following the example of Mexico, which through the North American Free Trade Agreement is trying to tie itself to the economic giant to its north. The speed with which the government has acted on this has been impressive in a country where the bureaucracy traditionally moves slowly. The initial moves have been with its neighbours. In October, tariffs between Ecuador, Colombia and Bolivia were abolished and Venezuela is scheduled to join the free-trade zone in January. This is in spite of problems within the Andean Pact - the recently revived trade grouping which brings Ecuador together with Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and Venezuela. Problems arose partly because of the breakdown of diplomatic relations between Venezuela and Peru due to the suspension in April of the constitution by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori. From the Ecuadorean perspective, the pact improves Ecuador's negotiating position. According to government officials, a priority is Chile, a country with which trade has traditionally been light. While the two economies are not seen as natural partners, they are said to complement one another. Another reason to move ahead with the lifting of trade barriers was the level of illicit cross-border trade that is already taking place. Official figures suggest Ecuador's exports to Colombia in 1991 were Dollars 31.9m, about 2 per cent of total non-petroleum exports, and imports of Dollars 94.5m. Yet smuggling is so widespread, the actual trade may be as much as four times higher.</p>

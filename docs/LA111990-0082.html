			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BOWL CONFIRMS ITS INTEREST IN AZTECS;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: INDEPENDENCE BOWL OFFICIAL SAYS, HOWEVER, THAT 'SOME PEOPLE  HAVE TO FALL ON THEIR FACES' FOR SAN DIEGO STATE TO WIN AN INVITATION.  </P> <P> An Independence Bowl official confirmed Sunday that San Diego State is one of  several teams being considered for the Dec. 15 game in Shreveport, La., but he  cautioned that the possibility of the Aztecs being selected is remote.  </P> <P> "I would say, right now, some people have to fall on their faces before (SDSU)  gets here," said Cecil Lloyd, President of the Shreveport Sports Foundation,  the governing body of the Independence Bowl. "They would add some color to the  game, but it's an outside possibility."  </P> <P> Lloyd said there are at least five teams other than the Aztecs (5-4) under  consideration to play a Southwest Conference team, most likely Baylor (6-3-1):  South Carolina (5-5), North Carolina (6-4-1), Temple (6-4), Louisiana Tech  (8-3) and Maryland (6-5), which sneaked into the picture after Saturday's 35-30  upset of Virginia.  </P> <P> According to NCAA rules, official bids cannot be tendered before Nov. 24. The  Independence Bowl Selection Committee met Sunday night in Shreveport and will  meet again tonight. They have not yet decided whom they will scout Saturday,  although Lloyd said nobody will be in San Diego for the SDSU-Texas El Paso  game.  </P> <P> "Limited funds," Lloyd said.  </P> <P> The committee has seen every team mentioned play except for SDSU and Maryland.  Lloyd said the committee has spoken with officials from both of those schools,  however.  </P> <P> SDSU Athletic Director Fred Miller was in contact with committee members via  telephone Sunday.  </P> <P> "We presented our case," Miller said. "I think at this point, everybody is  holding their cards in. They have some options, and some limitations, too.  </P> <P> "I think they're interested in us. All I can do is take them at face value."  </P> <P> Although Independence officials will not publicly acknowledge their top  choices, SDSU seems to be facing long odds:  </P> <P>  -- Louisiana Tech battled Auburn before losing, 16-14, has the best record of  the bunch and is the hometown favorite. The school is only 70 miles from  Shreveport.  </P> <P>  -- Temple would give the Independence Bowl good play in the East Coast media,  something that the committee would like. Plus, Temple told the committee it  thinks it can get alumnus Bill Cosby to Shreveport for the game, which would  enliven festivities.  </P> <P>  -- North Carolina and Maryland are both from the high-profile Atlantic Coast  Conference, which is attractive to the bowl. North Carolina has indicated a  possible problem with final exams, although schools have been known to work  around that.  </P> <P>  -- South Carolina has a large following that likely will buy tickets and boost  the local economy. As bowl officials put it, the Gamecocks travel well.  </P> <P> "The con part about San Diego State is they would not bring many people," Lloyd  said. "The pro is they have some real good athletes on their team. A couple  have a chance to get national recognition."  </P> <P> Miller initially piqued Independence Bowl interest in SDSU early last week with  a telephone call after Louisville decided to play in the Fiesta Bowl.  Louisville's announcement caused a series of moves, including Southern  Mississippi's decision to play in the All-American Bowl -- which sent the  Independence Bowl scrambling. Southern Mississippi had tentatively agreed to  play in the Independence Bowl.  </P> <P> "I'll tell you what, this is the worst year I've ever seen as far as bowl  selections," said Lloyd, who has been associated with the Independence Bowl for  15 years. "Look at Virginia, and Notre Dame (both losing Saturday). It's  absolutely wild."  </P> <P> Western Athletic Conference Commissioner Joe Kearney, like Miller, has also  made a few calls to the Independence Bowl attempting to sell SDSU.  </P> <P> "We do that every year for our teams, try to get them placed," Kearney said.  "First of all, with (Dan) McGwire at the helm, the (Independence Bowl) would be  able to showcase an exciting offense. That's one thing I've been telling them."  </P> <P> The way it now stands, at least four WAC teams will participate in bowls:  Brigham Young (Holiday), Air Force (Liberty), Wyoming (Copper) and Colorado  State (Freedom).  </P> <P> With a victory Saturday against Texas El Paso, the Aztecs (5-4) will clinch a  winning season. That's what is on Coach Al Luginbill's mind this week, although  any bowl game excites him.  </P> <P> "Geez, to have a chance . . . even if it's an outside chance," Luginbill said.  "Who knows? I think we would be a very attractive draw."  </P> <P> One reason, Luginbill said, is because he thinks the Aztecs could produce high  television ratings.  </P> <P> "An audience is not going to leave a TV game with us on it, I'll tell you  that," he said. "We'll do something to keep them there."  </P> <P> The Independence Bowl is played in city-owned Independence Stadium, which seats  50,000-plus. The payout to each team is $600,000.  </P> <P> "As long as the crack is in the door, we'll keep pounding away," Miller said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aztec Notes  </P> <P> Quarterback Dan McGwire set an SDSU record in Saturday's 40-34 victory over New  Mexico by producing 528 yards of total offense. He surpassed Dennis Shaw, who  held the old record with 526. . . . Free safety Damon Pieri severely bruised a  hand Saturday, but Coach Al Luginbill said he doesn't think Pieri will miss any  practice time. Linebacker Andy Coviello, who suffered a bruised back in  practice last week, was sore but OK Sunday after starting Saturday. "I thought  he showed some mental toughness," Luginbill said. Otherwise, the Aztecs are  healthy.  </P></p>

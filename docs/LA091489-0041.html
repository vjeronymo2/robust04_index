			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUCKY ELDERLY MARK BIRTHDAY OF SUBSIDIZED APARTMENTS  </P> <P> Ten years ago, Casa de la Paloma became Glendale's first subsidized housing  project. The nine-story apartment complex, with its manicured front lawn, red  facade and colorful interiors, opened its doors Aug. 20, 1979, to about 200  low-income senior citizens.  </P> <P> Many of the original residents were on hand Monday to celebrate the birthday  and show off their home -- some of the most sought-after living quarters in the  city.  </P> <P> "I was just one of the lucky ones," said Blanche Combs, 87, who moved into the  building when it opened. Casa de la Paloma on Kenwood Street is the largest of  the two federally subsidized apartment buildings in the city, where senior  citizens accounted for 22% of the population in the last census.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Based on Income  </P> <P> Southern California Presbyterian Homes developed the 167-unit apartment complex  and operates it under a contract with the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development. Tenants are required to contribute 30% of their income toward  rent.  </P> <P> Thousands of Glendale senior citizens, most of them on fixed incomes, have been  on waiting lists for subsidized housing units for years. Glendale Community  Development Director Madlyn Blake estimated that there are 4,000 elderly  Glendale residents living below the poverty level. There are more than 2,000  names on the waiting list for Casa de la Paloma and the 97-unit Park Paseo, the  other federally subsidized complex, she said.  </P> <P> Cathie Gee, 86, another 10-year Casa de la Paloma resident, said she applied  for subsidized housing in 1972. A Glendale resident since 1927, Gee said she  had to leave her former apartment because "the rent was going up so much."  </P> <P> Casa de la Paloma has hardly put a dent in the needs of the low-income elderly  in Glendale, but to the select group living there, it has made a world of  difference.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gather for Party  </P> <P> Dozens of residents, friends and relatives gathered for the anniversary party  in a reception area brightened by orange walls and by sunlight pouring from  windows. They talked about everything from weekend bingo to their health and  the going wages for part-time jobs.  </P> <P> A white linen tablecloth covered the long serving table. Dorothy Nelson, 84,  served tea from a silver urn. Ann Mitchelltree, 68, ladled fruit punch out of  an ornate glass bowl. A tray of pound cake and a cup of peanuts complemented  the refreshments. The paper napkins were inscribed, "Casa de la Paloma, 10th  Anniversary," with a big number 10 taking up most of the printed surface.  </P> <P> For Sadie Howard, 88, the party was a homecoming. Confined to a wheelchair and  no longer able to care for herself without help, she had to move out of Casa de  la Paloma and into a retirement home in April.  </P> <P> "It's so nice to be back," she said. "I have loads of friends here."  </P> <P> In one corner, the Royal Vista Terrace "gang," as they call themselves -- a  group of residents from a nearby non-subsidized senior citizen housing complex  -- admired the surroundings.  </P> <P> "This building is so big," said Betta Hart, 70, who was visiting for the first  time. "It has so much to offer. . . ."  </P> <P> The proud hosts, all sporting "Casa de la Paloma charter member" silk badges,  could hardly stop smiling as the visitors reminded them of their good luck.  </P></p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Serbia's vote THE PROBABLE victory of the hard-line Mr Slobodan Milosevic in the Serbian presidential election must be seen as a severe setback for efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Though the latest figures which give Mr Milosevic nearly 56 per cent of the vote, are based on only a partial count of last Sunday's poll, it is most unlikely that his moderate opponent, Mr Milan Panic, with 34 per cent, will be able to close the gap. By western standards, the conditions under which the elections were held were far from satisfactory. The election broadcasts of the state-owned Serbian TV were heavily biased in favour of Mr Milosevic and the large group of international observers reported numerous irregularities in electoral registration and voting procedures. Yet they do not appear to have been serious enough for Mr Panic's demand that the elections be annulled and another poll held within 90 days to stand much chance of success. In the circumstances, Mr Panic, a Yugoslav-born American multi-millionaire, did well to poll more than a third of the votes. His appeal lay in his promises to end the fighting and Serbia's international isolation. But the unpleasant fact the international community now has to face is that the Serbian people have preferred to be represented by a xenophopic leader determined to promote their national interests by whatever means necessary. The presidential election results have been made worse by the marked swing to the right in the separate parliamentary poll. The success of the extreme nationalist Radical party at the expense of its allies, the Socialists (ex-communists), is a bad augury for the fate of the ethnic minorities who make up one-third of Serbia's population. The Radical party is led by Mr Vojislav Seselj, whose militia is alleged by the US to have been responsible for the murder of thousands of Moslems in northern Bosnia last spring. The future Serbian government does not, therefore, look as if it will be prepared to make the required compromises to bring the conflict in Bosnia to a peaceful end. And its ethnic cleansing policies risk igniting conflicts in other potential trouble-spots, such as Kosovo, which could spread quickly to other regions in the Balkans through the involvement of countries such as Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria and Albania. Few options remain for the international community, in the absence of direct military intervention in Bosnia, which has been ruled out by the great majority of nations. However, that position is looking less tenable by the day. Stricter sanctions alone have failed to have the desired effect and it is difficult to see how the proposed cut in all international communications or the enforcement of a 'no fly' zone over Bosnia will bring Serbia round.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Turmoil in the Uni Storebrand boardroom - The Norwegian insurer's shareholders are seeking a shift in power The top echelons of Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurer, have been in turmoil recently with the departure of the company's president and chief executive and the board tendering its resignation. Now some of its biggest shareholders, frustrated at the lack of progress at the company, are intent on forcing a power shift within the company. Disgruntled shareholders are campaigning for power within the company to be transferred to the board from the executive administration where it has languished under the leadership of Mr Jan Erik Langangen, who resigned last Sunday. Mr Langangen's surprise departure came amid sharp criticism by shareholders from whom he had failed to win unconditional backing for a capital expansion of between NKr1.5bn (Dollars 258.6m) to NKr2bn being planned for the autumn. The capital expansion will enable Uni to meet international capital adequacy requirements while giving the company 'breathing space' over the next year to dispose of a NKr4.7bn, 28.3 per cent shareholding in Skandia Forsakrings, the big Swedish insurer. This stake was a key part of his strategy to create a pan-Nordic insurance alliance. Shareholders' disillusion has grown in recent months over Mr Langangen's failure to create this alliance and the fruitless, hostile raid on Skandia. The Skandia acquisition, they maintain, was a waste of resources on a miscalculated risk which gave the company no influence over the Swedish insurer whose strict rules limit voting rights. In addition Skandia's powerful leader, Mr Bjoern Wolrath, has stymied the prospect of Mr Langangen making his vision a reality. Shareholders were also disappointed at the progress Mr Langangen had made in the company following a merger two years ago between Uni Forsikring and Storebrand, out of which the group was created. They have seen Uni's Skandia investment plunge in value by an estimated NKr2.5bn as Uni's share price tumbled to NKr25 from NKr50, stifling its prospects for raising new capital. Dissenting shareholders have demanded the resignation of Uni's board as a condition for participation in that key share issue. Seeing that his freedom to continue to decide company strategy had been significantly reduced, Mr Langangen withdrew as the board tendered its resignation. Uni's board appointed Mr Per Terje Vold, deputy managing director of the group's life assurance company, as Mr Langangen's successor, but there are also questions over his future. His experience in the industry is limited to four years in the company although, to his credit, he was responsible for the successful clean-up operation in 1989 of Storebrand Finans, Storebrand's finance unit, which had plunged into deep losses. But there are also differences among the dissenting shareholders, of which Mr Vold's future as a president is only one element. Replacing all or part of the board is another, and so is whether to replace senior executive staff, loyal to Mr Langangen. Mr Thorleif Borge, Uni's board chairman, will be forced out of his post, but he could remain a board member since he represents the interests of the Uni Foundation, Uni's biggest shareholder with a 26.6 per cent stake. The shareholders' strongest candidate to replace Mr Borge is Mr Torvild Aakvaag, chairman of the board of Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest stock listed company, and a current member of Uni's board. 'Mr Aakvaag is an experienced industrial leader who could restore credibility to Uni Storebrand,' one shareholder believes. It is also widely expected that Norsk Hydro will make a hefty contribution to Uni's capital expansion. Shareholders want a change of the board. 'With the existing board chairman being the former chief executive of Uni (Forsikring), it is clear the power of the administration of the merged company had grown too strong,' one shareholder said. 'I think most shareholders will see to it that Uni gets the capital it needs, but major changes to the board will have to be made,' he said. Four out of Uni's top 10 shareholders are foreign interests, although there is no foreign board member. The appointment of Uni Storebrand's new board is expected to be announced on August 10. The board will then have to decide the fate of the company's interim president and senior executive management. Details of the planned September share issue will also have to be finalised and a strategy for the disposal of the Skandia shareholding agreed. The new board will also make clear the business priorities which Uni's management will have to pursue. There is little doubt that improving efficiency of the group since the merger will be a top priority.</p>

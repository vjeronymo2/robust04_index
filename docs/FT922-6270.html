			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Israel hits Lebanese villages ISRAELI aircraft bombed Lebanese territory yesterday for the fifth time in as many days, killing two small girls and their parents and wounding six other people. The raids were on Shia Moslem villages dominated by the pro-Iranian Hizbollah militia. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir vowed Israel would continue to hit Hizbollah targets until guerrillas halted attacks on Israel's self-declared border security zone in Lebanon. The latest violence has raised speculation that Israel might launch a 'limited war' against Syria, which has 35,000 troops in Lebanon and is accused by Israel of arming and supporting Hizbollah. Syria accused Israel of trying to kill the Mideast peace talks. About 14,000 people have abandoned homes in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley for fear of Israeli attacks.</p>

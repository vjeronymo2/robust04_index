			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (MENA)--AL-AHRAM newspaper says that  developments in the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue indicate the  failure of the U.S. plan to increase pressure on the Serbs by  normalizing relations between the Muslims and Croats and pushing  them into a confederation which the Serbs would later be  compelled to join.    In today's editorial, the paper notes that since an  agreement  was signed between the Muslims and Croats in Washington in  March, fighting between the Muslims and Serbs has intensified,  and it seems obvious that NATO's ability to intervene militarily  against the Bosnian Serbs has limitations.    The paper says the Russian Federation foiled the first  ultimatum by deploying its forces on the hills above Sarajevo,  while the Serbs foiled the second ultimatum by signing an accord  with the United Nations on a withdrawal from Gorazde. Before  they withdrew, however, they burned most of the city.    The paper concludes that it is necessary for the  international community, represented by the United Nations and  the European Union, to agree on a formula acceptable to the  three parties by which they will return to the negotiating table  in order to produce a cease-fire and then unconditionally  discuss solutions.    The newspaper expresses its belief that the arena must not  be  left for the United States to use as a guinea pig to test its  relations with the Russian Federation.</p>

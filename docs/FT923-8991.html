			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Kalon to increase Manders bid KALON, the paint group involved in a hostile bid for its rival, Manders, will today announce terms of an increased and final offer. At yesterday's closing prices a new cash and shares offer values Manders at Pounds 88.9m, up from Pounds 82.3m under the previous all-share offer. Kalon is offering 17 of its shares for each six of Manders against 8-for-3 previously but is introducing a cash alternative of seven of its shares plus 150p for each three Manders. The new all-share offer equals 260.7p per Manders share and the cash alternative is worth 264.7p. Manders' and Kalon's shares closed unchanged at 244p and 92p respectively. The offer closes on August 24. Analysts had been expecting Kalon to improve its offer and give a partial cash alternative to try to clinch the closely-fought bid. But the improvement was smaller than some had hoped.</p>

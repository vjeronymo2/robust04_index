			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Major orders probe into rules for public life Mr John Major ordered a sweeping investigation into standards in public life yesterday after the mounting allegations of sleaze in his government forced the second ministerial resignation within a week. During a day of high drama at Westminster, Mr Neil Hamilton, the industry minister named last week as the recipient of hospitality from the Harrods owner Mr Mohamed Fayed, was forced by Mr Major to quit the government. But Mr Major's attempt to regain the initiative failed to dispel the political controversy engulfing his government and brought charges from Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, that he was in the thrall of events outside of his control. In a bitter resignation letter to the prime minister Mr Hamilton left no doubt that he had left the government unwillingly. He said: 'I think it is sad and deeply disturbing that I have been forced to leave office because of foully motivated rumour and a media witch hunt.' Mr Hamilton's dismissal also provoked unconcealed rage among his supporters on the Tory right. They accused Mr Major of caving in to media pressure. Despite an expression of support for the government in his resignation letter, his friends said Mr Hamilton would prove a dangerous enemy on the backbenches. Mr Major said that, while he accepted the allegations were unsubstantiated, as prime minister 'I must be concerned at the general perception of the government and the capacity of ministers to carry out their work without damaging distractions'. The resignation came 90 minutes before Mr Major told MPs he had set up an independent commission chaired by Lord Nolan, a leading judge, to review fundamentally the rules applying to holders of public office. Ministers, MPs, civil servants, council members and officers, and appointees to quangos will all be subject to a review of their financial arrangements and commercial relationships. Mr Major told the Commons that he considered Mr Hamilton, who has insisted throughout that he is innocent of any impropriety, was no longer able effectively to carry out his ministerial duties. Earlier Mr Hamilton had expressed regret that he had not declared details of a free stay at the Ritz, the Paris hotel owned by Mr Fayed, in the Commons registry of members' interests. Last week Mr Tim Smith, a junior minister at the Northern Ireland office, was forced to leave the government after admitting accepting payment from Mr Fayed to table questions in the House of Commons. The prime minister disclosed that fresh, unspecified allegations had been levelled at Mr Hamilton since the completion yesterday of an investigation by Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, into the charges made by Mr Fayed. Downing Street refused to comment on the new allegations, which were presented to Mr Hamilton during a meeting with Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, in the presence of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. However Tory party managers said they did not relate to Mr Fayed. Mr Major was said also to have been furious at a statement released by Mr Hamilton comparing his dilemma with that faced two years ago by the prime minister over false allegations about an extra-marital affair. Amid an astonishing series of charges and counter-charges between Mr Fayed and the government, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, acknowledged that he had been one of the subjects of the investigation carried out by Sir Robin. Mr Howard said Sir Robin's report made clear he had committed no impropriety. He said: 'I have never been guilty of any impropriety in the conduct of any of my responsibilities as a minister or member of parliament.' The report, however, did little to suppress Westminster rumours about the past links of other Conservatives with Mr Fayed. It said that other ministers had been questioned as a result of the allegations first passed to Mr Major three weeks ago. Sir Robin concludes that the allegations were either 'demonstrably false' or 'so far as I have been able to establish are entirely unsubstantiated'. Mr Major was attacked by Mr Blair for insisting that investigations by the Commons privileges committee be held in private. Mr Blair accused the prime minister of using the wider investigation to 'sweep from public view' charges against individual MPs government members.

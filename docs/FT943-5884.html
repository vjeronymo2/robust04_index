			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Philip Morris in Dollars 6bn buy-back Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, is launching one of the biggest share buy-backs ever mounted in the US. The group's board yesterday authorised the management to repurchase and cancel up to Dollars 6bn of the company's shares over the next three years. It also voted to increase the dividend by 19.6 per cent, to 82.5 cents from 69 cents a share in the previous quarter The moves sent Philip Morris shares leaping yesterday by Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 61 - their highest level in more than a year. Philip Morris prepared the ground for yesterday's moves in May after Mr Michael Miles, the then chairman and chief executive, fell out with the board over his support for a plan to hive off the group's tobacco operations into a separate entity. The idea was to lift the group's share price by relieving the company of its controversial cigarette-making activities. But Mr Miles' successors - Mr William Murray, chairman, and Mr Geoffrey Bible, chief executive - ruled out a split, promising other methods of lifting the share price. Stock repurchase programmes tend to increase a company's share price because they reduce the amount of shares in issue, so increasing earnings per share. They are widely used by US companies with cash to spare as a means of delivering value to shareholders. Philip Morris's cigarette-making operations produce particularly large amounts of cash. According to Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, the group as a whole last year generated about Dollars 3bn in free cash flow - that is, cash left over after paying for capital expenditure and dividends. The stock repurchases announced yesterday, if fully exercised, would cost Dollars 2bn a year, and the increase in the quarterly dividend would cost Dollars 576m a year if sustained for the full year. This suggests that Philip Morris should have little difficulty in funding its new commitments from existing cash resources. The stock repurchase plan is the latest of a series of buy-backs mounted by Philip Morris. In November 1991 it authorised a Dollars 2bn buy-back and in May 1992 it authorised a further Dollars 3bn worth of repurchases.</p>

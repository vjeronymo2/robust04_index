			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Painful adjustments: The chancellor's dilemma - an inside view Why have we, as a nation, chosen to borrow so much? Why are we living beyond our means by about 3 per cent of our national in-come? There is a simple explanation. In the 1980s our spending habits were based on a national income boosted by oil revenues. In 1986 the value of the oil rents halved when the oil price fell. Revenue has subsequently fallen further as oil output has declined. We have failed to adjust our spending to that loss of income. Our balance of payments went into deficit in the late 1980s and has been in deficit ever since. The economic adjustments required by the arrival and departure of North Sea oil are complex. When the oil revenues first arrived the resulting balance of payments surplus, and optimism about its future, drove up the exchange rate. Manufacturing industry shrank in consequence, and we had a national debate about the perils of industrial decline. What will happen, people asked, when the oil runs out, and we haven't enough capacity to export manufactures instead? The answer, obvious to many economists but received with scepticism by businessmen, is that if a high exchange rate can cause manufacturing industry to shrink, a low one can cause it to expand. As the oil revenues dwindle, the exchange rate will fall, and manufacturing industry will expand again. Until 1986, when Britain had a large and growing unearned income from its oil rents, we all enjoyed extra spending power which came to us in two ways: the government's oil revenues allowed it to hold taxes lower than would otherwise have been the case, while the high exchange rate made imports cheaper. So we could afford to import goods previously made here and use the domestic resources thus freed to improve living standards by providing more services. That is what has happened in every country or region that has benefited from a mineral discovery. It was not a coincidence that thousands of new restaurants opened in the UK in the 1980s while local industries went to the wall. The same has happened after every gold rush in history. But when the mineral boom is over and the rents start to dwindle, the supply side of the economy needs to readjust. More goods and services have to be produced for sale abroad. The only way of achieving that is via a fall in the exchange rate, which shifts resources previously producing goods for domestic consumption into the export sector. In the UK case, as we shall see, that probably means shifting resources out of the service sector and back into manufacturing ind-ustry. In other words, the loss of the oil revenues means a reduction in our standard of living. And that comes about in two ways: a lower exchange rate makes imports more expensive, and higher taxes reduce disposable incomes. I have no doubt that economic historians will see the fall in the exchange rate last September after sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism and the subsequent increases in taxes as part of an inevitable adjustment process to the loss of the North Sea revenues. The only puzzle in this neat story is why we had to wait until 1992-93 before adjusting to a fall in the oil price which took place as long ago as 1986. In fact the exchange rate did fall in 1986. But the fall was quickly reversed by the boom of the late 1980s which generated worldwide interest in what was briefly dubbed the British miracle. Mrs Margaret Thatcher (as she then was) won a third term of office, taxes were cut, growth accelerated, and international companies stampeded to invest in the UK. The inflow of capital drove up the exchange rate and stopped in its tracks the adjustment to lower oil prices that was just starting. It also made any adjustment unnecessary - for a while. Lower oil revenues meant that, sooner or later, the UK consumer would have to retrench. But the evil day could be put off as long as foreigners were willing to lend. So in the late 1980s, far from cutting back in response to the fall in the oil price, we embarked on a spending spree. Much of that extra spending was on imports, not paid for by oil revenues but by borrowing. It didn't matter, because UK plc was flavour of the month, and ev-eryone wanted to lend to us. The boom of the late 1980s was a service sector boom. Business investment increased sharply, but casual observation suggests that much of that investment took the form of new office blocks, shopping malls and DIY superstores. The statistics confirm the evidence of our eyes: 95 per cent of the increase in investment between 1985 and 1991 was in the service sector, and nearly half went into the City. The extra investment improved living standards - but did it enhance Britain's ability to earn its way in the world? In theory there is no reason why we should not do that by exporting services. An improvement in Britain's balance of trade does not have to come from manufacturing. In practice however, despite the massive investment of the late 1980s in services, the export of services actually fell slightly as a share of gross domestic product. I conclude that the adjustment to a world of lower oil revenues will require a shift of resources out of services and into manufacturing. That adjustment has already begun, because the recession has been worst in the south, where services predominate, while the manufacturing north has escaped relatively lightly. The priority now is to ensure that the resources freed up by recession are absorbed again by manufacturing (or other industries whose output can be sold abroad and/or replace imports). They must not be pre-empted, as happened in the late 1980s, by another domestic service sector boom. It was Winston Churchill, as chancellor, who said (of the return to gold in 1925): 'I would rather see finance less proud and industry more content.' The fall in the exchange rate last September (analogous in many ways to coming off gold in 1931) achieves exactly that. It is the key to the expansion of manufacturing, which is why we have seen a rise in output this year despite flat retail sales. One aim of monetary policy must now be to ensure that the competitive advantage delivered by Black Wednesday remains intact. If that means lower interest rates, then an increase in taxes (or cut in public spending) will be all the more necessary to curb the resulting growth in domestic demand. Low interest rates and higher taxes: that is how to ease our economic adjustment to dwindling oil revenues.

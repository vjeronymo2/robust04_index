			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Thai banks report large gains in earnings THAI banks, profiting from increased spreads between their cost of funds and returns on lending, have reported sharply higher earnings in the first half of 1992. Net profits for Bangkok Bank, the country's largest, rose 45 per cent in the first six months to Bt4.86bn (Dollars 192m) from Bt3.36bn in the same period last year. Total income was Bt37.53bn, against Bt37.25bn while interest expenses fell to Bt21.76bn from Bt25.23bn, and operating expenses rose to Bt8.47bn from Bt6.76bn. Earnings per share rose to Bt4.86 from Bt4.2. The biggest half-year increase so far was at Krung Thai Bank, whose net profits jumped 123 per cent to Bt1.12bn from Bt502m. Earnings per share rose to Bt8.3 from Bt5.2. Thai Military Bank (TMB), the subject of a half-hearted boycott campaign following the killing of more than 50 pro-democracy demonstrators in May because it is one-third owned by the armed forces, reported a 60 per cent rise in net profits to Bt757m from Bt473m, with earnings per share up to Bt22.79 from Bt16.32. TMB is expanding in the region and is planning to double its share capital to Bt7bn to support new ventures in China, Indochina, Burma and the US. Siam Commercial Bank's net profits rose 64 per cent to Bt1.92bn in the first half from Bt1.17 and earnings per share increased 26 per cent to Bt50.5 against Bt40.3. Thai Farmers Bank, whose aggressive pursuit of market share has worried some investors, reported a rise in net profits of more than 50 per cent to Bt2.39bn from Bt1.57bn, while earnings per share rose 16 per cent to Bt34.08 from Bt31.47. Bank of Ayudhya's net profit rose 48 per cent to Bt1.16bn from Bt784m, with earnings per share up 11 per cent to Bt2.91 from Bt2.61.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Euro Disney chief tries to calm market Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chairman of Euro Disney, the embattled leisure group, yesterday sought to squash speculation about the company's performance after further erratic trading in its shares. Euro Disney's shares, which fell sharply on Friday and Monday, began the day by plummeting in Paris to a record low of FFr7.55 from FFr8.40 at the previous day's close. The shares, have been affected by concern about Euro Disney's prospects and about the future of Walt Disney, its US parent company. Shares were suspended four times during the day before closing 8.33 per cent up on the day at FFr9.10. Mr Bourguignon, who on Monday asked Paris stock market authorities to investigate the share price moves, said on French radio that the stock's volatility was due to market sentiment. 'If observers come to certain conclusions about us, that's their problem and their responsibility,' he said. 'If it affects our share price, that's their fault.' The Euro Disney chairman declined to comment on market speculation that the EuroDisneyland theme park has been poorly attended this summer. In May, the company confirmed that visitor levels in the first five months of the year had been lower than during the same period of 1994. Analysts are braced for another hefty loss at Euro Disney for the current financial year to September 30 after last year's net deficit of FFr6.9bn. Mr Bourguignon affirmed at the time of the restructuring that the group was unlikely to come back into the black before its 1996 financial year.

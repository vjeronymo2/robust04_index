			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Arts: Oleanna - Theatre The advance publicity was misleading; David Mamet's Oleanna is a much more subtle, cerebral play than you may have been encouraged to believe. To dispense with the title first: Oleanna is simply the name of an American folk song (Ole Anna), played once as the piece opens and never again. Then we get down to business. The subject is not primarily sexual harassment, though that helps to make the play topical and talked about. Nor is Oleanna even necessarily about male-female relationships, though again that provides an added thrust. Mamet's work is much more about the current pursuit of political correctness in American universities. Yet even that is an inadequate description. The real subject is witch-hunting or McCarthyism, whether from the left or the right. That has a long history in American politics, and indeed in the American theatre. To make the point starkly: Oleanna might be an even more interesting and provocative play than it is if the professor were played by a woman and the female student who accuses him of sexual harassment and elitism were played by a man. There is very little evidence in Harold Pinter's production at the Royal Court that sexual harassment takes place: perhaps a scintilla of doubt to make it teasing, not much more. The basic struggle is between liberals and illiberals. The clash between the sexes may add to the box office (and who in the theatre can quarrel with that?), but gender is immaterial to the argument. Carol, the protesting student in Oleanna could just as well be black, rich, Hispanic, Asian, male or any such combination. The same goes for the professor, John. The difference between the two of them is that the professor believes that words have a definable meaning while the student resorts to a group movement that prefers slogans. In the process Carol picks up language first used by the professor, though without the understanding. At the start she queries him for using long latinate words where shorter ones might do. By the end, to the professor's ironic amusement, she is doing the same thing herself, but cannot see the distinction between what the professor calls an accusation and what she calls a fact. If the committee of the student body on the campus says it is a fact, a fact it must be, however monstrous the distortion. The students' organisation apes the authority that runs the university. There is a similar transition in the resort to the law. At the beginning, the professor is calling a lawyer to supervise the purchase of a new house. In the devastating second act, it is the student who calls the law to allege rape. Someone, incidentally, should write a thesis on the use of the telephone in contemporary theatre: it must have cost thousands of actors' jobs as there is no need to pay an unheard voice. This is a marvellous play that could only have been written by someone with a deep understanding of linguistics. But it is more than word play. Oleanna contains a serious discourse on the value of higher education. Is it a right owed to every student, whether they are capable of appreciating it or not? Does more perhaps mean worse? Sir Kingsley Amis would love it, and there is just a touch in Oleanna of a debt to Lucky Jim. Mamet writes like an educated angel: terse, taut and to the point. Not a word in this quietly spoken production is redundant. It is ideal material for Pinter to direct: always disturbing, frequently menacing, but only at the end breaking into violence. Pinter's control is immaculate. There is a controversy about the conclusion, of which more than one version exists. The Royal Court has gone, with Mamet's agreement, for his original text which ends with the professor grovelling to political correctness rather than the more brutal finale in the script published by Methuen and played in New York. I do not think that it makes a huge difference either way. By then you can draw your own conclusions from a totally adult play, a tribute I normally reserve for Harley Granville Barker who also performed at the Court. The professor is played by David Suchet, the student by Lia Williams. Suchet catches to perfection that pedagogic, sometimes seemingly patronising manner of a man trying to be rational against the odds, struggling to find words for things that cannot be said because even language is imperfect as a means of communication. Ms Williams is quiet and fumbling to start with, as the part demands. She becomes a fury, the essence of a semi-educated sub-culture taking over. In this role she deserves a congratulatory first.

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / People: Consultant picks up the reins at Exco Richard Lacy, one of the best known figures in the global money broking business, is handing over the chief executive's reigns at Exco International to Ron Sandler, a 41-year-old management consultant. Lacy, who joined Exco in 1966 as a trainee broker and tea-maker, may be only 45 but he comes from a sector of the financial services industry where executives tend to retire before 50. A popular figure with staff, Lacy has helped keep Exco on an even keel following the collapse of its parent, the British and Commonwealth empire, in 1988. He tried to mount a management buy-out of Exco from the B&amp;C administrators in 1990, but this came to nothing and in July 1991 he handed over the chairmanship to Carel Mosselmans, a former chairman of Sedgwick group. Last summer the administrators sold 60 per cent of Exco's shares to a group of institutions and the intention is to refloat the company on the stock market. Lacy has now decided to lighten his workload and move up to be deputy chairman. Ron Sandler, Exco's new chief executive, comes from a very different background. After Cambridge and Stanford, where he got his MBA, Sandler worked first for Boston Consulting and then became managing director of the UK operations of Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, before running his own consultancy for a period. At the end of 1990, he was introduced to the money-broking world after one of his clients, Citibank, sought his help in recovering money lent to Gary Klesch's Quadrex, owners of Martin Bierbaum, another money-broker. Sandler took over as chief executive and reshaped the Bierbaum group so that it could be sold to David Hagan's Trio Investments at the end of 1992. Sandler, who takes over a business roughly twice as big as Martin Bierbaum, dismisses suggestions that he has been brought in to Exco for a similar mission. He says Exco has a good cash flow and a strong position in the three time-zones in which it operates. Meanwhile, Exco has also announced that Richard Jackson, 45, previously president of RMJ Securities, Exco's US treasury bond inter-dealer broker, has been appointed chairman of RMJ and retires from the Exco board.</p>

After the five year build-out period, the service area boundaries of the additional transmitters, as calculated by the method set forth in &sect;22.911(a), must remain within the CGSA. Licensees must notify the FCC (FCC Form 489) of any transmitters added under this section that cause a change in the CGSA boundary. The notification must include full size and reduced maps, and supporting engineering, as described in &sect;22.953(a)(5) (i) through (iii). If the addition of transmitters involves a contract service area boundary (SAB) extension (see &sect;22.912), the notification must include a statement as to whether the five year build-out period for the system on the relevant channel block in the market into which the SAB extends has elapsed, and whether the SAB extends into any unserved area in the market. The notification must be mailed or delivered to the filing place (see &sect;22.106) no later than 15 days after the addition is made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Air-ground Radiotelephone Service.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ground stations may be added to Commercial Aviation air-ground systems at previously established ground station locations, pursuant to &sect;22.859, subject to compliance with the applicable technical rules.

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Peace protesters rally in Belfast Peace demand: protesters make their message plain at a trade union-organised rally in Belfast yesterday. Thousands of Roman Catholics and Protestants gathered to demand an end to terrorist murder and intimidation of workers. It was the biggest gather-ing of its kind since the Peace Movement marches of the late 1970s. The IRA murders last month of eight Protestant construction workers in County Tyrone prompted the rally. Mr Terry Carlin of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which organised the rally, said earlier: 'This platform will represent a unique coming together of the trade union movement throughout the whole of these islands to affirm the right of workers in Northern Ireland to go to their work free from threats of murder and destruction of workplaces.' Among the speakers was Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress.</p>

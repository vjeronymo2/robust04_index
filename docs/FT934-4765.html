			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Public sector pay freeze Tuesday's Budget has set tough targets for UK public spending over the rest of the decade. More than Pounds 15bn has been lopped off general government expenditure for the next three years. The cumulative increase in spending between 1993-94 and 1998-99 will be held to less than 4 per cent, compared with a rise of almost 13 per cent in the six years from 1980-81. Mr Clarke and Mr Major are thus more ambitious in expenditure plans than Mrs Thatcher and her chancellors ever dared to be. In pursuing these targets, an important role will be played by a clampdown on public sector pay. For government departments, running costs will be held at this year's level of Pounds 20bn for the next three years. Provision for pay throughout the rest of the public sector has been set on a comparable basis. Providing it can be made to stick, this freeze is likely to make the largest contribution to the Pounds 5.7bn cut in public spending forecast for 1994-95. The approach is at the centre of the continuing attack on waste and inefficiency in the public services, according to Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary. He believes that efficiency savings of 2 to 3 per cent a year can be found throughout the public sector. Some of this can be used to increase the pay of employees, though part must be ploughed back into the service itself. Catch-up exercises This is a blunt weapon for improving the efficiency of public services. Yet it may be the only one left in the government's armoury. White-collar civil service numbers have changed little over the past 10 years. The number of local government employees is almost identical to that of 1979. And most health service managers have made little use of their greater freedom to reduce staff costs. Similar organisations in the private sector have made great improvements in efficiency in recent years, often driven by cuts in staff costs imposed during difficult times. The same approach is needed in the public sector. However, the experience of pay policies which apply only to the public sector suggests that some consequences may be less benign. If efficiency savings are not found quickly enough, pay in the public sector tends to lag behind the private sector, making it harder to attract good people into the public services and undermining standards. These pressures have then invariably led to expensive catch-up exercises to restore comparability, just at the point that private sector settlements are tailing off and so putting extra pressure on companies to match the high headline pay increases awarded to the public sector. Sensible decisions This time it may be different. The framework for greater decentralisation of public sector pay determination is now largely in place. Some local authorities and health organisations have used their greater freedom to be flexible on pay and staffing. From next April, some government departments and the larger agencies will have responsibility for the pay of their staff. And the government appears to accept that extra money may have to be made available for groups such as the police, teachers and nurses, where efficiency savings are unlikely. The introduction of accruals-based resource accounting for government departments will also give civil service managers the tools they lack to make sensible decisions about costs, resources and priorities. So too will the Treasury's relaxation of the annuality rules, which discourage managers from making savings by clawing back the money. But it must be asked whether public sector management systems are sufficiently well-developed or robust enough to meet the challenge they have been set. Enormous efficiency savings will be needed to compensate for a real fall in the pay bill of as much as 10 per cent over the next three years. The cash-limiting of running costs is an excellent discipline in reining in public service costs. But earnings in general rise faster than prices over the medium term, even in periods ministers describe as 'inflation-free'. Holding the increase in cash limits so far below the rate of inflation risks an explosion, perhaps in 1995-96, with a general election in prospect. Ministers have set the right course, but they will need to tack a little if they are to reach it.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHORTAGE OF FUNDS TO DELAY HIGHWAY PROJECTS IN STATE  </P> <P> For the first time in 15 years, state administrators have advised the  California Transportation Commission that a shortage of highway funds will  force them to begin a policy of intentionally delaying construction projects.  </P> <P> In an internal memorandum from Transportation Department Director Robert K.  Best, the commission was told to expect the first "slowdown" to come in July  and then be followed by increasingly longer delays.  </P> <P> After the July hiatus, the memo showed, the department would advertise projects  for bid in August and September and then shut down again in October and  November. By February, 1990, the memo said, all federal funds for that fiscal  year will have been spent and new projects will have to be delayed five months  until the following August.  </P> <P> "These are kind of like the foreshocks to the earthquake," said Allan Hendrix,  chief of the department's division of highways and programming.  </P> <P> Department officials had warned for months that the five-year, $14-billion  State Transportation Improvement Program faced at least a $3.5-billion deficit  because gasoline tax and other highway user fees have not kept pace with  inflation and demands for new construction. Legislative analysts later  estimated the deficit at $4.7 billion.  </P> <P> Department officials had advised lawmakers that at some point they would have  to begin juggling funds and delaying projects. The memo now provides the first  firm indication of exactly when the department expects the delays to come and  how long it expects each will last.  </P> <P> "For the past several months, the department has identified for the commission  an approaching slowdown in state highway construction, as our delivery of  projects ready for advertising outpaces the availability of funds for these  projects," Best wrote the commission. " . . . During the current federal fiscal  year, we will deliver about $600 million of projects that exceed available  funding."  </P> <P> Best said the first delay might have come as soon as this month but officials  were able to stave it off until July by "careful management of federal funds."  </P> <P> "The department is attempting to stretch its money," said Assemblyman Richard  Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee. "At some  point they are going to have to start laying off personnel and then gearing up  again. We have been building up the department based on an expectation of funds  and at some point you, don't need everybody."  </P> <P> Officials said it is too soon to name the specific projects that will be  delayed.  </P> <P> A department spokesman said some grading and paving work involved in the  construction of the Century Freeway could be subject to a short delay, but he  expects that contractors will be able to catch up quickly so the freeway could  open on schedule in 1993. The 17.3-mile Century Freeway, constructed at a cost  of $2 billion, will link the city of Norwalk with Los Angeles International  Airport.  </P> <P> Hendrix said the money problems began in the mid-1980s with the passage of  federal legislation and administrative rules that reduced the amount of federal  money that was being poured into California for highway construction. He said  state officials did not make a corresponding cutback in their planning for  construction projects because they expected the federal losses to be made up by  state funds.  </P> <P> The federal government provides 80% of the financing for most highway  construction projects, with the states expected to pay the remaining 20%.  </P> <P> When there was suddenly a shortage of state funds, Hendrix said, officials were  forced to begin delaying projects. He said the first delay will come in July  because federal funds for highway construction will be depleted in June. He  said the department will be able to advertise projects for bid in August and  September by, in effect, borrowing on anticipated federal funds which will  become available in October.  </P> <P> By October, he said the new funds will have been spent and the department will  not be able to begin advertising again until December. At that point, he said,  it can borrow against federal funds that will become available in January,  1990. He said it expects those funds to be depleted by February. More will not  be available, he said, until the following August.  </P> <P> Although actual construction will be delayed, Hendrix said, engineering and  designing will continue as if there is no shortage of funds.  </P> <P> The last time the state intentionally ordered a slowdown on highway  construction was in 1974, when state gas tax revenues "nose dived" as a result  of the Arab oil embargo, Hendrix added.  </P> <P> The plan for delaying projects came as lawmakers and private groups involved in  transportation were preparing to meet with Gov. George Deukmejian in the next  few weeks in a final effort to reach a compromise on the highway-financing  issue. At two previous transportation "summits," Deukmejian, lawmakers and  business and labor leaders agreed that an additional $20 billion will need to  be pumped into the state's transportation system in the next decade to erase  the deficit and to relieve traffic congestion.  </P> <P> Two members of Californians for Better Transportation, a nonprofit group  composed of business, labor and local government groups involved in  transportation, said Wednesday they fear that the governor may push for a  compromise that would provide only a portion of the $20 billion.  </P> <P> David Ackerman, legislative representative of the Associated General  Contractors of California, said Deukmejian had agreed that $20 billion will be  needed but insisted at the same time that any gas tax increase should be  subject to voter approval. To raise $20 billion, he said, a substantial gas tax  increase -- probably as much as 10 or 12 cents per gallon -- would be needed,  and polls show that the voters would never approve such a hike.  </P> <P> In private meetings, Ackerman said, officials in the Deukmejian Adminstration  had broached the possibility of a 5-cent gas tax increase, which some polls  show could win voter approval.  </P> <P> Jack Maltester, president of Californians for Better Transportation, said his  group, which is heavily represented at the summit meeting, could not agree to  such a plan because it would provide little more than enough money to ease the  deficit.  </P> <P> "There actually is a feeling of discouragement on the part of (Californians for  Better Transportation) that really the summit is not producing anything," he  said. " . . . If nothing comes out of the summit we're pretty well convinced  nothing is going to happen during this Administration."  </P> <P> But Kevin Brett, a spokesman for the governor, said Deukmejian is not wedded to  any specific plan, although he remains firm in his contention that any proposed  gas tax increase must be submitted to the voters.  </P> <P> "We remain confident that a consensus can be reached," he said. " . . . The  process is right on schedule. We are pleased with the momentum so far but we go  into this next meeting with our eyes fully open because we know the difficult  issues still remain. This is not a simple subject."  </P></p>

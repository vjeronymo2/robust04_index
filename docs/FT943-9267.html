			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Labour warns on shopping centres Local authorities which suffered financial loss because their objections to out-of-town shopping centres were overruled should be compensated by the government, Mr Keith Vaz, a Labour environment spokesman, urged yesterday. He called on Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, to follow up the recent policy U-turn towards keeping shops in town centres by autho-rising higher regeneration grants to areas whose once-thriving high streets had started to resemble ghost towns. Mr Vaz said a survey showed that, since 1989, 290 out-of-town developments opposed by local authorities on planning grounds had been allowed on appeal to the environment secretary. Mr Vaz said the government's U-turn had resulted in a 'lame-duck policy' which left councils footing the bill.</p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Gucci denies bid speculation GUCCI, the Italian luxury goods group best known for its shoes and accessories, may be facing a return to the shareholder differences which plunged it into difficulties in the early 1980s. However, the company, now 50 per cent controlled by Investcorp, a Bahrain-based investment bank, firmly denied reports that it was set to be taken over by the UK's acquisitive Dunhill group. A Gucci official said contacts between the two companies had been limited to meetings of middle management to discuss possible product synergies. Having survived family feuds and criminal charges in the 1980s, Gucci has run into trouble because of the recession and the need for costly restructuring. Fast expansion in the 1980s came partly at the expense of its exclusive image and, more recently, profits. Now, the company, guided by Mr Maurizio Gucci, grandson of the founder, has been rationalising its range, which had rocketed to 10,000 items, and closing outlets to project a much more exclusive identity more closely associated with its traditions in leather goods and accessories. That strategy, and recessionary markets, contributed to an 18 per cent fall in sales to L280bn (Dollars 212.9m) in 1991. The company, which has not revealed precise earnings figures, said it broke even in 1991 and hoped to return to profits this year. However, falling turnover and costly restructuring is believed to have been viewed amiss by some of Gucci's Bahrain-based shareholders. Though Investcorp has placed about 30 per cent of its holding with local funds, it retains voting rights. Growing unease with the Gucci's strategy probably explains the revival of rumours about its future.</p>

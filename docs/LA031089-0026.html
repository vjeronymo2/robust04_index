			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Johnny Carson fans can sleep better now. The longtime host of NBC's "Tonight  Show" told his TV audience Wednesday night that he'll be back for at least one  more season after this one. As Carson related it, the agreement came about  during lunch with Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment. "We talked  as we do about this time every year. He said 'What are your plans?' I said,  'Maybe we should do another year.' So we signed it and we're going to continue  for another year from September." Carson added that last year, he made "a  foolish mistake -- I said I'll do another year when it snows in Malibu . . .  and it snowed in Malibu, so here we are." In years past, Carson often has been  the subject of much will-he-or-will-he-not-stay speculation, an exercise  squelched for the time being by his announcement. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

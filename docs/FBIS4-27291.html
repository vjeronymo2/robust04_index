			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- Foreigners expressed  full support to the Korean people's cause of justice.    Jean Pierre Ngambi, general secretary of the Communist Party  of Cameroon, upon handing over to the Korean ambassador to  Cameroon on May 19 a signature paper after participating in a  signature campaign for supporting the "10-point Programme of the  Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the  Country", said Korea should be reunified through a confederacy  on the basis of the three principles of national reunification  and the "10-point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole  Nation for the Reunification of the Country" laid down by  President Kim Il-song.    To this end, he said, the concrete wall, an obstacle to the  reunification, must be dismantled and foreign interference and  nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula be removed at an early  date.    The Malaysian paper NANYANG SIANG PAU May 19 quoted the  Malaysian foreign minister as saying recently that the best way  of resolving North Korea's "nuclear issue" is negotiations  through diplomatic channels. The newspaper described as stupid  and extremely irresponsible the talk within the United States  about "possibility and desirability of a war in Korea".    Amaral Matos, first executive secretary of the Mozambican  Committee for Friendship With the People of the DPRK, in a  statement May 23 said the DPRK has advanced most reasonable,  realistic and fair reunification proposals on many occasions,  but the South Korean authorities objected to the proposals  categorically, and this shows that they have no intention for  reunification.    He stressed that the way of accelerating Korea's  reunification is for the whole nation to firmly unite under the  banner of the "10- point Programme of the Great Unity of the  Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country".</p>

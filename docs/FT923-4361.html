			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / UK airline passengers to clear US immigration in London ALL AIRLINE passengers flying to the US from London's two main airports will clear American immigration before leaving Britain following a UK-US agreement to ease border controls, the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service said at the weekend. The move, backed by the airports operator BAA and involving all scheduled airlines flying from Heathrow or Gatwick to the US, follows a separate UK commitment last week to relax border controls for European Community nationals. Under the scheme, due to be launched early next year, US officials will check passports at departure gates so that passengers will be officially 'admitted' to the US while still in London. Negotiations are continuing in London between INS officials, the Home Office and BAA to iron out any difficulties after 'pre-inspection' tests last year. BAA officials said they welcomed any move to ease congestion but were anxious to avoid importing the problems of US immigration queues to London. Minimum standards for immigration control, meanwhile, have been introduced at Heathrow. 'EC nationals should queue for no more than three minutes and non-EC nationals for no more than 10 minutes,' BAA said. BAA is seeking flexibility in staffing to increase the number of immigration officers on duty at peak times. Fixed shifts for airport security staff have been abandoned but similar moves for Home Office employees could encounter union opposition. The INS is recruiting non-union immigration officers to oversee introduction of the US scheme, which it hopes will be fully operational by spring 1993. The costs of the scheme are expected to be passed on to airline passengers, who will pay a Dollars 5 (Pounds 2.50) ticket surcharge. American executives have called for reciprocal arrangements at US airports. The Home Office said it would consider such proposals. Travel without hindrance, Page 7</p>

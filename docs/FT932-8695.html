			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Euro-sceptics plan their tactics after Danish poll TORY EURO-SCEPTICS were last night putting on a brave face ahead of today's Danish referendum on Maastricht while acknowledging that the poll will probably result in a Yes vote. If the Danes do vote Yes, the Maastricht bill will return to the Commons for its third reading on Thursday before moving on to the Lords. The government is assured of a large majority in Thursday's vote largely because Labour has decided to abstain. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is expected to give an initial response to the referendum in a speech tonight at a Confederation of British Industry dinner. It is widely expected that a No vote would result in Thursday's business being changed. Some Euro-sceptics were yesterday keeping their spirits up by looking forward to obstacles that the government still has to cross. These include the bill's passage through the Lords and the possible judicial review of the assertion by ministers that failing to incorporate the protocol containing Britain's social chapter opt-out into UK law had no effect on their ability to ratify the treaty. Mrs Teresa Gorman, Tory MP for Billericay, forecast difficulties in store for the government if a motion on a Maastricht referendum was selected for debate at the Conservative party conference this autumn. 'If conference votes yes for a referendum, the government would have a hell of a problem,' she said. Others drew encouragement from the way the hard core of 26 Euro-sceptics has held together for almost a year since the bill's second reading. In Thursday's vote, Euro-sceptic leaders will be aiming to beat their 'high-water mark' of 38 rebels who defied the government last month by supporting a Maastricht referendum. They say some waverers may be tempted into their ranks by the virtual certainty of a government victory. They plan to meet tomorrow to discuss the way forward.</p>

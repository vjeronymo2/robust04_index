			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Records: Lords of two 'Rings' THERE MAY no longer be quite the sense of pioneering achievement in completing a recorded Ring there was in the heyday of the LP a quarter century ago, but such events still remain noteworthy. Bernard Haitink's cycle for EMI and James Levine's for Deutsche Grammophon have joined the versions by Furtwangler, Solti, Bohm, Boulez, Karajan, Janowski and Goodall (sung in English) already available on CD and there are more to come: Decca is planning another with Dohnanyi, based upon concert performances in Cleveland, while Barenboim's Bayreuth performances in the current Kupfer production will doubtless appear on disc and video before too long. Although the choice is already wide, the second halves of the two new Rings undoubtedly offer a number of first-rate performances, even if they hardly ever threaten the long-lost Golden Age of Wagner interpretation. They have serious shortcomings but contain much to admire. That both conductors have explored the cycle in the opera house while engaged on the recordings, Haitink at Covent Garden and Levine at the Met, would have been a matter of course a generation ago; now, with the seemingly unstoppable hegemony of the recording industry, it becomes a definite, promotable asset. The strength and good musical sense of the conductors are the most stable characteristics of all four sets. To generalise dangerously, Haitink's approach is the more naturally expressive, the fiercer and less compromising in his approach to texture and pacing; Levine is the more affectionate, more inclined to go after the lyricism and to highlight it when found. On average, too, Haitink's pacing seems tighter; the differences may be often small but the overall effect is considerable. There is always a sense of the performance leading somewhere with him, of the drama propelling the musical argument rather than, as sometimes with Levine, being held back by it. Even in such a relatively straightforward showpiece as Siegfried's Funeral March from Gotterdammerung Haitink's sense of momentum and unfussy sculpting gives the music a sense of power and lowering grandeur that becomes just empty rhetoric with Levine. And at the opposite end of the scale it is Haitink who invests the chamber textures surrounding some of Siegfried's quieter reflections with luminous detail; his orchestra, the Bavarian Radio, is consistently well ahead of Levine's own Metropolitan Opera band in its refinement and idiomatic phrasing. Were selecting a Ring just a question of the conductor, then, Haitink's versions would edge ahead of those of his rival. But singers complicate matters, and in this case make them anything but clear. In EMI's roster the men outpoint their female colleagues by a fair margin; for DG the balance is reversed. In the second half of the cycle at least the presence of James Morris in both casts is less intrusive; for both conductors his Wanderer in Siegfried is the familiar mixture of suave good manners and serene detachment, putting not a note out of place but never engaging with the material either. He seems one-dimensional alongside Siegfried Jerusalem's attractive Siegfried for Haitink, better matched to Reiner Goldberg's performance for Levine. Jerusalem's intelligent singing is one of the EMI sets' real vocal strengths; the timbre may not be sufficiently heroic for some, and certainly it is effortful in the top register, but he comes into his own in Gotterdammerung with some beautifully sustained quiet singing and a response to the text that is always far sharper than Goldberg's stolid, four-square declamation. Jerusalem's exchanges with Peter Haage's Mime in Siegfried are much livelier than in the equivalent passages for DG, where Heinz Zednik is unconvincing; when combined with Thomas Hampson's Gunther and John Tomlinson's Hagen in Gotterdammerung the performance attains a very high level indeed. Hampson's flexible and lithe singing is unconventional yet works wonderfully; Tomlinson's baleful performance is terrifying and genuinely disturbing, where Matti Salminen's Hagen for Levine offers woolly power and little more. After that, though, with Haitink the doubts set in. Among the women Marjana Lipovsek makes an efficient Waltraute, without ever revealing the intensity she manages elsewhere; Eva-Maria Bundschuhe is an unexceptional Gutrune; Anne Sofie von Otter is predictably outstanding as the second Norn. In the equivalent roles for Levine Hanna Schwarz brings much dramatic interest to Waltraute, and Cheryl Studer is vocally much more alluring than Bundschuhe. His Woodbird is Kathleen Battle, Haitink's is Dame Kiri; chacun a son gout. But when it comes to the Brunnhildes personal taste hardly enters into it. Eva Marton for Haitink hardly utters a phrase in either opera that falls gently or gratefully on the ear; everything is forced and the tone quality consistently harsh, with precious little singing below a generous forte. It turns the final scenes of both operas into tests of endurance. While Hildegard Behrens is not the most naturally powerful of singers and sometimes lapses into an alarming vibrato, she does at least produce some moments of genuine beauty for Levine and never has to resort to high-pressure bawling. There is an emotional breadth to Behrens' performance, genuine light and shade, which quite eludes Marton. For those for whom any Ring cycle stands or falls by the quality of its Brunnhilde Haitink's will inevitable seem fatally flawed. That is an enormous pity for there is much to admire for anyone willing to withstand the intermittent aural assaults. The rewards of Levine are real but less compulsive; there is nothing to offend or to thrill, just solid workmanship pervading all aspects of the performances. Wagner: Siegfried.

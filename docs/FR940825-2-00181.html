			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Overview <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ``Business for Russia'' program has been developed in full partnership with the Russian Government and various Russian organizations. It has been designed as a working partnership between U.S. federal, state, and local governments, NGOs, and private enterprises and their counterpart institutions in Russia. Pending the availability of fund, approximately 1,000 Russian business people and local government officials will be recruited from selected regions of Russia through an open competition coordinated in Russia by an experienced, Moscow-based U.S. grantee organization in conjunction with the Russian government and Russian partner organizations. Participants will be screened for proficiency in English prior to final selection. Operating in accordance with guidelines established by USIA, the recruitment/selection organization will also cooperate with the U.S. Embassy, Peace Corps, American private organizations and businesses, and the Russian government and business organizations to select Russian participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This announcement seeks American grantee organizations to organize and implement business internships in the United States that will enhance the Russians' ability to develop their own businesses upon returning to Russia. USIA is interested in proposals that provide a professional business experience and, secondarily, expose the participants to American life and culture. USIA is not interested in programs that are academic in nature; this program is designed to provide practical, hands-on training in the American business environment that can be transferred to the individual's employment situation in Russia. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Participant Profile <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Russian participants will be predominantly business managers in existing small or medium-sized firms and entrepreneurs who manage their own businesses, mostly in the 25&hyph;40 age group. A small number of local government officials may also be recruited for participation in the program. All participants will be required to have a working knowledge of English. Depending on the results of this selection process, the Agency may request that the U.S.-based grantee organizations modify the number of individual interns assigned to their local region to meet the demands of the program. The Office of Citizen Exchanges will be responsible for matching interns with the appropriate US host organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interns will be placed in geographic ``clusters'' in the U.S. (i.e., areas within two hours' driving time of a central meeting point) in order to maximize local resources and strengthen the effectiveness of all aspects of the training program. Every effort will be made to group the interns by Russian region of origin in order to permit them to share common experiences and to develop networks and professional associations upon their return home. Proposals should explain how the grantee organizations will utilize the cluster to improve Russians' exchange experience. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Programs must comply with J&hyph;1 visa regulations. Participants will be covered by the Agency's self-insurance policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Budget <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Organizations must submit a comprehensive line item budget based on the specific guidance provided in the Budget Guidelines section of the Application Package.

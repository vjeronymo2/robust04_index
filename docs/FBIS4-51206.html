			<p>BFN     [Text] On the morning of 13 May, the Jinan city  intermediate people's court held an open trial for the 10  criminal cases involving 34 convicts of murder, harm, rape, and  robbery. During the trial, the city court sentenced 14 convicts  to death, four to death with probation, and 16 to term  imprisonment.    During the period from August 1988 to July 1989 the 10  convicts, including Chen Bin, Song Jiakun, Cheng Jichun, and Xue  Desi; colluded with the nine convicts, including Wang Fengting,  who were brought to another trial, on many occasions. They  successively committed 28 crimes of robbery in Jinan, in which  they snatched 150,800 yuan. During the trial Chen Bin, Cheng  Jichun, and Xue Desi were sentenced to death; Song Jiakun was  sentenced to death with a 2-year probation; and other six  convicts were sentenced to imprisonment with different terms.    At about 1800 on 9 January 1993 the convicts of Li Baoji,  Chen Yong, Li Jia, Ma Chuanxin, Zhu Baoshan, and Wang Hongzhu  (at large) were drinking at the "Shi Feng" bar run by convict  Zhang Chao (at large). Zhang Chao quarreled with Wang  Diancheng, a debtor of the bar, and beat the debtor during the  quarrel. Under the command of Zhang Chao the convicts Li Baoji,  Chen Yong, Li Jia, Ma Chuanxin, Zhu Baoshan, and Wang Hongzhu,  cruelly tortured the debtor for four whole hours with an iron  pipe, a bottle, and an electric prod and by giving cuffs and  kicks and burning him with matches. Wang Diancheng died of the  bruises all over his body, which were caused by the beating, and  of the exhaustion of his breathing and circulatory functions.  In the early morning of 12 January, the convicts, including  Zhang Chao, Chen Yong, and Ma Chuanxin, tied Wang's body with a  large stone and sank the body into the Gongshang River. Convict  Li Baoji was sentenced to death and Chen Yong was sentenced to  death with a 2-year probation. Li Jia, Ma Chuanxin, and Zhu  Baoshan were sentenced to imprisonment with different terms.

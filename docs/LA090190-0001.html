			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN, WILSON CAMPAIGNS FOR GOVERNOR  </P> <P> Why don't our two gubernatorial candidates realize that the one who will get  the winning vote will be the one who expresses concern for California and  outlines plans and goals to make our state a better place.  </P> <P> For far too long now, both parties have been concentrating their efforts on  digging up skeletons from their opponent's closet, rather than preparing a  campaign that will educate the California public on their priorities for the  state.  </P> <P> I think I can speak for the majority of Californians when I say that I am not  interested in what candidates do with their personal lives and finances, as  opposed to what they plan to do with mine.  </P> <P> I urge our two well-qualified candidates to stop running a race on what their  opponent has done wrong, and to start running the race on what they've done  right.  </P> <P> ANGELO TURNER  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

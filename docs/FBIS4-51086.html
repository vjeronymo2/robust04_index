			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, May 24 (CNS) -- Guangdong Province has  been concentrating on the consolidation of public security there  since this year. Special campaigns against criminals at railway  lines and robbery of automobiles have achieved initial results  and public order is now turning for the better.    In recent years, the province has seen an increasingly grim  public security situation which has become a hotpoint of common  concerns.    According to three surveys conducted in recent three years,  among five items with which residents in the province are  unsatisfactory, the situation of public security had twice  topped the list and ranked the second for one time. 74.4  percent to 81.5 percent of residents there are unsatisfactory  with the situation of public security [paragraph as received].    The police force in the province has organized a number of  campaigns against crimes this year. During the period of the  Lunar New Year, they waged a special campaign against criminals  committing crimes at railway lines with more than 5000 cases  dealt with and nearly 3000 criminals from more than 200 gangs  seized. In April, the police force staged another special  campaign against the robbery of automobiles with over 2900 cases  dealt with, over 2300 cars seized and more than 2400 criminals  from 490 gangs arrested.    The province has seen more than 10 million migrant people  flowing in every year which also formed the reason for the  increase in the number of crimes there. The crimes committed by  some migrant people covered more than half of the total number  of criminal cases in the Province.    In addition, according to statistics of police force, more  than 40000 criminal cases occurred in the province from January  to April this year, over 10 percent up than the same period of  last year, and the number of big cases showed high growth in  particular.    The police force there has taken two new measures to  consolidate public security. First, more than 4000 policemen  have gone on patrol in the medium- and large-scale cities of the  Province, and county towns and the above county-town cities will  all have their policemen on patrol by the end of this year.  Second, the administration over migrant people will be  strengthened.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Eduard Popov] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok 29 April TASS -- Russia and Japan  decided to build facilities in the Maritime Territory to store  and utilise liquid radioactive waste. The decision was taken as  a result of work by a Russian-Japanese intergovernment  commission on settling one of the most pressing far eastern  problems: storage and processing of liquid radioactive waste in  the Maritime Territory.    Commission Member Yevgeniy Stomatyuk, chairman of the  territorial committee on natural resources, told a news  conference in Vladivostok on Friday that the two sides reached  agreement to build a mobile facility in Japan in the near future.    It will store liquid radioactive waste from Russian  nuclear-powered submarines till a stationary system for  utilising waste is built.    The final discussion of the two projects will be held in  Moscow and Tokyo at the top level. Their bilateral  implementation will start in the latter part of May.</p>

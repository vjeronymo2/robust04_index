			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Party has expressed dissatisfaction  with the voting in some parts of Northern Transvaal. We spoke  to Regional and Land Affairs Minister Andre Fourie this morning  on the issue.    [Begin recording] [Fourie] Corruption is an ugly word, but I  have no doubt that there are irregularities at voting stations.  We have sufficient evidence. Our election agents will be  prepared to make sworn statements if necessary to prove this.  At some of the polling stations things are just not right.    [Correspondent Danie Hefers] What are these irregularities?    [Foure] Well, at some places there is no ink. At others with  no electricity the batteries have run down and cannot provide  lighting. Voting cards are being issued to youths arriving to  vote, youths who one can see are clearly not yet 18 years old.  [end recording]</p>

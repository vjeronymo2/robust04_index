To prevent a major epidemic with tragic consequences, the  potential disaster must be treated with the same urgency and  priority as the recent earthquake in the state, he urged.    Dr. Mersen was delivering the keynote address at the first  international conference on HIV/AIDS infection, tuberculosis and  respiratory diseases, organised by the National Medical  Association for AIDS Control, the Environment Medical  Association of India and the Indian Academy of Health Education.    He noted that the HIV/AIDS pandemic was bringing along with  it a great increase in tuberculosis and, by the WHO estimates,  the number of new TB cases each year worldwide were said to rise  from 7.5 million in 1990 (with 2.1 million in India) to 12  million in 2005, part of the rise being due to the HIV epidemic.    Between 1990 and 1999, eight million people are expected to  have developed TB as a consequence of their HIV infection and  will go on to infect more people with TB than HIV.    Dr. Mersen expressed alarm as Asia following the path of  Africa where the annual number of reported TB cases had almost  tripled in the last five years. He said that an estimated one  billion people in Asia were latently infected with tubercle  bacilli.    Already in India, more than 11 percent of reported TB  patients in Manipur were HIV positive and at Bombay's JJ  Hospital, HIV prevalence had risen from 2 percent in 1989 to 11  percent this year. Sixty percent of AIDS patients in the country  had TB.    To combat this dual infection, the prevention of HIV  infection and the strengthening of TB control programmes,  accelerating efforts to interrupt TB transmission by the  curative treatment of TB cases had preventive therapy to stop  HIV-infected people from developing TB are suggested by Dr.  Mersen.    He said that HIV infection could be prevented by taking into  account the roots of transmission, namely contaminated needles  when injecting drugs, inflected blood transfusion and unsafe sex  practices.    He advocated the widespread use of condoms and better  prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STD)    WHO estimates that the number of HIV infections in South and  South-east Asia rose from 1.5 million to 2.5 million this past  year and more than two in five of those infected were women.    In India the estimated number of HIV infections has risen by  60 percent over the past year to around 1.6 million.    Only a small number of Asians infected with HIV so far,  around 75,000, had gone on to develop AIDS, said Dr. Mersen. He  cautioned that the recent surge in the number of infections  would be followed by a dramatic rise in AIDS cases in the next  five years.    By the year 2000, as many as 500,000 Asians are expected to  develop AIDS annually.    Sex education in schools was crucial, Dr. Mersen said.    STD's must not only be treated at STD clinics which spell  out  stigmatisation to the patient but at every health centre.  Clients of prostitutes need to be educated.    For the treatment of STD's WHO recommends a simplified  approach which does not require laboratory facilities. A mere  physical examination and history-taking were sufficient, he  said. Model treatment charge and training courses by WHO were  being developed to help governments ensure widespread  application of this simplified approach.    Dr. S.P. Tripathi, director of the Indian Council of Medical  Research, said all programmes for the control of TB and HIV were  likely to be vitiated with the combined impact of these  diseases. He feared the spread of multi-drug resistant strains  in the country.    Mr. Paban Singh Ghatowar, Union deputy minister of health  and  family welfare, who was the chief guest, admitted that in view  of the alarming trends, HIV infection was now regarded as a  development problem in India.    Dr. S.R. Sallunkhe, additional director, health services,  government of Maharashtra, said that of the 184,000 people  screened in the state, 70 out of 1,000 were found HIV positive  and 200 of the 238 cases in Maharashtra were from Bombay. The  total number of AIDS cases in the country was a little over 500.</p>

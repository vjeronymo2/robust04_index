			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 14 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- The  Colombian and Jamaican Governments have ratified the Maritime  Delimitation Treaty, which establishes a common area for the  joint control and exploitation of marine flora and fauna.  Jamaican Ambassador to Colombia Mattew Antoni Cox Beaubrun and  Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin signed the document restating both  governments' desire to jointly manage marine resources.    According to the document, the common area excludes the  maritime zone around the Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo Banks  because, in accordance with international law, that area is  considered to be part of Colombian territory. In this manner,  Colombia and Jamaica will be able to exploit the reserves or  hydrocarbon fields that might be found in the designated area,  and which might intersect the maritime border.    The treaty, ratified on 14 March, was signed in Kingston,  Jamaica on 12 November 1993, after 19 years of negotiations  between representatives from both nations. Known as the  Sanin-Robertson Treaty, the agreement establishes a maritime  delimitation line between Colombian territory, a common area  located between the San Andres and Providence Archipelago, and  Jamaican territory.    President Cesar Gaviria called the agreement "historic," and  noted: "It will not only mark our boundaries in the Caribbean  sea, but it will make us true neighbors."</p>

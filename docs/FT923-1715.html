			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Shorts' share in jet plan will secure jobs PARTICIPATION in the development of a new business jet is expected to secure between 700 and 800 jobs at Short Brothers, the Belfast aerospace company now part of the Canadian Bombardier engineering group. Learjet, the sister company of Shorts within Bombardier, yesterday announced plans for the new medium-sized business aircraft, the Learjet 45, just before the opening of the Dallas business aircraft show. The Canadian company confirmed that the Belfast-based manufacturer will design and build a significant proportion of the airframe. Three Bombardier aerospace companies are participating in the project. Apart from Learjet, de Havilland in Toronto will be responsible for the wings and Shorts will design and manufacture the fuselage and build the tailplane in Belfast. Speaking from Dallas, Mr Roy McNulty, Shorts president, said he was 'delighted at this vote of confidence in Shorts' ability to play a major part in the new Bombardier project'. Preliminary design work has already started. Certification is scheduled for 1996. The new aircraft will be able to carry eight to 10 passengers over a range of 2,200 nautical miles at a cruise speed of Mach 0.81. Its 61-in cabin width will be designed to provide greater comfort with more head and shoulder room. Shorts already employs more than 8,000 people in Northern Ireland and is the province's largest private employer. There was further good news on the economic front in Ulster yesterday with an announcement by the Sandown group of private nursing homes that it is creating 250 jobs through the provision of four new homes across the province.</p>

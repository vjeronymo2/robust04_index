			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> THE GRAMMYS, ROUND 1;  </P> <P> POP MUSIC: ROCK 'N' ROLL VETERANS LEAD PACK OF RECORDING INDUSTRY AWARDS  NOMINEES.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based rock veterans Don Henley, Tom Petty, Bonnie Raitt and the  Traveling Wilburys will compete with English soul band the Fine Young Cannibals  in the album of the year category in the 32nd annual Grammy Awards.  </P> <P> The nominations were announced Thursday at a Beverly Hills press conference.  Winners will be named in nationally televised ceremonies from the Shrine  Auditorium on Feb. 21.  </P> <P> The album field consists of ex-Eagle Henley's sardonic "The End of the  Innocence," rocker Petty's darkly humorous "Full Moon Fever," blueswoman  Raitt's reflective "Nick of Time," the informal "supergroup" the Traveling  Wilburys' good-natured "Volume One" and the Cannibals' soul-flavored "The Raw  &amp; the Cooked."  </P> <P> Henley, with his album's title track, and the Cannibals, with "She Drives Me  Crazy," were also named in the record of the year category, along with Billy  Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire" Mike + the Mechanics' "The Living Years" and  Bette Midler's "Wind Beneath My Wings."  </P> <P> Henley's "Innocence" was also named in the song and male rock vocal categories,  giving him four nominations. Other artists with four nominations are Petty,  Prince, Raitt, Dave Grusin and Mike + the Mechanics' Mike Rutherford. Triple  nominees are five-time winner Joel, Fine Young Cannibals, Midler, Soul II Soul,  Janet Jackson, Bruce Hornsby, Aretha Franklin, Miles Davis, BeBe Winans and  James Levine.  </P> <P> While nominations in the two top categories generally followed industry  predictions, there were some surprising absences, most notably Richard Marx,  whose "Repeat Offender" album was one of 1989's biggest sellers and featured  many mainstream textures often favored by Grammy voters. Others who had been  widely touted for either album or single nominations included the Rolling  Stones, Janet Jackson, Neneh Cherry and Paula Abdul.  </P> <P> The balloting is conducted among the 6,000 members of the National Academy of  Recording Arts and Sciences. The eligibility period for the 32nd annual  competition ran from Oct. 1, 1988 to Sept. 30, 1989.  </P> <P> The competitors for best song (a songwriter's award) are Henley and Bruce  Hornsby ("The End of the Innocence"), Rutherford and Brian Robertson ("The  Living Years"), Joel ("We Didn't Start the Fire"), Larry Henley and Jeff Silbar  ("Wind Beneath My Wings") and the trio of Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil and Tom Snow  ("Don't Know Much").  </P> <P> Competing against Soul II Soul (which had two other nominations) in the  new-artist category are Neneh Cherry, Indigo Girls, Milli Vanilli and Tone Loc.  </P> <P> In other key categories, Joel and Prince are up against Michael Bolton, Richard  Marx and Roy Orbison for male pop vocal, while Raitt and Midler will be  challenged by Linda Ronstadt, Gloria Estefan and Paula Abdul for female pop  vocal honors.  </P> <P> The finalists in the female rock vocal competition, along with Raitt, are  Melissa Etheridge, Tina Turner, Cyndi Lauper and Pat Benatar. Vying with Henley  for the male rock vocal award are Petty, Neil Young, Lou Reed and Joe Cocker.  </P> <P> In the rock group vocal category, U2 is nominated twice -- for the album  "Rattle and Hum" and for the single "When Love Comes to Town," a collaboration  with B. B. King. The group's challengers are the Rolling Stones, the Traveling  Wilburys and Living Colour.  </P> <P> The female R&amp;B vocal nominees are Vanessa Williams, Anita Baker, Natalie  Cole, Janet Jackson and Aretha Franklin, while the contenders for the R&amp;B  male vocal award are Prince, Bobby Brown, Al Jarreau, Luther Vandross and  Smokey Robinson.  </P> <P> The finalists for best rap performance are Young MC, Public Enemy, Tone Loc, D.  J. Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince and De La Soul.  </P> <P> In country, k.d. lang and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band both received two  nominations, lang for best country vocal and as co-writer of "Luck in My Eyes,"  and Dirt Band for best group vocal and vocal collaboration. Lang's competitors  for female country vocal honors are Emmylou Harris, Rosanne Cash, Dolly Parton  and Kathy Mattea. The challengers for the male country vocal award are Rodney  Crowell, Keith Whitley, Randy Travis, Clint Black and Lyle Lovett.  </P> <P> Trumpeter Miles Davis is the leading nominee in jazz genre with three -- for  jazz fusion, solo jazz and big-band jazz performances. In the solo jazz  category, he'll be vying with Andre Previn, John Patitucci, Wynton Marsalis and  Chick Corea. For the jazz group instrumental award, it's brother against  brother -- Wynton vs. Branford Marsalis. Previn, for his "After Hours" album  was also nominated in this category, along with the Yellowjackets and the Chick  Corea Akoustic Band.  </P> <P> Both repertory and performers in the classical album category are more offbeat  than usual, though sentimental voting might favor a valedictory award to  Herbert von Karajan and the Vienna Symphony for their Bruckner Eighth Symphony.  </P> <P> The nominees also include the Gerard Schwarz/Seattle Symphony disc of Howard  Hanson symphonies and the Emerson Quartet's Bartok set (both up in two other  categories as well), and the Christoph von Dohnanyi/Garrick Ohlsson/Cleveland  Orchestra version of Busoni's Piano Concerto and the James Levine/Metropolitan  Opera recording of "Die Walkure," each with one other nomination.  </P> <P> The Robert Shaw Grammy machine in Atlanta has a recording of Britten's "War  Requiem" on the ticket in two categories.  </P> <P>  John Henken contributed to this article.  </P> <P> The Full List  </P> <P> The Grammy nominees:  </P> <P> Album: "The End of the Innocence," Don Henley.

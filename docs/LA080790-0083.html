			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOCUMENTARY;  </P> <P> TRINIDAD PREFERRED CRICKET TO A COUP;  </P> <P> DESPITE THE LOOTING, THE UPRISING ULTIMATELY FAILED BECAUSE TRINIDADIANS PLAYED  THE GAME OF DEMOCRACY AS THEY DO THEIR NATIONAL GAME -- BY THE RULES.  </P> <P> Linda Nunes smiled approvingly as a clutch of agitated soldiers grasped their  automatic rifles and bolted past the front porch of her small clapboard house  near the Trinidad and Tobago Television (TTT) station where radical Muslim  rebels were holding 29 hostages behind a barricade of booby-trapped vehicles.  </P> <P> The middle-aged government worker seemed unperturbed by the occasional bursts  of small-arms fire just a block away.  </P> <P> "Come in and wash your face and have a glass of rum," she called out in a  traditional gesture of Trinidadian hospitality to a group of harried foreign  journalists who had paused to take cover.  </P> <P> Sitting placidly in her porch rocker with a half-emptied glass in her hand,  Nunes said she would be happy if the soldiers stormed the station and the Red  House Parliament building where 42 more members of the radical Jamaat al  Muslimeen rebel group were holding Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson and 17  other senior government officials captive.  </P> <P> But even though she shared widespread feelings against the unpopular prime  minister for austerity policies that have pinched the incomes of most  Trinidadians, she hoped he would not be killed or forcibly ousted from power  during the hostage ordeal.  </P> <P> "I don't like the sonuvabitch either," she said, her rocker thumping  emphatically on the porch floorboards. "But we'll vote him out our own way, not  by hostage takin'. Don't be takin' the choice out of my hands!"  </P> <P> Her implacably democratic feelings were shared by many in the devastated  capital city, even among those who virtually wiped out Trinidadian commerce and  industry with five days of rampant pillaging when law and order broke down on  the first night of the hostage crisis. The rebel leader, Yasin abu Bakr, had  counted on such disaffected people to join his aborted revolution.  </P> <P> Why he did not succeed in turning the violent seizure of Parliament and the  broadcast center into a full-scale revolution was clear as the waters of the  Caribbean to the country's leading sociologist, Dr. Selwyn Ryan of the  University of the West Indies.  </P> <P> "Trinidadians play cricket, and cricket is a game of rules that must be  respected," he said as if that explained the matter. "People who play cricket  don't make revolutions. It isn't cricket."  </P> <P> As for the lawlessness and looting that left Port of Spain's once sparkling  Independence Square commercial center looking as burned out as downtown West  Beirut, the editor of a leading local newspaper had an equally benign and  probably correct explanation.  </P> <P> "It was not complicated by racial hostilities or an uprising of the  dispossessed or that sort of thing, because all races and classes appeared to  take part," he said. "It was simply people taking something for nothing in the  absence of visible law and order. That's not peculiar to Trinidadians."  </P> <P> Aside from the Muslimeen rebels themselves, hardly anyone in Port of Spain  thought the seizure of the hostages was a revolutionary act. Most of those  interviewed on the streets agreed with Col. Joseph Theodore, the armed forces  chief, when he called it a simple act of terrorism, nothing more.  </P> <P> "(Abu) Bakr expected the people to rise up like revolutionaries and help him,"  said a businessman who declined to give his name. "Instead they rose up and  helped themselves."  </P> <P> The wild carnival atmosphere of the looting during the first three days of the  hostage crisis already has provided the material for legend. Lennox Murray, a  local devotee of traditional Caribbean calypso music, said he knows several  calypso composers and singers who are already at work immortalizing some of the  Herculean looting feats they witnessed on the flame-lit streets.  </P> <P> "Think of it, Mon! ," Murray exulted. "Usually take six Trinidadians to move a  refrigerator 10 feet. Now we see one man take a fridge six blocks on his head.  What a song!"  </P> <P> The question of why the looters burned down so many buildings, including some  of the city's most modern office structures, remains a puzzle, but like  everything else that happened here last week, there were many uninformed  rumors. A cab driver named Joe Winter said he knew for a fact that Libyan arson  squads had come ashore from ships to accompany the looters.  </P> <P> Winter also claimed positive knowledge that a U.S. Navy task force lurking just  offshore "blew them Libyan boats sky-high right out of the water." When  challenged with the obvious fact that no warships were in sight, Winter blandly  amended his report. "They were submarines," he said.  </P> <P> Although Winter's rumors were wholly fabricated, talk of a Libyan connection  had a basis in fact. Abu Bakr is known to have visited Libya and received  financial support from its radical leader Col. Moammar Kadafi, according to  Trinidad and Tobago police who have had him under surveillance for six years.  Some of his men received military training in Libya as well, the police said.  But they said that they have found no evidence that Libya had anything to do  with Abu Bakr's violent takeover of the Parliament and broadcast center.  </P> <P> Before founding the radical Muslim sect and turning to violence, Abu Bakr was a  respected, law-and-order mounted policeman. For lack of a better explanation of  Abu Bakr's recent behavior, The Guardian, a local newspaper, reported that he  underwent an abrupt change of personality after being medically discharged from  the police. The medical reason for the discharge, the newspaper said, was that  Abu Bakr had become addled after his horse kicked him in the head.  </P> <P> Whatever the final outcome for Abu Bakr and his 111 fellow hostage takers, now  in military custody and likely facing charges of treason and murder, they will  not have a home to return to if their freedom ever is restored.  </P> <P> Buildings of the nine-acre religious commune that the sect built on squatter  land north of Port of Spain burst mysteriously into flames two days after the  crisis ended on Wednesday. No one seemed to know who started the fires, but  they centered on the plush four-bedroom apartment of Abu Bakr in a building  that contained the commune's shops.  </P> <P> Before the fire, journalists were taken on an army-sponsored tour of the  commune and found it totally, and apparently hurriedly, abandoned by the wives  and children of the insurgents. Discarded clothing and other possessions of the  radical Muslims littered the buildings and grounds.  </P> <P> "It looked like Jonestown without the bodies," said Bernard Diederich of Time  magazine, who covered the 1979 mass suicide in Guyana of the followers of the  Rev. Jim Jones, another rebel who claimed a religious mission to purify a  corrupt world.  </P></p>

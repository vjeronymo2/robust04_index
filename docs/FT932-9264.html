			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies The European authorities are evidently gambling that the Iberian devaluations will remain a parochial affair. Pressure on the Spanish currency has been brewing for some time. A devaluation of 8 per cent may allow short-term interest rates to fall to a level consistent with lower unemployment and an end to the alarming slide in industrial production. If so, Spain's third devaluation since last autumn could be dismissed as another example of the weaker brethren falling by the wayside - an event of little implication for the lucky survivors in the inner circle. Spain would have had a surer chance of cutting rates significantly if its devaluation had been 10 per cent, more so still if it had left the system altogether. All of which shows how difficult the task of European currency management remains. The increasing threat to the ERM is that those who have devalued and cut their interest rates will enjoy a stronger recovery and a quicker reduction in unemployment. France, for example, must hope that Spain has not won too much edge. It not only faces a loss of export competitiveness after yesterday; its monetary policy is still dependent on the Bundesbank which is back to blowing cold on interest rate cuts. If the French recession deepens as a result, it may reject the pain. Denmark's voters have a chance to do so in next week's referendum. If they take it, the centre may not hold.</p>

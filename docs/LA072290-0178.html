			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA TRENDS: RISE IN HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION WOES PROMPTS STATE ACTION  </P> <P> When Sheila Newsome closes escrow on her new house in Long Beach this month,  she will also purchase a stake in a corporation that can be held liable for her  personal safety, that can foreclose on her property and that can tell her what  color her new home can be painted.  </P> <P> Newsome is a new homeowner and also a first-time member of a residential  community association, a legal entity that manages and polices the affairs of  her development and yields consider able clout over how people live together.  </P> <P> The growing influence of community associations in California has prompted the  state Legislature to convene the Select Committee on Common Interest  Subdivisions, chaired by Assemblyman Dan Hawser (D-Arcata). Among other things,  the special committee is expected to consider whether a proliferation of  lawsuits and community association-related complaints justifies establishing a  state agency to regulate associations. The committee will hold hearings  beginning July 31.  </P> <P> It is estimated that more than 3 million Californians belong to residential  community associations, with nearly half located in single-family subdivisions.  They represent a radical transformation in the ownership of private property in  the state and have revolutionized how our communities are governed.  </P> <P> Once a new residential development is completed, associations are legally  organized as mutual benefit corporations. With a volunteer board of directors  and a paid staff or professional management firm, they collect dues and  maintain common areas, such as open space, streets, swimming pools, corridors  and playgrounds. Associations also enforce the property's covenants and deed  restrictions, which may include rules on loud music, design standards and how a  lawn must be landscaped.  </P> <P> Home buyers automatically become members of the association and must abide by  the rules. When a homeowner consistently violates the bylaws, such as  nonpayment of dues, an association can place a lien on the property and even  execute foreclosure proceedings.  </P> <P> "People think that they know what owning a house is all about, but they don't,  because this is a radical departure from ownership as we have known it in the  past," said UC Berkeley research associate Carol Silverman.  </P> <P> Expensive and complex legal brawls and consumer complaints have prompted the  Legislature to look into community associations.  </P> <P> San Francisco homeowner Suzanne Sarra's gripe is a familiar one. She lives in a  small condominium complex where a lawsuit between her homeowners association  and the developer has held up home sales and hurt property values.  </P> <P> "This has been a very frustrating experience; we are a small association  without a lot of reliable information," she said. "There should be some sort of  government agency to help. We didn't know what to do, so we hired an attorney,  which hasn't been cheap."  </P> <P> The number of appellate court decisions related to community associations  tripled between 1988 and 1989, according professor Katharine Rosenberry of the  California Western School of Law in San Diego.  </P> <P> "Phase 1 in the evolution (of community associations) is building all of these  projects and getting people to live in them," Rosenberry said. "And now for  Phase 2, when neighbors must learn to live with another and they begin to  disagree and they begin to sue."  </P> <P> The proliferation of associations accounts for the increased number of  conflicts that have come to the attention of the Legislature.  </P> <P> In California, 18,000 subdivisions and townhome and condominium projects have  associations with collective operating budgets that exceed $1 billion. It is  estimated that 70% of all new for-sale developments in the state that have more  than four units are organized with community associations.  </P> <P> Residential associations date back to 1743, when the Earl of Leicester  constructed townhomes surrounding a public square. Residents set up a legal  device to maintain the area so that they could have exclusive use of the  square.  </P> <P> After World War I, residential associations in the United States were used to  enforce restrictive covenants that prohibited racial minorities.  </P> <P> In California, the first community association was founded in 1912 when the St.  Francis Wood single-family subdivision was built in San Francisco. But it  wasn't until after the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978 that the number of  associations mushroomed.  </P> <P> Before that, community associations governed fewer than 200 developments  throughout the state, and the vast majority of those were upscale condominiums  and townhome developments.  </P> <P> "The fiscal problems of local government following the enact ment of  Proposition 13 accelerated the use of associations," according Silverman. "By  requiring the developer to provide streets, street lighting, visitor parking,  water and sewer lines, parks and playgrounds, localities can minimize the  fiscal impact of new development," Silverman said.  </P> <P> Once these common amenities are built, the developer sets up a community  association to maintain them. Not only have associations assumed  responsibilities traditionally provided by local government, but they tackle  broader duties.  </P> <P> For example, an association has unique responsibilities to safeguard its  residents. In the California Supreme Court case of Frances T. vs. the Village  Green Owners Assn., a Los Angeles woman won a lawsuit against a homeowners  association because it failed to provide adequate outdoor lighting that might  have prevented the woman's rape.  </P> <P> "A city doesn't have the (legal) responsibility to protect you against crime,  but here we have a case that says a homeowners association can be held  negligent for the same thing," Rosenberry said.  </P> <P> In other instances, associations have become a crutch for solving neighborhood  spats.  </P> <P> "Before we had associations policing illegally parked cars and shoddy  landscaping, these problems were worked out neighbor to neighbor," Rosenberry  said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, some experts say it is time to establish a consumer-oriented  regulatory agency to protect homeowners from abuses and to offer information  and redress for people who feel victimized by community associations or  developers.  </P> <P> "After the developer completes the project, there is no regulatory oversight,"  Silverman said. "It makes sense to have an agency that would protect the  consumer."  </P> <P> The California Department of Real Estate works with the developer to set up the  association, but the state agency washes its hands after it is established.  </P> <P> Silverman points to the Bureau of Condominiums in Florida, which is a  government regulatory body funded by fees from developers and homeowners. Such  an agency can offer mediation services in legal disputes, oversee the election  of association officers, require the licensing of association property managers  and provide consumer education.  </P> <P> "If it's set up to offer the homeowner better information and to regulate the  people that are hired to run these organizations, then it's a good idea,"  Rosenberry said. "But if it's set up to resolve disputes over barking dogs, it  will be a waste of taxpayers' money."  </P></p>

Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said  this evening that the chancellor had, however, expressed  understanding for the health reasons "that forced Professor  Ortleb to give up his ministerial office." In his three years  as minister, Ortleb has played a major part in dealing with the  changes in the education system that came about as a result of  German unification.    In particular, he played a successful role in the renewal  and  rebuilding of the higher education system in the eastern states,  the statement goes on to say. Ortleb has shown great commitment  in introducing his experience and the concerns of the eastern  states into the German Government's work. The chancellor  thanked Ortleb for his achievements as a member of the cabinet  and expressed the hope that he would continue to play a part in  politics using his expertise and experience.</p>

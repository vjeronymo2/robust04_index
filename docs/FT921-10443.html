			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Raglan losses cut to Pounds 0.69m Pre-tax losses at Raglan Property Trust were cut from Pounds 3.38m to Pounds 685,346 over the half year ended September 30. The figures reflected a reduction in exceptional provisions from Pounds 3.65m to Pounds 405,341. The exceptionals related to amounts written off properties and fees in connection with the agreement between the company and its three main bankers. In November 1991 Raglan reported that its lending banks had confirmed its request for continued support to March 31. In the absence of any other funding this support would be required after March 1992, the company added. Turnover showed a sharp improvement at Pounds 8.22m (Pounds 2.15m). Losses per share worked through at 0.4p (1.9p) and net assets per share at period-end stood at 0.7p (1.1p).</p>

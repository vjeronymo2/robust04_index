However, the Secretary considers an institution to be current in its debt service if the institution can provide evidence that it has reached a mutually acceptable agreement to restructure or reschedule its obligations. If an institution is unable to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with creditors after 120 days and the institution's failure to pay its obligations has resulted in a creditor taking legal action to attach the institution's assets or obtain a judgment, then the institution shall not be considered to be financially responsible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters felt the requirement that an institution maintain a cash reserve was excessive. A few commenters supported the requirement of the cash reserve and provided suggestions for alternative methods of calculating the amount of the reserve requirement. A majority of the commenters who expressed a concern believed that the establishment of a separate reserve account would significantly reduce available working capital funds that might be better applied to meet other operating expenditures. Many commenters believed that nonprofit institutions should be allowed to include amounts held in the cash reserve in the calculation of the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. Some commenters supported the Secretary's position that the cash reserve account should be excluded from the calculation of the ratio for nonprofit institutions. A number of the commenters thought that a more appropriate requirement would be a cash reserve that is based on the institution's actual refund experience. A few commenters suggested that the cash reserve requirement be based on the residual of total unearned tuition liability less accounts receivable, with an adjustment for refunds made under the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund policy. Many commenters suggested that the calculation of the reserve requirement on the basis of deferred tuition revenue seemed arbitrary and indicated that it would vary greatly among institutions depending on the timing of enrollments and the preparation of year end financial statements. Other commenters recommended that the Secretary consider an annual financial statement along with cash flow projections for the next three enrollment periods as an alternative to the cash reserve. A few commenters believed that the definition of acceptable forms of the cash reserve should be expanded to include money market instruments, that are highly liquid and trade in an active secondary market. Overall, the majority of the commenters believed that the provision should be removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 498(c)(5) of the HEA requires the Secretary to establish requirements for an institution to maintain sufficient cash reserves to ensure repayment of any required refunds. The Secretary proposed that a cash reserve based on the institution's deferred tuition revenue would be appropriate because the balance of the deferred tuition account generally reflects amounts collected by, or contractually obligated to be received by, the institution in advance of providing educational services. The Secretary believed an institution could reasonably expect that some students would withdraw prior to the completion of their educational program and be entitled to a refund of amounts paid for services not yet rendered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that the commenters are correct in observing that the balance of deferred tuition revenue would vary among institutions depending on factors that have little to do with actual refund payments by the institution, such as enrollment periods and fiscal year ends. The Secretary believes that it would be more consistent with the intent of the HEA for this provision to match the reserve requirement more closely with an institution's historical refund experience. The Secretary believes that a cash reserve balance equal to one quarter of the institution's previous year's total refund expenditure would be sufficient to satisfy the institutions cash reserve requirement because that amount represents approximately three months potential refund expenditure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to establish the appropriate amount for the cash reserve, the institution will have to disclose, in a note to its audited financial statements, the dollar amount of total refunds paid in both the current fiscal year and prior year. The Secretary does not consider internally generated cash flow projections as reliable indicators of an institution's ability to meet the cash reserve requirement. The Secretary does not consider liquid investments, such as money market funds, to be equivalent to cash because such investments do not generally have a maturity date and are therefore more characteristic of equity investments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Secretary acknowledges the criticism from the commenters that the establishment of a cash reserve reduces available working capital, the Secretary points out that the establishment of a reserve account requires the accumulation of cash on a one-time basis. Contributions to the reserve account would be required only to the extent that enrollment levels and refund experiences vary. On a continuing basis, the resulting net outflow of working capital would be the same despite the establishment of a cash reserve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary agrees with the commenters that nonprofit institutions should be treated consistently with for-profit institutions, and allowed to include the cash reserve in the calculation of the liquidity ratios. The reserve account is intended to provide an immediately available source of cash that must be available to make refunds at any time. It is reasonable to expect that if an institution were to close at other than the end of an academic period that the cash reserve funds would be used to pay the institution's refund liability. Since unpaid refunds are generally recognized as a current liability it is appropriate to recognize, in the institution's ratio calculation, those assets which would actually be used to offset the liability in the event of liquidation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulation will restrict the type of account in which the cash reserve must be kept because it must be maintained at a certain minimum level at all times. Accordingly, an institution may not hold reserve funds in any type of investment that is subject to significant price variation. The Secretary believes only cash held in the form of a demand deposit in a federally insured bank account, or short term investments secured by the full faith and credit of the United States meet this criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary amends the cash reserve requirement in &sect;668.15(b)(5) to require an institution to maintain at all times, a cash reserve equal to one-quarter of the total dollar amount of refunds paid by the institution in the previous fiscal year. Such reserves shall be maintained in a cash deposit in a federally insured bank account or, in U.S. Treasury securities, backed by the full faith and credit of the United States having an original maturity of three months or less.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

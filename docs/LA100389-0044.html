			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DAVID CARRADINE GETS JAIL, PROBATION FOR DRUNK DRIVING  </P> <P> Actor David Carradine was sentenced Friday to 48 hours in jail, three years  probation and ordered to work full time for 30 days on a Caltrans roadway  maintenance crew in addition to performing 100 hours of community service for  driving drunk last month in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Carradine, who starred in the television show "Kung Fu," pleaded no contest  Friday in Van Nuys Municipal Court to one count of driving under the influence  of alcohol. His blood-alcohol level was more than 0.10, the legal standard for  driving under the influence of alcohol, said Deputy City Atty. David  Kestenbaum. A second count of driving under the influence was dismissed in  exchange for Carradine's no-contest plea, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Education Program  </P> <P> Commissioner David Stephens also ordered Carradine to attend an alcohol  education program for one year and to attend one drunk-driving awareness  meeting sponsored by Mothers Against Drunk Driving. At these meetings, people  convicted of drunk-driving offenses listen to talks by mothers and other family  members who have lost loved ones in traffic accidents, said Deputy City Atty.  Lisa Kissel.  </P> <P> Carradine also is not to drive anywhere except to work and alcohol meetings for  one year, Kissel said.  </P> <P> Carradine was arrested by California Highway Patrol officers at about 12:45  a.m. Sept. 8 at Primera Place and Lindo Street in the Cahuenga Pass area after  he was observed stopped at a green light and straddling the center line, Kissel  said.  </P> <P> Carradine failed a field sobriety test. His blood-alcohol level was 0.17.  </P> <P> Carradine, represented by attorney Emanuel Barling Jr., admitted a previous  conviction from November, 1984, for driving under the influence.  </P> <P> Kissel said the sentence is typical for a second drunk-driving conviction.  Carradine could have received a maximum sentence of one year in jail and a  $1,000 fine, Kestenbaum said.  </P></p>

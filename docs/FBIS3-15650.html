			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "On Sea or Land -- Let Us Be </F> Ourselves"]    [Text] Activists of the Kiev branch of the Officers'  Union of Ukraine [SOU] at their meeting have proposed submitting  questions on our state security and integrity to a nationwide  referendum.    As is known, the protocol "On regulation of problems of the  Black Sea Fleet," signed by the Ukrainian and Russian presidents  in Masandra in September 1993, entrusted "the governmental  delegations of Ukraine and the Russian Federation with the task  of studying, within one month, all questions relevant to the  drafting of an agreement, in accordance with which the entire  Black Sea Fleet along with its infrastructure in the Crimea can  be used by Russia and bear Russian symbols, providing the  Russian side will make appropriate settlements for half of the  Black Sea Fleet, including its infrastructure, which by virtue  of previous agreements was assigned to Ukraine" (taken from the  original). Ukraine's leadership, emphasizes the recent  statement of SOU Kiev branch, has declined to inform the people  of the truth about the Masandra agreement in every possible way.  Ukraine's Defense Minister K. Morozov, who resisted the selling  of Ukrainian territory and property, was dismissed from his post.    Having postponed the above-mentioned agreement (but not  given  up its intents), the state leadership adopted a course for  transferring nuclear weapons to Russia. Through pro-Moscow  specialists in nuclear weapons, a preconceived and purposeful  campaign has been launched to threaten the Ukrainian people with  the possible consequences of keeping warheads on the Ukrainian  territory. In addition, the state leadership hides Ukraine's  rejection of the proposal from U.S. firms to built a joint  enterprise for reprocessing uranium from warheads into nuclear  fuel for nuclear power plants, from which Ukraine could derive  great profits. Moreover, public opinion is not informed of the  fact that Ukraine primarily transfers to Russia those nuclear  weapons whose shelf life expires in 2005, while those already  unfit for use are remaining.    Having acquired the Supreme Council support for the  trilateral agreement on transferring Ukrainian nuclear weapons  to Russia, our state leadership returned to the Masandra  agreement on transferring Ukraine's part of the Black Sea Fleet  to Russia "to pay off debts," as well as on leasing the Black  Sea shoreland in the Crimea and Sevastopol together with its  infrastructure. In addition to that, our leaders do not even  raise the question of Russian troops' withdrawal from Ukraine's  territory.    Feeling itself responsible for the destiny of Ukraine, for  the destiny of the servicemen of Ukraine's Armed Forces, reads  the statement, the Kiev branch of the SOU thinks that the  questions of Ukraine's security and integrity (nuclear status,  lease of the territory, state and administration system,  deployment of foreign troops, selling of the Black Sea Fleet)  should be submitted to a nationwide referendum on 27 March 1994.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Brooke launches fresh review of Arts Council MR PETER BROOKE, the national heritage secretary, yesterday announced a further review of the operation of the Arts Council, ignoring three recommendations by Price Waterhouse, the consultants. He told the House of Commons yesterday that the council had been given three months to analyse its activities, assuming a cut in its costs of 10 per cent, or Pounds 700,000. The council was free to outline what improvements in its service it could make if it was subject to a smaller grant cut. Mr Brooke reaffirmed the independence of the council, but made it clear he was exploring ways to make it more accountable. In the spring Mr Brooke asked Price Waterhouse to review the workings of the council and suggest savings. It came up with three options, saving Pounds 429,000, Pounds 847,000 or Pounds 2.2m. The third option would drastically reduce the council's role. Mr Brooke confirmed the arm's-length principle on which the council is run, but added: 'There could be occasions when ministers can properly act as a conduit for public and political opinion.' In the Commons yesterday, there was widespread criticism from MPs of the council's recent decision to remove grants from 10 regional theatre companies. Mr Brooke has suggested that the council explain the decision, perhaps to the national heritage select committee. Mr Brooke is shortly to decide on the size of the council's 1994-95 grant. This year it is responsible for distributing Pounds 225m in government subsidy to arts organisations. Under presure from Mr Brooke the council may be forced to backtrack on its policy of switching funding away from theatres towards contemporary dance and the visual arts. Mrs Ann Clwyd, shadow national heritage secretary, said the further review meant 'more delay - more paralysis by yet more analysis'.</p>

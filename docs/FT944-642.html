			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Perspectives: Christianity's cost-benefit analysis - As They Say in Europe In western Europe at this time of year, it is not unusual for politicians to try to square their practices and beliefs with those of Christianity. But their audience does not easily detect a specifically Christian heritage and rarely demands it. In Germany, political parties maintain the adjective; elsewhere, it has fallen by the wayside through irrelevance or corruption. The New Testament provides an ambiguous guide to what is the 'right' form of social organisation. In one parable, chaps get the same payment for working for an hour as others do for a day. In another, the shrewd investor of his master's money is rewarded with extra prizes, whereas the man who merely ensures the capital value stays intact is treated as a wastrel. It is not clear from such examples if one should prefer a corporatist egalitarianism or a devil-take-the-hindmost capitalism. Then we have the endless repetition of the saying: 'To him that hath shall be given.' This normally is used in a fatalistic manner - when millionaires win the lottery, for example, or bosses receive huge pay increases. The contrasting traditions of political Christianity are, in fact, reflected in the American and the European way. The most powerful religious force in the US seems to reject any element whatever of social responsibility except in the spreading-the-gospel sense. The good Samaritan is entitled to give a helping hand to the man beaten up by the lynch mob (although, in the Bible belt, helping the lynch mob has been the traditional obligation), but he would not want his tax dollars used for such support. The Christian right rarely puts forward any social policy beyond individual redemption. In Europe, the welfare state has been as much the product of the pulpit as of the political party. Many Christian politicians have seen it as a way to express their view of social morality in a secular world while still maintaining a religious thread. The welfare state emerged as the charitable obligation of the well-off Englishman who believed that his privileges had to be paid for, through his own and other people's taxes. It was the preferred instrument of left-wing Catholics, such as Charles Peguy or Jacques Delors, who saw society as weighted permanently against the under-privileged. In western Europe, the ideology of the welfare state has, over decades, been subject to the same rise and fall that characterised the history of Christianity. It was the shared, universal faith, but is no more. It acted as a form of social cement, but now is just as likely to exacerbate social division. Its decline started when people asked: 'What's in it for me?' Those who work in the caring services were once a kind of priesthood; now, only medical staff enjoy the same prestige. The welfare state seemed to guarantee a stable and even dynamic society; today, it is compared unfavourably with the anti-welfare practices of east Asia and even the US. Its opponents argue that extensive benefits for the unemployed mean high levels of unemployment which, in turn, creates a thriftless and potentially unstable class. Providing generous old-age pensions creates benefits for those who do not bother to make due provision for themselves, who fail to make their talent fructify. Even in Sweden, many have come to see the welfare state as the motor of economic decline, budgetary chaos and financial instability. Yet, in the European mind it holds sway. Most remain true believers and resist government attempts to shrink welfare. The problem is that, like Christianity, it was meant to include everybody. Every citizen in many countries is born into the welfare state and still is a beneficiary to a greater or lesser extent. It even fulfils the demand that to him that hath, shall be given. Today, in Britain, the talk is of 'targeting' benefits. But once the welfare state is turned into the property of the poor and underprivileged alone, it will lose its popularity - and that will augur its demise. If middle-class taxes are paid into welfare funds that work exclusively for the benefit of other groups, the system will die in a tax revolt. It is instructive to see why there is no such revolt in the most heavily-taxed nation in Europe: every Dane employed in the private sector pays out huge sums out in taxes, then sees their partner get it back in unemployment pay or an equally highly-taxed state wage. The system works in Denmark because every cost is seen as a benefit; in Britain, every benefit is a cost. Like Christianity, the welfare state will survive where individuals welcome its obligations in the firm belief that sacrifice today brings its rewards tomorrow.

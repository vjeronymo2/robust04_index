			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Associate provision hits Linton Park A Pounds 3.43m provision against an associate, taken as an extraordinary item, left Linton Park, the tea planting, food processing and engineering group, with a loss for the 1991 year of Pounds 2.27m, against Pounds 5.4m profits. Pre-tax profits were 45 per cent lower at Pounds 4.42m, against Pounds 8.07m, after a higher net interest charge of Pounds 1.79m (Pounds 1.47m) and lower income from associates and other participating interests of Pounds 431,000 (Pounds 1.27m). Turnover fell from Pounds 128.4m to Pounds 124.3m. Earnings came out at 8.8p (25.1p). A final dividend of 10.5p makes an unchanged 13p total. Ellis &amp; Everard, the chemical distributor, has sold two offshoots - Midkem and Dimex International - to Yule Catto for Pounds 2.5m cash. The disposals were consistent with Ellis's strategy of concentrating on its core chemical distribution businesses. The group, which in February sold the pub refurbishment business to Mr Stephen Dean, its former chairman and chief executive, said it had now negotiated the sale of the Platonoff and Harris joinery business to Mr Dean for Pounds 120,000.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 4 (ITAR-TASS) -- All today's Russian  newspapers print materials on the 195th birth of the great  Russian writer Aleksandr Sergeyevich Pushkin to be marked on  June 6. The Russian press also singles out the celebration of  the 50th anniversary of the D-Day, the opening of the second  front in Europe in the Second World War.    In this connection, the ROSSIYSKIYE GAZETA newspaper notes  that Russia was not invited to celebrate the D-Day jubilee. "It  is understandable why Russia was not invited," the newspaper  writes.    "It is inconvenient for some people to stand next to those  who made the main contribution to the victory over Nazi Germany  and to boast of their combat feats in, let it be, the largest  landing operation of the Second World War and yet an operation  but not the decisive battle of the war."    Writing on the same topic, the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper  stresses: "An operation, unique in its scale and organisation,  is a property of both military history and mankind's experience,  experience of self-sacrifice in the name of victory over evil  and an example of unity of people of various nationalities in  the name of a common goal, about which some people forget these  days."    At the same time, the newspaper notes that, "according to  public opinion polls conducted in France and the United States,  the world started forgetting who made the main contribution to  the victory over Nazism.    "Some 20 per cent of respondents, on average, remember the  Soviet Union. Most speak about the American victory. The  French mention even Italy."    The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper runs a front-page article,  criticising the Finance Ministry headed by Sergey Dubinin. "The  present-day Finance Ministry resembles a torpedoed ship which is  still afloat and moves by inertia but already loses speed," the  newspaper notes.    The same newspaper carries an article devoted to Aleksandr  Solzhenitsyn's return home. The newspaper writes in its  commentary that people, beset by political passions, complain  that Solzhenitsyn came to teach them how to live.    "We ourselves make a lord out of him who will decide who is  right and who is wrong," the newspaper says. "Solzhenitsyn who  was not broken by gulag and a forced expulsion from the country,  will not be anybody's confidant."    The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper features an interview  with  Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov who opposes the  salvaging of the sunken nuclear-powered Komsomolets submarine.    Mikhailov, the designer of nuclear weapons of the third  generation, says: "There is no need to surface the submarine.  All examinations show that there is no leakage of plutonium".    He claims that the submarine should be left at the sea  bottom. It will sink into ooze, and nature will take care of  neutralising the sub's nuclear weapons better than people.    The PRAVDA newspaper carries an interview with Professor  Aleksandr Livshits, head of the Russian president's expert group.    According to Livshits, "provided there is clear course of  the  present government and no political confrontation, there is no  more than one year left to the initial stages of an economic  rebound in Russia".    The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIA newspaper front-pages an interview  with  former State Security Minister Viktor Barannikov.    He explains his removal from the ministerial post by the  fact  that "it was not to the liking of the president's team, above  all, an insistent demand and readiness to take urgent and  specific measures at the state level against an appalling  pillage of the country's wealth.    "They were incensed by facts (quoted in my reports) of  direct  complicity in this of high-ranking government officials as well  as by glaring facts of corruption at the top echelons."    Commenting on the talks on the division of the Black Sea  Fleet, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper writes: "It is in vain to  hope for an early division of the Black Sea Fleet. The delay is  advantageous for Ukraine, since Russia, in fact, maintains the  entire fleet all alone, hence its Ukrainian part.    "Besides," the newspaper continues, "some politicians are in  no hurry to close the question on the Black Sea Fleet, since  they `have not squeezed' as yet all political `dividends' out of  this issue."</p>

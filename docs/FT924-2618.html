			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Improvements in mail order benefit Fine Art IMPROVEMENTS IN its mail order side helped Fine Art Developments lift pre-tax profits by 10 per cent, from Pounds 4.49m to Pounds 4.95m, in the six months to September 30. Mr Keith Chapman, chairman, said that Express Gifts had added more new agents through a successful recruitment campaign, and Mr Keith Brown, associate director, added that orders there were up more than 40 per cent as a result. The mail order side was also reaping the benefits of past investment in the Accrington site: customer service levels were improved and there was a 'significant' increase in order levels, though at lower average values. Hope Education lifted sales 'in a difficult educational market', and Home Farm Hampers was expected to make 'a very satisfactory increase' in the second half where all its business falls. Progress in the card and paper products division was more modest. Group turnover rose 9 per cent to Pounds 120m (Pounds 109.8m), largely, said Mr Chapman, 'by aggressive marketing'. Operating profits edged ahead to Pounds 9.79m (Pounds 9.71m) because of lower margins, though the figure included a Pounds 2.3m charge for the closure costs of Matador Paper Mills and a Pounds 2.17m credit from the sale of the Next stake. Reduced rates led to a fall in interest charges to Pounds 4.84m (Pounds 5.22m), though the group paid Pounds 4.4m to exercise its final option to lift its stake in Grattan from 10 to 15 per cent. Earnings advanced to 4.54p (3.86p) per share and the interim dividend is raised to 3p (2.7p).</p>

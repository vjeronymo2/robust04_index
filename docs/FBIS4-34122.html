			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 15 Jun (PL) -- Cuba reiterated today before  the diplomatic corps accredited in this country its opposition  to the illegal occupation of diplomatic missions by people who  want to abandon the country.    The Foreign Ministry [Minrex] summoned the heads of the  foreign missions and briefed them on the current situation  regarding the presence of three groups that forced their way a  few days ago into the residence of the Belgian ambassador and  the German Embassy, as well as the Chilean consulate.    Minrex Spokesman Miguel Alonso later told the local and  foreign media that according to Cuba the firmness by all the  sides affected by these incident favors a possible prompt  solution.    Nine people, including a woman and a child, participated in  the most recent illegal entry, which occurred at the Chilean  Consulate.    Alonso explained the Cuban Government has reiterated to the  ambassadors its decision to help resolve the problem caused by  the occupants of their respective buildings. He ruled out any  legal action against those who voluntarily leave.    Those transgressions cannot replace the country's current  normal procedure to travel abroad, nor is it acceptable to try  to force an ambassador into granting a visa, he added.    During the meeting, Cuba reaffirmed that in accordance with  international agreements, it respects the sanctity of embassies  and offers protection to all missions accredited in this  Caribbean nation.</p>

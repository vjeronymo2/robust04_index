			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Technology: New light on road safety - European car makers are using pioneering techniques Europe's motor industry has developed a system which could sharply reduce road deaths, according to European car manufacturers. The technology, which involves the use of ultra-violet light in headlamps, was developed under the Prometheus research programme and could be ready by the end of this decade. About 50,000 people are killed and around 1m injured each year on roads in Europe. With a view to reducing the toll, and solving another of the problems bedevilling Europe's roads - traffic congestion - 90 cars and trucks fitted with an assortment of pioneering technologies were put through their paces at a Paris conference last week. They were demonstrating the fruits of Prometheus, the first pan-European collaborative research project, which involves 13 vehicle manufacturers and some of their key component suppliers, plus electronics and defence equipment producers, research institutes and universities. Prometheus - an acronym for Programme for a European Traffic with Highest Efficiency and Unprecedented Safety - is eight years old and has cost nearly Ecu900m (Pounds 703m). The UV system, developed by Saab and Volvo, was demonstrated by Saab last week. At an unlit test track near Paris last week, the Saab 9000 showed only a hint of UV light from two small lamps at bumper level. But for the driver, the UV transformed the view. White lines and road signs treated with UV-responsive paint shone out from hundreds of yards ahead. Apart from safety, there is another dimension to the programme. Europe's vehicle makers are locked in a fierce race with rivals in Japan and North America to develop new technologies expected to transform vehicles and road infrastructure by the 21st century. At stake are vast rewards for those whose technologies become the industry standard in areas such as vision enhancement, automatic collision avoidance, and data interchange between vehicles and roadside equipment for purposes such as route finding and automatic tolling. The Prometheus research has fallen into three categories: safer driving, mainly through autonomous on-board systems; 'co-operative' driving, involving information exchanges between vehicles or roadside information beacons; and broader traffic management technology. The UV system falls into the first category. Jaguar, glass manufacturer Pilkington and GEC Marconi Avionics have taken a different approach, adapting military technology. A near-infra-red camera and filtered headlamps allow the driver to see into pitch-black countryside. Infra-red, unlike UV, can also cut through fog. Jaguar also demonstrated an 'intelligent' cruise control car, developed with Philips, Lucas Industries, Alfred Teves and DASA, which measures the distance and speed of vehicles ahead, maintaining a safe distance by automatic braking and throttle. The driver can override the system. Lucas, and Oxford and Southampton universities, has joined Jaguar to develop a vision system using a video camera and radar sensors to scan the road ahead and predict collision risk. BMW, Matra, Renault and Jaguar have also developed systems which help the driver stay in lane using a camera which recognises lane markings. Collectively, the Prometheus technology stands to change driving and safety standards beyond recognition in the next two decades - if motorists are prepared to pay extra for safety features. If Prometheus succeeds in its goals, the 50,000 annual death toll could be halved by 2010.</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COFFEE DIDN'T HAVE CAFFEINE, BUT IT WAS FLOATING IN COUPONS  </P> <P> A couple will have to drink a lot of java between now and 1991 to redeem all  the coupons they found in a single can of coffee.  </P> <P> Joyce and Dwight Spates recently found 254 discount coupons totaling $101.60 in  a 1-pound can of Sanka brand coffee.  </P> <P> "Joyce was making coffee for friends, and there was a coupon in the first scoop  out of a newly opened can, then another in the next scoop until she had pulled  out three or four coupons," Spates said. They emptied the coffee into a bowl  and ended up with half a can of coffee and half a can of 40-cent coupons.  </P> <P> Spates said he called the maker of Sanka to report the coupon bonanza.  </P> <P> "I told the man who answered the phone at General Foods that we don't usually  drink Sanka coffee and asked him if all the cans have this many coupons in  them," Spates said.  </P></p>

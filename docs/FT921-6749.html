			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / US aid budget comes under scrutiny: Israeli loans guarantee THE fate of the US foreign aid budget has become inextricably tied up with that of Israel's request for Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) of loan guarantees to help it absorb around 1m new immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Authorisation for US foreign aid is due to expire at the end of March, but Senator Patrick Leahy, who chairs the Senate sub-committee overseeing foreign aid funding, says he will not put forward a new aid bill unless an agreement could be reached that ties the Israeli loan guarantees to some sort of freeze on Israeli settlements in the Arab territories it occupied in the 1967 war. 'If we do not have a solution to the guarantees and settlements issue, then we don't have a bill - it's as simple as that,' he said yesterday. When it has fallen out with the US administration in the past, Israel has often been able to call on support in the Congress to make its views prevail. Today, locked in an apparently irreconcilable dispute with the administration, it faces an uphill struggle. Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, told Congress on Monday he would accept Dollars 2bn a year of loan guarantees for the five years only if Israel halted settlement activity, or agreed to deduct from the guarantees the amount it spent in the occupied terri-tories. Even Israel's strongest supporters, meanwhile, are not eager to force the issue. They believe they would probably lose a straight majority vote, and would certainly be unable to muster enough support to override a presidential veto. 'It's given that any sort of guarantee arrangement, in order to be sellable here, would have to be tied to pretty substantive restrictions on settlements,' said one congressional aide yesterday. The debate is taking place at a time when there is little enthusiasm either among congressmen or in the US at large for foreign aid in general. At the same time, Israel's position in the US public opinion has weakened in recent years. The Palestinian uprising and Israeli tactics against it have contributed substantially to this. A central factor, however, has been President George Bush's public stand against Israel, particularly in the September press conference when he called for a four month delay on the loan guarantees and depicted himself as standing alone against hordes of Israeli lobbyists. Mr Bush said yesterday that his administration's policy might be risky for his re-election campaign this year, but that he would not 'shift the foreign policy of this country because of political expediency.' In purely electoral terms, however, he and the Republican party have little to lose, since the Democrats habitually win over 70 per cent of Jewish votes. Many members of Congress have concluded, moreover, that they can afford to oppose the loan guarantees.</p>

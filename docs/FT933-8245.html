			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Observer: New York Fed form guide Now that Bill McDonough has settled in as the new president of the New York Fed, all eyes are on who gets the number two spot he vacated. Given that the person picked will be one of the leading players in the world's foreign exchange markets, the pressure is on for an early decision. McDonough, who had done 22 years at First Chicago, had only been in the job for 18 months, so it is no surprise that two veteran insiders are the firm favourites to become the next open market account manager with the responsibility for carrying out the Fed's monetary policy directives. What is different this time, however, is that the two favourites are women: Joan Lovett, manager of the domestic open market desk, and Gretchen Greene, manager of the foreign open market desk. When the presidency was up for grabs earlier this year there was considerable speculation that the Fed might choose a woman. So the chances of a woman in the number two slot are now higher. Of the two likely candidates, Lovett might have an edge because her role as chief of domestic market operations is arguably more important than Greene's, who handles the Fed's activities in the currency markets. Greene, however, has a clear advantage in seniority and experience - she has run the foreign desk for more than 20 years, and was in the running for the job when McDonough was brought in from outside. She also happens to be married to Ed Yeo, a former under secretary of the US Treasury in the Ford administration. Yeo went on to do a stint as First Chicago's chief financial officer but quit after a boardroom row in 1980. He was replaced by McDonough. Whether this helps or hinders his wife's chances of promotion remains to be seen.</p>

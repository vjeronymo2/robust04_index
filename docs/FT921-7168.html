			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Observer: Hani the Greek Guess where Chris Hani, general secretary of the South African Communist Party, has chosen to educate his 10-year-old daughter? Hani, one of the world's few remaining true believers in communism, has enrolled his offspring at an elite Johannesburg private school. For R10,000 a year - more than the annual salary of most urban blacks - Lindiwe Hani is attending Saheti school, a Greek private school where Greek language lessons are compulsory. According to a Johannesburg newspaper, Hani chose the school because he was 'interested in Greek culture and religion'. He could not have been expected to send Lindiwe to a segregated black public school in Soweto; but he could have chosen one of the many white schools which have opened their doors to other races - at a fraction of the cost.</p>

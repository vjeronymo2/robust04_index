			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Do financial services match M&amp;S image?  -Disagreement between City experts and the leading UK retailer ONE OF the favourite lines trotted out by financial services groups launching products early in the 1980s was: 'We aim to become the Marks &amp; Spencer of financial services.' But the line went out of style once M&amp;S itself moved into financial services, first with a charge card and then unit trusts and personal loans. Since then, City people have taken to wondering if the M&amp;S role in financial services really lives up to its high street retailing image. Daniel Bunting, an investment strategist with Matheson Securities who specialises in the retail sector, said M&amp;S had not really applied the same principle to its financial services activities as to, say, selling clothes. In clothing, M&amp;S typically would deliver an extra value element by keeping margins lower than those of competitors while compensating with greater volume. But with unit trusts, for instance, while M&amp;S's charges were much in line with the rest of the market, he would have hoped to see them lower. Ian Lindsey, executive director of Save &amp; Prosper, said: 'Marks &amp; Spencer in financial services gives reasonable value for money, but not what you would call the upper quartile.' He added that the unit trusts could be described as only average while the charge card, acceptable only in the stores, offered no better quality of service than any bank-issued credit card. Anne McMeehan, managing director of Framlington Unit Trust Managers, said M&amp;S had a distinct disadvantage with investment products as opposed to others. 'No sell-by date - what you can't do is guarantee the quality you get out of a unit trust by saying it must be bought or sold by a certain date,' she noted. For M&amp;S, Robert Colvill, executive director of financial activities, said it was not true that margins on financial products were higher than on retail products, although he would not reveal comparative figures. Since 1985, when M&amp;S launched seriously into financial services, customer balances have grown from Pounds 91m to Pounds 451m. The first year's loss of Pounds 10m had become a profit of just over Pounds 5m by 1988/89 and was just over Pounds 15m for 1991/92. Colvill said he expected a further significant improvement this year. Pre-tax profitability in financial services has risen steadily from 16 per cent in 1988/89 to 27.2 per cent in 1991/92. Out of 2.4m cardholder accounts, M&amp;S estimates that 10 per cent are dormant, with no activity for the last six months. About one-third show a nil balance and the rest split roughly equally between those with a balance and paying interest and those not doing so. 'I don't pretend the card rate is low in absolute terms,' said Colvill, 'but, taking into account the interest-free period and no fee, it is less than other issuers charge.' He added that the group did not think it appropriate to charge a fee on its card while barring Access and Visa cards from the stores. Colvill said M&amp;S had been looking at accepting debit cards, with the idea of paying a processing cost comparable to that for cheques. 'What we don't accept is a significantly higher charge, an interchange fee passed back to the card-issuing bank,' he explained, noting that the banks also were trying to introduce this type of charge on debit cards. This supposedly was to compensate for fraud losses but, in fact, cost far more. Colvill says M&amp;S is deliberately staying below high street banks on rates for personal loans and overdrafts. This is possible. he explains, because the loans go to customers the group already knows well. Most of the 80,000 loans outstanding have been made to M&amp;S cardholders. With both cards and personal loans, he said M&amp;S used credit reference agencies more than banks and had developed more sophisticated uses of behavioural scoring, which awards and deducts points as debt is run up and paid off - or not. 'We can be alerted before an account goes wrong and adjust authorisation procedures,' he said, "This is more difficult for banks because they don't control the (retail) outlets.' M&amp;S has two unit trusts with 75,000 investors: the Pounds 110m Investment Portfolio, launched four years ago, and the Pounds 58m UK Selection. Latest statistics from Micropal rank the Investment Portfolio 11th out of 15 funds in the international balanced category, with an 11 per cent gain in the past three years on an offer-to-bid basis. The UK Selection portfolio ranked 74th out of 90 funds in the UK equity general class with a gain of 5 per cent over the same period. Colvill said that as the Investment Portfolio held mainly UK equities, it did not really fit into the international balanced category which primarily held bonds and foreign equities. It could also not be classed as a fund of funds, since it did not hold other unit trusts. Consultants Frank Russell constructed a mini-peer group. This ranked the Investment Portfolio against 11 other funds considered comparable, and brought it out ahead on asset growth. 'For example, the Investment Portfolio showed 39 per cent growth in assets over the four years, against Cazenove Portfolio's 37 per cent and CU Managed 36 per cent.' The UK Selection falls more clearly into the UK equity general category. 'I don't deny we have underperformed the UK equity sector by 5 per cent in the past three years,' said Colvill. 'We had a rough 1991 and a better, but only average, 1992. But we are very confident that we don't want to change because this portfolio is very much geared to recovery.' He explained that the portfolio of UK Selection had been designed specifically for the personal equity plan (Pep) market with an above-average level of income: about 70 per cent of the unit-holders were Pep investors. 'With the benefit of hindsight . . . high income has savagely underperformed and small companies even more savagely.' M&amp;S uses a variety of managers for each unit trust but refuses to talk about individual performances. 'They can be hired and fired but they should not have their figures discussed in public,' said Colvill. For the Investment Portfolio, the breakdown is 60 per cent UK equities, managed by a combination of BZW (for indexation). Robert Fleming (for growth) and GMO Woolley (for value-based investment using quant methods). A further 15 per cent of the portfolio is in bonds, managed by Phillips &amp; Drew, and 25 per cent is in international equities run by Clay Finlay, a firm run by two Englishmen in New York. The UK Selection fund is one-third in the hands of BZW for indexation, but tilted towards income. The rest is divided evenly between GMO Woolley, providing a value base with relatively high income, and Delaware, formed mostly by Hill Samuel breakaways who use a methodology involving discount models; a longer-term growth company approach with an income bias. For the future, Colvill says M&amp;S has some product development thoughts but will not be coming out with mortgages, a 'horde' of unit trusts, or investment trusts. But he stresses: 'We do believe firmly in organic growth wherever possible. It may be a little bit pedestrian and it may have taken us six or seven years but it is solid progress, we believe.'</p>

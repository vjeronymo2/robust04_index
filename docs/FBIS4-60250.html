			<p>CSO     [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The  Majles met yesterday chaired by Dr. Rowhani, and the deputies  from the cities of Khaf, Ahar, Marivan, Ahvaz, Shadegan, and  Lanjan gave speeches. At yesterday's session the general form of  the motion to consolidate the industrial ministries into one  ministry was approved almost unanimously by the deputies.  Summaries of the remarks of some supporters and opponents for  this motion were printed in yesterday's newspaper. We now direct  the attention of our esteemed readers to the detailed  proceedings.  <H5>  Habibollah Habibi, Deputy From Khaf And Rashtkhar </H5>   Social justice and economic and judicial security must be  secured for all the people.    The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Habibi, deputy from Khaf and Rashtkhar. He offered  congratulations on the new year and said: It is obedience to the  guidance from the vice regent of the Muslims that allows us to  hold our heads up high in the world today and has made our  foreign policy so decisive and uncompromising towards any type  of imperialism. We have become known throughout the world was an  anti-imperialist center.    He also said: Our combative and proud nation, with its firm  beliefs in the principles of the revolution, is today a refuge  for all the arisen nations.    From the most remote part of Africa to the heart of Europe,  from the tormented people of Bosnia to the combatants of Muru  [as published], from the brave combatants of Palestine and  Lebanon to the anti-imperialist factions in South America, the  eyes of all are fixed on Iran, this Islamic center.    Continuing, the speaker added: The exalted leader's  decisiveness, not only in foreign policy but also in every  detail of domestic policy, must guide the entire nation,  especially the officials and government leaders. Social justice  and economic and judicial security must be secured for all the  people.    He discussed the fact that in many areas of life and  society,  we have not been successful carrying out a proper and correct  plan. He said: Excessive price increases, improper economic  inflation, and the rising price of foreign exchange are the  topics of the day in every circle.  He also discussed the fact that officials should bring about  financial ease and security. He said: Today great strides have  been taken to bring about domestic security, protect land and  water borders and reinforce military and police forces, and our  land is no longer vulnerable. The power of the military and  mobilization forces, which still come from the heart of the  revolution, will defeat any kind of aggression from any  aggressor.    Continuing, the speaker said: Many steps have been taken to  maintain security in the eastern and southern parts of Khorasan,  but if economic and judicial security and decisiveness do not  exist in political and social matters and if the people are  worried, all that effort to maintain security cannot have the  desired results.    Habibi discussed the fact that unfortunately his electoral  district has not benefited well from the implementation of this  plan. He said: Regrettably I must say that in some sectors we  have begun to fall behind and stop progressing. An example is a  great task such as the Khaf Sangan iron mines, with reserves of  322 million tons and an average assay of 50 percent. These mines  were visited during a recent trip to the province of Khorasan by  the president of the republic, who issued the necessary orders  to equip them and get them started. Unfortunately, however, due  to the lack of sufficient credits the mines are not operating  and 250 workers are idle, adding to the region's unemployment.  In view of the cultural poverty and the fact that the area  borders on the Muslim country of Afghanistan, there is a  pronounced need for cultural and educational programs,  especially in education and training, culture and Islamic  guidance, and this should receive special attention from the  officials.    Continuing, he added: Sufficient attention is not being  given  to road-building programs. Late in the month of Esfand [20  February - 19 March], eight people lost their lives on the road  from Torbat-e Heydariyeh to Rashtkhar because floods had washed  away the bridge over the river. I ask the Ministry of Roads and  Transportation, the Ministry of Education and Training, the  Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, and the Ministry of  Mines and Metals to give more attention to these important  matters.    The speaker also said: In view of the size and population of  the province of Khorasan, especially the sacred city of Mashhad,  which receives 12 million pilgrims per year, the distribution of  national and province credits is unjust compared to the nation's  other provinces.    In conclusion he then said: I thank and praise the  management  and other province officials for doing what they could to draw  credits in the year 1372 [21 March 1993 - 20 March 1994], and I  ask the Ministry of the Interior to take serious and rapid  measures to divide the province, which is the desire of the  province's deputies.  <H5>  Valiollah Ahmadi Zadsaray, Deputy From Ahar </H5>   The next speaker was Zadsaray, deputy from Ahar. He offered  congratulations on the new year and said: Since the beginning of  the triumph of the Islamic revolution, the Great Satan,  world-devouring America, has not relented for an instant in its  hostility to Islam and the revolution, and has plotted openly  and secretly against Islam and our Islamic nation. It has used  military attacks and economic embargos to cause problems for the  Islamic Republic of Iran, and its intention is to destroy the  revolution, but through the strength of divine power and the  prophetic guidance of the late Imam and the exalted leader, it  has been frustrated and has had its hopes dashed every day.    Continuing, Zadsaray thanked the minister of agriculture for  visiting the projects under way in the deprived areas of Ahar  and Hashtgerd, he thanked the president of the republic for  financial assistance starting the Free Islamic University, he  thanked the deputy minister of the interior for development for  visiting Ahar and Haris, and he thanked the governor-general of  East Azarbaijan for dealing with the problems of the people from  his electoral district.  <H5>  Mohammad 'Ali Karimi, Deputy From Marivan </H5>   To move ahead in our work this year, we deputies and  executive officials must act in accordance with the exalted  leader's orders.    The next speaker was Karimi, deputy from Marivan. In his  speech he discussed the plots by world imperialism against the  Islamic Republic of Iran. He said: It is incumbent upon those of  us who want to have the Islam of Mohammad to use our effort and  power in any way possible to frustrate the filthy plots of world  imperialism, especially world-devouring America and usurper  Israel, and to make them regret their shameful acts forever.    He asked the government to think about a solution for the  vulnerable classes so they will no longer be subjected to the  pressures of life, inflation and high prices and so they will be  able more easily to obtain what they need.    He added: It is incumbent upon us deputies to make more  effort in this area and to take positive and effective steps to  make life easier for the ever-present-on-the-scene people. To  move ahead in our work this year, we deputies and executive  officials must act in accordance with the exalted leader's  orders. In his New Year's message he said: In the year 1373 [21  March 1994-20 March 1995], let there be a work ethic and social  order.    At all times and under all circumstances, the Council of  Ministers and the nation's executive officials must think of the  peace of mind and the lives of the people, and they must guide  the nation's economy in view of the fact that our country is  like most developing nations.    The deputy from Marivan thanked the president of the  republic  for his attention to Sunni brothers and clergymen, and he also  praised the governor-general of Kordestan for attending to the  demands of the area's people.    Continuing, Karimi issued memos to the minister of roads and  transportation, the minister of petroleum, the minister of labor  and social affairs, the minister of culture and higher  education, and the minister of housing and urban construction  concerning asphalting the roads from Marivan to Sanandaj and  Marivan to Saqz, providing gas service to Marivan, creating  employment for unemployed people, establishing the Payam-e Nur  University, whose preliminary steps have been taken, and  beginning the project to build the Marivan hospital.    He also asked for help and cooperation from the minister of  agriculture; the minister of the reconstruction crusade; and the  minister of energy concerning the timely transfer of  agricultural entities to farmers, putting the destroyed wells of  Marivan back into operation, and providing electrical power to  the rural areas. He asked for help and cooperation from the  minister of the interior; the minister of education and  training; the minister of health care, treatment and medical  education; the minister or economic and social affairs; and the  chief of the Central Bank in alleviating the problem of idleness  among the residents of the border strip rural areas; issuing  authorization to conduct development and service projects;  paying unpaid wartime overtime wages to teachers; dealing with  the malfunctions and the situation at Allahu Akbar Hospital; and  providing low-profit interest-free loans to the exalted families  of martyrs, wounded war veterans, and former prisoners of war to  procure housing.  <H5>  Seyyed Mohammad Reza Movalizade, Deputy From Ahvaz </H5>   Human rights are not observed in any country as much as they  are observed in the Islamic Republic of Iran.    The fourth pregenda speaker was Movalizadeh, deputy from  Ahvaz. He discussed the anniversary of cutting political  relations with America. He said: Applying the valuable guidance  from the leader of the revolution concerning attention to the  work ethic and social order will undoubtedly play an important  role in creating change in the activities of our agents and  reforming as much as possible the social relations in our  growing society.    He commemorated the martyrdom anniversary of the basiji  artist Avini. He said: Based on existing statistics, the  government was successful in many areas during the First  Five-Year Plan. It is hoped that during the Second Five-Year  Plan the problems will be overcome in such areas as employment,  providing housing for low-income people, reforming the  administrative structure and increasing nonoil exports.    There is no doubt that collecting taxes from the prosperous  classes is strong leverage for redistributing wealth in society  and creating social justice. It is completely clear that whoever  has more income should pay more taxes. Doing this requires  decisiveness, avoiding condescension and caution, and a  revolutionary spirit. In this regard I ask the minister of  economic and financial affairs to make every effort to reform  the nation's tax system.    Continuing, he said: Approving the general form of the  Consumer Rights Protection Bill should open the door to serious  economic support for the deprived and vulnerable classes. Those  who sell at high prices must fear the sharp sword of the law,  and no one must permit himself to fan the flames of unreasonable  and unregulated inflation. Today our society has a sharp thirst  for government decisiveness dealing with the economic  terrorists. I ask the Government of Saudi Arabia to scrupulously  observe the provisions of the treaty signed with the Islamic  Republic of Iran in the year 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992],  and not to increase the burden of its sin any further by  sabotaging implementation of this divine duty. Human rights are  not observed in any country as much as they are observed in the  Islamic Republic of Iran.    Continuing, Movalizade noted: It is most regrettable that  the  secretary-general of the United Nations has forgotten the  credibility of his position and has become a listless, dependent  tool of criminal America. With his weak approaches to  international problems, every day he brings this organization  closer to collapse and destruction.    He said the Government of Armenia is the main cause of the  crash of the Iranian aircraft. He said: This country must offer  the international organizations an explanation and an apology  for committing these crimes and it must pay the necessary  reparations.    Noting that nothing new was said at the 50th meeting of the  Gulf Cooperation Council, he said: In the face of the repetition  of the vain claims of the past, we must state once more that  according to reputable international documents and evidence, the  three Iranian islands are undeniably part of the soil of the  Islamic Republic of Iran, and that we will act whenever and  wherever necessary to protect and guard every inch of our sacred  soil, just as we did during the eight-year defense against the  invasion of the Ba'thist occupiers.    He added: The Government of Turkey must realize that it  cannot suppress the rightful demands of Muslims with threats and  fear, which were expressed in the mayoral elections. The period  of leaning to the West and the spread of secular thinking in the  Islamic lands has long since come to an end.    The deputy from Ahvaz expressed thanks for the efforts of  the  health care and treatment workers of the province of Khuzestan  and he asked the minister of health care and treatment to help  as much as possible to make use of the experience of these dear  retired people.    In conclusion he asked the minister of roads and  transportation to deal with the province's malfunctioning roads.  <H5>  'Isa Moqadamizad, Deputy From Shadegan </H5>   Moqadamizad was another preagenda speaker. During his speech  he offered congratulations on the new year. He said: Every day  we see the publication of various and numerous magazines and  publications by the executive organizations, and if the matter  is studied carefully, it will be seen that their readers are  very few. The result is nothing other than wasting of the public  treasury. I ask the president of the republic to give the  required order in this regard.    Continuing, he said: Unfortunately in some offices and  institutions sabotage, working too little and bribery are on the  increase every day, and this kind of illicit behavior will make  the sacrificing people pessimistic, anxious and uncomfortable. I  ask that the violators be dealt with seriously and decisively.    He then said: In view of the lack of water in the province  of  Khorasan, the effects of drought such as the lack of feed and  the drying of fields are evident in most of the province's  municipalities. The minister of the interior and the minister of  the reconstruction crusade must take the necessary steps to  compensate for these losses.    The deputy from Shadegan then offered thanks for the visit  from the President's Council of Payam-e Nur University with  regard to the establishment of this university in Shadegan.  <H5>  Mohsen Kuhkan, Deputy From Lanjan (Zarrinshahr) and Mobarakeh </H5>   I remind the Ministry of Post and Telegraph that any  violation of Majles legislation will meet with a legal response  from the Majles.    The final preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Kuhkan, deputy from Lanjan (Zarrinshahr) and  Mobarakeh. During his speech he said: These days coincide with  the anniversary of cutting relations with world-devouring  America, this oppressive government, which is the greatest  supporter of terrorism, and is indeed itself a terrorist  government, a government that uses human rights as a pretext to  commit the greatest crimes against the rights of the oppressed  and against human societies such as the Muslims of Palestine,  Bosnia and Herzegovina and other parts of the world.    Continuing, Kuhkan issued memos to the nation's executive  officials. He said: At the beginning of the year 1373 the  exalted leader called for a "work ethic" and "social order." The  nation's executive officials must answer that call by exercising  more supervision, implementing policies of encouragement and  punishment, and expediting administrative reform in the country  in such a way that it reduces the size of the administrative  organizations and reinforces the spirit of commitment and taking  the part of the people.    The speaker also said: Just as the exalted leader said  concerning the Five-Year Plan and the 1372 [21 March 1993-20  March 1994] Budget Bill, privatizing is not a goal, although we  are emphasizing doing it quickly, properly and strongly, unless  the nation's executive managers are careful to have the  resources used in this way and the facilities transferred serve  the purpose of encouraging and starting work, rather than, God  forbid, having a large unrestricted portion of the Muslim  treasury be siphoned into the pockets of a few people.    Kuhkan said our own forces have done very good things to  help  the Islamic nation rebuild and achieve self-sufficiency. He  said: These positive measures must be mentioned and those  involved must be thanked and praised.    He reminded the management of some industrial centers in the  municipalities of Lanjan and Mobarakeh, who have not given  enough attention to helping the adjoining area. He said: Just as  the president of the republic emphasized in his trip of 1371 [21  March 1992-20 March 1993], these centers should help solve some  of the problems in the municipalities. I expect measures to be  taken quickly to secure the views of the president of the  republic and the people of the region.    Continuing, Kuhkan added: For some time in the province of  Esfahan we have seen trips abroad being made by people who  themselves should be advising others to be careful about the  economic affairs of Muslims. I hope these trips were not purely  for recreation and God forbid that the sponsors for some of the  trips were not the region's industrial centers and management.    At the end of his speech the deputy from Zarrinshahr and  Mobarakeh said: Just as the deputies know, in the 1373 budget  law we have given authorization according to the law to some  executive organizations to raise prices on some services and  goods. It is appropriate that I remind the Ministry of Post and  Telegraph that Majles legislation concerning postal expenses  limits increases to 50 percent of the rates for the year 1372,  and no more. Concerning telephone communications, as far as I  know, each telephone signal is no more than three minutes, but  it seems that two and one-half minutes has been calculated for  the year 1373. On the one hand the base price for an increase of  2, 3, and 4 rials [R] as given in Paragraph J, Note 25 is R10,  and what has been announced is more than that. What the Majles  has approved and enacted and what has also been approved by the  Guardian Council must be the basis of the work and it must be  precisely implemented. The slightest violation of Majles  legislation will definitely meet with a legal response from the  Majles and the deputies.  <H5>  Legislation </H5> <H5>  Deputy From Minab's Question to Former Minister of the </H5> Interior    The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was the report from the Articles 88 and 90 Commission  concerning the deputy from Minab's question to the former  minister of the interior on the procedures for the research and  expert work that has been done to build the Minab River flood  wall.    The commission's view concerning the aforementioned  question:    In view of the fact that in his answer to the respected  deputy from Minab the respected former minister of the interior  said that the expert work on the aforementioned project was done  by the Satiran Company, and on the other hand that the  aforementioned company announced that it was not present at any  stage of the project's study, planning, supervision or  construction, and also in view of the report from the inspector  sent there who announced that the planning was not done by the  Satiran Company and that the Luzan Company, which the former  minister of the interior said was the project's executor, has no  background in this area, the commission therefore finds the  answer unsatisfactory.  <H5>  Motion To Consolidate Ministries of Industry </H5>   The second item on the agenda was the report from the first  consultation of the Joint Administrative and Employment Affairs  and Industries and Mines Commission Concerning the Motion To  Consolidate the Ministries of Industry, the Ministry of Heavy  Industries, and the Ministry of Mines and Metals and to form a  Ministry of Industries and Mines.    After a talk by Mr. Rashidi, representative of the joint  commission, supporters and opponents of the motion spoke, most  of whose remarks were published in yesterday's issue. As the  session continued, Qabal Qashqavi spoke in opposition to the  consolidation. He said: So far we have not had and do not have  any problem with the structure of industry and we have had no  motions or bills to solve this problem. In my view the position  and responsibilities of industry in our country have been  specified and there has been no overlap anywhere.    He then said: In the Second Five-Year Plan let us authorize  responsibilities and specify complexes that the government  should create, and after those responsibilities are carried out,  let us create an administrative structure.    Qashqavi also added: Between you and me, is the discussion  of  transfers a discussion about consolidation and nonconsolidation,  or is it a discussion about motivations and other issues? Even  if you do not have the motivation of privatization, the  consolidation still will not succeed.    Ramazanpur was the next supporter of consolidating the  ministries of industry. During his speech he said: When we  discuss the performance of an industrial ministry, we must  determine its role in elevating the level of manpower,  developing technology and developing the country. It is entirely  regrettable that I must say that based on the report from the  Statistics Organization, 97.5 percent of our work force lacks  specialist credentials. We want to fight world imperialism  through economic development. Can this development grow with  this manpower composition in industry?    He then said: Today our nation is determined to be  independent. What products do we produce right now? The nation's  customs statistics are nothing at all to be proud of for any  Iranian. In the year 1371 we had about $29 billion in registered  import orders. We must look to see where we are. What is the  level of our industrial exports? The ministers of industry must  answer that question. He then said: The more we delay this  motion, the more problems we will have with the fate of the  Councils Law. Approval of this motion is therefore a national  necessity.    Sadatian was another of the bill's opponents. After the  recess he said in his remarks: In this regard one must consider  the government's executive capability. Today does the government  itself have enough executive ability to carry out this  consolidation, or will it excuse itself? The year 1373 is a  difficult year for us in terms of oil revenues. Why do we want  to create an executive problem for ourselves this year?    He added: I myself am in favor of reforming the nation's  administrative structure. What we are saying is that at a time  when the government is not ready to do this, if we want to  impose that task, we will only impose added pressure and  disruption.    Then Ahmad Nateq-Nuri spoke in favor of the aforementioned  bill. He said: The Majles is doing this precisely for the  purpose of carrying out infrastructure work. Between the First  and Second Five-Year Plans, when we have an interval of time, if  this is not the time to do this, then when will be the right  time? This is precisely the time when we should reform the  nation's administrative structure and base the Second Five-Year  Plan on that.    He added: The three ministers themselves said this task  should be done at the end of the First Five-Year Plan.  Therefore, now is the best time to do this. Now the Hapco  Company [as published], which belongs to the Ministry of Heavy  Industries, builds the heavy machinery, and on the other hand  the Ministry of Industries imports these machines, which are  piled up at Bandar 'Abbas. We want to stand on our own feet in  industry. We also proposed that all offices outside the country  be centralized.    The final opponent was Mr. Luruzadeh. During his talk on  this  subject he said: Consolidation of the industrial ministries will  mean centralized policy making. My question, however, is when  will one minister be able to make policy? If it works the way  things have been going and the prevailing system remains in use,  each person will carry out his own special responsibilities  wherever he is placed. If the government and the Majles set  customs duties, taxes and commercial profits fees in such a way  that the domestic sector can compete with foreigners, it  certainly will not be economical for that gentleman to import  earth grading machinery.    We are not opposed to the term consolidation, but there  needs  to be a basis for this.    Ansari also spoke as the final supporter. He said: When are  we going to lay the groundwork for consolidation? This  groundwork was laid during the First Five-Year Plan. To discuss  research for industrial development, we need three tools  (manpower, knowledge, and technology). We will have knowledge  and technology when we are able to invest in research. Dividing  these three ministries works against this goal. We have not been  able to work well in the area of industrial research.  <H5>  Government's View of Consolidation </H5>   Mohajerani, the government's representative, said: first of  all, the question of reforming the structure of the government  is not something anyone opposes. The question is, how, when,  under what conditions, with what goals, and using what procedure?    To consolidate we need criteria and standards which must be  fully evaluated, so no problem will be created.    Continuing, he added: The question of the work of mines,  metals, geology, exploration and extracting copper and steel is  one thing, the question of the work of light and heavy industry  is something else. Of course, all of these come under the  general heading of industry, just as soccer, volleyball, and  basketball all involve the use of a ball. With the common  element of a ball, one cannot combine all these games and  proceed easily. That is, in practice boundaries must be kept in  mind.    He also said: For consolidation, one must pay attention to  appropriate growth and the necessary readiness. With regard to  mines, metals and heavy industry, because they are younger and  their structures are easier to reform, this work has been done,  and the organizational positions at the province centers have  been minimized.    Continuing, the government's representative also said: Among  the things talked about in the government was the fact that  consolidation does not mean we can consolidate these ministries  with a bill, but let us not get into the issue of quality  concerning this task. The goal is not to perpetuate the status  quo under the same conditions and with increasing numbers of  deputy ministers. The goal is a single organizational structure.    He said: Until these industries are transferred to the  private sector, it will not be possible to bring this entire  complex into one organizational structure. That is, the entire  body of the ministries must also be reformed. The government  representative discussed the fact that transferring parts of the  ministries to the nongovernment sector has not had the necessary  success. He said: Some countries who have fewer ministries or  more ministries are worth studying with regard to government  management of industry.    He then added: We know from experience that as soon as the  subject of consolidation arises, there is a kind of insecurity,  and in any case a state of disturbance develops in these staffs  and we will have a state of near shutdown in the most sensitive  sector. We are in such a hurry to consolidate that we do not  want to wait until the Second Five-Year Plan is approved to  understand the extent of consolidation and then begin.    As the government, we do not consider it in our interest to  discuss consolidation in this way before the Second Five-Year  Plan.    The commission representative noted that the views of the  opposition deputies and the government representative can be  summarized in several points: One is that we should wait for the  Second Five-Year Plan. The second is that the intermediate  industries may become dominant. The third is that there is no  cooperation and unity and that this is a precipitous plan.    The commission representative said that the government has  become small and lean and that for some time since the division  of these ministries there has been the problem of which ministry  to put an industry in. He said: That is, these industries have  been so mixed together and fused into one that they have not  been able to separate them.    He discussed the fact that the joint commission has voted  unanimously for this proposal. He said: The Administrative and  Employment Affairs Commission, which is now working on the  government's enormous organizations, is 100 percent in favor of  this consolidation.    He discussed the points of overlap. It is very strange if we  say there is no unity and cooperation among these ministries.  They were one, and because of the interests of the revolution  they were separated for a time. Now they are to be consolidated,  and there was really nothing about them to be separated.    Then a secret vote was taken by paper ballot with 171 votes  in favor, 18 votes opposed, and 10 abstentions. Five deputies  also did not vote, and in the end the general form of the Bill  to Consolidate the Ministries of Industry was approved.  <H5>  Bill Forming General and Revolutionary Courts </H5>   The final item on the agenda was the report from the second  consultation of the Judicial Affairs Commission concerning the  Bill To Form General and Revolutionary Courts, continued  consideration of whose details was postponed to the next session.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Kurdish protests leave 45 dead FIFTEEN people were killed in clashes between troops and Kurdish demonstrators in south-east Turkey yesterday, bringing the weekend's death toll to 45, Reuter reports from Diyarbakir. The violence was some of the worst since the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) began its fight for an independent state in 1984. The worsening crisis has dimmed hopes that the four-month-old government of prime minister Mr Suleyman Demirel will be able to solve what he describes as Turkey's biggest problem. Security officials said 10 people were killed and 20 wounded in the town of Nusaybin on the Syrian border as troops clashed with marchers.

The PKK had threatened an uprising to coincide with Saturday's Kurdish New Year in the impoverished south-east which has seen seven years of PKK insurgency in which more than 3,400 people have been killed. Protests swept other south-eastern towns yesterday. The government accused PKK guerrillas of provoking trouble. Witnesses said the PKK, which had urged its supporters to launch a popular uprising to coincide with the spring festival of Nowrouz, put masked gunmen into the streets to back youngsters building barricades.

Many are integrated into Turkish life and have little sympathy for the PKK's armed campaign in which more than 3,400 people have been killed. But the latest violence has underlined the failure of successive governments to dent the PKK's popularity among disaffected Kurds in the impoverished south-east. It will make it harder for Kurdish nationalist members of parliament to stay in the conservative social democrat coalition government led by Mr Demirel. Kurds in towns like Cizre, located on a bend in the Tigris river near Turkey's borders with Syria and Iraq, say raw repression remains the order of the day. 'The government treats us like animals,' said a relative of a boy shot dead on Saturday. 'We will fight back.'</p>

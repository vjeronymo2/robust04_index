			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Friends, Please Join the Ranks of </F> Volunteers"]    [Text] The "Chinese Young Volunteers' Action" under the  theme of "enthusiastically dedicating oneself to society and  warming human hearts" took off across the country some time  between last winter and this spring, bringing a breath of fresh  air to society and receiving favorable widespread comments.    The "Chinese Young Volunteers' Action" is a key part of the  "Cross-century Youth Spiritual Civilization" project sponsored  by the Chinese Communist Youth League. The project has enriched  and developed the drive to learn from Lei Feng in a new format  to match the new era and is a new way to foster the "four  have's" new generation and promote ideological and educational  youth work. The project counts on the participation of young  volunteers, orients toward society, and provides sustained and  detailed voluntary services such as public labor, environmental  protection, rescue and relief operation, community service, law  and order, and the defense of youth rights.    Since reform and opening up, there has been a boom in modern  developments and projects. A large number of ambitious,  hardworking, enterprising, pragmatic, dedicated, advanced, and  Lei Feng-style people have emerged in various trades and  professions. However, money worship, hedonism, and extreme  individualism have also grown in some localities, and  indifference to suffering and refusals to help in emergencies  are often reported. The party and government have stressed  repeatedly that in developing a socialist market economic  system, it is necessary to vigorously educate people in arduous  struggle, thrift, nation-building, and vocational and social  ethics with the aim of voluntarily resisting and overcoming  various negative and corrupt phenomena and creating a better  opinion and social climate for reform, opening up, and socialist  modernization. The "Chinese Young Volunteers' Action" was  initiated against such a background. It can actively promote  good social morality; encourage solidarity, friendliness,  helpfulness, courageous acts, and selfless dedication; boost  patriotism and collectivism; strengthen socialist spiritual  civilization; and raise ideological, moral, and scientific  quality of youth.    The activities are characterized by attention to  self-education and stress on voluntary participation, which  turns "being made to participate" into "me participating,"  allowing the majority of youths to join activities and services  to help others and society, while having their souls purified  and forming a correct outlook on life. They will have a chance  to continually improve themselves morally, cultivate themselves,  raise their quality, and finally turn into talented,  disciplined, cultured, and morally sound youths with ideals and  who work for the socialist cause. Therefore, from the very  beginning, these activities spread very quickly across the large  cities, illustrating their vitality.    The Chinese Young Volunteers' Action has had a good  beginning. Tens of thousands of young people across the  countries have participated actively in this great project with  enthusiasm and love. In launching this activity, localities  should take note of their local conditions and ensure voluntary  participation, that they go only as far as their abilities  permit, work for results, and sustain their efforts. Only a  pragmatic approach can deepen and sustain these activities,  which will foster a generation of new people in the  "Cross-century Youth Spiritual Civilization."    The times call for more volunteers! Friends, join the ranks  of the volunteers. Let more people contribute voluntary  services toward a fundamental change for the better in the  social climate and the progress and civilization of human  society.</p>

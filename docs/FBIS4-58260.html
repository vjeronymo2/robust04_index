			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Jordanian-Saudi relations, tense since the Gulf  war, have witnessed yet another setback. In spite of some  mediation attempts to reduce the tension, the Jordanian-Saudi  relationship has now plummeted to an all-time low, especially in  the wake of King Husayn's visit to the holy land to perform the  minor pilgrimage. The surprise then was that Saudi officials did  not observe the simplest rules of tact and protocol stipulated  by international norms.    What happened last week was another negative incident that  reflects a Saudi desire to escalate the official quarrel. Saudi  Arabia has issued an official statement saying it is taking care  of the reconstruction of holy sites through UNESCO.    The seriousness of this statement is that it came only hours  after Jordan's grand, official celebration of the unveiling of  the dome and a plaque that set 18 April, 1994 as the date the  reconstruction of the Dome of the Rock was finished and the  repair work on the Salah-al-Din pulpit, burned by the Zionists  in 1968 when they burned the al-Aqsa Mosque, was begun.    Jordan chose not to reply officially to the Saudi statement,  leaving facts on the ground to speak for themselves. Except for  an editorial in a daily, all comments by Saudi media at home and  abroad which elaborated on the Saudi official statement were  absolutely ignored by Jordan.    As background to this incident, it should be mentioned that  three years ago, UNESCO proposed a plan to refurbish the al-Aqsa  Mosque, in coordination with Israel, since it is the occupying  power that controls Palestinian land. Israel encouraged this  step. Jordan, however, rejected this approach when it received  a message, just like all other countries, to contribute to the  reconstruction of the al-Aqsa Mosque.

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Legal jousting is the game of the Names: The scale of two court victories by Lloyd's insurance market victims Mr Michael Sword-Daniels, a dentist who joined the Lloyd's of London insurance market in 1987, this week cracked open a bottle of champagne. 'I burst into tears,' he said, after celebrating the first good news since he was warned, four years ago, that his investment had turned sour. Two significant court victories this week offered a glimmer of hope for thousands of members such as Mr Sword-Daniels, who are seeking compensation to cope with crippling financial demands. After several years of stress and personal tragedy a judgment in the High Court on Wednesday brought some hope to individuals under pressure to pay their share of the enormous losses at Lloyd's during the late 1980s. In a second case, on the same day, the House of Lords ruled that two 'action groups', representing members of some of the highest loss-making syndicates, could sue the agents who acted for them. 'There are moments when you get so depressed it is like looking down the barrel of a shot-gun,' said Mr Sword-Daniels, whose losses are now estimated at more than Pounds 500,000. He is one of two Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally underwritten the insurance market, who was awarded damages in the High Court against H G Poland, now called KMR Services, the members' agency which looked after their interests at Lloyd's. Mr Sword-Daniels says he had asked H G Poland to place him on underwriting syndicates involved in conservative, low-risk business, but was in fact placed with some of the highest-risk syndicates. Mr Richard Brown, the second Name in the case, requested some higher risk business but claims his agent still failed to provide adequate professional advice. For distressed Names, who are deploying a variety of legal tactics in their efforts to win compensation for heavy losses, the settlements were the first sign that the tide might be turning in their favour. They also set a precedent in that the award included not only compensation payments in respect of past losses (the size is still to be decided in the high court), but also a highly unusual indemnity against losses incurred in the future. The award was a fillip for Mr David Tiplady, of the law firm D J Freeman, which represented Mr Brown and is overseeing similar claims by another 28 Names. He said he has been approached by other Names seeking to emulate Mr Brown's success. Mr John Startin of Hexstall, Mr Sword-Daniels' lawyer, said: 'It is an important route if there is a serious hiccup with the group actions.' However, the initial celebration among Lloyd's names after the High Court case has been followed by a sober realisation that its impact will be limited. Others seeking to follow the route taken by Mr Sword-Daniels and Mr Brown will have to prove their cases on the individual merits of each, demonstrating that their requests for conservative underwriting were ignored. That may be difficult, partly because few instructions from Names to managing agents were committed to paper; most were conducted by word of mouth. There is also the possibility that the members' agent will appeal. As a result, Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, lays more stress on the second legal victory for Names this week  - won by his group, along with the Feltrim Action group, in the House of Lords. This threw out an attempt to block the action groups' claim that their members' agents were contractually liable for negligent underwriting. It cleared the way for the Gooda Walker case to begin in the High Court on April 26, and the Feltrim case in October. Mr Deeny represents more than 3,100 Names allocated to the four heavily loss-making Gooda Walker underwriting syndicates on Lloyd's who are suing for more than Pounds 600m. But the Action Group's approach to litigation is different from that of Mr Sword-Daniels and Mr Brown. They believe that, if they can prove that they were the victims of negligent underwriting, this will lead automatically to compensation for all the Names involved in their legal action. 'We just have to prove that a few underwriters were negligent and that's it,' says Mr Deeny. He warned that the publicity surrounding the High Court decision risked causing false expections: 'It could lead to hundreds or thousands of Names trying the same approach, which is going to be a wasted effort.' But it is too late for other Names to join the Gooda Walker and a number of other action groups. 'The doors closed on our action last September,' said Mr Deeny. Moreover, Names who have not already begun legal proceedings will have to wait for redress as the courts are clogging up with Lloyd's-related litigation. 'Anybody who decided to begin today will go to the back of the longest queue in the world,' said Mr Deeny. Even for those who are in the action groups, Mr Deeny did not expect any quick surrender from the members' agents. 'The errors and omissions insurers (who cover Lloyd's agents against legal awards for negligence) dare not settle. They take on every point, fight every issue and hope to burn out some action groups.' Mr Tiplady, Mr Brown's solicitor, added: 'If the agents fight every claim it will be expensive and time-consuming. It's very nerve-wracking being cross-examined.' The only other legal option which might have been open to Names was to sue Lloyd's for failing to regulate the market adequately. However, under the act of parliament which sets the statutory framework for the insurance market, Lloyd's is immune from litigation  - a point already upheld by the courts. There was one non-legal alternative: an omnibus out-of-court settlement proposed by Lloyd's at the end of last year, which offered Pounds 900m to cover claims of Pounds 3.2bn. At the time, Mr David Rowland, the chairman, doubted whether Names would have the stamina to pursue legal action. But, believing it was too small, Names voted in February to reject the settlement. However, even if the Names prove successful in winning their legal cases against members' agents, there is a sting in the tail. Few are likely to receive back all the money they seek because the value of members agents' insurance cover is far less than the losses incurred by the Lloyd's market. The first to win their cases may take the lions' share of the funds available in what some Names describe as a 'dash for cash'. Each claim that is settled will add to the demands being made on Names because many are on syndicates that underwrote errors and omissions business. Meanwhile, Lloyd's will continue to pursue the Names to meet their obligations on the market. The likely result is that, alongside any lucky Names able to win awards in time to pay off their debts, there will be many losers.</p>

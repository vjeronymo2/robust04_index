			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Simferopol April 8 TASS -- Not counting the Balkans,  the Crimea is the most militarized place in Europe now,  according to Valery Kuznetsov, military aide to the Crimean  president.    In a conversation with ITAR-TASS on Friday, Kuznetsov  pointed  out that, besides the Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's naval  forces, around 50 thousand Ukrainian soldiers and officers are  concentrated on the peninsula. The amount of military personnel  located here was twice as small before the dissolution of the  Soviet Union.    The presidential aide expressed his doubts in the necessity  of maintaining such powerful military forces in the Crimea.  Referring to operational information, Kuznetsov noted that the  Ukrainian Defence Ministry "plans to increase its military  presence in the Crimea".    The recent sudden visit of Ukraine's military leaders to the  peninsula caused sharp indignation in the area and a sharp  retaliatory statement from Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov.  Similar steps by Kiev, Kuznetsov declared, are not only "a form  of pressure, but possible training before future actions  intended to change the situation in the Crimea".</p>

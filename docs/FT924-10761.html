			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Money Markets: German policy tight RATES in the sterling cash market continued to ease yesterday as dealers waited to see whether the chancellor will signal a cut in base rates to coincide with tonight's Mansion House speech, writes James Blitz. However, Euromark futures were pushed lower as hopes vanished of an official rate cut at today's Bundesbank meeting. The Bundesbank dashed hopes of an easing by allocating 'repo' funds to the cash market at a minimum interest rate of 8.75 per cent, a level that was unchanged from last week. Sterling markets continue to be the most bullish in Europe. Many people assume that another base rate cut is in the offing. That expectation was reflected in dealers' unwillingness to offer bills to the Bank of England yesterday. The Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 800m at the start of yesterday's operations, but, in the morning, the authorities only bought Pounds 124m in a repurchase agreement at the established rate of 7 15/16 per cent. Dealers had probably offered to sell bills at lower rates, but were turned down. Later, the market relaxed, and Pounds 715m of liquidity was added in the afternoon after the Bank increased the shortage to Pounds 850m. One-month money, at which a lot of banks do their market borrowing, closed at around 8 3/8 per cent from a previous close of 8 per cent. The 3-month rate dropped from around 7 13/16 per cent to 7 1/2 per cent, the lowest it has been since the last base rate cut. Some dealers were expecting conditions to be much tighter today. There may be heavier speculation on a rate cut, and assets will not be sold easily. The Bundesbank signalled in its money market operations that there will be no official rate change after it refrained from engineering a reduction in short-term rates in the weekly round of securities repurchase agreements. Mr Hermann Rempsberger, chief economist at BHF bank in Frankfurt, was quoted as saying that he would be very surprised if there was a change in official policy today. 'The repo rates will have to move first,' he said. The December Euromark contract closed down 7 basis points from its opening level at 91.73, suggesting that 3-month money will be at 8.27 per cent by Christmas. December French franc futures closed unchanged at 90.91.</p>

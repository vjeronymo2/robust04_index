			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Arts: A bad dream of the Sixties - Union Chapel Bad Boy Johnny and the Prophets of Doom is, apparently, a cult musical in Australia. That does not necessarily make it awful but somehow explains its superfluousness. It is like everyone's bad dream of a sixties happening. For a start it is being presented in a church, the grand and monumental Union Chapel in Islington. This is supposed to make it daring and experimental but only ensures an awful acoustic, restricted acting space, and a slight feeling of unease. Then it still believes in the sixties myth that rock and roll is the new religion, and a guitar hero the natural Messiah. Finally it takes to the witless limit that sixties freedom to debunk everything, to, well, swear in church. Daniel Abineri, who with a credit for book, music, lyrics and direction can be named as the guilty man, has the sweet idea that by making his main protagonist, Father Maclean, a murderer, rapist, and swindler, his rock musical is going to frighten the horses. Throw in a Pope who comes on like a Mafia boss, and Abineri has stood civilisation on its head. With such naughtiness, who needs characterisation and plot? Sadly, no one involved in this superficial romp seems to share Abineri's bravura. The cast are like hapless victims, stuck waiting for the next musical number. Luckily the songs are rather good, a pastiche of old fashioned guitar rock so currently out of fashion that it hits you with its novelty. There is also some under-used video play, but none of those psychedelic blobs, that excess of incense, which made earlier happenings in churches so much fun a generation ago. Craig Ferguson (an alternative comedian of some note) works at being bad as Father Maclean but soon realises that, with a script trivialised into rhyming couplets, it is hardly worth the effort. Mark Shaw (singer with the band Then Jericho) looks butch enough as Johnny, the choir boy selected by Maclean as the next Pope-star, but he would be more convincing if he actually played the guitar he cradles on stage. Only Stephen Marcus as a Pope enters into the tackiness of it all. If you think the spectacle of a topless nun trying to give the Holy Father a heart attack as he sits before an altar is a dynamic coup de theatre, go to Johnny. You also get a tall lady in white suspenders stalking our hero with a gun; the heavily predictable sight of Father Maclean turning his waters into wine; and a chorus dressed as school girls. Perhaps it could have been fun in a more liberated venue; perhaps the church still holds enough power over mind to reduce Johnny to tasteless posturing. This is really little more than an exercise in cheap publicity to promote an album of retro rock.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Fears on government competence cloud sales rise The proportion of business leaders reporting increased sales volumes and profits rose sharply last month, but their optimism about the economy fell, largely as a result of political uncertainty. In the Institute of Directors' bi-monthly survey of business opinion, based on some 300 interviews, 70 per cent of directors reported an increase in the volume of their company's business compared with six months earlier - up from 61 per cent in February. There was also a rise in directors reporting increased profits, to 59 per cent in April from 52 per cent in February. However, the balance of directors more optimistic about the economy over those less optimistic fell to 33 percentage points in April, from 38 points in February. Twenty-four per cent - the biggest single group - of those who were less optimistic cited government incompetence as their main reason. A further 15 per cent pointed to lack of demand, and 9 per cent to tax increases. Of those who were more optimistic, mainly as a result of increased economic activity, 6 per cent said factors such as political uncertainty and government incompetence had restrained their optimism. Thirty-four per cent said the April tax increases had made them less optimistic about the UK economy and only 2 per cent said they had made them more optimistic. Fifty-eight per cent of directors in the north, 63 per cent in the Midlands and 64 per cent in the south reported greater optimism about their own companies' prospects. Greatest confidence was reported in the services sector, where 72 per cent of directors were more optimistic, followed by distribution, at 70 per cent, and business services, at 62 per cent. In mining and construction the proportion of directors reporting greater optimism about their own company's prospects fell from 69 per cent in February to 55 per cent in April. The biggest increase in optimism was among directors of medium-size companies, employing between 101 and 200 people. These companies were also the most likely to take on new employees during the next six months, with 55 per cent expecting increased employment levels and none expecting to cut jobs. The overall proportion of companies expecting to take on new employees rose to 44 per cent in April, from 37 per cent in February.</p>

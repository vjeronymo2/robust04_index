			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: France sees dollar rate asblock to Gatt FRANCE yesterday argued that a Uruguay Round world trade agreement could not be concluded until the European Community and the US factored into their negotiations the effects of the devalued dollar on farm trade, the main obstacle to a deal. 'The fall in the dollar has been a formidable stimulus to American exports,' said Ms Elizabeth Guigou, French minister for Europe, adding that 'we cannot negotiate trade in abstraction from exchange rates.' EC leaders at the summit, increasingly irritated with French obstruction of a Gatt agreement, nevertheless reconfirmed the Commission's mandate to conclude a deal soon on behalf of the Community. The risk was that France's opposition to any cutback in its lucrative exports of subsidised cereals might unravel those agreements on farm trade reached in EC-US talks at the beginning of this week, conducted by senior Commission officials. These agreements forced French officials to admit privately this week that this May's radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) - the underpinning of the Gatt farm talks - would not work or be adhered to. The CAP reform, which France, along with its partners, signed up to, commits the EC to deeper cuts on subsidised food exports than the EC would have to undertake under the worst outcome of the Gatt negotiations. French officials, however, have made clear in private that the powerful Paris agriculture bureaucracy does not take the CAP reform projections seriously. Under the revamped CAP, EC cereals production would fall from 180m tonnes to 164m tonnes, with subsidised exports falling from 33m tonnes to 19m tonnes over three years. The maximum Gatt commitment of a cut of 24 per cent in subsidised cereals exports would still allow the EC to export 23.5m tonnes in six years' time. A senior French official at the European Commission, reconfirming on Thursday that these figures remain acc-urate, explained the inconsistency in France's position with the remark that 'it is an emotional question'. He said, however, that the fall in the dollar was 'the only serious problem to analyse'. Dollar depreciation not only makes US exports more competitive, but because farm trade is denominated in dollars, adds to the cost of the CAP in the EC budget. There is some sympathy for France's new line of defence on the dollar. Indeed, US lobbyists opposed to the Uruguay round settlement have also raised concerns over currency movements as they influence world trade. But there is no sympathy at all for France's obstruction of a Gatt deal which all its EC partners believe could inject desperately needed confidence into the depressed world economy. 'It is clear that France never really intended to comply with CAP reform,' one senior Commission official said on Thursday. 'They don't care about the dollar,' a German diplomat said angrily yesterday, 'they're only worried about their internal political situation.' However, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, minister of state for European affairs, said there could be no question of bringing pressure on anybody until the Commission came up with a package of negotiated agreements for member states to judge. Mr Frans Andriessen, who yesterday brought the leaders up to date on the state of the Gatt negotiations, insisted that the Uruguay Round farm trade obligations were well within what had already been agreed on Cap reform, and would help conserve the EC farm regime, according to one of his aides.</p>

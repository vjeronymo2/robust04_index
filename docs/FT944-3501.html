			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Arts: Calamity Jane - Theatre If you like your ham hickory smoked, this is surely the show for you. The Steam Industry's production of Calamity Jane (at BAC, Battersea), is a hoot from start to finish: wildly energetic, noisy, sweaty, totally over the top and thoroughly enjoyable. Phil Willmott's staging gallops through the story of the pistol-toting tomboy, Calamity Jane, her efforts to please the local wasters by fetching a glamorous actress to perform in Deadwood, Dakota, her fights and her eventual romance with Wild Bill Hickock, manages to send it up comprehensively, but in a generous spirit. Willmott hooks his audience from the outset with the dashing opening. The show begins very quietly as little groups of two and three filter on to the stage in the dark to stand and wait, until the stage is filled with two dozen silent people and the anticipation cannot be sustained any longer. Then the remainder of the 30-strong cast bursts into the auditorium and thunders down through the audience singing 'The Deadwood Stage' at full throttle. From then on the pace is furious, the company putting everything into a staging that is corny and camp, but never churlish. The choreography, by the appropriately named Jack Gunn, is of the wide-eyed, thigh-slapping, cheesy-grinning variety - Gunn must have raided every musical on offer to pilfer every cliche in the book. The cast shuffles and stomps, the girls do high kicks, the men in the bar move as one, like a shoal of fish, while the stars leap onto furniture and pound up and down the stairs. This is not a show for those with a nervous disposition or a passion for subtlety. At the centre of it all, Leigh McDonald holds her own in the Doris Day role as a tremendously appealing Calamity Jane. A tough, chirpy little body, she has a strong voice - a little breathless at times, but that is because she throws herself into the part with such exhausting energy. She is nicely matched by Michelle Bissell as the sweet and wholesome Katie Brown and Jason Griffiths as the sly Mr Wild Bill Hickock. There is no danger of any deep psychological interpretation of Calamity Jane's insistence on dressing like a man and playing tough, indeed there is no danger of any depth or subtlety at all. But, as Calamity would say, what the heck. The Steam Industry is an interesting company, whose work ricochets from the inspired to the dire, but this production is irresistible, pure entertainment on a shoestring, and it generates enough energy to rival Battersea power station in full swing.

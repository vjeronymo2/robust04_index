			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUBWAY BEGGING NOT FREE SPEECH, U.S. COURT RULES  </P> <P> A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that begging on the subways is not a  constitutionally protected form of free speech and is "nothing less than  assault" on citizens by panhandlers.  </P> <P> The decision by the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a Jan. 26  ruling by U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand that poor people had a First  Amendment right to beg.  </P> <P> Sand's ruling had fueled a heated debate on panhandling and heightened  frustration of commuters complaining about increasingly aggressive homeless  people asking for money.  </P> <P> "It seems fair to say that most individuals who beg are not doing so to convey  any social or political message," said Judge Frank Altimeri, who wrote the  50-page, 3-1 decision. "Rather, they beg to collect money.  </P> <P> "Begging is inherently aggressive to the captive passengers in the close  confines of the subway atmosphere. Begging in the subway often amounts to  nothing less than assault, creating in the passengers the apprehension of  imminent danger."  </P> <P> Sand had directed that begging and panhandling be permitted on subway platforms  and mezzanines but temporarily prohibited such behavior on subway trains and  other areas.  </P></p>

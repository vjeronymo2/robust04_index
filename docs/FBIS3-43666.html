			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Nairobi, 12 Jan (KNA) -- The vice president and  minister for planning and national development, Professor George  Saitoti, today held fruitful discussions with the leader of a  Japanese economic and technology cooperation mission currently  in the country. At the head of the high level mission is Mr.  Masao Sawaki, special assistant to the minister for foreign  affairs, who was accompanied by the ambassador of Japan to  Kenya, Ms. Ginko Sato, during the discussions at the vice  president's office at the Treasury in Nairobi.    The vice president assured Japan of the Kenya Government's  commitment to the principles of good governance, transparency,  and accountability. Prof. Saitoti assured further of the  government's commitment to the maintenance of security and the  protection of lives for both the local and international  communities in Kenya. This was in response to concerns expressed  by Mr. Sawaki on the two issues.    Mr. Sawaki had told the vice president that Japan's  assistance would only go to those countries that practiced good  governance, transparency, accountability, and respect for human  rights. Mr. Sawaki had also said that the international  community would not be willing to work in countries where their  lives were at risk.    Prof. Saitoti stated that the isolated incidents of  insecurity were not internal but of induced [as received] nature  associated with conflicts in neighboring countries. He said  that some of the fleeing refugees brought with them into the  country weapons that were used to commit crimes.    Prof. Saitoti underlined that His Excellency President  Daniel  arap Moi was involved with peace initiatives in the African  region in the realization that there would be no peace in one  particular country if others were in turmoil.    The vice president regretted the drought scourge sweeping  many parts of the republic which, he said, had adverse effects  on the country's economy. He said the country was forced to  purchase foodstuffs to meet the deficit at commercial prices and  appealed for donors' and agencies' assistance. The country, he  said, was further reeling down with high unemployment, but he  observed that this state could only be changed through growth in  the economy.    The vice president emphasized that the government was  serious  in her efforts to bring further down the population growth and  reported that the situation had assumed a downward trend. He  said the biggest challenge for the country has been a major  slowdown of the economy, but the government was doing everything  possible to turn things around. Prof. Saitoti stressed that the  government had liberalized many areas of the economy to make it  stable. He said that the government had demonstrated its  seriousness by implementing far-reaching structural economic  measures.    Prof. Saitoti underlined that the government had effected  major political and economic changes in the recent past. The  country now enjoys a participatory multiparty democracy, he  said, adding that the government would not relent in her efforts  of real democratization and promoting a market-oriented economy.    During the discussions Mr. Sawaki said that his government  considered Kenya as a priority country in Africa and that is why  the country received the highest amount of Japanese aid. He  said Kenya's success is fundamental, to be replicated in other  areas. He underlined that his country placed emphasis on  environmental and population-related programs and warned that no  part of the aid should be diverted to military purposes since  this could result in the suspension of the aid package.    The vice president thanked the Japanese Government for its  assistance to Kenya, observing that every area of the economy  had benefited from Japanese aid. He mentioned the Kenya  Broadcasting Corporation, and various roads and bridges among  major beneficiaries and in particular highlighted the Jomo  Kenyatta College of Agriculture and Technology as a living  testimony of economic cooperation between the two nations.

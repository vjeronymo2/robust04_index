			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Kalon predicts extra Pounds 5m for merged group KALON Group yesterday said that combining its operations with those of Manders if its hostile takeover was successful, would add at least Pounds 5m a year to the pre-tax profits of the enlarged group. The forecast profits increase came as the paint group increased the terms of its bid. The offer now values rival Manders group at Pounds 93.7m or 254p, down from Pounds 95.6m because of the fall in Kalon's share price yesterday. Kalon increased and made final its offer of 17 of its new shares for every 6 Manders shares, compared with its original 8-for-3 offer. Kalon also introduced a partial cash element, which comprises 14 new Kalon shares and 300p cash for every 6 Manders shares and values the offer at Pounds 95.6m or 259p a share. The new partial cash alternative values Manders at the equivalent of where the all-share offer closed on Thursday night with Kalon's share price at 91.5p. However, Manders share price remained resolutely stuck below the offer prices, and even fell yesterday from 244p to close at 238p. Manders said the offer remained inadequate. A Kalon adviser described the bid as 'a hostile merger', and added: 'We have said to Manders shareholders that we will give you a fair share of the merged cake and we will manage your assets better. 'We are not there to buy them out for cash and it's really an argument about management.' The bid closes two days early on August 21.</p>

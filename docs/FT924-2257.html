			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Survey of Pulp and Paper (6): Weaker krona lifts Sweden - Regional report: Scandinavia THE 19 per cent jump in the shares of Sweden's forestry companies the day after the country floated its currency last month said it all. Sweden's pulp and paper groups were competitive again, after a year in which a strong Swedish krona had seen them outflanked by rivals in North America and Finland. A weaker currency may not be an instant fix for all the problems battering the highly-cyclical forestry industry - now very much in one of its down phases - but it certainly helps. Finland has boosted both export prices and volumes since devaluing the markka in November 1991, and it has gained a further benefit from floating its currency in September. Indeed, the currency changes may help make 1992 a turning point for the forest companies of both Sweden and Finland. The two countries expect their pulp and paper sectors to make a loss this year, but are cautiously optimistic that 1993 will bring a return to profit. The benefits of rationalisation, a stronger dollar and an upturn in the US market will also be vital ingredients in any turnaround. Prices remain, nevertheless, under strong pressure because of market overcapacity. Sweden and Finland also face special competitive difficulties. They have slower tree-growth rates, higher wood and labour costs, and a less favourable tax regime than some of their rivals. In Sweden, forestry companies have had one of their worst years for a long time and are looking at a collective loss of SKr2bn (Pounds 193m) for 1992. This compares with a SKr3bn profit last year and a SKr12bn profit in 1990. As a result of devaluation, and assuming unchanged prices, the the industry association calculates that companies will be SKr3bn better off. The improvement would have been even greater if the UK, Italy and Spain had not also seen their currencies effectively devalued during the year. MoDo, one of the three biggest Swedish forestry groups, estimates that it will gain SKr900m a year as a result of the weaker Swedish currency, though not until current hedging programmes have expired in the second quarter of next year. Devaluation is not, however, the panacea it might have been 10 years ago, when exports by the Swedish companies from Sweden accounted for some 80 per cent of their turnover. Now much more of their capacity is based outside the country, and Stora, Europe's biggest paper and pulp group, exports only some 24 per cent of its turnover from Sweden. Finnish experience has shown, too, that buyers seek a cut from devaluation, putting further pressure on prices. Swedish companies will certainly benefit from cost-cutting efforts put in place over the last two years. Stora alone has shed 6,000 jobs since 1990 and is looking to cut costs by a further SKr2bn over the next two years. Yet Mr Jan Remrod director general of the Swedish pulp and paper association, stresses that devaluation alone will not not make the Swedish forestry industry competitive. Sweden still has the highest costs in the world, because of its wood and labour costs, high tax levels, and environmental ambitions. Finland, too, still enjoys a competitive advantage over Sweden because the markka has effectively been devalued by 25 per cent over the last year, which is much more than the drop in the value of the krona. The Finns also benefit from state-of-the-art technology and have been much more aggressive in cutting raw material costs. One estimate suggests that Finnish wood costs have fallen by up to 40 per cent over the last two years. Finnish pulp and paper groups have not been able to take full advantage of their competitive position, however, because of the heavy debts accumulated as a result of big investment programmes in the late 1980s. Those with high levels of foreign debt have found their position exacerbated by the weakening of the markka. Debt-servicing costs and foreign exchange losses help explain why the Central Association of Finnish Forest Industries expects the country's pulp and paper companies to post a total loss of FM3.5bn this year. This is despite a 6 per cent rise in export volumes and a 9 per cent increase in export value, to FM39bn, during 1992. For the first eight months, the country's four leading forestry groups - Repola, Kymmene, Metsa-Serla and Enso-Gutzeit - were all in the red, notching up a combined loss of FM1.7bn (Pounds 900m). For 1993, a modest collective profit of FM300m is predicted, but this assumes a 7 per cent rise in export volumes and a 12 per cent increase in value. The debt problem remains a serious one, however. The large Finnish groups have been forced to reduce leverage through cutbacks in capital expenditure, as stock market conditions have not favoured equity raising. For both Finnish and Swedish producers, the most worrying question is how much further the European market will turn down, and how much further prices will come under pressure. The concern applies particularly to the German market. 'The first half of 1993 will be very difficult, because of flat or negative GDP growth in many of the large European markets,' says Mr Denis Christie, paper and packaging analyst at James Capel. Against this, there is the expectation of a stronger dollar and a recovery in the US economy, which should reduce the level of North American exports to the European market and ease price pressures.</p>

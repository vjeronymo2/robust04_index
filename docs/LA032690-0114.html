			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> NIXON: 'HISTORY WILL BE HARSH'  </P> <P> Former President Nixon said he expects historians to judge him more by  Watergate than by his diplomatic overtures to China.  </P> <P> "Historians are more likely to lead with 'He resigned the office,' " Nixon said  in an interview in the latest issue of Time magazine.  </P> <P> "The jury has already come in, and there's nothing that's going to change it.  There's no appeal. Historians will judge it harshly."  </P> <P> Nixon discussed the Watergate break-in in his new book "In the Arena,"  excerpted in the magazine.  </P> <P> The former President said that he made the "inexcusable error" of asking the  CIA to block an FBI investigation of the Watergate break-in, but that the CIA  declined.  </P> <P> Nixon said a decision by then-CIA Director Richard Helms and his deputy, Vernon  Walters, to ignore the request discredits Watergate's "most serious myth -- the  one that ultimately forced me to resign:" that the CIA, in fact, obstructed the  FBI investigation on his orders.  </P></p>

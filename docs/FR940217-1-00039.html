Subject and Scope of Rule for Negotiated Rulemaking <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is proposing that the technical regulations to govern the provision of Local Multipoint Distribution Service and fixed satellite use of the 28 GHz band be developed through negotiation. We believe that the selection criteria listed above are met. Technical rules are necessary to establish under what circumstances, if any, sharing between satellite and terrestrial uses is feasible. The parties whose interests are affected are identifiable from comments filed in this proceeding. These interests can be adequately represented on a committee, and we believe that representatives will act in good faith to reach a consensus on technical rules within a set time frame. We believe that the negotiated rulemaking process will better use public and private resources than would our requiring more iterations of written comments will an adequate record is developed. We have adequate resources to commit to this endeavor and would use the consensus report of the committee to develop proposed technical rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has identified the following primary issue that should be addressed in the negotiations and resolved in the proposed rules developed by the Committee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> What technical rules should be adopted for the Local Multipoint Distribution Service and/or the fixed satellite service so as to maximize the sharing of the spectrum among these services?  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> If the Negotiated Rulemaking Committee is able to accommodate all proposed uses of the band, we ask that it proposes specific rules to effectuate a sharing plan. We ask that it provide an analysis of how benefits of its proposed solution outweigh other options for accommodating these services. Specifically, we ask that it explain:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _The proper definition of the product market and geographic market for the services proposed; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The degree of competition anticipated within the relevant market (including the extent to which the proposed services are expected to compete with existing services); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The degree to which new services and technological innovations will be stimulated by the proposed allocation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

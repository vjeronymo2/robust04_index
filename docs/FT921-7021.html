			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Airbus is ordered to alter A320 cockpit THE FRENCH government yesterday ordered Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium, to make changes to the cockpit design of the A320, the aircraft which crashed in eastern France last month, killing 87. The instruction, from Mr Paul Quiles, the transport minister, which followed publication of the independent investigators' preliminary report into the crash, will be seized upon by critics of one of the most technically advanced aircraft in the air. They claim that the computerised controls can confuse pilots and leave them unprepared for emergencies. The report said changing the cockpit layout could cut the chances of pilot error. Airbus Industrie immediately set up a team to examine possible changes, while both Lufthansa, the German airline which has more A320s than any other carrier, and British Airways said they would study the report's findings. The report did not identify the cause of the crash. This should be in the final version which could take another year to produce. The investigators made three recommendations: to review the layout of the descent controls; to make all passenger aircraft carry alarms to alert pilots when they are approaching the ground; and to review the placing of the aircraft's emergency radio beacon. Specifically, there was concern that displays might make it easy to confuse an instruction by the pilot to the aircraft to descend at a set angle with one to descend to a set height. Mr Alain Monnier, head of the inquiry panel, said: 'Among the scenarios we are studying is a confusion, undetected by the crew, between the two modes of descent.' He added this 'does not mean that the commission of inquiry has decided on the most likely scenario or scenarios of this accident'. Mr Quiles asked the French civil aviation authority to ensure that all French airlines installed ground proximity alarms - currently not obligatory in France - by June. Air Inter, the domestic airline operating the A320, had intended to install such systems by the summer. The minister's instructions were welcomed by the SNPL national pilots' union. The crash happened when an A320 operated by Air Inter, the French domestic airline, hit a mountain ridge on a night approach to Strasbourg airport, in eastern France. The A320's radio beacon, which was carried in its nose, was accordingly smashed on impact, and rescuers took four hours to find the aircraft.

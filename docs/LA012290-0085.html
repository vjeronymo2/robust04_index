			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT: WESTWOOD ONE IS A CLASSIC WALL ST. TUG OF WAR  </P> <P> Back in 1985, Westwood One had a great story to sell, and Wall Street bought  it. Instead of merely syndicating radio programs, it built its own radio  network by acquiring existing networks that were in trouble. First, it bought  the Mutual Broadcasting System, followed by the NBC Radio Network two years  later, making Westwood the country's biggest radio network after ABC. Its  stock, which sold for as low as $4.375 in 1984, shot to as high as $32 in 1987.  </P> <P> More recently, Westwood has added radio stations in New York, Los Angeles and  San Diego, among other properties. But fast growth may have taken its toll on  the $100-million-plus Culver City-based company. Quips one short-seller: "It's  a Cinderella story gone sour."  </P> <P> Indeed, its stock is resting near its 52-week lows, in part because of a  slower-than-expected turnaround in NBC, and the bears believe that it will go  much lower. It closed Friday in over-the-counter trading at $7.625 a share, up  12.50 cents.  </P> <P> (After the markets closed Friday, the company announced that it expects to  report a record loss for the latest fiscal year of about $24 million, or $1.57  to $1.63 a share.)  </P> <P> One short-seller who declined to be identified -- which is often the case --  believes that in the best case, assuming the company's assets are sold, the  stock is worth $2.50 a share after paying off about $190 million in debt. Not  only is Westwood's debt double its equity, but it lost $18.6 million for the  first nine months of its last fiscal year and interest payments more than  doubled.  </P> <P> What's more, Financial Statement Alert, which is produced by Los Angeles-based  Kellogg Associates, has questioned some of Westwood's accounting. Kellogg has  been early in spotting controversial activities at numerous companies whose  stocks have subsequently declined, such as Prime Motor Inns, Cineplex Odeon and  First Executive Corp. In the case of Westwood, Kellogg questions whether the  company fiddled with its income statement in the third quarter "to avoid  showing a larger loss."  </P> <P> But bulls are also sounding off on Westwood, which is quickly evolving into a  classic Wall Street tug of war. Most analysts are as bullish as ever. The lower  the stock goes, they say, the more attractive it becomes. On Thursday, in fact,  Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette analyst Dennis Leibowitz issued an "aggressive  buy" on the stock, dismissing bear talk that has mauled the stock in recent  days as "the same old issues."  </P> <P> He's impressed by what he sees as the company's strong cash flow and the  underlying value of its assets, which he thinks are worth about $20 a share.  </P> <P> As for the company's position on all of this, President William Battison takes  issue with concerns raised by Kellogg &amp; Associates. He insists that  Westwood generates enough internal cash flow to service its debt, and he  believes that the company will be profitable sometime in 1991.  </P> <P> Meanwhile . . . there's another less obvious cloud hanging over Westwood. A  former Westwood executive has lodged a complaint with the Federal Election  Commission against Chairman Norman Pattiz.  </P> <P> A commission spokesman confirmed receiving the complaint but would say only  that the case hasn't yet been closed. The letter states that Pattiz "secretly  financed campaign contributions in the name of his employees and their  relatives, each of whom was subsequently reimbursed by Mr. Pattiz through his  corporation."  </P> <P> According to the letter, the money, $13,000, went to the presidential campaign  of Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.) as a way to enable Pattiz to testify before a  broadcasting-related congressional subcommittee run by Sen. Daniel Inouye  (D-Hawaii), who happened to co-chair Biden's short-lived presidential effort in  1988. The company said it is cooperating with the FEC to resolve the matter and  believes there was no intentional violation of the law. It declined further  comment, citing a confidentiality requirement imposed by the commission.  </P></p>

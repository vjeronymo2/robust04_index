			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Business school wins fight for autonomy MANCHESTER Business School is to keep its separate identity and will continue to operate with considerable autonomy from Manchester University, its parent. Arrangements finalised this week are seen as a shift of position by the university after 14 private-sector members of the school's advisory board resigned in May. They were protesting at plans to federate the graduate school with other, mainly undergraduate, business studies sections in Manchester. Federation will proceed but the business school - which has an international reputation that ranks its Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree with those of Harvard in the US and Insead in France - will remain in its buildings. They include hotel-standard accommodation for students, who are all experienced or senior executives and half of whom come from abroad. 'We need high-quality teaching and living facilities for competitive purposes,' according to Professor Tony Cockerill, the school's deputy director. The business school will still be able to reinvest surpluses in improving its facilities. This academic year it has made Pounds 350,000 on a Pounds 12m turnover. With bookings full for MBA and senior executives' courses, the business school expects similar profitability in the new academic year, which begins next month. The seriousness of the dispute over the school's future has prompted Professor Martin Harris, who becomes the university's vice-chancellor next month, to take the chair of a new interim management committee for the school. The committee will probably preside over the business school for a year until an executive board is appointed with a majority of private-sector members. Mr Joe Dwek, chairman of Bodycote International and one of northern England's most prominent business leaders, will be on the committee. Mr Dwek has active links with the University of Manchester's Institute of Science and Technology, which is putting its school of management into the new federation. Mr Edmund Gartside, of Shiloh, the Manchester textile company, will also serve on the committee, along with Mr Tom Hinchliffe, a director of ICL, and Mr Norman Quick, former chairman of Quicks, the car distributor. No plans have been made to replace Professor Tom Cannon, who resigned as the school's director a few days after the 14 board members. The job may rotate among senior academics in the federation.</p>

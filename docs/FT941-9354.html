			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T's first chief executive for Europe American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US telecommunications group, has appointed Mr Pier Carlo Falotti, the former European head of Digital Equipment, the computer manufacturer, as its first European chief executive. The appointment signals the priority AT&amp;T gives to building its European business as Europe's telecommunications market undergoes radical liberalisation. Mr Falotti, who left Digital in July 1992 and has since been chief executive of ASK, a US software group, is well regarded in Europe's computer industry and well-placed to spearhead AT&amp;T's European ambitions. His appointment comes at a key stage in negotiations between AT&amp;T and the French and German state telecommunications companies about a possible alliance. AT&amp;T is also keen to break into the UK. It is in talks with Energis, the subsidiary of National Grid which is to launch a third national long-distance telecoms network in April, about taking a one-third stake in the new operator. Mr Falotti, 51, will report directly to Mr Victor Pelson, AT&amp;T's chairman of global operations and effectively deputy to Mr Bob Allen, the chairman. AT&amp;T has 25,000 employees in Europe, about half acquired with the takeover of NCR, the computer company. Mr Pelson said AT&amp;T looked to Mr Falotti to 'drive a more synergistic and proactive approach, to expand our presence, and build our relationship with European partners and customers'. Mr Falotti said his preference was to build AT&amp;T's presence through partnerships, not confrontation. 'You must have an availability to partner in this industry', he said. Outside the UK, AT&amp;T's capacity to compete in Europe is limited by monopoly restrictions set to remain in force until 1998, the EU's deadline for the introduction of competition in basic voice services.</p>

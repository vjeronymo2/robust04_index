			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> FCC Chairman Unveils Fin/Syn Timetable: In speech before the Academy of  Television Arts &amp; Sciences, FCC Chairman Alfred C. Sikes said the Federal  Communications Commission would hold public hearings on the financial interest  and syndication rules later this year and hoped to have a report and order  issued by the first quarter of 1991. The fin/syn rules prohibit the three TV  networks from earning hundreds of millions in profits off reruns of old TV  shows. Sikes said his mind was not made up about how he will rule in the  proceeding but termed the erosion of network share of viewers "important."  </P></p>

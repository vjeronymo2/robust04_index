			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Books: Authenticity reveals the clue - Thrillers A LONG COLD FALL by Sam Reaves Serpent's Tail Pounds 7.99 TWILIGHT AT MAC'S PLACE by Ross Thomas Scribner's Pounds 12.95, 304 pages PASTIME by Robert B Parker Viking Pounds 14.99, 224 pages THE SONG DOG by James McClure Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 13.99, 281 pages A FRIEND came to stay in Washington some years ago. He spent a week pounding the streets, checking the walking distance from the White House to the State Department, the menu at Jean-Pierre, the ratio of Ethiopian to Ghanaian taxi drivers. He was writing a thriller. It was not bad either, and not only because I could not detect a single mistake in his description and use of location. Obviously lots of things go into making a good suspense novel and several of them need to come together for it to come off well. They include the ability to write dialogue, describe sex and violence, build characters and plot. But all this can be undermined if the feel for location, and the people who inhabit it, is wrong. Equally, location alone cannot compensate for deficiencies in the other vital ingredients. These four books get it pretty much right. Three are set in the US, in Boston, Chicago and Washington, and the fourth in South Africa, black and white. Three are by old hands and one by a newcomer. Sam Reaves, the ingenue of the quartet, can write. A Long Cold Fall has a great first sentence and does not subsequently let go. Cooper, the Vietnam veteran and Chicago taxi driver, does not really invite trouble, but in trying to find out who killed a woman he had once loved and who is trying to kill her teenage son - who turns out to be his own - he does not avoid it either. This book contains the most explicit and unpleasant violent scenes of the four, but they are handled with accuracy, dispatch and some style. And Chicago comes out as a mean town. There are cops and waitresses with hearts of gold, naturally, but tough exteriors. There is a lot of low life and some on the high side and in high rises. It is not a book the city council would promote, though most of them would probably find it hard to put down. Ross Thomas's Twilight at Mac's Place deals in ex-spies and is set where most of them hang out - in Washington. The milieu is softer but no less accurate. If Mac's Place itself, the restaurant bar run by two former CIA men, does not exist, there are a number like it where the trade is Scotch-and-conspiracy, past and present. The plot - the search for the memoirs of the late CIA agent Steadfast Haynes - is deftly handled and, if the denouement is guessable three quarters of the way through, readability does not flag. Robert B Parker, who is fulsome in praise of the first two authors on their dust jackets, is now like an old shoe and Spenser, his Boston private eye, a familiar figure. Perhaps because he does not need to parade location any more, the city itself is never more than a backdrop. In Pastime Parker handles his big set pieces as well as ever, be it the finale in the Public Gardens or the hunting of the wounded Spenser in the Massachusetts woods. But that is not really what makes Spenser books beguiling: it is because literate cynics make good heroes. The Song Dog, by James McClure, returns his two well- established detectives, Tromp Kramer the white Afrikaner and Mickey Zondi the black, to the beginning of their collaboration, solving a nasty double murder in backwoods northern Zululand. Kramer investigates the white community and Zondi the black in ways that turn out to be complementary. From initial mistrust the relationship evolves, perhaps predictably but not sentimentally, into one of respect (though it is not hard to guess who, in the end, saves whose life). Not having read the earlier books and not really knowing the respective cultures means I was taking a lot on trust, but there is a ring of authenticity to the locale and enough intrinsic interest in a complex plot to make it worthwhile checking out the predecessors. The very last page, however, has a chilling hint suggesting that the South African equivalent of the Reichenbach Falls is around the corner. That is something that Robert Parker is obviously not yet contemplating for Spenser. Sam Reaves's Cooper could be a one-off creation, but Chicago as a location certainly is not. Mind you, it never was.</p>

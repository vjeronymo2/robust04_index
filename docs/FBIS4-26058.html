			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- According to the State  General Administration of Taxation, as of the end of April this  year, industrial and commercial taxes collected in Shanghai  reached 14.803 billion yuan, up 59 percent over the same period  last year. Of this amount, the central government collected  9.055 billion yuan, and the local government 5.748 billion yuan  -- the ratio between them was 61.17 percent to 38.83 percent.  The revenue increases, progress of tax collection, and  proportion of the central government's revenue are all larger or  quicker than the country's average.    According to the State General Administration of Taxation,  since the new tax system was introduced, Shanghai has not  witnessed any worrisome fluctuations or big increase in prices.  As a result, people are free from anxiety, and the market is  brisk. This has laid a foundation for the increase of  industrial and commercial taxes. Tax departments at various  levels in Shanghai promptly and effectively trained tax  collectors and managers in various ways and tested their  knowledge of the new tax system. While compiling reference  materials on the new tax system for enterprises, tax organs gave  special lectures or explanations on such difficult points as  taxes included in the calculated prices; taxes not included in  the calculated prices; taxpayers; and those whose tax  obligations have yet to be fulfilled. Such training and  publicity created favorable conditions for the smooth  implementation of the new tax system and increase of revenues.    In tax levying and management, Shanghai Municipality made  conscientious efforts to have general taxpayers understand the  need for the value-added tax and to supply special invoices.  The municipality appropriately adjusted the way in which it  used to levy and manage taxes. It also strengthened its  management of tax returns and invoicing. Since the  implementation of the new tax system, more and more enterprises  have reported on the invoices they issued. This has effectively  guaranteed their payment of taxes.    Shanghai Municipality also strengthened its examination of  tax payment receipts and its coordination with banks in order to  ensure that all tax payments go to the state treasury. At the  same time, the municipality also stepped up its work of  destroying old tax payment receipts and set strict limits on  invoices issued by enterprises. This was aimed at ensuring the  correct use of new tax payment receipts and the accurate  collection of taxes.    Since 1 January this year, Shanghai Municipality's tax  departments have taken measures to strengthen their control and  screening of invoices and tax payment receipts. All the tax  payment receipts issued in the first quarter of the year have  been checked, and the accuracy of using and filling in such  receipts has also improved. As of the end of April, special  invoices issued by 64,700 general taxpayers were checked,  accounting for the 72.2 percent of those special invoices which  should be checked. Also checked were 5,758,100 special invoices  involving the added-value tax, 531,000 of which were  questionable, accounting for 9.22 percent of the checked  invoices.    While implementing the new tax system, Shanghai Municipality  has cracked down on those issuing forged invoices. The  municipal inspection and auditing group, and district inspection  and auditing detachments took joint action in cracking down on  the production and selling of forged invoices in several places  in the city. Forged invoices were put on display to enable  people to recognize them. In coordination with public security  and procuratorial departments, the tax office in Zhabei district  on 11 March raided Xinkezhan and two other places where illicit  selling of forged invoices was rampant, and discovered more than  30 people peddling such invoices. Public security personnel  arrested eight of them and confiscated over 1,000 forged  invoices of various kinds.</p>

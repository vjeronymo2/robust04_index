			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Arts: Waiting for the final resolution in residence - Art Of all our larger public institutions, the National Gallery was the first, some 15 years ago, to make a studio available on the premises and to invite a particular artist to take up residence. The scheme excited controversy at the time, though quite why seems hard to fathom now. What did mere artists, those rude mechanicals, have to do with the old masters, that they should have such privileged access to the collect-ions? In practice it proved itself almost at once. Artists have always plundered the art of the past for their own reasons. In introducing the current show of the works of Ken Kiff, the latest to emerge from the scheme, the director of the National Gallery, Neil MacGregor, admits as much: 'They have a double power. They are the exploration of an autonomous vision, entire in itself. But. . . they are at the same time a revisiting of a painted world which I thought I knew and which I now see to be even richer than I had guessed.' But the scheme has changed its spots over the years. So rich and yet so various is the feast afforded by the collections that a certain maturity is required to digest it. From being an annual residency open to competitive application and immediately attractive to younger artists as an early step up in their careers, it has now become a matter of direct appointment as Associate Artist. Ken Kiff has been thus in post for about 18 months, in which time he has come to work at the studio provided at the National Gallery more or less full-time. He is now 58 and for these dozen years past has been showing his work, on his own and in mixed company, with increasing prominence and regularity. Even so, he is not yet so prominent as all that. In a sense he is still a private artist, a painter's painter, a well-kept secret. The work is intensely personal, quite as much in its physical and practical aspects, with its saturated colour and impulsive, sensual working of the paint, as in any of its imagery. And that imagery is fraught with reference and symbol, at once overt and yet densely ambiguous and private, funny yet frightening, erotic yet innocent. He knowingly embraces the full scope of the surreal and symbolist tradition at its most sophisticated, from Duccio to Pisanello, Patenier and Bosch, to Goya, Blake and Moreau, to Klee, Miro and Picasso. Yet he remains curiously and touchingly himself. He has produced a mass of work, much of it unfinished and more to come. The final resolution can wait, for it will come. He has spent much time exploring the collections, from Filippo Lippi and Masaccio to Monet and Van Gogh. But in his work he has naturally, been drawn to the masters of magic and miracle, and in particular to the iconography of the Renaissance. His is the narrative world of the predella, the altar-piece and the morality, the lives of the saints, the deaths of the martyrs, the Garden of Eden. The sun flowers in the sky, the snake which slips through the grass, the girl in the pool. And while these things remain unmistakably the product of Kiff's personal vision and elegant hand, we find ourselves, with Neil MacGregor, looking again at Bellini's monks slaughtered in the wood, or Pisanello's Holy Vision of St Eustace. It is to Ken Kiff that we may well ascribe Baudelaire's 'impeccable naivete', the quality that by coincidence is cited as epigraph in the catalogue to the show of recent work by Howard Hodgkin. Many things he may be, and the most knowing and calculating of colourists: but Hodgkin naive? Never. He is an abstract artist in the older and truer sense, moving from particular reference of place or person to its more generalised evocation by association, mood or trick of memory. The achievement is reductive in terms of imagery and the broad simplicity of the final sweeps of paint, cumulative in terms of the actual overlaying of paint. He has a seductive command of his material, most especially so the smaller the scale, to which he brings a visual concentration and intensity. But now he has begun to move the other way, making paintings that are not exactly vast but are certainly very large for him. And what is lost in concentration is hardly made up by size and weight alone, or at least not yet. The paint seems thinner, the single sweep of the house-painter's brush, that in the smaller works appears so magisterial, seems now stretched, less certain and assured with more space to animate. But then again, it is only the pointless experiment that is ever vitiated by failure. We shall see. Ken Kiff at the National Gallery, Trafalgar Square SW1, until January 9. Howard Hodgkin, Anthony d'Offay Gallery, Dering Street W1, until November 24.</p>

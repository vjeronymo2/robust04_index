			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NIH/ORDA will inform the institution of the DHHS Freedom of Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officer's determination and follow the institution's instructions as to whether some or all of the records involved are to be returned to the institution or to become a part of NIH/ORDA files. If the institution instructs NIH/ORDA to return the records, no copies or summaries of the records will be made or retained by DHHS, NIH, or ORDA. The DHHS Freedom of Information Officer's determination will represent that official's judgment at the time of the determination as to whether the records involved (or some portion) would be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act if at the time of the determination the records were in NIH/ORDA files and a request was received for such files under the Freedom of Information Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section V. Footnotes and References of Sections I Through IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section V&hyph;A. The original reference to organisms as Class 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 refers to the classification in the publication Classification of Etiologic Agents on the Basis of Hazard, 4th Edition, July 1974, U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Public Health Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Office of Biosafety, Atlanta, Georgia 30333. The NIH Director, with advice of the RAC, may revise the classification for the purposes of the NIH Guidelines (see Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1-b-(2)-(e)). The revised list of organisms in each class is reprinted in Appendix B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section V&hyph;B. Section III describes a number of places where judgments are to be made. In all these cases, the Principal Investigator shall make the judgment on these matters as part of his/her responsibility to ``make the initial determination of the required levels of physical and biological containment in accordance with the NIH Guidelines'' (see Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;4-c-(1)). For cases falling under Sections III&hyph;A through III&hyph;D, this judgment is to be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee as part of its responsibility to make an ``independent assessment of the containment levels required by the NIH Guidelines for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed research'' (see Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;2-b-(1)). The Institutional Biosafety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee may refer specific cases to NIH/ORDA as part of NIH/ORDA's functions to ``provide advice to all within and outside NIH'' (see Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;3). NIH/ORDA may request advice from the RAC as part of the RAC's responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for ``interpreting the NIH Guidelines for experiments to which the NIH Guidelines do not specifically assign containment levels'' (see Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1-b-(2)-(f)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section V&hyph;C.

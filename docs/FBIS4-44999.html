			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Haytham Rashid: "Internal Hamas and External </F> Hamas"]    [Excerpt] An examination of the position of Hamas toward  the peace process shows clearly that there are some differences  between Hamas' comprehensive position abroad and Hamas' position  inside Palestine. These differences are evident in the tone with  which the peace process is "rejected."    In the dialect of the entire external Hamas, rejection  surfaces firmly and strongly. Rather, this tone harbors within  its folds the features of a warning to the process supporters,  whereas the tone of internal Hamas is characterized by  moderation and projected with a sportsman-like spirit.    The question that may occur to observers is: Is this  difference a sign of a hidden and concealed split between Hamas'  internal and external wings, or is it tantamount to a  well-studied tactic that serves a specific purpose in the  rhetoric with which the masses are addressed.    To dot the i's and cross the t's, one must note the surprise  which has resurfaced among observers now that the internal Hamas  has clung to the principle of democratic opposition to the  accord, declaring explicitly that its opposition has its  redline, which is not to let opposition reach the point of  internecine fighting and the use of violence between  Palestinians. This surprise emanates from the fact that even  before the peace process, violent opposition and clashes  occurred because of issues much less significant than the  process.    The answer to this particular surprise leads to a basic  fact,  namely that the internal Hamas is fully aware of the proverb  that, "He who receives the lashes is not like him who counts  them." What this means is that even though the internal Hamas is  in full agreement with the strategic position of the external  Hamas, the former sees, with its awareness of the Palestinian  people's real situation, that the "pain here is very great" and  that the "majority of the Palestinian people," like Hamas, want  their full rights. However, the people realize that within the  given facts of the situation, it is impossible to attain this  goal within the foreseeable future.    It is certain that the people of the internal Hamas have  developed the conviction that they, like all other Palestinians,  are Palestinian in pain and hardship and that, simultaneously,  they are Hamas people who, like all other Hamas people, cling to  Hamas' strategy. This means that the internal Hamas realizes  that the Palestinian people must not be pushed to the point of  suicide and extinction and that, if there is a chance for ways  of surviving the stormy sea of annihilation, then one must cling  to them. I believe that with this move, Hamas adheres to its  Palestinianism. Simultaneously, Hamas is fully eager to cling,  along with its people, to the means of survival (the process),  but without declaring that it is accountable for what follows.  With this move, the internal Hamas maintains its lines of  communication with the comprehensive Hamas strategy.    One cannot interpret this position as being the result of  Hamas' splitting into two parts. Rather, one can interpret it as  part of the phenomenon of unity of the Palestinians on the need  to preserve their survival as a people. The internal Hamas that  is opposed to the accord, like the side that supports it, agrees  that the Oslo solution erodes numerous Palestinian constants.  However, it is certain that the Palestinian people at home want  a breather.    This position by Hamas toward the entire Palestinian  situation, Hamas' adoption of a sportsman-like spirit in  opposition, and its decision to avoid internecine fighting among  Palestinians, all will leave their imprint on the future of the  coming Palestinian entity, meaning that the internal Hamas will  include preserving the Palestinian people's survival as a  priority in its agenda. This question of keeping the Palestinian  people within the bounds of the possible is some sort of a bond  which, in my opinion, will enhance the Palestinian people's  chance to prove to the world that they are capable of building a  state, which is one of their rights in the first place.    A meaningful summary of all we have said is that the hand of  the internal Hamas, like that of Palestinians, is in the fire.  The more Hamas crystallizes this fact in positions reflecting a  sportsman-like spirit, the closer it will find itself to others,  even to those who support the settlement, because [passage  omitted, article incomplete].</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> GET TOUGHER ON CHINA?;  </P> <P> RAY PRICE  </P> <P> Emotion is a poor and often a disastrous guide to policy. Yes, it's right that  we should be on the students' side. But this is a time for scrupulously  careful, meticulously calculated responses by the American government to an  extraordinarily fluid situation in which our knowledge of what's happening is  necessarily extremely limited, which we have little capacity to influence and  in which the actions that instinct and emotion might command are likely to  prove counterproductive.  </P> <P> On the American part, it's a time for sympathetic understanding and support,  but not for heroics. Those are the province of the Chinese people, whose  heroics of the past few weeks will reverberate through history.  </P></p>

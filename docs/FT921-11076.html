			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / GPA rejects advice over flotation price GUINNESS Peat Aviation, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, has rejected the advice from its merchant banks to price its new shares at around Dollars 20 in its forthcoming flotation. Mr Tony Ryan, the group's chairman and founder, was reported by one of his advisers as telling the group's investment banks that such a price, which would value the company at around Dollars 3bn, would mean selling the company on the cheap. Mr Ryan owns 8 per cent of the company and every dollar reduction in the share price would reduce his wealth by Dollars 10m. GPA yesterday called an emergency board meeting at its headquarters in Shannon, in the Republic of Ireland, to discuss the impending sale which could take place as early as March or April. The group's executives were first told on Friday, in a meeting with its advisers in London, that the banks were proposing to price the new ordinary shares at between Dollars 20 to Dollars 25, with the emphasis on the lower price. GPA executives immediately insisted on flying the bankers to Shannon. Representatives from Japan's Nomura, Schroders, the UK merchant bank, and Goldman Sachs of the US then had a meeting with Mr Ryan. Representatives from Barclays de Zoete Wedd, GPA's UK brokers, were also present. Mr Ryan, already irritated by what he heard, was reported to be even more angry when told that one of the advisers was proposing selling the shares for as little as Dollars 17 in order to be sure of placing Dollars 500m (Pounds 276m) of the stock in the US. One adviser to the group said: 'Mr Ryan hit the roof when he heard that'. The offering will make multi-millionaires out of most of GPA's executive directors. GPA's advisers have now been told to come up with a new price in the next few weeks. The row could cause a serious rift between the advisers, since there are sharp differences of opinion between them on the proper value of the company. It is understood that GPA would like to price the shares nearer to Dollars 30. Earlier this year GPA raised Dollars 100m through a private placement of convertible redeemable preference shares in the US. These convert into ordinary shares at a price of Dollars 34. GPA is considering raising about Dollars 700m of new money in its flotation. However, shares with a value of up to Dollars 1.5bn are likely to be on offer, the precise amount depending on how many of its existing shareholders wish to sell. The sale will also help GPA finance its ambitious programme of aircraft purchases.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Mlechin report: "Japanese Embassy Competing for </F> Title of Most Active in Moscow"]    [Text] The new Japanese prime minister, Hata, has taken an  unexpectedly hard line toward Russia's participation in the  forthcoming conference of the seven leading powers in Naples.  What is this -- a new policy from Tokyo or coincidence?    After Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan, the process of the  clarification of relations between Moscow and Tokyo through  conflict and outrage has entered a sluggish stage: It is  thought that there will be no more surprises, pleasant or  unpleasant. Only professional Russian patriots still suspect  President Yeltsin and Minister Kozyrev of harboring a secret  desire to sell off the Kuril islands.    In the president's entourage, beginning with Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin, there are no politicians prepared to  fulfill the provisions of the 1956 Soviet-Japanese declaration  and renounce either two or four islands at the southern end of  the Kurils chain.    When Tokyo objects to Russia's full-fledged participation in  the G-7 conference, this looks like an attempt to obtain  something from Russia by barter.    When Koji Watanabe, Japanese ambassador in Moscow, spoke to  me he protested keenly: The new prime minister cannot take a  tough line. Hata came to Moscow as foreign minister and vice  premier in mid-March and talked with Viktor Chernomyrdin and  Andrey Kozyrev about expanding dialogue between the two  countries and about Russia's role in the world economy.  Meanwhile, the future premier was not received by Boris Yeltsin  on that occasion, a fact which hardly left the Japanese visitor  with fond memories.    The top Moscow leadership has lost interest in political  talks with Japan. The level of diplomacy has fallen to that of  Poland.    Ambassador Watanabe refuses to recognize that  Russian-Japanese relations are deadlocked:    "From the day that I arrived in Moscow back in January this  year I have heard the most appalling predictions about  hyperinflation, disorder, and political destabilization. Not  one of them has come true."    The 60-year old Koji Watanabe is well known for his love of  an open fire, which he kindles himself, his nostalgia for the  warmth of Italy, where he represented his country before coming  to Moscow, and the frenetic energy with which he acquainted  himself with all the even slightly well known people in the  Russian capital in just a few months.    "I do not know whether I understand correctly what is going  on in Russia," Koji Watanabe remarked. "Sometimes it seems to  me that I have understood something but then the next week I  come to the conclusion that I was hasty..."    Russian diplomats specializing in Japan consider Koji  Watanabe a hypercautious diplomat who avoids improvization and  adheres strictly to instructions received from Tokyo.    The Washington embassy is regarded as Japan's most important  mission; it has 50 percent more staffers than the Moscow  embassy. The embassies in Moscow and Beijing are in second  place. And Tokyo treats its embassies differently.    The small embassy building on Kalashnyy Lane used to have a  dining room for more than 60 diplomatic staff. The Japanese  Foreign Ministry considered it an unnecessary luxury to pay for  a chef and the dining room was closed. To make up for it,  staffers at the Japanese embassy in Moscow have been given three  weeks' extra recuperation leave. That detail provides the best  illustration of how the Japanese see life in Russia.</p>

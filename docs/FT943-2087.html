			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Management: The divide Europe failed to bridge - Anglo-German differences are still profound despite the single European market The traditional differences between German and British management styles were underlined this week by the first comparative study of middle management in the two countries. The report*, by the Anglo-German Foundation, looked at 60 German and UK middle managers working in the brewing, insurance and construction industries between 1991 and 1993. It found striking differences in their qualifications, career paths, attitudes and their whole concept of 'management'. The German managers saw themselves primarily as specialists who owed their authority to their superior technical knowledge. They aimed to convince others primarily by the content of their arguments, not their presentation. They wanted consistency and punctuality, rather than personal drive or enthusiasm, from their subordinates. They guarded their home life jealously, kept rigidly to office hours and some even chose to 'clock in'. In the UK, technical work was viewed as something that should be abandoned in the search for promotion into management. British middle managers saw themselves as scaled-down senior managers whose role was to take the 'larger view'. They were comfortable with uncertainty and had a notion of the job being 'what you make it'. Their subordinates were expected to display initiative, responsibility and honesty. They relied on persuasion and networking to win support and tolerated long, relatively unfocused meetings. They were prepared to work late and at weekends, but had few qualms about making private phone conversations or visiting the bank or dentist during working hours. The research found that qualifications played a larger part in propelling people through the organisation in Germany. Those middle managers with only a technical or commercial apprenticeship stayed in each job for an average of eight years. Those with university degrees stayed in their positions for an average of four years. In the British companies, there was 'a striking willingness' to ignore prescribed qualifications if the 'right candidate' did not happen to possess them. The British managers had greater internal job mobility, partly to avoid stagnation and partly because jobs were less tied to qualifications. The German managers were used to middle managers staying within the same functional area of a firm through their working life. The German companies put a greater emphasis on co-operation than their British counterparts. In Britain, objectives were set up in a way that fostered 'ownership' and accountability, rather than co-operation. Structural, as well as cultural, factors played an important part in explaining this gulf in attitudes. In contrast to the organic growth of German companies, the UK companies were likely to have expanded through mergers, making it more difficult to integrate functions. As a result, the British managers tended to take part in more cross-over meetings in steering committees, working parties and project groups. German companies had at least one and sometimes two fewer tiers of hierarchy than the UK ones. One reason why German middle managers tended to identify downwards was that industrial unions encompassed every type and grade of employee. Another was that managers tended to share an apprenticeship background with their workforce. This system instils occupational pride, reducing the onus on the manager to motivate workers. The findings of this report, which were discussed at a Coopers &amp; Lybrand seminar this week, may have important implications for both nationalities which go beyond the much-rehearsed arguments about the advantages of vocational qualifications. Rosemary Stewart, a fellow in organisation behaviour at Templeton College in Oxford and one of the report's authors, urges British and American managers to ask whether their emphasis on 'management' is overdone. 'Perhaps more involvement in, and more knowledge of, operations would make for greater effectiveness,' she says. She also urges British managers to look at the more simplified organisations of the German companies - possibly why Germans produce equivalent output with fewer staff. German managers may need more job mobility and could benefit from learning from the experience of other managers. At a time of rapid change, German managers may need to be more adaptable, flexible and innovative. Benedikt Koehler, General Manager at Norddeutsche Landesbank in London, says: 'The British style of management is superior when it comes to innovation.' Bryan Rigby, chairman of the employment policy committee at the CBI and trustee of the Anglo-German Foundation, sees changes coming as German and British companies face up to similar pressures. 'The British are starting to plan better,' he says. 'The Germans may be becoming more flexible and adaptable.' The single European market will help narrow the gap between management styles, according to Alfred Kieser of the University of Mannheim, an author of the report. 'A degree of convergence is unavoidable,' he says. 'But it will take a long time.' *Managing in Britain and Germany, price Pounds 5.

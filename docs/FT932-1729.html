			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (18): Finance in the new Europe - Industry FINANCIAL INTEGRATION IN EUROPE by Harald A Benink Kluwer Academic Publishers 202 pages THE financial services industry in Europe probably faces a bigger challenge than any other sector from the Single Market officially established at the beginning of 1993. Whereas manufactured goods have travelled relatively easily across borders in the past (though there are now even fewer impediments), many providers of financial services - especially in the retail markets - have until now found it almost impossible to penetrate European frontiers, either because of regulatory barriers or daunting tax obstacles. Harald Benink, a Limburg University professor based, appropriately enough, in Maastricht, sets out the legislative framework that will determine the future shape of the EC's financial services industry. Most of this framework is now in place - for banking and securities, for instance - but the life assurance directive does not come into force until July 1994 and the pension fund legislation appears stalled. Financial institutions now face fundamental strategic decisions. Benink warns, however, that they should not rush headlong into growth; in the US, with a population about three-quarters that of the EC, banks have found efficiency more important than size. He translates the US motto 'don't get bigger, get fitter' into a European version: 'In any case get fitter, and if necessary get bigger'. Although an academic work, it may prove useful for commercial operators looking for a volume that covers much of the detail of the EC's legal structure for financial services.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Nazeykin, chairman of the Central </F> Committee of the Trade Union of Communication Workers, by Ivan  Akkuratov, correspondent of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA: "Strike on the  Air"]    [Text] After the warning action by communication  workers, when television screens went out in many regions of  Russia, the government promised to look into their problems and  to rectify the situation in the very near future. Therefore, all  the more unexpected is the call for an all-Russian strike by  RTPTs [not further identified] workers. A correspondent of  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA contacted by telephone Anatoliy Nazeykin,  chairman of the Central Committee of the Trade Union of  Communication Workers.    [Nazeykin] After the February events, when communication  workers banged, as they say, their fists on the table, we  managed to handle only last year's debts. Communication workers  have already received about 30 billion. The government promised  to cover the remaining 35.9 billion in the very near future. Up  to now it is unclear what will be this year. Contracts with many  television and radio companies have not been concluded and there  is no financing. It is not even clear how many state television  programs and what their broadcasting volumes will be.    [Akkuratov] Could a meeting with the prime minister solve  the  problems?    [Nazeykin] We have not yet seen Chernomyrdin. Proposals for  the government draft decree on television and radio broadcasting  had to be prepared first. The document must determine how it  will develop and who will manage it. The draft (it already  exists!) discusses the establishment of the Teleradioinform  Company under the Ministry of Communications. In the future  television and radio companies will have to conclude contracts  for technical servicing with it. Taking into consideration the  big delays in the payment for our services, we proposed that a  point on prepayment be introduced into the decree.    [Akkuratov] However, the February action, seemingly, has  brought results. Why are passions inflamed again?    [Nazeykin] Because in a number of regions--Kirov, Kemerovo,  Tula, and Voronezh--they began to set procuracies against  communication workers. Although in February a strike was not  even discussed--a reduction in broadcasting volumes, yes.  Incidentally, in oblasts, where heads of administrations  allocated money from their budget, broadcasting was not reduced.  Now RTPTs labor collectives demand that the prosecution of their  leaders be stopped, but their opinion is ignored.  Dissatisfaction is growing and people are declaring their  intention to use extreme measures.    [Akkuratov] Political demands, as in February, are not put  forward?    [Nazeykin] When in March people receive wages for November  and December--is this policy or not? The state has four  television channels, let it pay for them. If it is unable to do  so, let it give them to commercial structures. Communication  workers are dissatisfied with the fact that television and radio  companies do not settle their accounts with them for  advertising, which takes more and more time on the air.    [Akkuratov] Are you not disturbed by the fact that, by  "punishing" the state, you infringe primarily upon television  viewers' rights?    [Nazeykin] What is left? During the entire year of 1993 we  talked about our unfortunate situation. No reaction. Then we  decided to resort to a reduction in broadcasting. At first we  scheduled this for 1 July and then we postponed this to 12  August. To 1 October. And, again, nothing but promises. The  broadcasting center in Kamchatka was idle for an entire month.  Power engineering workers shut it off owing to our debts. Most  technical centers have been operating to the point of wear for a  long time. Basic equipment has become disabled. There are no  funds to buy new equipment. What is there to wait for?    [Akkuratov] Nevertheless, how realistic is an all-Russian  strike by communication workers?    [Nazeykin] If the attempts to prosecute the organizers of  the  February action do not stop, it will be difficult to guarantee  anything. Labor collectives can no longer be held back by  promises to analyze the situation. If RTPTs leaders are not  protected, the process will become uncontrollable. And then the  consequences are unpredictable.</p>

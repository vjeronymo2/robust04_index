			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / International Company News: Dell Computer posts first loss after charges DELL Computer, the personal computer manufacturer, reported its first quarterly losses after charges of Dollars 71m to cover restructuring, inventory write-offs and other adjustments for delayed and cancelled products. Losses for the quarter were Dollars 75.7m, or Dollars 2.03 a share, compared with net income of Dollars 21.9m, or 57 cents, in the same period last year. Revenues rose to Dollars 701m from Dollars 458m. Dell, until now one of the fastest-growing companies in the computer industry, had previously acknowledged problems with the development of notebook computer products and announced plans for restructuring charges. Other factors contributing to the second-quarter loss included a 'significant sell-off of excess inventory at substandard (profit) margins,' the company said.</p>

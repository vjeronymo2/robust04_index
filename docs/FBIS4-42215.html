			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Subsidies for Eastern Mafia?"] </F>   [Text] Ten fish trawlers are irritating Bonn. They are to  be built by the Peene shipyard in Wolgast for the Russian Ohodsk  Fishing Company, which moved to the tax paradise of Limassol,  Cyprus. Bonn wants to subsidize the order volume of 200 million  German marks [DM] with DM11.85 million. Mecklenburg-Western  Pomerania is to contribute the same amount; negotiations are  currently going on. The deal would secure 500 shipyard jobs for  about two years.    However, "in this way we are financing Russian tax  refugees,"  a confidant of Economics Minister Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party  of Germany) stated critically. Officials in the ministry are  currently examining whether money from the Russian mafia is  being laundered in the deal. The fishing company, which already  has 26 fishing ships, belongs to Russians who apparently want to  circumvent the high taxes in their homeland.    Johannes Ludewig, head of the Department for Economics and  Finances in the Chancellor's Office, arranged the deal during  Russian President Yeltsin's visit to Kohl. Nobody knows why  Yeltsin supported the Ohodsk group so much. However, there is  another snag to the deal: Schwerin wants to wait for Brussels'  agreement to the contract before it forks out subsidies -- and  it is not certain because the amount of the subsidies exceeds  the permitted European Union framework of 9 percent.</p>

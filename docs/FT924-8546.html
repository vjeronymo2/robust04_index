			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Groups may share HK container terminal work THE Hong Kong government yesterday said it would award the work to build the colony's four-berth ninth container terminal (CT9) to three of the four consortia who bid for it. Officials said the decision to approach three groups to build CT9 - which is estimated to cost around HKDollars 10bn (Pounds 843m) - reflected the need to have the terminal operational by mid-1995. Yesterday's announcement took many of the bidders unawares. However, one of the successful applicants was critical of the government's inability to chose a clear winner. The government wants all three consortia to share the cost of building CT9 but, on completion, for Hongkong International Terminals (HIT) and Modern Terminals Limited (MTL) to share two berths and for the Jardine Matheson-led Tsing Yi consortium to operate the other two berths. The Tsing Yi consortium, which includes Sea-Land as operator, said the government's offer was different from the one it has expressed interest in. It said it was now considering the implications of the offer. MTL was also considering the government's offer. The bidding for CT9 has occasioned one of the most acrimonious fights for preferment that Hong Kong has witnessed for many years. Jardine was pitted against Hutchison Whampoa, which controls HIT, and MTL, owned by mainland Chinese interests and Peninsular and Orient Steam Navigation. At stake was the right to own a slice of infrastructure through which much of China's trade with the rest of the world passes. By 1995 the port is expected to handle 8m TEUs (20-foot equivalent units), up from 6m in 1991.</p>

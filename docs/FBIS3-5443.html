Napthong Thongyai, chief of  the Thai Commercial Counsellor's Office in Washington.  Singapore, an ASEAN member, and Korea have approached the NAFTA  partners -- the United States, Canada and Mexico -- to become  members of what is already the world's largest free-trade zone.    According to M.R. Napthong, the US Trade Representative's  office has informed the Thai Commerce Ministry of the two  countries' overtures. Mexico once opposed to the idea of new  NAFTA's members, appears to be doing an about-face and has  recently suggested that other countries in South America could  join the pact.    A Commerce Ministry source said that if Singapore and Korea  were accepted into NAFTA, US investments in other ASEAN  countries including Thailand would be affected. The source noted  that Singapore would be a target for criticism from members of  the ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA] unless it offered similar  preferential tariffs to members of both trade blocs.    He said Singapore may offer lower tariffs on certain items  traded among NAFTA members or shorter enforcement time frames  than those offered to AFTA members. Singapore has long been  known in favour of such an agreement, so many ASEAN members fear  it would offer the US the best deals.    If NAFTA covered Korea, it may erode the competitiveness of  Thai exports in certain items such as textiles and electronic  products in the United States, said the source.    Another source in the Business Economics Department said  there would be little impact on Thai exports to the United  States since Thailand enjoyed lower rates on products such as  computers under the Generalised System of Preferences.    Singapore is the second-biggest exporter of computers to the  United States with a 17.2 percent market share. Japan's share  is 35.2 percent.    The source said Thai exports of textiles, which account for  2.6 percent of the US market, would not suffer because a  bilateral agreement ensured export quotas.</p>

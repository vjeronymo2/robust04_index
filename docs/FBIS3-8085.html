But their  optimism was dented Friday when UN Bosnia commander General  Michael Rose expressed unhappiness about the failure of rival  military commanders to attend a joint meeting the previous day.    "There is no way back," Viktor Andreyev, civilian affairs  officer for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) told AFP Thursday.    UNPROFOR officers have said a ceasefire that began February  11 is holding despite violations that have included mortar fire  within the 20-kilometre (12-mile) heavy weapons exclusion zone  NATO has declared around Sarajevo. Small-arms and grenade  attacks have increased along the confrontation line in the  capital.    "We're going in the right direction but we have to move fast  when these incidents occur to keep it from getting worse,"  UNPROFOR spokesman Canadian Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman said.  [passage omitted]    Sarajevo was calm overnight Thursday but this week has  marked  the most serious shooting in the Bosnian capital since the  ceasefire began. The shooting is coming mainly from the Jewish  cemetery in southern Sarajevo, where French troops are  monitoring the ceasefire on the Bosnian side and Russian troops  are on the Serb side. [passage omitted]    Andreyev said the fact that shelling of Sarajevo had stopped  was the mark of success so far. "One cannot expect things to go  straight and without bumps," he said of prospects for securing a  lasting peace and restoring utilities and other services to the  besieged city.    Andreyev said the process "must succeed. We must succeed."</p>

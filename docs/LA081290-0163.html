			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILLING TO BLOCKADE IRAQ TO STOP ANY OIL SHIPMENT, BUSH SAYS;  </P> <P> SANCTIONS: BUT THE PRESIDENT REPORTS THAT THE U.N. EMBARGO HAS VIRTUALLY HALTED  WORLD TRADE WITH BAGHDAD.  </P> <P> President Bush said Saturday that he would be willing to order a naval blockade  of Iraq, while noting that world trade with the Middle East aggressor has come  to a virtual halt already because of the embargo approved by the U.N. Security  Council.  </P> <P> "With the exception of one small tanker, I believe it was, no vessels from Iraq  or Kuwaiti ports are trying to get out of there with cargo, with oil cargo,"  the President said, adding: "No shipping from Iraq is coming through the Strait  of Hormuz."  </P> <P> Asked whether a decision had been made to impose a trade quarantine, Bush  replied: "I've made the decision in principle, and I think most other leaders  have, that the sanctions will be fully enforced and that exports from Iraq will  not get into the market.  </P> <P> "What we want to do is see that no oil comes out through the Strait of Hormuz.  And if it requires naval vessels to see that that happens, fine." he said. The  strait is a narrow stretch of water leading from the Persian Gulf, on which  Iraq has its only deep-water port, to the oceans of the world.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the U.S. military presence in the Middle East continued to grow,  with a contingent of Marines dispatched from Camp Pendleton and other troops  from Ft. Campbell, Ky. The Pentagon said the units are equipped with missiles  and other sophisticated weapons.  </P> <P> In Kennebunkport on the first full day of his summer vacation, the President  engaged in personal diplomacy to encourage international participation in the  military effort to prevent Iraq from launching an invasion of Saudi Arabia from  its position in Kuwait.  </P> <P> Bush telephoned President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and  the leaders of Bahrain and Qatar to discuss the Middle East crisis and the  international campaign to isolate Iraq and its leader, Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> The goals of U.S. policy in the region are to use a multinational military  force to keep Iraq from attacking Saudi Arabia while relying on the trade  embargo to pressure Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that no Iraqi oil is leaving  Turkey or Saudi Arabia. A Turkish oil terminal on the Mediterranean Sea and a  Saudi terminal on the Red Sea are key transit points for 90% of Iraq's oil  exports.  </P> <P> Bush used extreme caution in discussing whether he would like to see Hussein  overthrown from within. Officials have said privately that such a move by  disaffected Iraqis is the underlying goal of U.S. policy.  </P> <P> "We're not prepared to support the overthrow," Bush said. But, referring to a  policy intended to force the withdrawal of invading Iraqi troops from Kuwait,  the President also said: "Whatever it takes to have our objectives met is what  should take place."  </P> <P> Bush was asked if his objective includes overthrowing Hussein. "I'll just leave  it sit out there and everybody can figure it out," he replied.  </P> <P> The President spoke to reporters from the back porch of his vacation home. He  was joined at his home by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, National  Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and  several deputies.  </P> <P> The advisers gathered to review with Bush the secretary of state's trip to  Turkey and Brussels, where Baker met with NATO foreign ministers, and to  examine potential naval operations near the Turkish and Saudi ports through  which the bulk of Iraqi oil is shipped.  </P> <P> The President is backing up his policy with a rapid deployment of troops from  the United States to the tense region. U.S. Army airborne and mechanized  brigades, Air Force F-15 fighter jets, three U.S. Navy aircraft carrier battle  groups and a large contingent of Marines have either arrived in the Middle East  or are on their way in air and sea lifts.  </P> <P> Reporters asked Bush if he considers it likely that Iraqi citizens will rise up  against Hussein. The President replied:  </P> <P> "That sometimes happens when leaders get so out of touch with reality that they  commit their country to outrageous acts. That does happen. And I know that some  countries around the world are hoping that that will happen in this situation.  But we'll wait and see."  </P> <P> Pressed later on the same point, Bush said he hopes that international action  will produce "an Iraq that is prepared to live peacefully."  </P> <P> "If that means Saddam Hussein changes his spots, so be it. And if he doesn't, I  hope the Iraqi people do something about it so that their leader will live by  the norms of international behavior that will be acceptable to other nations,"  the President said.  </P> <P> The Administration continued to refrain from describing as hostages about 3,500  Americans in Kuwait and Iraq who have not been permitted to leave the two  countries.  </P> <P> Officials have said that calling them hostages would only inflame the  situation, increasing their potential "value" to Hussein.  </P> <P> "Nothing has been demanded or asked in connection with permitting them to leave  the country," Baker said.  </P> <P> "As far as we know, no American citizens have as yet been mistreated," he  added, noting, however, that the situation runs "against all international  norms."  </P> <P> Bush declined to discuss the ultimate size of the U.S. force being sent to  Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> The Pentagon's reports of an initial deployment of about 4,000 was quickly  eclipsed by unofficial estimates of 50,000 and then 90,000. At least one report  subsequently has estimated the possible eventual total as high as 250,000  troops if Iraq invades Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said the Administration would not provide "any numbers on troop  strength for obvious national security reasons."  </P> <P> While such reports could encourage Iraq to strike before the forces grow any  larger, officials said, the unofficial figures also serve as a warning to  Hussein that the United States is willing to pour considerable resources into  the mission.  </P> <P> Throughout the day, Bush mixed work with recreation, sandwiching the 90-minute  meeting with his advisers between a morning ride on his speedboat Fidelity and  an afternoon on the Cape Arundel golf course.  </P> <P> On the golf course, Bush told reporters he might make several trips back to  Washington during his vacation. At least one, next Wednesday, is already  scheduled to allow him to meet with officials for an update on the Iraq  situation.  </P> <P> The President stressed that "there's still room for more diplomacy" in the  effort to persuade Iraq's Hussein to step back from Kuwait. He called attention  to the the resolution adopted Friday by a majority of the members of the Arab  League, recommending that Arab nations commit military forces to the defense of  Saudi Arabia and any other threatened states in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> "I think (Hussein) does see today more clearly than he saw yesterday at this  time that the world is united against him," the President said.  </P> <P> Bush also expressed confidence that excess capacity within the oil industry  would allow the international oil market to remain stable despite the  disruption of exports from Iraq and Kuwait.  </P> <P> In a written statement, Fitzwater praised Venezuela and Iran for pledging to  make up any oil shortfalls and said that as a result of high oil stocks in the  United States, "America is in a very positive situation in terms of its ability  to withstand existing oil disruptions."  </P> <P> He also said the "military participation" offered by Canada, Australia, West  Germany, France, Belgium and Britain "signal a high degree of unity."  </P> <P> Times staff writer John M. Broder, in Washington, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

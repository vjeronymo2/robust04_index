			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Lifeline thrown to Italian state groups The Ciampi government has thrown an end-of-year lifeline to financially troubled state groups by introducing a mechanism to reschedule high interest debt. The main beneficiary will be Iri, the state holding company, which is close to collapse with L80,000bn (Pounds 31.6bn) of debt and expected 1993 losses of L10,000bn. However, other groups such as Eni, the state oil concern, and Enel, the state electricity authority, could also benefit. The measure was approved in the form of a decree late on Wednesday night at the end of a long cabinet meeting that also endorsed new fiscal measures to raise an extra L6,780bn (Pounds 2.7bn) for the 1994 budget. The debt rescheduling mechanism permits the treasury's financial arm, the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, to issue state-backed paper in the name of wholly-owned state companies. This paper, issued at market rates, can then be swapped with bank loans. A treasury spokesman pointed out that state companies had been borrowing at rates of 15-16 per cent from banks, although they were formally backed by a state guarantee. The treasury has yet to decide what form the financial instruments will take, but officials pointed out that interest rates would be around 8 per cent in current market conditions. This would involve a substantial saving in Iri's present financial charges. No figure has been fixed for the size of this rescheduling, but yesterday there were suggestions the treasury would issue at first some L10,000bn in favour of Iri and its subsidiaries. Such measures would save Iri more than L5,000bn in debt service. Despite obtaining L1,850bn from this month's privatisation of its 67 per cent stake in Credito Italiano, Iri's finances are in desperate shape and the group will need to find more funds early next year to finance the restructuring of Alitalia, the state airline, and the sell-off of the Ilva steel group. Cleaning up Ilva for privatisation is likely to cost L4,000bn. Treasury officials insist that the measures do not infringe existing agreements with the European Commission over state subsidies. The government feels it has finally patched up its relations with Brussels in deals over Efim, the state industrial holding in liquidation, and over Ilva, the latter being concluded just before Christmas. The government was allowed in July to refinance the debt of state companies but undertook not to increase the overall level of debt outstanding at the end of 1993. The new measures will not increase the total debt stock of state companies, nor will they weigh upon the budget deficit. The treasury said yesterday the government was anxious to see the debt rescheduling mechanism operational as soon as possible. The measures attracted some hostile comment in the press on the grounds that they smacked of continued state interventionism at a time when the government was seeking to privatise. However, the decree seems to be the least interventionist way of bringing about a quick improvement in Iri's potentially disastrous finances, which in turn will help the privatisation process.</p>

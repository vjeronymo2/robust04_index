Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of the Navy has adopted procurement policies and procedures that implement and supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) [48 CFR] and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). The policies and procedures are known collectively as the Navy Acquisition Procedures Supplement (NAPS). Pursuant to FAR 32.500(b), the Navy developed a shipbuilding progress payments clause for use in fixed price (FP) and fixed price incentive (FI) contracts for construction or for shipbuilding or ship conversion, alteration, or repair, when the contracts provide for progress payments based on a percentage or stage of completion. The shipbuilding progress payments clauses are being revised primarily with the intent of incorporating controls, terms and provisions consistent with those found in the clause at FAR 52.232&hyph;16, Progress Payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. Summary of Major Revisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Definitions. Consolidates the FI clause definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Computation of Payments. The proposed rule modifies the payment limitation of 100% of allowable costs to include unliquidated progress payments made to subcontractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Invoices. The proposed rule modifies the invoicing provision by requiring contractor certification of the amount of unliquidated progress payments made to subcontractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Physical Progress and Weighting Factors. The proposed rule modifies the physical progress and weighting factors provision to give the Contracting Officer the unilateral right to establish the weighting factors if the contractor and the Contracting Officer cannot reach agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Incurred Costs. The proposed rule adds to the list of incurred costs exclusions, costs incurred by subcontractors and suppliers; and capitalized costs and interim payments to subcontractors and suppliers. This provides consistency with the FAR progress payments clause. The proposed rule also removes the small business provision that allows for billing of material costs not paid for by the contractor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Progress Payments to Subcontractors. The proposed rule adds a new section containing provisions from the FAR progress payments clause that govern payments to subcontractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Liens and Title. A proposed provision is added which references Liens and Title provisions found elsewhere in the contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Reduction and Suspension. The proposed rule adds a new section incorporating provisions from the FAR progress payments clause that govern reductions and suspension of progress payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Limitations on Undefinitized Contract Actions. A proposed new section is added incorporating provisions from the FAR progress payments clause that govern limitations on Undefinitized Contract Actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Special Terms Regarding Default. A proposed new section is added incorporating provisions from the FAR progress payments clause that govern treatment of progress payments in a contract default.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule contains no new information collection or recordkeeping requirement under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Supporting data requirements identified in the proposed rule include only data already required to be maintained by shipbuilding contractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> D. Regulatory Flexibility Act Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule will have no economic impact upon small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The shipbuilding progress payment clauses have been incorporated into applicable contracts since the early 1980's, affecting all shipbuilders, large and small. The proposed NAPS rule will benefit the Navy and its shipbuilding contractors by insuring uniform application and administration of progress payments. Therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been performed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

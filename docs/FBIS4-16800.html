			<p>BFN     [Text] Belarusian Premier Vyacheslav Kebich reacted with  irony to the statements by Belarusian ex-speaker Stanislav  Shuskevich and leader of the Belarusian Popular Front Zenon  Poznyak who called the signing of Russian-Belarusian documents  on the unification of monetary systems "a crime,"  press-secretary of the Belarusian prime minister Vladimir  Zametalin told INTERFAX.    He said that "Kebich considers such accusations another  provocation by national-reformists, and the treaty with Russia,  in the opinion of the prime minister, is the only way to  preserve Belarus' sovereignty."    Zametalin also announced the prime minister's plans to hold  an open meeting of the presidium of the Council of Ministers in  the near future with unlimited participation of all interested  parties and mass media in order to stop speculations around  "so-called corruption." (He referred to accusations against  some high-ranking officials made by chairman of the recently  disbanded parliamentary commission against corruption Aleksandr  Lukashenko)    Zametalin also said that the government meeting will be  attended by top officials of the Republic's General Prosecutor's  Office.</p>

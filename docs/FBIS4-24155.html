			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg June 23 SAPA -- The national violence  death toll dropped by 60 per cent from April's 487 to 195 during  May, the Human Rights Committee [HRC] said on Thursday [23  June]. In its monthly report the HRC said violence in  KwaZulu/Natal had continued to drop, with the May death toll of  104 the lowest recorded since January 1993.    Despite ongoing tensions in the area, the declining death  toll supported the HRC's repeated calls for the lifting of the  state of emergency in KwaZulu/Natal, the HRC said. The 195  deaths in May were considerably lower than the 1994 monthly  average of 365 and the 1993 monthly average of 367.    There were 73 deaths in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging], 104 in Natal, and 18 elsewhere, bringing the year  total to 1,826.    Of the 195 victims, ten were women and five children. Two  white civilians were among those killed in May.    The 226 incidents of violence in May represented a 65  percent  decrease from the April figure of 649. This low level of  violence had not been experienced since January 1993, the HRC  said.    Only one "major massacre" took place in May -- the  execution-style killing of 12 people in Thokoza, linked to  fighting between Self-Defence Units in Katlehong.    The right wing, with no deaths attributed to it in May,  appeared to have been neutralised after it caused 24 deaths and  184 injuries during its bombing campaign in April.    Taxi violence, with 14 deaths, increased for the third month  in succession.    On human rights, the HRC recorded declining figures in  detentions without trial, deaths in police custody and political  arrests.    It reported as a violation of the freedom of assembly the  order circulated by Eastern Cape Premier Raymond Mhlaba banning  civil servants in the province from going on strike.</p>

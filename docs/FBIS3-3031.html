At the ongoing NPC session, deputies have already reached  consensus on many major issues. What is needed to be done in  the future is to carefully solve problems in line with the  reality of localities and departments, he said.    Shandong, with a population of 80 million, is a large  province in terms of economy. A total of 174 deputies attended  the annual session of the NPC, of whom some are from Yimeng  Mountains, an old revolutionary base.    During the liberation war period, Shandong people,  especially  people in the Yimeng Mountainous area contributed greatly to  winning the war, Qiao said.    Today it is all the more necessary to carry forward the fine  tradition in order to overcome difficulties and solve problems,  he added.    He urged deputies to make joint efforts to do a better job  in  all fields.</p>

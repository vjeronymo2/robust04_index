The British general, head of the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, spent two hours at the base  which was handed over to UN control last week by the  mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army after being closed since May 1992,  shortly after the outbreak of the war. Peacekeeping troops have  been clearing the airport area of mines left by a succession of  Yugoslav, Serb, and Bosnian forces.    Rose had been "pleased" by the advanced state of repairs on  the runway, base commander Lieutenant-Colonel Hans Jorgen  Nielsen told journalists Monday. Asked about the date of the  first flight into Tuzla, Nielsen said it was a "question of  days." "We have been ready (...) for four or five days. It  will come when the politicians have taken a decision," he  explained.    The first arrival will be an UNPROFOR flight bringing  technical material to prepare an airlift of humanitarian aid for  the people of northern Bosnia, who are surrounded by Bosnian  Serb forces.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisition costs put Borland in loss BORLAND International, the California-based personal computer software publisher, reported a loss for its fourth quarter following additional charges in connection with its acquisition of Ashton-Tate, a database management software company. Revenues for the fourth quarter ending March 31 were 14 per cent down at Dollars 117m (Pounds 66.1m) compared with Dollars 136m. The pre-tax and net loss was Dollars 26.9m against a pre-tax income of Dollars 6.92m last time and after-tax income of Dollars 2.77m. Losses per share were Dollars 1.05 (11 cents earnings). Included in the results was a Dollars 30m charge to cover severance and facilities costs arising from the consolidation of international operations following the Ashton-Tate acquisition. This latest restructuring charge brings the total of pre-tax transactions and restructuring costs related to the acquisition to Dollars 146m. Borland acquired Ashton-Tate last year, in a deal valued at Dollars 439m. Borland's stock price closed down Dollars 2 at Dollars 46.75 in New York on Monday amid concerns that its results would be below expectations. The results were announced after the close. Revenues for the year to March totalled Dollars 483m, (Dollars 457m). The pre-tax loss was Dollars 125m (Dollars 17.9m profit) and net losses for the year amounted to Dollars 110m, or Dollars 4.29 per share, compared with net income of Dollars 4.8m, or 20 cents per share. 'Fiscal 1992 was a pivotal year in Borland's history,' said Mr Philippe Kahn, chairman, president and chief executive. 'In addition to launching significant new products, we laid the foundation for the future with the acquisition of Ashton-Tate. Fiscal 1993 should see us continue our momentum with the release of a new generation of graphical products for a variety of operating systems.' Borland's UK share price, currently languishing at Pounds 26.25, down 25p on the day, has been one of the wonders of London's unlisted securities market. It was the market's best performing stock in 1990, more than doubling over the year to touch Pounds 15.10. It continued its spectacular rise last year reaching a high of Pounds 45.75. For UK investors, however, the price is largely academic because over 90 per cent of Borland's shares are now traded on the over-the-counter market in the US. Its London quote is an anomaly, the result of an early decision by Mr Kahn, the company's French-born founder, to go public in Europe where he had connections with investment bankers. Borland was a pioneer of low-priced computer software sold by, at that time, unconventional methods such as mail order. But despite the often meteoric growth of the company's share price, it has an erratic business record and is moving into an area where it will face direct competition from Microsoft, a leading personal computer software company.

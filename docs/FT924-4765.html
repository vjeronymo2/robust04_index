			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Trust closed Tessa after discussions with Bank BIRMINGHAM Capital Trust, a banking institution, said yesterday that it had closed its Tax Exempt Special Savings Account (Tessa) when it realised that it would not be able to use the deposits as it had first intended. Mr Vernon Norton, a director and company secretary, said the trust had hoped to link the deposits to fixed-interest loans, but then deemed this 'not prudent' because of the requirement for Tessa deposits to remain liquid. BCT has about 200 Tessa depositors and it has written to them saying that it has decided to close its scheme after discussions with the Bank of England. It had offered a fixed interest rate of 12 per cent over five years. The company's accounts showed that it made pre-tax trading losses of Pounds 571,000 for the year to December 31 last year and of Pounds 620,000 for the previous 12 months. It had assets last year of Pounds 1.6m, and made provisions for bad and doubtful debts of Pounds 824,000. It had deposits of Pounds 944,000. Mr Norton said BCT had suffered losses as a result of the declines in the property market and expected to make further provisions in the current year. He added that the executive board of the company had been 'wound down', that it no longer had a managing director, and that new plans on its future structure would be put forward within the next 6 months. The accounts show that there was a capital injection of Pounds 600,000 in July last year and was continuing to try to find other suitable investors. They also show that the company bought a car from Mr Mukkaram Syed, a director, for Pounds 16,000 during the year, and proposed to change its auditors from Overton Salt to KPMG Peat Marwick. The letter sent to Tessa depositors last week said losses in 1990 and 1991 had caused a 'major erosion in the capital base of the company' and that further losses were continuing in spite of the Pounds 600,000 capital injection.</p>

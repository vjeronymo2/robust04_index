			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Robin Hood or just a hoodlum: David Buchan says investigations into Bernard Tapie's business affairs raise questions about corruption in France With Bernard Tapie, Gaul is again divided into three. To some French - and their number can be judged by the 2.5m who voted for his Radical Movement candidates in the European elections - he is a Robin Hood figure who defends the poor. To others, he is a scoundrel who deserves 'the 162 police inspectors and seven investigating magistrates' whom he claims are hounding him for alleged tax evasion, fraud, misuse of corporate funds and football bribery. And there is a third category of spectators, the largest of all, who just chuckle at his latest brush with the law. On Wednesday last week Mr Tapie was dragged out of bed at dawn by police to be taken before a magistrate who put him under formal investigation for tax evasion and fraud. Clearly, matters are becoming serious for Mr Tapie. But the saga so far retains a Tom and Jerry quality, in which the mouse bites back and has still not been finally snared. Mr Tapie greeted police at dawn last week with a string of oaths, which earned him an extra charge of 'insulting representatives of the law'. Later in the day he left the magistrate's office, though without his passport, which had been impounded to prevent him leaving the country. A month earlier, there had been another piquant episode, this time at midnight: Mr Tapie spirited some of his 18th-century furniture and works of art into a suburban Paris warehouse, pursued by private detectives in the employ of his biggest creditor, Credit Lyonnais, which claims Mr Tapie's valuable chattels as security for the FFr1.2bn (Pounds 142m) he owes the bank. But the Tapie affair raises two wider issues. First, it reinforces the impression that France resembles Italy in terms of corruption. The suspicion has been fostered by allegations of improprieties in the financing of political parties and of systematic political kickbacks by construction companies and utilities to obtain public contracts. 'France does not seem like Italy,' says Mr Antoine Gaudino, a former financial police investigator in Marseille, 'but only because French magistrates have not generally been given the same independence to pursue corruption that their Italian counterparts have had in recent years.' Yet yesterday saw evidence of increased activity by the fraud police, who detained for questioning Mr Pierre Suard, president of Alcatel-Alsthom, the electrical engineering group. Second, Mr Tapie's success in winning for his populist, left-wing movement 12 per cent of the Euro-election vote and 13 Euro-seats in last month's European Parliament election has destabilised the left, just as Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front threatened to do on the right. Conspiracy theorists see in these developments the hand of President Francois Mitterrand, who introduced proportional voting in 1986 and gave Mr Le Pen his big electoral break and who, in the Euro-election campaign, reserved his praise for Mr Tapie rather than Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist leader. Mr Rocard was ousted as party leader after gaining only 14.5 per cent of the Euro-vote. This leaves the Socialists in a quandary about how and whether to effect a rapprochement with Mr Tapie and the Radical Movement (MRG) party. Until Mr Tapie joined the MRG last year and effectively took it over, it was an obedient - because not very successful - ally of the Socialists. In last Tuesday's National Assembly vote to lift Mr Tapie's parliamentary immunity on charges of tax evasion and fraud, the Socialists chose to abstain rather than confront the man whose young and working class following they desperately need to regain. But the Socialists face stiff competition from Mr Tapie's populism, which is not wholly without principle. He is widely admired for his strong opposition to the far-right National Front. Apart from that, however, he gives the impression of opportunism. Last Tuesday, for instance, to distract fellow-deputies before they voted to lift his immunity, Mr Tapie tabled a bill to make youth unemployment illegal. During the debate on his immunity, Mr Tapie raised the political stakes as high as he could, warning deputies they might provoke a backlash among 'his' 2.5m voters if they supported the authorities' 'lynching' of him. The conservative government says it is just letting the judicial and tax investigations run their course. It is, however, striking that these investigations have accelerated since March 1993 when the Socialists and Mr Tapie lost power. In 1992 Mr Tapie became minister for cities in the Beregovoy government, resigned because of a row over his alleged short-changing of a business partner in importing electronic equipment, but got his ministry back on Christmas Eve of that year. As striking has been the widespread leaking to the press of magisterial, police and tax reports on Mr Tapie. But some cases against Mr Tapie have been initiated by disgruntled managers of his companies. One involves Testut, a small weighing-machine maker, whose manager filed charges against Mr Tapie for using Testut to get out of debts contracted by another Tapie company, Trayvou, and to fund a fellow MRG politician's campaign. Mr Tapie has not fulfilled his early promise of the 1970s as a white knight galloping to the rescue of stricken firms. According to Mr Christophe Bouchet, who has written a business biography* of the man, the way Mr Tapie typically worked was to target family companies in difficulty, often run by heirs not up to the standard of the founders but anxious to save the family honour. Ideally, such companies would have relatively little preferential debt on whose repayment the tax and social security administrations would have first call, but often substantial commercial debt which Mr Tapie would then buy at a big discount. The final rule was to sell the companies as quickly as possible. Some relatively quick sales produced relatively good book profits - FFr260m from the Look ski wear company (held for six years), FFr470m from the Wonder battery company (held for five years), FFr280m from Adidas, the sports goods manufacturer (held for three years). But, Mr Bouchet notes, the longer Mr Tapie held on to companies, the worse they have done. This is the case with companies such as Terraillon (bought in 1981), Testut (1983), and Trayvou (1983). All three are (curiously given Mr Tapie's problems with the 'lady of justice' symbolised by a pair of scales) in the weighing machine business. All are, also, still on Mr Tapie's hands, as is La Vie Claire, a chain of diet shops bought in 1980. Ironically, in view of Mr Tapie's latest plan to outlaw youth unemployment, all have shed jobs over the years. The Terraillon workforce, for instance, has shrunk from 560 to 30 in its 13 years under Mr Tapie. It is, of course, equally true that the worse these companies have done, the longer Mr Tapie has had to hold on to them. He tried to interest Booker, the UK food distribution group, in buying a stake in 1986 in La Vie Claire, but ended up in 1989 having to buy back all the shares. He actually got Mr Pierre Botton, the son-in-law of the mayor of Lyons, to buy La Vie Claire, but took it back again in 1992 when Mr Botton complained of being misled about the company's true debt. After the sale of Adidas in 1993, Mr Tapie withdrew his holding company, Bernard Tapie Finance (BTF) from the Paris bourse, and the separately quoted Testut and Terraillon were withdrawn from the Paris and Lyons Bourses. BTF is 62 per cent owned by Groupe Bernard Tapie (GBT). This last company, and Financiere et Immobiliere Bernard Tapie (FIBT), a property company that owns his houses in Paris and Marrakesh and Marseille-moored yacht, are wholly owned by Mr Tapie and his wife, Dominique, as personal unlimited liability companies. This has the disadvantage of making Mr Tapie and his wife personally liable for all their possessions, but the convenience of not having to publish accounts. It was on Olympique-Marseille football club that Mr Tapie lavished the time he might better have spent managing his other companies. He produced extraordinary results. The club won five consecutive French championships and was the first French team to win the European cup. But in his quest for soccer success, Mr Tapie also used extraordinary methods, according to allegations by police and a Lyons accountancy firm. To get to the top, O-M needed the best players, and to afford them the club allegedly resorted to a variety of ruses including 'fictitious loans'. Instead of being paid a salary which would have the inconvenience of attracting income tax and social security charges, players were given 'loans' which, at the end of their contracts, were then forgiven. More sensational, however, was the allegation that, just before their victory over Milan, O-M officials offered money to players for Valenciennes, a northern French team, 'not to play too hard' against O-M. A cache of FFr250,000 was later found in the garden of the parents of a Valenciennes player. The case is still under investigation. O-M is said to have large debts, including tax and social security arrears, and is staggering on under judicial supervision. Meanwhile, the French football authorities have demoted the club to the second division and banned Mr Tapie from holding any post in soccer once he has found a buyer for his controlling stake in O-M. Until this year, Mr Tapie had the good fortune to have a loyal bank, the Societe de Banque Occidentale (SDBO). This is a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, the large state-controlled bank which under the stewardship of Mr Jean-Yves Haberer piled up big losses and bad debts. But Mr Tapie's links with SDBO predated the 1988 arrival at Credit Lyonnais of Mr Haberer, who, however, seemed happy to ignore a relationship of which his Socialist political masters evidently approved. As late as 1992 SDBO lent FFr80m to ACT, the company set up by Mr Tapie to manage his four-masted yacht, the Phocea, as a commercial enterprise. The allegation that some FFr55m of this loan actually went to other parts of the Tapie empire, including FFr9m to increase Mr Tapie's capital in O-M, constitutes one of the two cases opened against Mr Tapie so melodramatically last week. The other allegation, leaked in its entirety to the French press, is that Mr Tapie underbilled ACT for his personal use of the Phocea, and used its deficits to underpay income tax by FFr12.4m in 1989-91. Last year's replacement of Mr Haberer by Mr Jean Peyrelevade at the top of Credit Lyonnais spelled trouble for Mr Tapie, though this was not immediately evident. In March, Mr Peyrelevade reached an agreement with Mr Tapie, cutting him off from further credit but giving him five years to pay off his FFr1.2bn debt to SDBO. One of the conditions was that Mr Tapie furnish a detailed valuation of his furniture and paintings, which SDBO had earlier loosely agreed would be security for its loans; Credit Lyonnais says the 'friendly' agreement in March was vital to tightening its mortgage on the furnishings. In the event, Credit Lyonnais claimed it did not get the valuation, got police help to enter forcibly Mr Tapie's house in May to do its own valuation and has tried to call in some of its loans. However, Mr Tapie claims that he has honoured the March agreement by supplying a valuation. The dispute awaits resolution in court in the autumn. So far, media attention has been focused on Mr Tapie, and on how or whether he will get out of the legal labyrinth into which he is now plunged. But the broader question is one posed by Mr Gaudino, the former police investigator in Marseille: will French magistrates, so galvanised into action against Mr Tapie, tackle other forms and sources of corruption? Mr Gaudino's case is instructive. In 1988 he uncovered the Socialist party's system of financing itself through the Urba network of 'bureaux d'etudes'; socialist politicians throughout the country asked companies seeking public contracts to pay a commission to Urba offices, which were supposed to evaluate the bids but in fact simply paid the commissions into the party's central coffers in Paris. Mr Henri Emmanuelli, who has just become the Socialist party's leader but who in the late 1980s was its treasurer, is still under investigation for his role in the Urba network. Following his investigative diligence, Mr Gaudino was struck off the police roster, to which he was formally reinstated last year by the new conservative government. But, like many other professional investigators, Mr Gaudino is convinced that 'corruption exists on the right, except that it is more atomised, with individual right-wing politicians taking money, usually in cash, for themselves and a bit for their party'. One of the magistrates who investigated Mr Emmanuelli over Urba is now trying to trace an allegation that a commission paid by Pont-a-Mousson, a pipe-making company, to win a contract in Nantes may have ended up in the pocket of Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister and Republican party president. Mr Longuet has denied any knowledge of the commission. Decentralisation over the past 10 years, and granting greater powers to French regions, departments and communes to award public contracts, has certainly increased the potential for corruption. French elections, particularly at the presidential level, also remain very expensive in European terms. If the problem is indeed general, then nothing would do more to prove Mr Tapie's charge of hypocrisy against the French establishment than selective pursuit of him. *Tapie: L'Homme d'affaires.

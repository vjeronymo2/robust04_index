			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Letter: A lesson in protectionism Sir, If Ronald Dore ('Preaching pragmatism to free trade church', July 8) thinks British bureaucrats have come up with something new in the way of 'a sensible and pragmatic form of protectionism', he is sadly mistaken. What does he think Japanese bureaucrats have been doing all these years? The result is the world's biggest GNP per capita among the large industrialised countries and virtually no unemployment. Dore's proposals for a new concept on trade and investment are insufficient without the highly trained and dedicated bureaucrats to implement it. Therefore, what is needed is a transplant of the skilled Japanese practitioners of the art to Britain. Mark Popiel, 28-20 Denenchofu Minami, Ota-ku, Tokyo 145, Japan</p>

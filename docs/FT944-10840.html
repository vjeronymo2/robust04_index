			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Tory councillors 'bullied staff' Conservative members of Westminster City Council 'bullied officers into doing work which was political because they were frightened for their jobs', the public inquiry into gerrymandering allegations was told yesterday. The claim was made by Mrs Patricia Kerwan, the council's head of housing between 1983 and 1987, who was the first senior Westminster Tory councillor to go public with the details of the allegations when she appeared on a BBC Panorama programme in 1989. This led to a four-year investigation by the district auditor who said in a provisional report that 10 councillors and council officials had 'wasted' Pounds 21m by selling homes at a discount to entice likely Tory voters into marginal wards. Mrs Kerwan was called as a witness by two of the accused - Dame Shirley Porter, former council leader; and Mr Barry Legg, a former councillor who is now Conservative MP for Milton Keynes South West. Under cross-examination, Mrs Kerwan said she had opposed the sales scheme and had fallen out with Dame Shirley. She said the scheme was 'drawn up with a view to increasing the Conservative vote in eight key marginal wards - that was wrong'. Dame Shirley had 'hammered councillors into the ground' to produce a scheme to gentrify the marginal wards. She said that she had been under pressure from the leadership to write papers in 1986 on how to target housing policies towards marginal wards. Mrs Kerwan stood unsuccessfully against Dame Shirley for the post of leader in 1987 because she 'didn't like her style, her attitude and way of working'. The inquiry continues.</p>

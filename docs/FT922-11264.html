			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / UK Company News: Five Oaks Investment makes good progress CONSIDERABLE progress was made by Five Oaks Investment, the property group, in the six months ended December 31 1991, the pre-tax loss being cut from Pounds 7.88m to Pounds 371,000. Rental income improved from Pounds 1.48m to Pounds 1.56m, while sales from investment properties were only Pounds 207,000 (Pounds 1.12m). The biggest factor, however, was no provision for reduction in value of completed developments, against Pounds 8.3m last time. Vacant space in the income producing portfolio had fallen from 5.8 per cent at the year-end to only 3.5 per cent to date. In February the Court confirmed the scheme to offset the deficit on distributable reserves. No ordinary dividend can be recommended yet, nor, in the absence of reserves, can preference payments be resumed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report: "The Federation Council Speaker </F> Will Take Care of Security"]    [Text] Recently there has been a series of edicts on  including new state officials into the Security Council. But  Boris Yeltsin's latest appointments stand out from this crowd.  Two weeks ago it was announced that Ivan Rybkin has become a  member of the Security Council. Now the other speaker --  Vladimir Shumeyko -- has been included into the council as a  non-permanent member. With this appointment the president  honors the terms of the national accord pact while the speaker  gets the possibility to expand his presence on the Russian  political Olympus.    The edict appointing Vladimir Shumeyko to the Security  Council lay in the Kremlin exactly two weeks: It is dated 23  May (on that day Ivan Rybkin was officially co-opted into the  Security Council). An official in the presidential  administration explained that the delay in promulgating the  edict was due not to political but to "diplomatic" reasons: The  Kremlin thought it unethical to publish the edict before the  Federation Council speaker's return from his Latin American tour.    As far as Shumeyko himself is concerned, this course of  events is very opportune. Expanded powers are vital at present  for the speaker of the parliament's upper chamber. With all the  importance of Shumeyko's position, and his authority in the  Federation Council, his prospects as a politician are at best  foggy. Under the Constitution, beginning in 1995 Federation  Council members will not be elected but appointed: One  representative from the legislative and executive branch of each  component. And in accordance with the fundamental law, the  career of Shumeyko the senator is to end (unless, of course,  corresponding changes are made in the Constitution) in a year  and a half.    Shumeyko's life shows that he is not among those who would  be  happy to continue his career as an ambassador or president of  some foundation. Likewise, after his position as chairman of  the parliament upper chamber, he will hardly be content with a  mere deputyship. Perhaps the sole place acceptable to Shumeyko  is the president's chair. But the play for the presidency  involves a great number of dangers: Everyone remembers Sergey  Shakhray's sad experience. Moreover, participation in elections  as Yeltsin's rival not only reduces Shumeyko's chances to zero,  but could also mar his relations with long-standing associates.  Yet something else is also remembered. Boris Yeltsin once let  drop a phrase to the effect that a new leader should be at least  tall enough and that he, Yeltsin, intends to breed his own  successor. Obviously such statements by the president could not  but set Shumeyko thinking in a certain direction.    Therefore, if Yeltsin does not run for another term,  Shumeyko's candidacy as "heir" will be quite in place. His  connections with regional leaders and his contacts (in the post  of chairman of the Interparliamentary Assembly) with the CIS  state leadership will be to his advantage. Yet the seriousness  of Shumeyko's intentions comes through especially clearly in his  efforts to promote friendly relations with the army. On 21  April Vladimir Shumeyko stated that he "intends to get  acquainted with all branches of the Armed Forces and meet their  commanders and personnel." Unlike the president, who has  apparently forgotten about his monthly "military day," the  speaker conscientiously visits military units. He accompanies  these trips by loud statements about the need to increase the  military budget and revise articles of military laws granting  service deferments to too many -- in the military's opinion --  of those liable for conscription. Moreover, Shumeyko has taken  such a liking to the Baltic Fleet sailors that he decided to  "adopt" (of course, on behalf of the Federation Council) a  missile carrier.    The speaker's rising influence cannot but be enhanced by his  participation in Security Council sessions. The possibility of  promoting good relations with the power ministers, participation  in discussing the key aspects of national security, and finally  the mere presence in the presidential "inner circle" should help  Vladimir Shumeyko prepare a reliable bridgehead for subsequent  maneuvers.</p>

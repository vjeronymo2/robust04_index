			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by special correspondent Ernesto Esparza] </F>   [Excerpts] Tijuana, Baja California -- Self-described  insurgent Subcommander "Marcos" of the Zapatista National  Liberation Army [EZLN] is Jesuit Priest Jeronimo Hernandez  Lopez, according to an investigation by a special federal  government group that has its center of operations in Chiapas  State.    According to the results obtained from computerized tests,  photographs, recordings of his voice, physical similarities, and  videocassettes, it was possible to establish that the enigmatic  figure who emerged on 1 January in the armed conflict in the  mountains of Chiapas is a priest of approximately 36 years of  age.    According to confidential information obtained by SUMMA,  Jeronimo Hernandez Lopez was sent to Chiapas State four years  ago. However, for over two years no one has known in which  community he lives.    Photographs obtained by this newspaper corroborate the  results of the investigation conducted by the specialized group,  which reveals the considerable resemblance and body similarities  shared by the priest and Subcommander "Marcos."    Another piece of information that corroborates this is that  "Marcos'" guerrilla comrades in the mountains of Chiapas call  him the "Monk from Altamirano;" furthermore, in the jungle,  mountains, or in combat, he constantly changed his code to avoid  being identified.    "Marcos'" alleged identity was obtained through operation  "Identity," for which it was necessary to have a special agent  infiltrate the EZLN. Through this agent the Federal  Government's special group learned all of the insurgents'  tactical moves, especially those of its spokesman who, it is  said -- behind the [ski] mask he always wears when he appears on  television or is photographed -- is a Jesuit priest who  occasionally says mass dressed in white and without a "hood."  [passage omitted]    Jeronimo Hernandez Lopez' curriculum, the investigation  states, shows that he has always been of a revolutionary bent  and that when he was sent to Chiapas he welcomed the appointment.  <H5>  Conscientious Investigation </H5>   SUMMA gained access to the investigation whereby the  subcommander's alleged identity was established. The most  interesting study of all was, unquestionably, the computerized  physiognomical study because the eyes, forehead, mouth and nose  of the enigmatic figure were compared with hundreds of faces  that bore the same characteristics. The task was difficult and  quite complicated because there was no room for mistakes.  According to the federal government's theory, the Jesuit priest  "meets all the requirements" to be Subcommander "Marcos."    Another key feature in the establishment of similarities  between both men was the pockmark or mole that both have between  the corner of the eyebrow and the eyelid of the right eye.  Likewise, the sharp and robust nose; skin color; eyes, which  are light brown; the shape of the mouth; the breadth of the  forehead is the same; and voice and arm movements.    A comparison was made between "Marcos'" voice during the  interviews he has granted to the electronic media and the voice  of the Jesuit priest officiating mass. The priest's voice was  [recorded] during a mass he presumably officiated in Ocosingo  Municipality several hours after the armed uprising on 31  December 1993.    In his homily on that occasion, Hernandez Lopez said: "We  will never again allow the murder of a single Indian; to do this  we must defend ourselves and always remain united at all cost,  with God's help."  <H5>  State Secret </H5>   This investigation, which the Federal Government considers a  "state secret" and which was already disclosed to the highest  ranking officials of the current administration, resulted from  the arduous labor of almost three months.    We do not know if, now that the negotiations for stable  social peace are to resume in Chiapas, this investigation will  be published, but for the time being SUMMA has done so, not with  a desire to create confusion over the real identity of  Subcommander "Marcos," but solely to attest to the veracity of  this information, which is of national and international  interest.    We are hereby reiterating our desire to be at the  journalistic forefront in order to serve our readers.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> LYME DISEASE SYMPTOMS LINGER  </P> <P> Some victims of Lyme disease may suffer memory loss, mood changes, tingling  sensations, shooting pains and other signs of nerve damage that strike years  after the initial tick bite, scientists have found.  </P> <P> Antibiotic therapy can often relieve these lingering symptoms, although  recovery is seldom complete.  </P> <P> "This is similar to syphilis," said Dr. Allen C. Steere. "Although the  neurological symptoms and consequences are different, in both diseases there  are long periods of latent infection in the brain followed by a variety of  neurological disorders." The doctors cautioned that only a few Lyme patients  suffer this lingering nerve disorder, and most can be cured with antibiotics  given early during their infections.  </P> <P> Steere, who first recognized the disease in Old Lyme, Conn., about 15 years  ago, was senior author of the latest report, written with two colleagues at New  England Medical Center in Boston. It was published in last week's New England  Journal of Medicine.  </P> <P> Lyme disease is a bacterial infection transmitted by tiny ticks that are  usually carried by deer and mice. It is common throughout the Northeast,  Midwest and California.  </P> <P> Usually, the first sign of Lyme disease is a red circular rash around the tick  bite. It is often accompanied by fever, fatigue, aches and other flu-like  miseries. In more advanced stages, the disease can cause arthritis and  neurological problems.  </P></p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Caustic claimant to the throne: Fear and truculence could mark the first session of Russia's newly-elected parliament The first speech to the lower house of the Russian parliament - the state duma - should be given at its opening today by Mr Georgi Lukava, at 68 its oldest member. It is a nice newly-minted gesture to honour age: the problem arises only with Mr Lukava's affiliation. He is a member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the ultra-nationalists who command 64 seats in the duma, making them the second largest group in the fragmented assembly and by far the biggest in that half of the duma's 450 seats chosen by party affiliation. Russia's newest and most alarming claimant to power thus has the first word. There are those, including some of the radical democrats, who think it may have the last word, too. As the implications of last month's elections sink in, and as the signs from the presidency point increasingly towards a course which at best slows the pace of economic change, the reformers grow pessimistic and talk of going into opposition. When President Bill Clinton flies into Moscow he will find a city in which the main political actors find it difficult to speak their lines, because their parts are still being written. Only Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the LDP, seems as completely certain of himself as ever - responding to Mr Clinton's speech in Brussels on Sunday evening with a threat to 'annihilate' any Nato division which approached the borders of the former Soviet Union. Though shunned by European countries, thrown out of Bulgaria, and absent from Mr Clinton's busy schedule, Mr Zhirinovsky has effortlessly kept media attention by his pronouncements, the now familiar mixture of bombast and sweet reason. Among the latter, he has said he is willing to co-operate in parliament with any of the elected groups, including the main liberal party, Russia's Choice, though he favours the Communists and the Agrarian Party. He seems to have come to at least a tactical agreement with them to push for chairmanships of important committees - and may claim the foreign affairs chairmanship for himself. Though the arithmetic will remain unclear until the independent deputies - who make up the majority of the 50 per cent of the duma elected in first-past-the-post contests - decide which way to vote, it now seems likely that it will be largely hostile to reform and strongly nationalistic in tone. Under the constitution, the parliament has few real powers to challenge the president and can only vote down his choice of a government by securing a two-thirds majority. However, it is freely elected, and it seems that President Boris Yeltsin has chosen to co-operate and compromise with it to stop or at least delay the kind of confrontation which led to the shelling of the White House in October. Even before the elections, it was clear that Mr Yeltsin's team was adopting a harsher tone in its foreign policy stance: that tone is now being further strengthened. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, now makes threatening speeches against Ukraine for its continued retention of nuclear weapons, and has sought to appear more patriotic than Mr Zhirinovsky when the latter commented that Germany might share the administration of the north-west region of Kaliningrad (formerly Konigsberg). At the same time as Mr Kozyrev set out to reassure the west that ultra-nationalism would not influence his foreign policy, he demanded that the west desist from 'preaching' to Russia on how it should act. This tone is being picked up and amplified. At a press conference yesterday to publicise the creation of the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service designed to replace the Security Ministry (itself replacing, or renaming, the KGB), Mr Sergei Stepashin, the service's first deputy director, complained that the west - and the former Soviet states, especially the Baltics - had stepped up its intelligence activities and were seeking to recruit senior Russian officials as spies. This may be true, but to announce it so close to the Russia-US summit is to make a political, rather than a factual, point. The Russian attitude to the former Soviet states is clarifying itself - and hardening. Membership of the Commonwealth of Independent States increasingly means submitting to Russia's economic and security priorities. With the exception of the Baltic states, the economic prostration of these countries, or the large amounts of Russians within their borders, or both, dictate that the behest of Russia is usually heeded. In the case of Belarus, the least independent-minded of the former Soviet republics, it now appears that under an economic treaty agreed in principle last week, the smallest Slav state will essentially be reincorporated into Russia. Ukraine, the second largest (after Russia) of the former Soviet Slav countries, remains the largest potential problem, and one to which the new parliament will pay at least as much attention as the old. Mr Clinton has been optimistic about Ukraine's readiness finally to sign an agreement to hand over its nuclear weapons to Russia, but such an accord has been reached before, and they remain in Ukraine. Within Russia itself, the chances of a reform course continuing to be underpinned by the commitment of an all-powerful president appear to have dwindled in the opinion of the reformers themselves. Mr Yeltsin yesterday announced the shape of the government - slimmed down to four deputy prime ministers and to 26 ministers. He told Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, to name his team within a week. That team, the reformers believe, will certainly not be more strongly committed to economic reform than the last. It may, on some scenarios, lack any of the leading reformers altogether. Mr Chernomyrdin is constitutionally the second most powerful figure in the country and has made it clear he sees a centrist course as the salvation for Russia. A presidential decree yesterday named his closest (and conservative) aide, Mr Vladimir Kvasov, as head of the government's administrative secretariat, with ministrial rank. Mr Chernomyrdin is no reactionary, but he has been a reluctant radical. A weathervane politicially, he is swinging back to a middle ground which is still to be defined but which will certainly downplay the macroeconomic stabilisation which the radicals have struggled - so far unsuccessfully - to achieve. Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister and the symbol of Russian reform, is likely to be named again as one of the two first deputy premiers, according to sources in the presidential administration and among the reformers. Doubts remain over the fate of Mr Anatoly Chubais and Mr Boris Fyodorov, respectively deputy prime ministers for privatisation and finance. Both, in their different ways, are less accommodating than Mr Gaidar, more intent on demanding a commitment to deepening the reform process and to an end to the compromises and half-measures which they believe marked the government last year. Their agendas, differing from Mr Gaidar's, may mean a split in the reformers' ranks. Russia now has all the trappings of a democracy - a constitution, an elected president, an elected assembly, a free press and an independent judiciary whose members are still to be appointed. Its first democratic parliament reflects its mood, fearful and truculent, scornful of its former weakness in being so nice to other countries. This need not mean disaster. It will, however, mean that 1994 will be another year of dangerous living.</p>

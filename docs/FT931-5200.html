			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Skiing: Keep it in the family at Snowmass THERE ARE few places more suited for an English-speaking family skiing holiday than Aspen's Snowmass village, in the heart of America's Rocky Mountains. Aspen and families might seem an unlikely combination, given that the attractive Victorian mining town is the most glitzy US skiing resort - a sort of Hollywood winter retreat. And Aspen Mountain is hardly kid's stuff: a mogul skier's delight, it boasts not a single green run. Yet just 20 minutes up the valley of the Roaring Fork River lies Snowmass, a resort with miles of varied intermediate skiing which is tailor-made for families. Snowmass is friendly, informal and more down to earth than Aspen. It is also extremely children-friendly. It may cost more than Europe, and be farther away, but it has two big advantages. The first is that Americans speak the same language (more or less) - no small thing when you are half-way up a mountain seeking advice on how to get to the bottom. The second is the quality of instruction. Americans generally like and relate to children in a way that Europeans (Britons especially) seem to find harder. This shines through at most ski schools, where the instructors clearly enjoy the company of their charges and the emphasis is on having fun and bolstering self-confidence. So, having decided on a US holiday, why pick Snowmass? First, because it is in the Rockies, which gets better snow than icy New England. Second, because of its huge expanse of intermediate skiing, which absorbs large numbers of skiers and still leaves uncrowded slopes and virtually no lift lines. For advanced skiers, the mountain also offers challenging terrain, such as the Hanging Valley run, although real experts will tend to head for Aspen Mountain and a third local resort, Aspen Highlands, both of which are covered with difficult black trails. And third, because the Snowmass ski school is outstanding. In surveys it is consistently ranked among America's top learning centres, together with the one at a fourth mountain in the Aspen area, Buttermilk. Victor Gerdin, director of the Snowmass school, says his children's instructors are all people who have specified that they want to work with kids - and it shows in their exuberant encouragement and endless patience. Certainly my three children - David, nine, Lizzie, seven and Kate, five - all rated their instructors 'really great.' By the end of a week Kate, who had barely skied before, had advanced from crude snowploughs to parallel 'hockey stops' and tricks like skiing backwards. David and Lizzie also made good progress, and particularly liked the special 'kid's trail map' marking secret spots - such as 'Jaws' and 'Pinball Alley' - around the mountain that are not known to adults. The school offers several children's programmes. There is day-care for infants from 18 months to three years; an introductory ski programme for three- to six year-olds; ski school for six- to 12 year-olds; and a teenage programme including evening activities ranging from ice skating to pizza parties. Adult beginners might do better on the smaller Buttermilk mountain, which lies just outside Aspen town and also offers highly rated childrens' programmes (from the age of three). Buttermilk is such a benign mountain to learn on that the ski school guarantees that absolute beginners will ski from to bottom in just three days' instruction or get their Dollars 99 fee back. The design of Snowmass village also makes it attractive for families. The 25-year-old village is hardly scenic, but planning regulations have kept building heights down, so it is not the visual eyesore of some modern US and European resorts. Its few hotels and large number of 'condos' ( apartment buildings) are on or very near the slopes, so that most visitors can ski to their accommodation. Snowmass is not perfect. One of its biggest failings is the lack of a separate area for the childrens' school, which means that tiny tots share the main village skiing thoroughfare with everyone else. And the Snowmass village centre, a glorified shopping mall, is devoid of atmosphere and nightlife. But there is plenty of that in Aspen, and plenty of babysitters on hand to relieve those couples capable of rocking the night away after a hard day's skiing - and parenting.</p>

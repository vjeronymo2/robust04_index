			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (1): Alive and kicking - After stemming the decline of the 1960s and 1970s, Glasgow is fighting to avoid the worst of the present recession. At the same time, it is trying to create and consolidate a new basis for its future prosperity GLASGOW last winter formally sent into retirement its famous slogan Glasgow's Miles Better, which, enlivened with the cheery face of Mr Happy, had for a decade been pasted to the side of buses in both Glasgow and London, and, translated into foreign languages, taped proudly to the luggage of Glaswegians travelling abroad. The decision to drop the slogan was a symbolic moment of transition. It showed that Glasgow thinks the world has now accepted that it has pulled itself out of the decline to which it seemed to be condemned in the 1960s and 1970s, and that it is time for the next stage in the city's recovery. Yet there seems to be a widespread realisation in the city that the next stage is not likely to be particularly easy, nor are its outlines very clear. The greater sobriety of the new slogan, Glasgow's Alive, (said to be more convenient than its predecessor for putting on to almost any document originating in Glasgow) has a durability that may be required during the long haul ahead. The revival of Glasgow has so far been one of the success stories of urban regeneration in Britain. In the 1970s the economic base of this once great shipbuilding and manufacturing city was declining at an alarming rate; its population fell by 33 per cent between 1961 and 1981, not just through organised dispersal to new towns but by emigration motivated by despair. The city had an intimidating reputation for grime and crime. A turning point came in 1975 when the new Strathclyde regional council persuaded the government to abandon the creation of another Scottish new town and divert the money to the regeneration of the decayed east end of the city. Gradually a coalition of forces - the Scottish Development Agency, the Labour controlled regional and district councils and the private sector - developed a strategy for recovery, which involved pouring in very large quantities of public money. Much of this came from a Pounds 350m EC integrated development grant negotiated by Strathclyde regional council. Glasgow was perforce to become a largely post-industrial city, concentrating on developing its service activities. The initial aim was to improve the centre of the city, not least by property development, new retail complexes and extensive stone-cleaning, making the centre one of the main generators of wealth. Glasgow would also exploit its already strong cultural assets to become a tourist destination and develop its distinguished university base to become an exporter of graduates and knowledge. What made the policy work was the existence of a form of collective leadership that was lacking in Liverpool, a city with comparable problems, which took such a different path to Glasgow in the 1980s. Glasgow's Labour politicians became almost Conservative in their fiscal rectitude and grasp of commercial reality; the city's business leaders are committed people who for the most part live in the city rather than escaping to the countryside in the evening. The landmarks of revival are the Glasgow's Miles Better slogan which struck a happy note with Glaswegians when it was launched in 1983 ('people just flooded into the City Chambers to pick up the stickers,' says Mrs Jean McFadden, leader of the district council); the Glasgow Garden Festival of 1988; and the city's year as European City of Culture in 1990, which culminated in the opening of the Pounds 28.5m Royal Concert hall. Yet despite all the achievements, unemployment in Glasgow never dropped below 14 per cent in the recent upturn and has lately risen to 15.5 per cent, with no less than 21.6 per cent of the male workforce out of work. Manufacturing is still declining despite the fact that Glasgow has some good engineering and shipbuilding companies: it now occupies only 16 per cent of the work force. The population is still falling, although the drop from 765,000 in 1981 to 654,000 in the 1991 census may have been exaggerated by as much as 35,000 by poll tax non-payers not registering in the census. Above all, while the centre and the west end of Glasgow are now rather smart, and surrounding areas like the east end, Govan and even the Gorbals are improving, there are still great areas of wretched accommodation, poverty and misery in the peripheral areas of Easterhouse, Drumchapel, Castlemilk and Pollok. Last year, the Scottish Development Agency was wound up and replaced with a network of local enterprise companies under the umbrella of the new Scottish Enterprise. Glasgow gained the Glasgow Development Agency, which has a budget this year of Pounds 67m to spend on training, property and environmental improvement and assistance to business. Mr Stuart Gulliver, its thoughtful, chain-smoking chief executive, exudes what the agency calls the 'new mature realism' about Glasgow. 'Any turnaround of a city like Glasgow takes about 25 years, a full generation. So far we've done 10 years and transformed the urban landscape, laying a patina of improvement across the city. There's far more to be done.' He is frustrated that the recession, which came late to Glasgow, is putting a brake on development and forcing businesses to concentrate on survival rather than long-term improvement. He admits that the agency's prime target group among the city's 50,000 unemployed has to be the top 30 per cent - 'the walking wounded who have their work ethic intact'. He fears that the bottom 30 per cent - 'second or third generation unemployed, living in a world of drugs and crime' - are beyond reach of an organisation like the GDA. About these people Mr Robin Boyle, formerly at Strathclyde university's centre of planning, wrote recently: 'Glasgow's poor are simply no longer part of the city. In economic, political or social terms, their alienation from urban life is almost complete. 'Years of isolation bred hopelessness; the reponse of the very poorest has been to withdraw into a personal world of survival, far removed from city centre renewal, waterfront housing and new shopping centres.' Mrs McFadden, who recently replaced the powerful Mr Pat Lally as Labour leader on the council, voices a similar anxiety. 'I've always said Glasgow's Miles Better only referred to the centre of the city. It was a sick joke for people living in damp houses in Easterhouse.' Like many leading people in the city she expresses a longing for a revival of manufacturing in Glasgow. The great expansion of jobs in services, she says, is 'very worrying because these jobs do not pay as well as those in manufacturing, tend to involve women rather than men and, especially in tourism, are vulnerable to recession'. Where does Glasgow go now? The city council and the GDA have formed a strong partnership which will continue the strategy of developing service industries such as tourism, and attracting more companies to set up branch or head offices in the city, and, it is hoped, factories. Mr Gulliver says a long term policy of upgrading skills and performance throughout the businesses of the city is essential. Michael Kelly, who as Lord Provost launched the Glasgow's Miles Better campaign and now runs a public relations agency while also advising other British cities on how to stage recovery, believes a big new initiative is needed to succeed the garden festival and the city of culture ventures. 'I've suggested we celebrate the ending of World War two, possibly in conjunction with other European cities'. He rejects the idea that this approach to reviving a city is purely cosmetic and does not produce lasting effects. 'Why do women use cosmetics? Because they are effective.' But the calm Mrs McFadden says Glasgow no longer needs spectacular new events to follow up the garden festival and the city of culture year. 'We don't need a big event every so often any more. A lot of the groundwork of recovery has been done. What Glasgow needs now is constant marketing to proclaim our advantages and attract both visitors and companies.'</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT;  </P> <P> NBC FLIES HIGH WITH 'PETER PAN'  </P> <P> NBC's first broadcast of "Peter Pan" since 1973 enchanted viewers again,  winning a respectable 27 share of the audience Friday night and helping the  network tie CBS' all-time record of 40 weeks in a row atop the ratings,  according to A. C. Nielsen figures released today.  </P> <P> NBC's victory was not without a scare from ABC, which came within half a point  of the leader, thanks to a strong performance by the movie "The Women of  Brewster Place," which ranked No. 2 behind ABC's "Roseanne."  </P></p>

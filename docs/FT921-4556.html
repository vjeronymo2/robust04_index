			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Early rate cut option recedes as pound weakens: Lamont warned on easing loan costs in Budget week THE CHANCES of a cut in interest rates to accompany the Budget, or follow shortly afterwards, have dwindled after last week's weakening of sterling and nervousness in the market for government gilt-edged securities. Although a politically inspired rate cut cannot be ruled out - especially if the Budget is given an enthusiastic reception on financial markets - both the Treasury and Bank of England have advised Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, against reducing rates this week. The Bank of England has been trying for several weeks in its domestic money market operations to dissuade traders from expecting an imminent cut in bank base rates from the present 10.5 per cent level. Some 10 days ago, the Treasury used the Treasury Bulletin to highlight the limited scope for rate cuts since the differential between official UK and German short term rates has fallen to 0.75 percentage points. Since then, sterling has weakened in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System and on Friday was at its EMS floor against the Spanish peseta. Sterling is now around the level where it will require Bank of England support in the ERM if it comes under selling pressure. In a further sign of nervousness, prices for gilt-edged securities fell by as much as 2 points last week, reflecting investors' fears about the government's standing in the opinion polls and expectations that tomorrow's Budget will see the announcement of a sharply higher public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 25bn or more for 1992-93 . Ministers have been warned that reducing the 0.75-point premium of UK bank base rates over the Bundesbank's 9.75 per cent Lombard emergency funding rate might not be sustainable during an election campaign. Officials have pointed to the example of France which was unable to keep its rates at German levels in spite of a lower inflation rate than either Germany or the UK and more than five years of successfully maintaining its present ERM parity. As late as last week, however, there were still strong expectations in the City of a rate cut. A poll of 22 banks and investment houses in the UK, carried out by MMS International, the business information group, on March 4, found that 71 per cent of respondents expected the next cut in base rates 'just after the Budget'. UK interest rates were cut at Budget time for eight successive years in the 1980s. Last year - after two years without a Budget-week rate cut - Mr Lamont cut rates by a half percentage point after waiting three days for financial markets to digest his first Budget. He will have to move quicker this week if he intends to cut rates. It is generally expected that Mr John Major, the prime minister, will launch the campaign for an April 9 general election on either Wednesday or Thursday, after which a rate cut would be highly unusual. By convention, UK governments do not cut rates in an election campaign. Ministers have tended to regard such action as too overtly political. Britain's annual Budget should be scrapped and replaced with a more considered system of formulating fiscal policy, according to Sir Douglas Wass, a former permanent secretary at the Treasury. Sir Douglas said the Treasury's 'archaic' secrecy in preparing for the Budget was unnecessary and reduced the possibilities of a public debate about tax policy and the economy.

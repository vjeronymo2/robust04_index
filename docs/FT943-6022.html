			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Prize of peace in Ulster has never been closer It may be too soon to celebrate. It is not too early for hope to displace the cynicism that has long suffocated politics in Northern Ireland. The prospects for a permanent peace remain uncertain. But the prize has never been closer since the present round of killings started 25 years ago. The grip of history has been loosened. Building a political settlement in a province where many are more frightened of peace than of war will not be easy. The misery inflicted on the people of Ulster by the mindless killings is matched only by the mutual mistrust across the sectarian divide. The habit of murder is deeply ingrained. Nor does it take much understanding of the past to appreciate that the objectives of the IRA and of the unionist majority are as irreconcilable today as they have ever been. After so many vicious murders over so many years, no one can be expected to take the IRA statement on trust. There was no mention of that most critical word - permanent. It may be that the present generation of republican leaders has given up hope of military victory. Certainly some in British intelligence share that view. History however - still an insidiously powerful force in Northern Ireland - reminds us that past ceasefires have split the republican movement. The killing has then resumed. The IRA remains as strong militarily as it has ever been. Some of its commanders will be looking for an opportunity to resume what they call the armed struggle. The response of the so-called loyalist paramilitaries - responsible in recent years for about half the killing in the province - will be crucial. The Rev Ian Paisley's warning of civil war was characteristically forthright. The hard-line Democratic Unionist leader is right, though, that the working-class Protestants need persuading that the price of peace has not been a weakening of Britain's commitment to the province. Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, have shown rare determination and grit in pushing the process this far. Mr Major, as beleaguered a prime minister as any in recent history, shrugged off the brickbats of colleagues who whispered behind their hands that last December's Downing Street declaration was destined to fail. He has gone as far as a Conservative leader could to rebuild trust with Ulster's nationalists and with the Dublin government. The personal risks have been considerable. So too have been his negotiating skills. Mr Major has managed thus far to avoid a backlash from the moderate majority among the unionists by ensuring that the door of 10 Downing Street has been ever open to Mr James Molyneaux, the leader of the Ulster Unionists. He has been rewarded by acquiescence, if not enthusiasm, from the leader of the province's most important political party. It will be harder now than it has ever been to sustain that careful political balancing act. But if the IRA statement does presage peace, Ireland could rescue Mr Major's premiership. Both prime ministers will have to take more risks. There will be many calling themselves Catholics or Protestants determined to wreck the initiative. There will be strains between London and Dublin. The contrasting tone of the responses in the two capitals underlines the danger. The understandable euphoria in Dublin was not echoed in Downing Street. Mr Major's statement spoke in more measured terms of the need to confirm that this is more than a pause in the killing. The risk is that an ambiguous ceasefire will create a rift between London and Dublin; that Mr Reynolds will be too eager to respond quickly to the IRA statement and that Mr Major will be unduly cautious. The political compromises behind the Downing Street declaration and the search for a new constitutional framework for Ulster would then be threatened. Some in Whitehall believe that has been the IRA's game-plan all along. So the two governments must stick firmly to their public pledge that there will be a place at the negotiating table for Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, only when it is clear the renunciation of violence is irrevocable. The fundamental principle on which co-operation between London and Dublin has been based is that of consent - in short, it is (and always will be) for the people of Northern Ireland to decide their own future. For all his government's protestations that nothing has changed in its attitude to the future of Ulster, Mr Major has moved in the direction of the nationalists. He has made explicit what has been implicit, but carefully hidden, in the approach of successive governments since 1973 - that Britain has no 'selfish or strategic' interest in maintaining Ulster as part of the union - it will do so only if and for as long as a majority in the province so wish. For his part Mr Reynolds has been obliged to admit the legitimacy of the unionist veto - that the nationalists' longstanding demand for self-determination in Ireland cannot override the wishes of a majority in Northern Ireland. That principle must remain inviolate. If Mr Major steps just an inch over the line dividing neutrality from persuasion he will lose the support of moderate unionists and face a backlash on his own back benches. In his understandable enthusiasm to ensure that the chance of peace is not lost, Mr Reynolds must be careful to ensure that reassurances to the unionists offered by London are not undercut by nationalist triumphalism in Dublin. Every step for the next few weeks will be an awkward one. There are ways in which the British government can respond quickly to the cessation of violence - by lifting the broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, by changing the pattern of policing in Northern Ireland - which involve few risks. But it cannot allow the slightest hint that its actions are being driven by the threat of a resumption of IRA killing. Mr Major and Mr Reynolds must move quickly to finalise the outline plans for a political settlement they have been promising since early summer. The shape is clear - dilution of the republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland, changes in Britain's 1920 Government of Ireland Act to enshrine the principle of consent, a devolved Northern Ireland assembly and new cross-border institutions to build trust. It is talks on this document that Sinn Fein will be invited to join if in, say, two or three months' time the IRA has proved its good intent. You do not have to search too hard around Westminster to find those confident that even if the process gets that far, the nationalists' demand for a united Ireland and the determination of the Protestant majority to sustain the union will quickly restore the familiar deadlock. History is on the side of the cynics. But this time there is a decent chance the future will not be a prisoner of the past. The police said yesterday that 3,168 people had died in the sectarian terror which has engulfed Northern Ireland for 25 years. Maybe, just maybe, that is enough even for the IRA.</p>

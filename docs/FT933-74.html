			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (6): Green light for red tape curbs - The effects of the new deregulation policies CORPORATE Japan has lent all its weight to the government's drive to reduce the official regulations that control an officially estimated 50 per cent of the economy. No sooner had the new coalition government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa published its list of 60 proposals - later enlarged to 94 - to curb the burdens imposed by administrative red tape last month, than the Keidanren, the powerful economic federation, came out with its own further reaching counter plan. Senior Keidanren officials say they have been supporting deregulation ever since a previous government set up a panel on the subject 12 years ago. Yet corporate eagerness to give fresh impetus to efforts to curb red tape also shows how the recession and the yen's rise have highlighted the economic costs of red tape. As corporate Japan's costs rise above those of its foreign, especially Asian competitors, companies are desperately eager to cut operating expenses before they have to make further cuts in their payrolls. Whether Mr Hosokawa's deregulation drive will make any practical difference to Japan's economic problems is still an open question. Estimates of the impact of the measures vary widely. The government's economic planning agency, often criticised for over-optimism, has forecast that the package, plus a Y6,150bn public spending plan, would add 1.3 percentage points to gross national product over the next 12 months. A conservative private sector estimate, by stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd is that the government's deregulation plans could add up to one percentage point to annual growth in gross domestic product over the next decade. The ultimate impact, of course, depends on how much political resistance the package meets. This is hard to measure. Given Mr Hosokawa's record popularity, few people are prepared to criticise deregulation in public. Indeed the red tape cutting plan is seen in political circles as an astute gesture to public frustration with some of Japan's old rigidities. Yet behind the scenes, entrenched interests are strong. Generally, both government and private sector economists agree that deregulation will cause some economic pain at first, by driving inefficient companies out of business, leading to lasting benefits in terms of reduced business costs in the next two to three years. In the short term this could cause a rise in unemployment as has been the case with US and European Community deregulation moves in the 1980s. So, analysts do not expect the proposals to be implemented fast. First, Mr Hosokawa's seven-party coalition has to overcome the vested interests of the government ministries and businesses, such as the layers of middle men that stand between factories and customers that stand to lose power and profits from deregulation. A sign of the challenge ahead is that the deregulation list was prepared by none other than these territory-conscious bureaucrats, who inserted several contentious proposals rejected several times in the past decade. Moreover, the 94 proposals in the plan, half of which are to be introduced by next March, are a very small proportion of the more than 10,000 government rules which control one of the world's most regulated developed economies. Among the main points are: fewer controls on construction material imports and mobile telephone sales, an easing of restrictions on the freight weight of large trucks, an end to minimum production limits for brewers, which keep potential small producers out of the market, and fewer car roadworthiness inspections. Others include a review of the anti-monopoly law to close loopholes for cartels, more flexibility for the bond market, and fewer controls on the opening of discount food and drink stores. Foreign companies could well benefit from plans to speed up complaints to the trade and investment ombudsman. Many of these ideas will meet opposition, as they already have done in the past. Car makers have supported the roadworthiness certificate system, as they benefit from purchases inspired by the need for old cars to pass a test every two years, or annually for cars more than 13 years old. Car repairers and parts suppliers have a similar interest. Taxi drivers, a politically vocal class in most countries, can be expected to stage stiff resistance to plans to deregulate fares. A look at past history indicates that putting all this into action might not be easy. In Japan as in many other countries, vested interests can only be challenged if some kind of compensation is paid. For example, controls on opening large retail outlets will be relaxed under the deregulation proposals, in theory paving the way for the further expansion of the newly fashionable discount stores. In May 1990, Japan responded to US demands to amend the Large-Scale Retail Store Law, which covers stores of 500 sq m or more. The US idea was that large stores would have increased shelf space for imported products and new retailers would be less obliged to stock traditional suppliers' goods. To win approval for the changes, which took another year to be introduced, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry put together a Y162.1bn subsidy package for small retailers, who were able to use the funds for business promotions, including street fairs and pavement repairs. Three years later, in spite of a speeding of approvals for new large stores, small shopkeepers are still able to put obstacles in the way of ambitious retailers. Will Mr Hosokawa be able to make a deal with vested interests or will this latest attempt to deregulate go the same way as previous abortive efforts? The consensus among economic and political observers is that, whatever the outcome of these proposals, the policy debate has been shifted, giving consumers benefits where producers' interests have long predominated. As Mr Hosokawa himself put it in a policy address to parliament: 'It is essential that we work to promote governmental deregulation and the reform of those old competition-restrictive systems and practices that are unsuited to the new era and to advance consumer interests and and further enhance economic efficiency.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP 20 COMPANIES BY PRE-TAX PROFIT (Y00m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rank  Company                     1992    1991   Rank   1990   Rank  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1     Toyota                     3,758   5,743   1     7,338   1 2     NTT                        2,488   3,528   2     4,143   2 3     Sanwa Bank                 1,953   2,073   4     2,267   6 4     Nintendo                   1,637   1,562   10    1,403   18 5     Tokyo Electric Power       1,583   1,468   12    1,282   21 6     Fuji Photo Film            1,512   1,689   6     1,602   15 7     Mitsubishi Heavy Industry  1,407   1,554   11    1,526   16 8     Shimizu Construction       1,326   1,244   17    1,157   24 9     Mitsubishi Bank            1,306   1,688   7     1,840   10 10    Kansai Electric Power      1,235   1,415   14    1,097   28 11    Sakura Bank                1,110   1,620   9     1,703   12 12    DKB                        1,056   1,452   13    1,909   9 13    Taisei Construction        1,010     964   23      810   43 14    Ito-Yokado                   975     971   22      888   36 15    Matsushita Electric          967   1,964   5     2,765   3 16    Chubu Electric Power         945   1,194   19      573   70 17    Fuji Bank                    943   1,622   8     2,059   7 18    Tohoku Electric Power        922     944   25      785   48 19    Kajima Construction          879   1,238   18    1,032   29 20    Daiwa House Industry         871     905   26      893   35  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The Wako Research Institute of Economics  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

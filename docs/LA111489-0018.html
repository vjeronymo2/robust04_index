			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POSTSCRIPT: SNYDER OUT OF CITY HALL BUT NOT ADVOCACY BUSINESS  </P> <P> He was once a "barefoot barrio kid from East Los Angeles," but Arthur K. Snyder  wound up serving 18 years on the Los Angeles City Council. He can still look  out over his old Eastside district from his 37th-floor law offices in  downtown's Wells Fargo Center.  </P> <P> A burly redhead of German-Irish descent, Snyder, 56, defied all the odds and  drove his opponents to distraction after a 1972 court decision forced a change  in his district's boundaries, handing him a district that was 60% Latino.  </P> <P> At the time, he objected vigorously -- not because he didn't like Latinos, he  said, but because political opponents were trying to win in court what they  couldn't win at the ballot box.  </P> <P> "The city approached it as if they would elect a Hispanic," he said. "What a  phony baloney thing they did."  </P> <P> Even his opponents concede that he paid scrupulous attention to his  constituents' needs. He spoke Spanish at public gatherings and kept winning  reelection -- even as his district became more Latino.  </P> <P> "It gave me a real challenge," he said. "Nobody was interested in doing what  was needed on the Eastside."  </P> <P> Controversy was never far removed, despite his political success. He had a  series of accidents in city-owned cars and once was tried -- and acquitted --  on drunk driving charges.  </P> <P> He was removed as chairman of the council's powerful Planning Committee in 1979  after colleagues complained that he was using the position to solicit campaign  contributions. Similar charges led to his ouster from the South Coast Regional  Coastal Commission in 1980.  </P> <P> Moreover, his second wife, Michele Noval, charged in divorce proceedings the  same year that he battered her and abused their then 5-year-old daughter.  Neither allegation led to criminal charges, and Snyder was given visitation  rights.  </P> <P> Time spent with his child since the divorce has enabled him to "appreciate what  a father and daughter relationship should be," he said in a recent interview.  "Right now, I would say, is the happiest time of my life."  </P> <P> Through all Snyder's personal and political controversy, his constituency  remained loyal.  </P> <P> "The ones who laughed and cried with me were the people in my district," he  said. "They were the ones who knew I cared. It didn't matter what the press  said."  </P> <P> Citing concern for his current wife's health, Snyder resigned from the council  in 1985. Richard Alatorre succeeded him, becoming the council's first Latino  member in more than 20 years.  </P> <P> Capitalizing on valuable connections built during 30 years in local politics,  Snyder has moved smoothly into a new legal career, practicing what he prefers  to call "advocacy." The former councilman's contacts have made him one of the  most sought after lobbyists in the city, although, he said, "I don't consider  myself as a lobbyist. I represent my clients as an attorney."  </P> <P> He said he might "fold up" his firm when he turns 65, and only "maintain a  small practice that keeps me close to my friends. I don't know that I could  ever completely retire."  </P> <P> He has learned to take a "longer view" that keeps him from getting as excited  with "momentary matters," he said. But that view "doesn't keep me from being a  very strong advocate for my clients."  </P> <P> "I don't like to lose." JOHN H. LEE  </P></p>

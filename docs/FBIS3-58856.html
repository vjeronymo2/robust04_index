"A lot must still be done" in that area, he said.    On Monday Qian is also to meet U.S. Secretary of State  Warren  Christopher to discuss human rights issues, conditional on the  United States renewing China's most favoured nation status next  June.    Juppe said that Qian's trip to France marks "a new  departure"  in Franco-Chinese relations following the healing of a year-long  rift over French arms sales to Taiwan.    He said in addition to the human rights issue his meeting  with Qian also focused on nuclear proliferation, regional  conflicts and the role of the UN Security Council of which  Beijing is a permanent member.    Qian's three-day official visit was scheduled after  Franco-Chinese relations returned to normal on January 12 when  Paris pledged not to conclude any new arms contracts with Taiwan.</p>

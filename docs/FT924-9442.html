			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Labour threat on Sunday trading THE Labour party has threatened to oppose any proposals the government makes for the reform of Sunday trading laws in England and Wales if the wages councils are abolished. The government is expected to make a statement on Sunday trading shortly, and will need the support of Labour MPs to ensure that any reform passes through the Commons. Many Conservative MPs oppose the extension of Sunday trading on religious grounds. The Employment Department has said that it sees 'no permanent place' for wages councils, which set minimum rates for about 10 per cent of the working population. There has been speculation that Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, will include their abolition in the Employment Bill, which is likely to be published tomorrow. The link between Labour's support for reform and wages councils emerged during an information-seeking meeting between Ms Joan Ruddock, Labour's spokesperson on Sunday trading and Mr Peter Lloyd, a junior home office minister. Ms Ruddock said the abolition of wages councils would undermine legal guarantees of protection for retail workers - for example the provision that Sunday working must be voluntary - which are central to Labour's support. The unions argue that if wages councils were abolished there would be a general downward pressure on pay that would depress premiums for Sunday working particularly. Wages councils would be their preferred vehicle for setting and policing such premium rates. Both Labour and the government are committed to a free vote on Sunday trading, but the Labour front bench will issue guidance on the reforms that will strongly influence shadow ministers and many backbenchers. The government has been committed to reform the Sunday trading laws since 1987 but has been reluctant to legislate after its last attempt was defeated by a Conservative backbench rebellion in 1986. The options are expected to range from full deregulation on the Scottish model to a tightening of existing laws along the lines advocated by the Keep Sunday Special campaign. Pressure on the government to introduce urgent reform of Sunday trading laws increased after the European Court of Justice suggested that it was up to English courts to end the confusion surrounding the present legislation.</p>

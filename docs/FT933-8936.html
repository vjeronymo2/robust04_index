			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei posts third consecutive gain on political hopes HOPES that the new government will increase spending in telecommunication infrastructure, among other initiatives, encouraged active buying by foreign investors and investment trusts, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average posted its third consecutive rise with a gain of 238.82, or 1.2 per cent to 20,732.57. It saw a day's low of 20,489.05 during the first hour of trading, and a high of 20,756.08 just before the close. While many Japanese investors were absent for the Obon holiday period, volume rose to 360m shares from 274m, rising above the 300m level for the first time since August 4. Gainers led losers by 814 to 184 with 165 unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks rose 19.01 to a new high for the year of 1,680.23. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.65 to 1,283.20. Interest rate-sensitive stocks picked up as bond yields fell on hopes of lower interest rates. The yield on the No 145 10 year benchmark fell 0.04 percentage points to 4.08 per cent. However, the sharp rise in the yen had little effect on export- related stocks. The dollar closed down at a record Y103.77, down Y0.70. Foreigners and dealers bought Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, lifting sentiment overall. NTT gained Y25,000 to Y971,000. Cable companies were also seen as beneficiaries of the government's plans to revamp the country's telecom infrastructure. Mitsubishi Cable, the most active issue of the day, rose Y40 to Y895. Nippon Express, the parcel delivery company, rose Y20 to Y1,120; investors expect a rise in profitability, because of an easing of regulations in the transport market. Mounting hopes of a housing tax cut continued to boost housing related stocks. Sekisui House rose Y40 to Y1,350 and Daiwa House gained Y50 to Y1,660. Financials were higher on hopes of a discount rate cut by the Bank of Japan. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y60 to Y3,450. Brokers were also higher, the sector rising 3.9 per cent. Nomura Securities rose Y80 to Y2,190 and Nikko Securities advanced Y80 to Y1,300. High-technology issues failed to react to the higher yen. NEC rose Y20 to Y1,030 and Matsushita Electric Industrial gained Y10 to Y1,400. Sony, however, was one of the few losers of the day, falling Y60 to Y4,430. In Osaka the OSE average advanced 169.34 to 22,625.56 in volume of 52.1m shares. High-technology related stocks were higher, with Rohm, in semiconductors, up Y90 to Y3,050. Roundup US influences brought more angst to the Antipodes. Bombay was closed for a Hindu festival. NEW ZEALAND brokers offered US worries over legal action by the communication and energy workers union over Telecom's restructuring plans as one reason why the shares fell seven cents to NZDollars 3.98. Another was a rumoured profit-taking recommendation by a large US brokerage house. Telecom led the market down, the NZSE-40 index falling 20.56 to 1,883.41 in turnover of NZDollars 45m. AUSTRALIA featured more volatility in CSR as the All Ordinaries index closed a mere 0.6 higher at 1,861.0. CSR dropped another 16 cents in early trade, following Monday's US court award of punitive damages in an asbestos case. But it rebounded to close 8 cents higher at ADollars 4.15, in some 4.4m shares, after CSR said that it was not concerned by the finding. HONG KONG closed moderately higher as late demand reversed early losses, but most of the buying interest was focused on China-linked stocks as the Hang Seng Index ended 27.82 higher at 7,357.63. Turnover was flat at HKDollars 4.46bn. SINGAPORE flattened out after Tuesday's climb, the Straits Times Industrial index closing 2.26 higher at 1,901.10 on late gains after profit-taking for most of the day. Volume fell from 188.9m to 140.7m shares. SEOUL rose again on buying of large-capitalisation shares, the composite stock index putting on 4.21 at 723.65. BANGKOK celebrated Queen Sirikit's birthday a day in advance with the SET index up 8.08 to 963.17. Turnover was heavy at Bt10.1bn, and devoted mostly to property, media and finance issues. JAKARTA saw strong buying interest as the JKSE index rose 7.52 to 377.35. MANILA reported heavy foreign buying in the newly-listed JG Summit, 40 centavos higher at 6.80 pesos as the composite index rose 13.48 to 1,747.67. TAIWAN ended off its peak after profit-taking in the last hour, the weighted index ending 21.73 higher at 4,115.04, after 4,167.49. Turnover soared from TDollars 17.2bn to TDollars 26.62 billion, the highest since May. Construction stocks jumped by 2.25 per cent on news that the finance ministry was considering extending maturities of housing loans.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Arts: The Morris Minor of jazz - Garry Booth reviews Jimmy Smith and his B3 Hammond organ Dated but lovable and reliable, it simply will not go away. Though it first appeared over 40 years ago, the Hammond B3 organ's teeth-grating treble sound is as popular with today's hip set as it was during the heyday of greasy soul jazz. Given the other uses to which the instrument has been applied - in gloomy cocktail lounges and brightly lit social clubs - it is a wonder that every one has not been smashed up and buried in a secret place. It is the Morris Minor of the jazz world and the reason there are still so many on the road, held together by gaffer tape and nicotine, is that in the right hands the Hammond can be made to swing like crazy. Few other instruments, running on a mixture of gospel and blues, can transport a small group to the heights a B3 can. Usually found in the company of an electric guitar and drums (or tenor sax and drums) the Hammond driver can prod out solos, or provide mounting excitement for other soloists to adorn, and all the while moving things along with thick bass lines from the pedals. The purists might even use an original Leslie speaker, a device whose spinning reflector emphasises the already shrill vibrato. More often the original is souped up by new technology - the young German player, Barbara Dennerlein, heard at Dingwalls last week, makes the most of her deft left foot by using a sampled double bass sound for the pedals. It is unlikely that the Hammond would have got this far without the attention of one man. Jimmy Smith single-handedly reinvented the Hammond organ sound in the late 1950s with a series of jam session recordings for the Blue Note label. Sizzling blues which wrung the lowdown best from horn players like Lou Donaldson and Jackie Maclean were an instant success. Apart from taking a wrong turning into pop-crossover in the latter part of the 1960s, Smith has been following that same, funky road since. Seeing the youthful Smith seated behind the varnished facade of his B3 at Dingwalls with a quartet of saxophones (Herman Riley), electric guitar (Terry Evans) and drums (Jimmie Smith Jnr), the years roll back. The tunes are almost irrelevant: it is the groove that is important to Smith, an inveterate crowd pleaser. The preacher sends flurries of titillating notes out from the right hand, a padding of droning chords from the left. His guitarist, while not up to the kind of licks Kenny Burrell would spin from the organist's chords, is suitably twangy and sings a passable 'Georgia'; Riley's upper register sax sound providing gritty solo parts, and jocular conversation with the leader. But on Monday Smith sometimes seemed too relaxed and verged dangerously towards the cocktail lounge end of bland, tinkling improvisation. An instinctive and competitive player, Smith always excels in tough company and is capable of leading the best of jazz bluesmen. Hearing him in undemanding company like this is still a joy - but what a pity Burrell cannot be prised away from BB King for a reunion match. Dingwalls, Camden Lock NW1 (071 267 1999) until Thursday March 24.</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Executive at Euro Disney to leave MR JOHN FORSGREN, vice-chairman of Euro Disney, plans to leave the troubled European leisure group to return to an unspecified position with Walt Disney, its US parent company. Euro Disney, which has this summer been clouded by controversy about its financial performance and future prospects, confirmed that Mr Forsgren would be returning to the US. However, it said details of the move, and his new role at Walt Disney had not been finalised and meanwhile he would remain as its vice-chairman. The departure of Mr Forsgren, one of Euro Disney's most senior executives and finance director at the time of the opening of the Euro Disneyland theme park in April last year, comes at a sensitive time. Euro Disney, which is burdened by heavy debt and deeply in the red, has been forced to ask Walt Disney for financial support. Mr Forsgren, 46, joined Euro Disney in January 1990 to help orchestrate its launch. He joined after four years as treasurer of Walt Disney, which owns 49 per cent of the European company. In April this year Mr Forsgren was replaced as Euro Disney's finance director by Mr Mike Montgomery, another former Disney treasurer. Mr Montgomery has taken charge of financial affairs reporting directly to Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chairman, and has played a leading part in preparations for a financial restructuring. Mr Forsgren has since April been vice-chairman. Euro Disney said at the time of his appointment that he had been promoted to deal with the investment and political communities. Euro Disney said yesterday that Mr Forsgren's return to the US was part of the routine process of repatriating US executives. Mr Forsgren, now at his holiday home in Connecticut, has spent most of the summer in the US. Euro Disney's share price fell sharply last week following press speculation about the group's problems, It dropped from FFr56.80 to FFr54.50 when the market opened yesterday but recovered to close at FFr56.00. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, analyst at Morgan Stanley in London said: 'Euro Disney is in a dire situation and investors are very nervous.' World Stock Markets, Page 29 London, Page 32</p>

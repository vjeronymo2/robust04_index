			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- China has succeeded in  applying rare earth to over 800,000 ha of forests, a world  record, according to an official from the Ministry of Forestry.    Rare earth elements are a new type of growth regulators. By  using scientifically-made fertilizers mixed with rare earth  elements to dress seeds, dip roots or spray leaves, the growth  of trees is promoted.    China started to use rare earth in agriculture and forestry  in the 1980s, the earliest in the world. In 1992 the technology  was popularized and applied to over 30 strains of trees,  including walnut, date, pear, Chinese chestnut and Chinese  hawthorn as well as grape vines.    Research results show that the output of a fruit tree  cultivated with fertilizers containing rare earth elements  increased by 10 percent to 40 percent. Besides, the fruit  contains more sugar, Vitamin C and other nutritious elements.  The 50 pilot counties in Beijing municipality and the Provinces  of Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Shandong and Henan invested about  one million yuan (about 115,000 U.S. dollars) in the application  of rare earth to fruit production, and they managed to increase  their output of fruit by a total of 50 million kg, worth 100  million yuan.    Scientists also found that by applying rare earth, pine  seeds  will germinate earlier and pine trees will grow more quickly.  Besides, by spraying rare earth elements on them, deciduous  trees in north China remain green longer in the autumn.    In recent years the ministry of forestry, and provincial and  city departments of forestry have taken various measures to  popularize the technology of applying rare earth elements,  including holding training classes, lectures, exhibitions and  on-the-spot teaching.</p>

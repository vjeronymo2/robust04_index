			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: LTV receives new offer for missile unit THE battle over ownership of LTV's aircraft and missiles businesses continued to escalate yesterday, when LTV announced it had a new offer of Dollars 475m from the Loral/Carlyle/Northrop team. Only a week ago, LTV announced a preliminary agreement to sell its entire aircraft and missiles operations to defence group Martin Marietta for Dollars 440m. This came only days after defence group Loral offered Dollars 240m for LTV's missiles business, in a joint bid with the Carlyle Group, a Washington investment firm, and defence company Northrop, which together offered Dollars 190m for LTV's aircraft side. The latest offer consists of Dollars 450m in cash and Dollars 25m in referred stock. The bidding partners said it exceeded the Martin Marietta offer by Dollars 35m, and by Dollars 54m in cash. They also said that Carlyle and Northrop had already received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance, and that Loral's closing was not conditional on Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance. The deal still needs approval of the bankruptcy court, which oversees LTV's assets.</p>

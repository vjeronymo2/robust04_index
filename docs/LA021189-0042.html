			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: LASORDA HAS TALE FOR MOST EVERYTHING  </P> <P> Joe Ferguson and the rest of the Dodger coaches were honored at a luncheon  benefiting the Hollenbeck Youth Center Thursday, reminding some of a story  Manager Tom Lasorda likes to tell.  </P> <P> Ferguson was catching for the Dodgers during a game at Dodger Stadium, Mickey  Hatcher was playing third base and there was a runner on third with two out.  Normally, if a grounder is hit to third in that situation, the play is to first  for the easy out.  </P> <P> "A grounder was hit to Hatcher, and I'm getting ready to watch his throw to  first," Lasorda said. "If you're the catcher on the play, you run down to first  to back up the throw.  </P> <P> "So where does Hatcher throw the ball? He throws home. And the amazing thing is  Fergie is there to make the play.  </P> <P> "Hatcher comes off the field and I say, 'What the hell are you doing throwing  home with two outs,' and he says, 'I thought there was one out.'  </P> <P> "Then I turn to Ferguson and say, 'Why weren't you running to first to back up  the throw?'  </P> <P> "And Fergie says to me, 'When you play with dummies you have to think dumb.' "  </P> <P> Trivia time: Who holds the NBA All-Star records for most field goals attempted  and most field goals made in a single game. (Answer to follow.)  </P> <P> A network executive was somewhat taken aback the other day when Harold  Rossfields Smith, who served four years for embezzling $21.3 million from Wells  Fargo Bank, called to pitch Olympic middleweight Roy Jones Jr., whom he said he  was promoting.  </P> <P> Asked how he obtained a promoter's license, Smith said: "My problem wasn't  boxing, it was banking."  </P> <P> From Bruce Keidan of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, on schools who have said they  voted yes on Proposal 42 by accident:  </P> <P> "Isn't there anyone who voted for Proposal 42 on purpose? Maybe you ought to  have to score 700 or higher on the SAT to qualify as a delegate to the National  Collegiate Athletic Assn. convention. Some of the delegates to this month's  convention apparently could not spell cat if you gave them a three-letter head  start."  </P> <P> From Bob Smirzik of the Pittsburgh Press: "This is greed: About the same time  his agent said no to a $2-million offer from the Boston Red Sox, pitcher Roger  Clemens was charging $8.50 for an autograph in the Boston area. How much money  to you need, Roger?"  </P> <P> Talk about stretching for an angle. This comes from a CBS-TV press release:  </P> <P> "Although George Washington and Abraham Lincoln weren't around when Dr. James  Naismith invented the game of basketball in 1891, the former chief executives  would undoubtedly have enjoyed watching two of the NBA's best teams battle on  the day commemorating their births.  </P> <P> "If they were alive and owned a television, they could do just that when 'The  NBA on CBS' presents the Houston Rockets at the Cleveland Cavaliers, live on  President's Day, Monday, Feb. 20."  </P> <P> For the record: Pete Maravich did, indeed, score 66 points for LSU against  Tulane on Feb. 10, 1969, and the score of the game was, indeed, 110-94, but it  was Tulane that won, not LSU, as reported here Friday.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Rick Barry holds the record for most field goals attempted, 27  in 1967, and Wilt Chamberlain and Michael Jordan share the record for most  field goals made, 17. Chamberlain got the record in 1962 and Jordan tied it  last year.  </P> <P> Quotebook  </P> <P> William Sanders, on why he wants his son Barry to bypass his senior year at  Oklahoma State: "If he's going to play 11 games next year, he might as well  play 16 and make some money."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, May 19 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- Research and  Technology Minister B.J. Habibie said Thursday ASEAN amity could  be significantly fostered by cooperation in technology and human  resources development. He said ASEAN member countries had a  political commitment to undertake the improvement of the quality  of their human resources in ways compatible with "the ASEAN  spirit."    The minister was speaking at a ceremony marking the signing  of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on cooperation in various  fields between Indonesia and Malaysia.    Habibie signed the document for Indonesia, while Malaysian  Defence Minister Datuk Sri Mohamed Najib bin Tun Abdul Razak did  the same for Malaysia.    Several other Indonesia-Malaysia accords were also inked at  the ceremony. One was between the state-owned aircraft-making  company IPTN and the Malaysian Defence Department and another  between the Indonesian Air Force and Malaysia's Airod [company  speciliazing in aircraft repairs and overhaul].    ASEAN unity or solidarity has lately become a topic of  public  discussion following the emergence of a difference of views  between Jakarta and Manila about the scheduled holding of a  seminar on East Timor in Manila.    According to spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Affairs  Ministry Irawan Abidin, the Philippine Government could not meet  Indonesia's demand that the meeting be called off but had  promised it would try to have the topics to be discussed at the  proposed seminar limited.    Malaysia was among several countries which disagreed with  the  plan and said such a seminar was an effort to damage ASEAN  friendship.    In response to President Suharto's statement on the  possibility of marketing Malaysia's Proton Saga cars at  relatively low price in Indonesia, Habibie said that it was a  breakthrough which was expected to bring this archipelagic  country to the technology of the future.    President Suharto had reportedly told Razak at a meeting  Thursday the Malaysian cars can be sold in Indonesia, especially  if the cars use components made in Indonesia.</p>

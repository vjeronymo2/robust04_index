Manuel Bustos, president of the United Labor Federation  (CUT), said it would be more advantageous for Chile to sign a  bilateral agreement with the United States, as joining NAFTA  would imply "the transfer to Chile of all the deficiencies of  that agreement."    The Chilean labor leader said that entrepreneurial interests  prevail in NAFTA, which is structured in such a way that all  sanctions for violations of workers' rights "are impossible to  implement."    In the past weeks Chile has been mentioned by U.S. officials  as the leading candidate for joining NAFTA.    The CUT president made these remarks in accompanying  representatives of the U.S. labor organizations AFL-CIO to a  meeting with Chilean President-elect Eduardo Frei, who will be  inaugurated on Friday.    The Chilean labor leader said that Frei told them he intends  to create a tripartite commission, made up of representatives of  workers, entrepreneurs, and the government, to discuss the  possibility of joining NAFTA.    The representatives of the AFL-CIO, which has a membership  of  17 million workers, said they do not support Chile's entry into  NAFTA because they believe the agreement has inadequate social  protection clauses.    AFL-CIO executive director William Doherty, who heads this  organization's delegation to the inauguration, said his  country's workers were hurt by NAFTA because of the low cost of  Mexican labor and Canadian advanced technology.    The U.S. leader said negotiations between Mexico, Canada,  and  the United States over NAFTA did not take into account the  social situation of the three countries, adding that the  discussion only involved "multinationals interested in  protecting the capital."</p>

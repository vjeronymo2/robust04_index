			<p>940420 FT  20 APR 94 / Christie's announces sale of Bacon's Study From Portrait of Pope Innocent X by Velasquez Christie's yesterday announced the sale of Francis Bacon's Study From Portrait of Pope Innocent X by Velasquez, Susan Moore writes. The 1959 canvas, expected to fetch about Pounds 2m, belongs to the artist's most famous series in which he used the 17th century Velasquez portrait in the Galleria Doria-Pamphili in Rome as a starting point for some of the most disturbing images of the 20th century. Bacon thought the Velasquez was one of the greatest paintings in the world and said it had 'haunted and obsessed (him) . . . by its perfection' for more than a decade. Other sources of inspiration included a photograph of Pope Pius XII carried in a sedan chair, a blurred snap of a baboon in motion and a film still of the bloody face of the nurse in Eisenstein's film Battleship Potemkin. The painting, which has been in the collection of its present owner for more than 20 years, is to be offered for sale in London on June 30.</p>

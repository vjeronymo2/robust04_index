			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Ministers 'missed chance' on NHS pay MR ERIC CAINES, the personnel director of the National Health Service, said yesterday government ministers and managers of new National Health Service trusts had failed to grasp a unique opportunity to abolish central pay mechanisms and improve performance in the service. Mr Caines, who leaves the NHS next week, took a keen interest in the abolition of central mechanisms for pay and terms of employment and the introduction of local trust-based bargaining. Only a handful of NHS trusts have moved in this direction and the government has not abolished central machinery, including pay review bodies and the Whitley council. Trusts give several reasons for staying within their remit, including the need to concentrate on more immediate practical problems. Mr Caines, in a final salvo against NHS managers and ministers, said in an interview in Personnel Today that one of the most important areas needing attention when the first NHS trusts were set up was to devise trust-based reward systems balancing fair pay and the need for flexibility in work practices. He said: 'Unfortunately - and it grieves me to say this - the NHS has almost certainly passed up the best, indeed the only opportunity it has ever had to make fundamental changes in these areas.' Managers, he said, had failed to see the billions of pounds spent on pay as a key management tool. Unions representing hospital workers said yesterday they had rejected suggestions by two trusts, Hillingdon in Middlesex and Redbridge in Essex, to forego the 1.5 per cent pay increase this year.</p>

Several comments received on the original notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) requested additional time to respond to the proposed action. This proposed action would incorporate and update the procedures and applicability of both AD's into one document. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent structural failure of the V-tail, which could result in loss of control of the airplane.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before June 17, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;37&hyph;AD, room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.

The action proposed to supersede AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01 and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1 with a new AD that would require: (1) Checking the ruddervator static balance and adjusting as appropriate; (2) fabricating and installing airspeed limitation placards; (3) incorporating certain airspeed limitations into the airplane flight manual (AFM); and (4) installing stabilizer reinforcements. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with the instructions to either Beech Kit No. 35&hyph;4016&hyph;3, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;5, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;7, or 35&hyph;4016&hyph;9, as applicable and as specified in Beech Service Bulletin No. 2188, and the applicable maintenance manuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters request an extension of the comment period in order to have additional time to respond to the actions presented in the proposal. After careful consideration, the FAA has determined that the comment period for the proposal should be reopened to allow the public additional time to comment on the proposed actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has altered the proposal to include additional information that was inadvertently left out or referenced incorrectly when preparing the original notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). Before final rule action is implemented, the FAA will evaluate all comments received in response to the original NPRM as well as this supplemental NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Beech 35 series airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01 and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1 with a new AD that would require: (1) Checking the ruddervator static balance and adjusting as appropriate; (2) fabricating and installing airspeed limitation placards; (3) incorporating certain airspeed limitations into the airplane flight manual (AFM); and (4) installing stabilizer reinforcements. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with the instructions to either Beech Kit No. 35&hyph;4016&hyph;3, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;5, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;7, or 35&hyph;4016&hyph;9, as applicable and as specified in Beech Service Bulletin No. 2188, and the applicable maintenance and shop manuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Repo cut boosts D-Mark The D-Mark firmed across the board yesterday as the cautious lowering of German interest rates lent support to the currency, writes Philip Gawith. The German currency rose because the market had expected a more generous cut in the repo rate than the three basis points - to 5.94 per cent - that the Bundesbank allowed. The rate move, which was followed by a Belgian rate reduction, confirmed the downward trend of European interest rates, but underlined the cautious approach being taken by the Bundesbank. The US Federal Reserve's 'beige book', released yesterday afternoon, reported little sign of rising prices and had minimal effect on the dollar. The US currency was stronger against the yen on indications that progress was being made in the resolution of the trade dispute with Japan. German call money rates eased slightly after the Bundesbank added a net DM500m funds at its weekly repo and let interest rates decline again. Call money was quoted at 5.95/6.10 per cent, from 6.00/6.15 per cent on Tuesday. The three basis-point cut was slightly below market consensus, but confirmed that German rates were on a downward path. The Bundesbank allocated DM83bn of new funds to replace DM82.5bn of pacts expiring. The D-Mark finished at FFr3.404, from FFr3.397, against the French franc and L988.6, from L984.3, compared to the Italian lira. The Belgian central bank followed the German example and cut its key central bank rate to 6.15 per cent from 6.25 per cent. The Belgian franc held steady afterwards at BFr20.590/593 per D-Mark, but closed lower at BFr20.60, from Tuesday's BFr20.58, in line with the general weakness of EMS currencies against the D-Mark. Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, said Belgium still enjoyed a positive interest rate differential compared to the D-Mark bloc currencies. He cautioned, however, that 'at some point the market is going to call into question the extent to which Belgium can bring rates into line given its fiscal difficulties'. He said Belgium was getting into 'marginal territory' where further rate cuts could cause currency weakness. The Bundesbank's small move has reduced the prospect of a rate cut when the monetary council of the Bank of France meets today. The dollar continued in poor health yesterday, finishing nearly a pfennig lower in London at DM1.7070 from DM1.7155. It closed weaker in New York at DM1.6995. Although the release of the Johnson red book, and a speech by Fed governor Mr John Laware, emphasising a strong growth outlook, were both dollar-positive, they were undermined by the German rate cut. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, commented: 'News on the US is being offset by the laggard behaviour of the German monetary authorities.' The release of the 'beige book' - an economic summary by the 12 Federal Reserve district banks, covering the period from mid-January to February 28  -was eagerly awaited by a market nervous about the US inflationary outlook. In the event, the Fed said: 'Only limited price pressures are reported - prices of building materials, selected metals and some chemicals are said to be rising, but prices of manufactured goods and consumer goods generally are not experiencing upward pressure.' This quashed fears of an imminent tightening by the Fed. Attention will now shift to the release next week of CPI and PPI figures. The dollar enjoyed improved fortunes against the yen, closing at Y105.835, up from a low of Y104.80 on the day. Analysts said the firmer dollar reflected positive developments on the trade front with Japan. It finished in New York at Y105.665. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, provided the impetus when he said progress had been made in the US-Japan cellular telephone dispute. 'I am not announcing right now we have an agreement. We do not know, but we have made progress,' Mr Kantor was reported as saying. There were also reports of progress in the super-conductor sector. But Mr Cunningham of UBS noted that there was 'still a long way to go'. He said there were at least five other sectors in which the US could activate trade sanctions under the Super 301 executive order. 'The market still needs to see something come out of the Japanese side,' he added. Conditions in the UK discount market were fairly tight, the overnight rate rising to 7.5 per cent. The Bank of England provided the market with Pounds 660m of late assistance after earlier putting Pounds 604m into the system. This compared to a revised shortage of Pounds 1.3bn. The Bank announced that it will be providing Pounds 4.5bn to the market today in its new twice-monthly repo. This represents a net inflow of about Pounds 1.2bn. Analysts said the improved outcome reflected the recent tightening of two-week rates in the cash market which made resort to the repo facility attractive.</p>

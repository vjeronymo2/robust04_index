			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nabih Birri, speaker of the Chamber of Deputies,  went to the south this morning to follow up developments there  in light of the continuing Israeli military escalation. He  listened to security briefings about the attacks and telephoned  Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz and Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul.    Israeli occupation forces continue to make the security  situation in the south and western al-Biqa' worse, amid mounting  fears of renewed Israeli attacks on the liberated areas. Since  morning, the Israelis have shelled Frun, al-Ghanduriyah, Zawtar  al-Sharqiyah, Zawtar al-Gharbiyah, Bra'shit, and Haddathah.  Israeli reinforcements continue to pour into the occupied  border strip.    In the past few hours, the Lebanese Army reinforced its  positions in Marj al-Zahur, Mimis, and western al-Biqa' with men  and weapons in anticipation of any eventuality.    Elsewhere today, Timor Goksel, spokesman for the UN Interim  Force in Lebanon, said five Nepalese soldiers were wounded, one  of them seriously, when their military vehicle overturned  yesterday near al-Ghanduriyah in Tyre.</p>

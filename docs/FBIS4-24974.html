			<p>BFN     [Text] A standardized receipt for the value-added tax  designed with tough fraud-prevention techniques will be  introduced to taxpayers nationwide beginning in July, according  to an official announcement by the State Administration of  Taxation released yesterday.    The receipt has three different versions: a Chinese version  (including the Tibetan and Uygur language versions), a  Chinese-English version and a computerized version.    The Chinese and Chinese-English versions both include three  different forms, covering tax values of 10,000 yuan ($1,150), 1  million yuan ($115,000) or 10 million yuan ($1.15 million).    The receipts are made by the money printing company under  the  People's Bank of China, the central bank. Enterprises or  individual are forbidden to print the receipt themselves.    The former receipts will be invalidated as soon as the new  receipts are issued, the announcement says.    Any enterprises or individuals who illegally forge, sell or  lend the receipts will be severely punished.    China launched a nationwide tax reform at the beginning of  the year, aimed at setting up a fair taxation system to read  just the industrial structure and promote equal competition,  according to tax officials.    A new business tax with the value-added tax as its major  component is the main element of this taxation reform.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: S African golds overcome early losses Gold shares overcame early losses as bullion pushed higher, while industrials extended gains in steady trade in further response to recent good company results. Golds, which started weaker on bullion price weakness and firm financial and commercial rands, retraced losses by the close as the financial rand slipped and the gold price recovered to Dollars 391 an ounce. The overall index rose 9 to 5,691 and industrials added 37 at 6,505, while golds finished 3 firmer at 2,325 after an early fall to 2,291. De Beers was 50 cents down at R99.50 and Anglos unchanged at R238, while Minorco slipped 50 cents to R106.25. All were off intraday lows. Investec eased after a strong results-inspired advance on Tuesday, retreating R1 to R64.</p>

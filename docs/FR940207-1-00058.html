			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The UMTRCA regulations, as promulgated by EPA and implemented by NRC prior to the 1993 amendments, while ultimately limiting emissions to the same numerical level as subpart T, were supported by a variety of design-based substantive and procedural requirements that speak to UMTRCA's unique concern that final site closure occur in a manner that will last 1,000 years or at least 200 years, but did not require monitoring of emissions to confirm the performance of the earthen cover. See generally 10 CFR part 40, appendix A and 40 CFR part 192. Subpart D, as amended, requires all appropriate monitoring be conducted pursuant to the procedures described in 40 CFR part 61, appendix B, Method 115, or any other measurement method proposed by a licensee and approved by NRC or the affected Agreement State as being at least as effective as EPA Method 115 in demonstrating the effectiveness of the permanent radon barrier in achieving compliance with the 20 pCi/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -s flux standard. After emplacement of a permanent radon barrier designed and constructed to achieve compliance with, including attainment of, the 20 pCi/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -s flux standard, the licensee shall conduct appropriate monitoring and analysis of the radon flux through the barrier. This monitoring will verify that the design of the permanent radon barrier is effective in ensuring that emissions of radon-222 will not exceed compliance with the 20 pCi/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -s, as contemplated by 40 CFR 192.32(b)(1)(ii). EPA intends that the permanent radon barrier be designed to ensure sustained compliance with the 20 pCi/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -s flux standard by all sites, but does not require continuous emissions monitoring. Rather, a single monitoring event may suffice to verify the design of the permanent radon barrier to ensure continued compliance. Note, however, that if the NRC or an Agreement State extends the time for performance of milestones after making a finding that compliance with the 20 pCi/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -s flux standard has been demonstrated by appropriate monitoring, compliance with the 20 pCi/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -s flux standard must be demonstrated each year during the period of the extension.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. NRC Regulatory Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 3, 1993, NRC proposed uranium mill tailings regulations to conform the NRC requirements to EPA's proposed amended standards at 40 CFR part 192 subpart D. (58 FR 58657). Section 84a(2) of the Atomic Energy Act requires NRC to conform its regulations to EPA's regulations promulgated under UMTRCA. As noted above, the existing NRC criteria while providing a comprehensive response to EPA's general UMTRCA standards did not compel sites to proceed to final closure by a date certain nor did they require monitoring. The proposed regulations amend Criterion 6 and add a new Criterion 6A and definitions to the Introduction to appendix A to part 40 of title 10 of the CFR. Consistent with the MOU, NRC's proposal provides for timely emplacement of the ``final'' radon barrier and requires appropriate verification of the radon flux through that barrier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Criterion 6 paragraph 2 provides for appropriate testing and analysis to verify that the construction of the barrier effectively controls radon from uranium byproduct material to a level not exceeding 20 pCi/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -s. Paragraph 3 requires verification of the radon flux to be conducted over the covered portion of the pile or impoundment if phased emplacement of the barrier is authorized. Paragraph 4 would require reporting and recordkeeping.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As proposed, Criterion 6A addresses the timeliness of complying with the requirements of Criterion 6 as applied to uranium mill tailings. Paragraph 1 would require compliance with Criterion 6 as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility after a pile or impoundment containing uranium byproduct materials ceases operation. In addition, this paragraph would require inclusion of specified interim milestones in the individual site license. Proposed Criterion 6A also sets forth the conditions for Commission approval of extensions for performance of milestones and continued acceptance of uranium byproduct and other materials in the pile or impoundment. See Proposed 10 CFR part 40 appendix A Criterion 6A paragraphs 2 and 3 at 58 FR 58664.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Amendment of NRC and Agreement State Licenses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with their commitments under the MOU, as well as EPA's previous proposal to rescind subpart T (56 FR 67561 December 31, 1991), NRC and the affected Agreement States agreed to amend the licenses of all non-operational uranium mill tailings sites to ensure inclusion of schedules for emplacing a permanent radon barrier on the tailings impoundments, as well as interim milestones (e.g., wind blown tailings retrieval and placement on the pile, interim stabilization and radon barrier construction). To this end, NRC and the Agreement States requested the licensees to voluntarily seek amended licenses and have completed processing those requests. NRC has continued the spirit of cooperation between EPA and NRC by keeping the Agency apprised of the status of the approval of reclamation plans and amendment of licenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As of September 30, 1993, NRC and the Agreement States had completed all license amendments for closure of licensed non-operational impoundments, with the exception of the license amendment for the Atlas site located in Moab, Utah.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEL MAR;  </P> <P> BALDOMERO WINS OSUNITAS, GIVES SHOEMAKER FIRST STAKES VICTORY  </P> <P> Twenty years ago and one day after his biggest milestone, Bill Shoemaker came  up with another on Saturday.  </P> <P> Baldomero, a 9-1 shot in the $83,025 Osunitas Handicap, provided the world's  winningest rider with his first stakes victory as a trainer.  </P> <P> The 5-year-old Pas de Seul mare's victory over 50-1 shot Kikala and eight  others almost coincided with the 20-year anniversary of Shoemaker's historic  6,033rd victory. On Sept. 7, 1970, he guided Dares J. into the winner's circle  and propelled himself past John Longden.  </P> <P> Besides being his first stakes victory, the Osunitas was Shoemaker's initial  success at the Del Mar meeting. He was 0 for 16 going into the restricted race  after a solid Hollywood Park season.  </P> <P> "What are you going to say?" Shoemaker said after Baldomero won by  three-quarters of a length while completing the 1 1/16 miles on turf in 1:42.  "(Gary Stevens) rode her well. She ran well. The last time, she had to go  around the field and Wedding Bouquet (the 9-5 favorite Saturday) got through on  the inside.  </P> <P> "This is great. I predicted she would be a stakes winner when these people  bought the horse. It makes you feel good when your predictions come true."  </P> <P> No doubt, Baldomero has been a model of consistency since coming to the United  States. She hasn't been worse than second in five starts and the Osunitas was  her second victory.  </P> <P> "She wasn't that good a filly in Europe, but she's improved over here,"  Shoemaker said. "Probably the air. She blossomed out; she's a better-looking  mare. I rode her once at Ascot (in England) and she was kind of washy and  silly. Mr. (Robert) Sangster sent her over here last year; she was one of the  first horses I acquired."  </P> <P> Fifth after six furlongs behind the moderate pace being set by Paper Princess,  Baldomero rallied on the outside through the stretch and was going away at the  wire. Kikala, the longest shot in the field after finishing last as the 5-2  favorite in her previous start, defeated Tessla by a neck for second. Wedding  Bouquet, who was very impressive in her American debut Aug. 22, was another  head back in fourth.  </P> <P> "Shoe told me to ride her like you own her," Stevens said. "That's all he said.  She's a consistent mare. She gives 100% every time. Today's extra distance  helped her.  </P> <P> "That mile the other day was just too short. She's only got one quick burst,  but the distance was to her advantage this time. I'm happy for Shoe."  </P> <P> Chris McCarron had no excuses for Wedding Bouquet, concluding what was a  less-than-memorable day for trainer Gary Jones. Earlier, his Timebank had  finished last as the 6-5 favorite in Belmont's Fall Highweight Handicap.  </P> <P> "I had a good trip," McCarron said. "She moved up there real nice, but then she  hung just a tad near the end."  </P> <P> Robbie Davis is looking for a new agent.  </P> <P> The rider, who has won only four times from 107 tries at Del Mar, and Jeff  Franklin, his agent since he came to California early in 1989, parted company  Saturday.  </P> <P> "Robbie and I are still friends; it's an amicable parting," said Franklin, who  previously had worked for Gary Stevens, among others, and is generally  considered one of the best agents. "There are overriding personal concerns."  </P> <P> Listening to Davis, it's clear the decision to split wasn't his.  </P> <P> "I'm shocked," he said. "I'm losing a great agent, probably the best I've ever  had. It's going to be very hard to replace him. I'm sorry he had to do what he  did.  </P> <P> "I was off for three weeks with a bad back, then my wife had a baby. There's  been a lot of stress and we didn't bounce back as well as we had hoped.  </P> <P> "I have no idea, I haven't got a clue (about a new agent). Jeff's been with me  ever since I came here, so I don't know too many agents out here. I want to  stay here. That's why I left New York; to come out here."  </P> <P> Kansas City is the 4-1 third choice on the morning line for today's $1-million  Molson Export Million at Woodbine.  </P> <P> Trained by Julio Canani and owned by Clover Racing Stable, Kansas City has won  two in a row since returning from a seven-month layoff. Claimed for $32,000  late last year, the son of Habitony won a Hollywood Park sprint in his  comeback, then got his first stakes victory, the Windy Sands Handicap here Aug.  15. Kansas City, who has won four of seven, will be ridden for the first time  by Chris McCarron. Clover won the Molson last year with Prized.  </P> <P> Izvestia, the Canadian Triple Crown winner, will be the heavy favorite in the 1  1/4-mile race. Owned by Kinghaven Farm, the son of Icecapade will be shooting  for his eighth consecutive stakes victory. Don Seymour will ride.  </P> <P> The rest of the field includes Shot Gun Scott, Baron de Vaux, Bloody Caesar,  Pleasant Rapture, Piper Gray and Chief Honcho.  </P> <P> A full field of 12 is expected for Wednesday's $350,000-estimated Del Mar  Futurity, the closing-day feature.  </P> <P> The probable favorite is Best Pal, winner of the Balboa and I'm Smokin stakes  at the meeting. The gelded son of Habitony will race coupled with Magnificent  Red, a Secretariat colt who broke his maiden at first asking Aug. 25. Both  2-year-olds are owned by John Mabee's Golden Eagle Farm.  </P> <P> The other probable starters are Sunshine Machine, who will be ridden by Jose  Santos in his Del Mar debut, Formal Dinner, Bucking Bird, Arctic Deputy,  Pillaring,. Regional, Terrific Trip, Southern Justice, Got To Fly and Running  Total.  </P> <P> Of the dozen expected to go, five were supplemented for $10,000 before the  Friday deadline. They are Sunshine Machine, Formal Dinner, Southern Justice,  Got To Fly and Running Total. Drag Race, the surprise winner of the Futurity  last year, was also supplemented.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes.  </P> <P> Friday was senior citizen's day at Del Mar. Trainer Steve Ippolito, 75, won the  featured Torrey Pines Stakes with 15-1 shot Oh Sweet Thing and, five races  earlier, L.J. Brooks, who will turn 84 Sept. 28, clicked with 5-1 shot Chief  Dare. Brooks is the oldest trainer ever to win a race at Del Mar. . . . Russell  Baze and Julio Garcia both won twice Saturday.  </P> <P> Charlie Whittingham will start two of the four entrants in today's $206,300 Del  Mar Budweiser Breeders' Cup over a mile. Ruhlmann is the 123-pound highweight  and he will be ridden by Gary Stevens. Whittingham's other contestant is Lively  One, who is partial to Del Mar. Alex Solis has the mount. The other starters  are Stalwart Charger and Flying Continental.  </P></p>

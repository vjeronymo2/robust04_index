The North side headquarters of Pomminnyon said this in a  statement Monday denouncing the South Korean authorities for  blocking the southern trip of the North side's mourning group  for the late Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a pro-reunification patriot.  The statement brands this act as an intolerable insult to the  North side headquarters of Pomminnyon and all those concerned  with Pomminnyon and compatriots at home and abroad and one more  political persecution of the deceased who devoted his all to the  patriotic movement for reunification of Pomminnyon.    It further says:    "The Rev. Mun Ik-hwan was a leading figure of the movement  for democracy and reunification who, from the first days of the  Pomminnyon-led movement, fought for the founding of an  organisation of Pomminnyon and its legalisation in South Korea,  braving all manner of persecution and suppression.    "To regard Pomminnyon as an `organisation benefiting the  enemy' is, in the final analysis, to regard the whole nation as  an enemy, and is a criminal act that can be done only by those  who are opposed to the unity of the nation and reunification.    "By blocking the Seoul trip of our mourners' group the Kim  Yong-sam group made it plain that `national reconciliation' and  `divorce from the military dictatorship' declared by it so often  are lies and that it is a group of traitors and  anti-reunification elements outdistancing the preceding military  dictators."    Noting that today all the fellow countrymen in the North,  the  South and overseas are turning out as one in the struggle to  achieve reunification in the 90s by united efforts of the nation  at any cost, the statement stresses the need to immediately cut  out the cancerous being swimming against this trend of the  nation.</p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKERS FINALLY LOOK AT HOME ON THE 'ROAD';  </P> <P> THEY END LOSING STREAK BY BEATING CLIPPERS, 116-95  </P> <P> There might as well have been a giant magnifying glass over the Sports Arena  Sunday afternoon, for all the microscopic analysis that was going on during the  Lakers' 116-95 victory over the Clippers.  </P> <P> Amid the people-watching, matinee style, the focus of attention from the crowd  of the 15,352 belonged to:  </P> <P>  -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and his 2-week evaluation period to remain the Laker  starting center.  </P> <P>  -- Gene Shue and his daily evaluation period to remain as Clipper coach.  </P> <P>  -- Streaks, on both sides.  </P> <P> As for the latter, the Lakers (24-12) won on the road for the first time after  8 straight defeats, a skid that had dragged out since Dec. 13. Meanwhile, the  Clippers (10-26) suffered their ninth consecutive loss and 20th in 24 games.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar was hardly the key, but his second-half play inside, when the  Lakers turned a modest 65-57 halftime lead into an eventual 22-point cushion,  was another bright spot for Laker Coach Pat Riley.  </P> <P> The much-scrutinized center, who came in averaging 9.4 points and 4.1 rebounds,  finished at 12 and 5, respectively, while tying his season-high in minutes  played, 31. He scored 10 of the points, on 5-of-10 shooting, and got all 5  rebounds in his 18 second-half minutes.  </P> <P> "I feel a lot better now," Abdul-Jabbar said of his shooting touch. "I feel my  shots will go in. Before, they just flew out of my hands.  </P> <P> "I can play the minutes, physically. Mentally, I think I've come up a step or  two and I think I've been improving. I just haven't been used to being part of  the offense.  </P> <P> "It's not going to come back exactly when I (get the minutes). But I think I'm  approaching it. Another game or so and I'll be OK."  </P> <P> Which is more than can be said for the Clippers.  </P> <P> With Shue's job possibly hanging in the balance -- even though team owner  Donald T. Sterling was out of town and president Alan Rothenberg was at home  ill -- the Clippers played well enough in the first half before the Lakers made  it a rout.  </P> <P> Actually, the Clippers played well above their recent standards in the first  half, shooting 60.5% from the field, to trail by eight points. That they were  falling behind, though playing good, said plenty about how the Lakers looked.  </P> <P> "It means we were playing against the world champions," said Clipper guard  Quintin Dailey, who scored 20 of his team-high 24 points in the first half. "We  turned the ball over in key situations. And when you do that against the  Lakers, they're off to the races."  </P> <P> Said Shue, who may have coached his last game at the Sports Arena with the  Clippers: "I thought the Lakers played great. In the first half, we played  very, very well. As a matter of fact, I don't think we could play much better."  </P> <P> The Laker lead increased steadily in the second half, to 20 points, then to 21  and, finally, to 22, at 115-93, on Mark McNamara's layin with 48 seconds to  play. Along the way, the Clippers had only 35 rebounds, a season low and an  abysmal number by any standard. The Lakers had 53.  </P> <P> Benoit Benjamin had 13 rebounds and 21 points on 9-of-12 shooting. It was his  fourth straight game of double-figure rebounds, and he is also averaging 16.8  points in the last 4 games.  </P> <P> "I think I'm getting back to the way I'm capable of playing," said Benjamin,  who, for a change, is not one of the subjects under the microscope. "I was  getting shifted around (between being a starter and a reserve), but now I'm  coming back to where I was before being benched."  </P> <P> The Lakers looked like the Lakers of old on the road.  </P> <P> The victory was their second straight impressive performance. Last Friday in  the Forum, they defeated Cleveland, the team with the National Basketball  Assn.'s best record, 116-95.  </P> <P> Five players scored in double figures against the Clippers, led by Byron  Scott's 28 points, Magic Johnson's 22 (and 12 assists) and James Worthy's 21.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Laker-Clipper Notes  </P> <P> Clipper guard Gary Grant missed his second straight game with a bruised right  thigh. His status for Tuesday's game at Seattle is uncertain. . . . Tom  Garrick, who has seen time at point guard with Grant's injury and inconsistent  play, sprained his left ankle in the second quarter and did not return. X-rays  will be taken today as a precautionary move, but his availability for the game  against the SuperSonics is also unknown. . . . After a career high in points  (35) and rebounds (20) in Friday's loss to Golden State, Clipper forward Ken  Norman set another career best against the Lakers with 7 assists. . . . Laker  Mychal Thompson, on this "road" game: "It was rough. There was adversity. I was  hitting every light coming here. I couldn't believe it. A couple of police cars  came flashing by, and I don't know what. . . . The scariest part is that I've  got to drive back."  </P></p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / German deal raising petrol tax boosts 'solidarity pact' HOPES for a deal between the German government, the opposition and the 16 federal states on a multi-billion D-Mark 'solidarity pact' to finance German unification increased yesterday, after the ruling coalition agreed on a sharp rise in oil and petrol taxes. The move is seen as the first step in an inevitable double increase in taxation next year, which Chancellor Helmut Kohl will be forced to concede to gain agreement on the pact. Leading negotiators for the 16 German Lander, who will sit down to thrash out a deal with the government on March 11 and 12, are convinced that only the early reintroduction of a 'solidarity surcharge' on income tax will bridge the financing gap over the next two years. Agreement by leaders of the three parties in the ruling coalition on a 13-pfennig-per-litre increase in oil and petrol taxes - a 13 per cent increase in the tax on leaded petrol and nearly 24 per cent on the tax on diesel - is officially intended to finance the debt servicing costs of the German railway system. It was immediately described by the opposition as a backdoor tax increase, in contradiction to the insistence by Mr Kohl that he will not raise the tax burden before 1995. The precise terms of the oil and petrol tax were placed in some doubt last night after a meeting of MPs from Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). They decided that increasing oil and petrol taxes was not enough and there should also be a motorway fee on cars and trucks from January 1 next year. The CDU parliamentary chairman, Mr Wolfgang Schauble, said that the oil and petrol tax rise could be less than had been proposed if it could be coupled with a motorway fee. He described the MPs' decision as very reasonable and said it did not conflict with the aims of the coalition leaders. However, there has already been a public outcry in Germany at suggestions the Bonn government might introduce an autobahn vignette, an annual or monthly sticker that motorists would have to buy and display on their vehicles. Supporters of motorway fees say they are essential to make foreigners pay towards the upkeep of motorways. Foreigners can avoid higher petrol tax by filling up their tanks abroad. Motoring organisations said a tax rise could damage the German car industry, already suffering from the effects of recession, and cost jobs.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / DTI to appeal against ruling on bus mergers THE GOVERNMENT is to appeal against a recent High Court ruling in a Sheffield bus merger case. At the end of March, the court overturned a recommendation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that a Sheffield bus operator should be forced to sell four rival companies it had bought in 1989. The ruling was a setback to government attempts to slow the pace of takeover activity among bus companies. The commission concluded in a report last year on the acquisitions by South Yorkshire Transport of Sheffield and District Transport, Sheafline (PSV), Michael Groves and SUT that each merger might be expected to operate against the public interest. The appeal has been lodged by the Department of Trade and Industry and the commission. The government is concerned that the 1986 de-regulation of bus services outside London has failed to produce the amount of competition expected. Unless the court decision is overturned on appeal it will be very difficult for the government to refer local bus mergers to the commission for investigation without a change to the 1973 Fair Trading Act. The court ruled that the area of operation looked at by the commission when considering the four acquisitions was not 'a substantial part of the UK' within the meaning of the market-share test set out in the 1973 act. Until the case is resolved, the only effective way for the government to challenge local bus mergers is to ask the commission to carry out a monopoly investigation of bus services in a particular part of the UK.</p>

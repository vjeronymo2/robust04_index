			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Battle looms on Tokyo deficit: Japanese finance minister rules out special borrowing MR Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese finance minister, yesterday fired an opening salvo in what is expected to be a protracted battle over how the government should finance increased public spending to stimulate the economy. Mr Hata, delivering a lecture in Tokyo, ruled out a return to special borrowing to finance the Y10,700bn (Pounds 52bn) emergency spending package announced in August. He also rejected demands from retailers and industrial leaders for an income tax cut in 1993 to boost flagging consumption. Mr Hata's remarks are the furthest he has gone in pledging that the ministry of finance will not allow short-term demands for economic stimulus to corrupt what officials refer to as the hard-won 'decency of public finance'. His comments signal an intensification of the political struggle over how the government should finance higher public spending, which is virtually the only domestic source of economic growth at the moment. It is understood the ministry plans only a limited increase in borrowing to finance the emergency package with a construction bond of between Y1,000bn and Y2,000bn. Officials believe the rest of the package can be financed if the ministry is allowed to use all the Y1,500bn tax surplus it has carried over from last year. It would normally use half the sum to pay off government debt. In addition it will seek to trim general government expenditure and finance most of the package by raising funds from individuals through the post office savings system. However, Mr Hata's hard line is an indication of how tricky it will be to construct a durable consensus between Japan's political leadership and the various arms of the economic bureaucracy over how higher spending should be financed. Ministry hopes of trimming general expenditure are unlikely to bear much fruit. Departmental requests for the 1993 budget at the end of August are thought to suggest that general expenditure may increase by 5 per cent, while the general account, which includes capital spending and local government transfers, could grow by 7.2 per cent. However, the ministry's main immediate concern is the way the recession is eating into tax revenues. In July these were 3.9 per cent down on the year before, with a 27.1 per cent fall in corporate tax collected and a 23.7 per cent drop in consumption tax. Official estimates that this year's tax revenues could fall Y3,000bn to Y4,000bn short of the budgeted total of Y62,500bn are judged to be too optimistic by private sector economists.</p>

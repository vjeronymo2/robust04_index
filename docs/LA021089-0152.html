			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OVERTIME DISPUTE SPURS TALKS BY EASTERN AIRLINES, MACHINISTS  </P> <P> Eastern Airlines management and Machinists union officials Wednesday discussed  a mandatory overtime dispute that led to a walkout.  </P> <P> Company spokesman Robin Matell said that there were two small, short-lived  walkouts Wednesday morning by groups of Machinists workers but that operations  were continuing normally.  </P> <P> Up to 1,000 Machinists walked off the job Tuesday afternoon at Miami  International Airport. The job action lasted about 3 hours, and management  personnel used to replace baggage handlers and other ground services workers  enabled the airline to run its flights with minimal delays.  </P> <P> Machinists leaders said they didn't call for the walkout and said it was  spontaneous. Matell blamed it on "public posturing" by the Machinists, whose  16-month-old contract dispute with management has a March 3 deadline for  settlement.  </P> <P> Matell said the meeting Wednesday continued discussions from Tuesday on the  suspensions for 3 days each of eight to 10 Machinists who refused to work  overtime required by their contract. The Machinists said the company failed to  show a need for the extra work.  </P> <P> "This is a decision management interprets, when there is a need," Matell said.  </P> <P> A union member said the strike was a spontaneous action from the rank and file.  </P></p>

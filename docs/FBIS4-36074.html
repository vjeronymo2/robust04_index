			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, June 5 (AFP) -- Six-hundred-and-thirteen  soldiers loyal to northern President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih have  been killed and 2,030 wounded in Yemen's month-old civil war,  officials said in the first official toll published here Sunday  [5 June].    Another 1,200 northern troops have been reported missing  while 901 are being held prisoner by southern forces backing  Salih's rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a military spokesman told the  northern-controlled SABA' news agency.    He said the number of prisoners being held in "concentration  camps in Aden" had been supplied by the International Committee  of the Red Cross.    It was the first official, if partial, toll to be given  since  fighting broke out on May 5.    Late Saturday a southern leader said in Cairo that 80,000  people had been killed, wounded or made homeless in the  fighting, without giving a breakdown.</p>

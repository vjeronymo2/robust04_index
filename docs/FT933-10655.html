			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Letter: Lysold plan 'best possible' for ensuring a sustainable future for Lloyd's Sir, On July 23 you reported Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's, being critical of me ('Names face writs to recover losses') for advising Names to vote against a resolution supporting the present management, and being sharply critical of improvements (involving Lysold plc) suggested for Lloyd's business plan. The EGM resolution contains several topics, including 'that the new management of Lloyd's should be allowed the opportunity to implement the Business Plan'. I, and my group, believe that the plan can be improved and, as we are unhappy for it to be implemented on the present basis, we have suggested a vote against the resolution. It is unfair of Peter Middleton to interpret this as a vote against the present management, as Lysold wishes to collaborate with him and his team. The statement that the Lysold solution is 'commercially naive' is amazing. Surely corporate capital investors must be regarded as 'commercially naive' if they were to prefer the exposure in the Lloyd's plan to the security of the Lysold barrier through the end of 1993. Corporate investors must contribute 1.5 per cent to the central guarantee fund, and be exposed to possible additional levies. Lysold proposes a further 1 per cent annual charge with no exposure to the past or to any further levies, including Lioncover (Cameron Webb), a liability that Lloyd's has not yet mentioned. Lysold considers it impossible to run a successful Lloyd's with half the membership involved in disputes. Lysold's proposed solutions involve the creation of an insurance company, owned by Nantos and incorporating all its reserves, operated under Department of Trade and Industry rules and not under the absolute control of Lloyd's; a solution that the council cannot suggest but which can be proposed by the Names. These solutions include parameters for settling the litigation, closing open years, and providing a fair and affordable exit route for any Name at the end of two years. It is really sad that, after months of work and consultations with leading City institutions, Peter Middleton should denigrate Lysold as naive and unacceptable. Lysold is a constructive and workable solution to the massive problems at Lloyd's. Hopefully, Peter Middleton will yet see Lysold as the best possible evolution of the Lloyd's business plan, and the implementation of Lysold will result in a positive and sustainable future for Lloyd's. Support for Lysold is growing and, unlike the Lloyd's business plan, the Lysold suggestions are 'consultative'. David Springbett, The Abbey House, Huntercombe Lanes, Taplow, Berkshire SL6 0PQ</p>

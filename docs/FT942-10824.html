			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Dismay at stance on EU funding The government is refusing to submit plans for spending Pounds 520m of European Union funds available to the UK for retraining workers in industries undergoing structural change - such as cars and carpets. Ministers believe that the money would be better spent on training for the unemployed and that employee training is the responsibility of employers. But the decision has caused dismay among local authorities, motor industry companies and Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in areas of industrial change such as the Midlands. 'When funding is already there and we're turning our back on it, it is extremely frustrating,' said Mr John Hawksby, a Bedfordshire Conservative councillor who is chairman of the all-party Motor Industry Local Authority Network (Milan), which brings together local authorities with a strong interest in the motor industry. The money available from the EU is the so-called Objective Four funding, which can be spent over the next five years. It is administered by national governments, which must give the European Commission details of their spending plans. The UK government has refused to do this for 1995-96. 'We believe that the money could be better used in helping the unemployed under Objective Three of the structural funds, which provides training for the unemployed,' the employment department said. Any money spent on Objective Four funding comes out of the budget for Objective Three. By not applying for Objective Four funds, the government hopes to maintain present levels of EU funding for unemployment programmes. However, Mr Rodney Skidmore, chief executive of Central England Training and Enterprise Council, said that withholding Objective Four funds was making it harder for Tecs to assist in reskilling local labour forces. 'Anything we can do to help people make a smooth transition in employment must make sense.' Motor industry groups, including Ford, Vauxhall, Unipart and Rover - which spends Pounds 35m a year on training - want to tap Objective Four funding. Mr Iain Mills, co-chairman of the Commons car industry committee, said it would not take up any position on the issue before the autumn.</p>

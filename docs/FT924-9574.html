			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Technology: Brush up on gums - Victoria Griffith describes why companies are putting a new shine on dental products In the days when our concerned parents urged us to brush our teeth at night, that was about as far as their exhortations went. These days, though, parental pleas might include brushing with tartar-control paste, flossing, and rinsing with a plaque-fighting mouthwash. Attention to dental care over the last few years has brought forth a flood of new products that our mothers and fathers would never have recognised. In the past, tooth decay was the main concern, and fluoride became recognised as a key compound for control. Today, as the baby-boom generation enters middle age with most of its teeth intact, the focus has switched to the prevention of gum disease. With the improvement in dental hygiene, and regular visits to the dentist, tooth decay is becoming a disease of the past. According to a study by the US National Institute for Dental Research, less than half of American children now have tooth decay, compared with 63 per cent a decade ago and 72 per cent in the 1970s. The result is that more people are keeping their teeth longer. Not long ago, dentures were common in middle-aged adults, but today less than 4 per cent of Americans under 65 have lost all their teeth. More teeth has meant more demand for dental products. Because teeth encourage the build-up of bacteria in the mouth, however, it has also meant more gum disease. 'The baby-boom generation is moving into a phase of life in which gum disease is a major threat,' said Aline Christiansen, a product director at Johnson &amp; Johnson. 'That's why we've seen so many new products in this line over the last few years.' Toothbrushes have been the main focus of innovation recently. 'There has been a small boom in toothbrush products over the last few years,' said Glenn Archibald, president of California-based toothbrush manufacturer Oral-B. The reason is that traditional toothbrushes are not really suitable for gum stimulation, which is important in the prevention of gum disease. 'Dentists are now advising their patients to brush their gums as well as their teeth,' said Chris Burbank of Crest, part of Procter &amp; Gamble. 'But old-fashioned toothbrushes, if used improperly, can cause gum damage.' Crest has just come out with its first toothbrush, which is designed to penetrate further between the teeth without hurting the gums. The toothbrush has a rippled surface; its bristles are highly polished, and therefore gentle on gums. 'We have a patented technology to polish, cut and shape the bristles so that they can be used effectively on the gums,' Burbank explained. Colgate has also jumped on the bandwagon by introducing its Precision toothbrush brand, which has a triangular head. Once again, the goal is to brush between the teeth. One new toothbrush, Oral-B's Indicator brand, is aimed at encouraging Americans to replace their toothbrush more often. 'The American Dental Association recommends replacing your toothbrush every three months,' Archibald points out. 'But most people buy a new one once a year. By then the bristles have frayed and may start to damage gums.' The idea behind the Indicator is simple. A row in the middle of the brush is coloured blue with a food-based die. When the colour fades half-way down the bristle, the marketing slogan explains, it's time to get a new toothbrush. Electric toothbrushes have also experienced something of a renaissance. Braun makes a new product called the 'Plac Remover', with a round head which moves back and forth. Bausch &amp; Laumb has put out 'Interplak', an electric toothbrush whose individual tufts rotate in different directions, and Panasonic and WaterPik have introduced similar products. Dental floss is also being made more appealing. Although flossing is considered essential for the effective prevention of gum disease, a study by the American Dental Association shows that only 44 per cent of Americans floss daily. The reason, manufacturers feel, is that many people find floss difficult to use. Sulca, a Canadian company, has taken advantage of this hole in the market by introducing what it claims is a substitute for flossing - a stimulation brush. The brush, which was tested with encouraging results by Columbia University, consists of a single tuft of bristles, pointed at the tip and placed in a rubber base, for easy insertion between the teeth. 'This product works better than dental floss in massaging the gums,' said Ira Florence, Sulca's sales director. According to the American Dental Association, mouthwash has been even less successful a product than floss, with just 16 per cent of the country's population using it on a regular basis. Mouthwash manufacturers have been taking advantage of the new concern about gum disease by pointing out that mouthwash is an effective combatant. The problem is that many people do not like the taste. To make the product more amenable, Warner-Lambert has introduced a variation on its Listerine brand. Its new mouthwash 'maintains a balance of thymol, menthol, eucalyptol and methyl salicylate, while making it taste more like mint'. According to Ray Le Febvre, president of the company's consumer health products group: 'Through a patented process, our scientists identified the formula to enhance the taste, yet maintain therapeutic efficacy.' Although preventing gum disease is the industry's main focus, scientists have been working on other innovations as well. Johnson &amp; Johnson has just launched 'synthetic sapphire braces' for general orthodontic use. 'Synthetic sapphire is the second-hardest metal known to man,' said Christiansen, product director at the company. 'These braces don't stain, and because they are clear, they blend with teeth colour.' Other products consumers can expect to see on the market soon are improved artificial teeth and desk-top computer systems that will show the impact of orthodontic plans to patients before treatment begins. The National Institute of Dental Research is also financing the development of a new fluoride and calcium phosphate mouthrinse for the market. As people hold on to their teeth longer, industry experts believe dental care products will continue to be a growing market.</p>

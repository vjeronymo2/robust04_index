			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / C4 chief coy over ITV approach Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, has been approached as a possible successor to Mr Ward Thomas as chairman of the ITV company Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television. A number of talks are believed to have been held on the issue between Mr Thomas, who is 71 and starting to think about his successor, and Mr Grade, whose contract with Channel 4 runs out in 1996. However, Mr Grade, who is in Bournemouth to address the Conservative Bow Group think tank on reforming the Channel 4 funding formula, said last night of the approach from Yorkshire-Tyne Tees: 'There is no substance in it at all.' He declined to say whether he had been sounded out on the issue of the Yorkshire chairmanship. Mr Thomas, who was brought back to run Yorkshire-Tyne Tees after the abrupt resignation of Mr Clive Leach nearly a year ago, has made clear that he would like to retire at the company's annual general meeting in the summer of 1996. Mr Thomas would like to have a potential successor in place well before he retires so that there could be an orderly handover. Last year, according to the Channel 4 annual report, Mr Grade was paid between Pounds 355,000 and Pounds 360,000. Earlier, top executives at the channel received substantial incentives to retain their services through the 1991 ITV franchise round. It is not clear what Yorkshire could offer Mr Grade to induce him to move, other than generous share options. Mr Grade's priority at the moment has been to argue for the removal of the funding link with ITV. The link has meant Channel 4 paying large sums to the ITV companies as part of a complex 'insurance policy' providing financial underpinning for the channel's minority remit. Last year Channel 4 paid Pounds 38.2m to ITV and this year the sum could be considerably higher. Mr Grade wants the channel to keep the money and spend it on more British programming.</p>

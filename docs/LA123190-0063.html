			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLOODING CLOSES ROADS, FORCES EVACUATIONS IN MIDWEST;  </P> <P> WEATHER: ANOTHER WINTER STORM WARNING IS ISSUED IN WASHINGTON STATE. MORE  RECORD LOWS ARE SET IN THE PLAINS.  </P> <P> Flooding forced evacuations and closed roads Sunday in Indiana and Ohio, and a  new storm headed into wind-ravaged Washington state with a threat of snow and  high wind.  </P> <P> Highways were icy across parts of the plains and towing services were kept busy  with cars that wouldn't start or stay on the road.  </P> <P> Temperatures dipped to numbing lows again Sunday, including a record 23 below  zero at Scottsbluff, Neb., 30 below at Rapid City, S.D., a record for the month  of December, and an unofficial 40 below at Porcupine, S.D.  </P> <P> Since the start of the season's first strong cold wave on Dec. 18, at least 98  deaths have been attributed to the weather.  </P> <P> Two days of heavy rain combined with melting snow to push streams out of their  banks in many areas around Indiana. Scattered evacuations were reported in  several communities, including Indianapolis. Countless roads were closed by  high water, officials said.  </P> <P> Indiana's emergency management director said he was concerned that rivers were  still rising and had not crested yet. Additional rain, sleet and snow fell  Sunday.  </P> <P> The Mississinewa River was forecast to crest five feet above flood stage for  its worst flooding at Marion since 1958, and Indianapolis was due to receive  the highest levels along the White River since 1964, the National Weather  Service said.  </P> <P> Dozens of residents were evacuated in two northern Ohio towns because of high  water.  </P> <P> In the Northwest, which was battered by high wind Friday that damaged coastal  property and knocked down trees and power lines, the weather service issued  another winter storm warning for the Puget Sound area and upgraded a storm  watch to a storm warning for north-central and northeastern Washington.  </P> <P> The storm also knocked out power to about 150,000 utility customers.  </P></p>

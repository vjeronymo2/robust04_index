			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Lawyers propose legal aid savings THE LAW Society and the Bar have put together a package of cost-cutting measures designed to replace the government's proposed cuts in legal aid eligibility announced in the 1992 Autumn Statement, Robert Rice writes. The lawyers' proposals are calculated to save Pounds 43m - the savings in the legal aid budget that Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, has said he must find to meet Treasury targets in 1993-94. Their proposals include: A pay freeze for legal aid lawyers in 1993-94. That would save Pounds 15m assuming the government had planned a 1.5 per cent increase in fees in April. Ceasing to pay for a solicitor's representative to attend court with a barrister in most legal aid cases. At the moment all barristers must be accompanied by a representative of the instructing solicitors. This could save Pounds 9.1m in criminal cases, Pounds 3m in family cases and Pounds 2m in other civil cases. Removal of the need for lawyers to attend court for unopposed adjournments in magistrates' courts. This could save Pounds 11.6m. Removal of the need to pay for a junior barrister as well as a QC in a substantial number of legal aid cases. This would save Pounds 1m. Cost penalties on legally-aided matrimonial litigants where there is clear evidence of an uncooperative approach to divorce or separation. This could save Pounds 2m.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (15): Teamwork discovers fresh territory - The full potential of CE (concurrent engineering) has barely been used, Andrew Baxter learns on a visit to TransTec / Management:  Concurrent Engineering Concurrent engineering - using teamwork to get new and better products on to the market more rapidly - has been a regular feature on the industrial map for the best part of a decade. Now, however, it is moving into new territory. Most surveys suggest a large proportion of engineering companies in most western countries are using concurrent engineering (CE) in some or all parts of their business. Its benefits are understood, because companies realise from bitter experience how expensive it can be to have to change the design of a product at the last moment. Some experts say the idea was invented first in Japan and has been rapidly copied, adapted and improved by European companies to stay competitive. Others say the term is simply management-speak for 'common sense'. One company that claims to have been using CE long before the phrase was coined is TransTec, the Birmingham-based specialist engineering group. Since its early days in 1982, says Dr Sami Ahmed, executive director, it has frequently used project teams led by a full-time manager who pulls in colleagues from different disciplines to ensure the right product gets to market at the right time. TransTec is now participating in an ambitious worldwide project to chart the future for concurrent engineering, which can be defined as the consideration during the design phase of the factors associated with the life cycle of the product, including manufacturing, assembly testing, maintenance, reliability, cost and quality. The old, traditional alternative is a sequential approach, where a product is typically designed, then engineered for manufacturing, then given to the marketing department. It might only be very late in the process, for example, that a maintenance problem might emerge - which could have been spotted if the relevant employees had been involved at the outset. But how can concurrent engineering be carried out in a global manufacturing context? What happens if products are designed in one place and manufactured in a different part of the world? These are the questions being tackled by a project on global concurrent engineering being carried out under the auspices of the five-continent Intelligent Manufacturing Systems Initiative. TransTec is leading the European side of the project, which is currently at the feasibility study stage. Other members of the European team, which is backed by funds from the European Union's Esprit research and development programme, include Olivetti of Italy, De Montfort University in Leicester, and the Odense Shipyard in Denmark. The US team is the North Carolina State University and the California Polytechnic, along with 25 small companies based around the NCSU, while the Canadian team is Northern Telecom, and Carleton University in Ottawa. The project has five aims: to establish the extent to which CE is practised: to identify the 'critical constraints' or obstacles to global manufacturing in terms of technology, technology management and human resources; to synthesise the best practices of CE, and to develop the requirements necessary to diminish the effects of the critical constraints; to design an 'architecture' of a CE system for global manufacturing; and finally, to disseminate the results through a Global CE workshop in Patras, Greece next month. With Odense, one of the world's most sophisticated shipyards, producing large products at big intervals, NorTel producing thousands of small parts, and Trans-Tec somewhere in between, the project has plenty of its own CE experiences to draw on. But its main information source, says Dr Ahmed, is an elaborate questionnaire which has been sent to hundreds of companies in six sectors: automotive, aerospace, information technology, shipbuilding/marine, telecommunications and electronics design. In return for some useful information that benchmarks their own performance in all aspects of introducing CE, the companies have contributed data on how long they have been using CE, its benefits, problems faced when it was introduced, and on what sort of employees became involved in the new product development process. The major benefit of CE was seen to be shorter time to market, followed by improved communication, improved product quality and reduced design changes. The biggest problems were resistance to change, managers' reluctance to implement it, and geographical dispersion. These are the impressions so far: companies are very interested in strategies for implementing CE, especially on a global basis; all CE approaches are 'custom-built'; dispersed teams need to build trust through initial face-to-face meetings; CE has industrial benefit through improved quality and reduced changes; IT tools can help but are not an adequate alternative to multifunctional teams. Problem areas include: implementing CE at the working level; getting managers to 'let go' or accept that they may have to delegate more to team members in the interests of faster product development; integrating many teams in large projects; and problems with team turnover and knowledge of teamwork. Dr Ahmed says it will be impossible to find an architecture for CE that is applicable universally, but it should be possible to produce at least a generalised architecture. This would have a number of requirements: it should be flexible, to allow the design problem to be approached from a variety of viewpoints; the designer should be able to design even if complete information is absent; it should handle the large volume, variety and interdependence of life-cycle information; it should readily interface to database management and CAD systems; it should be easy to use, and should support design audits. The feasibility study ends this month but participants will now seek backing for a full IMS project, which could last three years and would fully develop an architecture for global CE. Dr Ahmed sees benefits for TransTec from the project, as it is considering expanding its manufacturing locations, and Japan would need to consider the many human issues involved. TransTec is also a big exporter, so after sales technical support is important, and needs to be included in the CE process. TransTec may even end up with a new product out of the process, he says - a global CE kit which it can sell to industry worldwide.</p>

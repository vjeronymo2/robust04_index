The following are the major changes made in the military  over  the past year: The establishment of an atmosphere for  discussions in military camps; the disbanding of the officers  wives associations; the increase of personnel driving their cars  as opposed to using chauffeurs; the establishment of a  self-regulating leave system; the removal of unnecessary  paperwork; proper guidance for environmental protection; and the  reduction of the military office of protocol at Kimpo Airport.    Among these changes, the new system for the smooth  communication between officers and enlisted men in military  camps presents a striking contrast to the past authoritarianism.  The Army, Navy, and Air Force frequently hold various  get-togethers and forums ranging from staff officers meetings to  soldiers free discussions, with an unprecedented activeness in  helping facilitate smooth verbal communication between officers  and enlisted men.    Participants of these meetings freely express their own  opinions, in contrast to the past when both officers and  enlisted men could hardly put their thoughts into words because  they were studying their officers' faces. Soldiers came to  often sharply point out their commanders' merits and demerits.    The military authorities explain: An atmosphere for free  discussions has been vitalized mainly because most soldiers were  born in or after the seventies, when the country was rapidly  growing, and belong to the new generation and because over 80  percent of them are high school or upper secondary school  graduates.    As the officers wives associations, which had played the  role  of channel for asking personnel favors among military officers,  has completely been disbanded over the past year, the phrase in  vogue "A colonel's wife is a general" has become an archaic  saying.    Activities of the wives associations led by the wives of the  Army, Navy, and Air Force chiefs of staff included some positive  ones. They supported helpless people and paid visits of inquiry  to soldiers. The associations, however, were disbanded and  their official activities have been completed forbidden since  last year when it was revealed that they influenced military  reshuffles. At present, the Navy and Air Force strictly control  all visits to the chief of staff office by the officers and  their wives. As the system of assigning some soldiers as  chauffeurs for generals was removed last year, their families  and even generals drive their cars when they are using them for  unofficial purposes, creating an increase of personnel driving  their cars instead of using chauffeurs.    Despite the military service regulations' guarantee for  leave, officers and soldiers could not take their leave in the  past, because they had to read their commanders' mind. "Taking  leave by reading their commanders' mind" has became  old-fashioned these days, because most officers and soldiers  seems to believe that taking their leave is a kind of the  continuity their work performance.    For an example, Cho Kun-hae, chief of the Air Force, could  not take his summer leave last year, but most of his staff  members enjoyed their leave without reading their chief's mind.    Red tape, which has been regarded as a traditional bad habit  of the administrative organization, has been gradually improved.  The Army, Air Force, and Navy have set up computer networks and  computer terminals in their military units to reduce  inefficiency of their administrative activities caused by the  excessive work needed to prepare many documents. They have  decided to gradually expand the method of approval through  computers.    The Army's understanding of the environmental pollution  issue, which was neglected by people over the past years, has  been largely changed. As a result, the Army has recently set up  a new section, which will mainly deal with environmental issues,  to actively participate in preparing for the prevention of air  pollution. It has set up space to separately collect garbage  and to recycle the used resources and has established a sewage  disposal plant.    Moreover, the Defense Ministry has largely cut the size of  the military protocol office at Kimpo Airport. This office has  created the social disharmony between the people and the Army by  giving priority seating in airplanes to military personnel and  in clearing customs at Kimpo Airport. Accordingly, it has  closed the VIP room in the domestic airline waiting room. The  VIP room at the international airline waiting room is being  operated by a small number of military personnel.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chan Wai-Fong] </F>   [Text] Shenzhen hopes to improve its poor industrial  safety record by requiring enterprises which employ more than 50  workers to hire safety officers.    The measure, modelled on Hong Kong practice, will be  implemented later this year. The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone  (SEZ) will be the first in China to try this approach to  industrial safety.    A government document issued last month indicates  enterprises  with 50 to 200 workers must hire an acting safety officer.  Those with more than 200 must have a full-time one.    And for industries classified as dangerous, special safety  units must be established. The same will apply to large-scale  industries that control a number of subsidiaries, a Shenzhen  municipal official responsible for labour safety said.    The official, who identified himself only as Mr Lo said  training courses were being prepared for the safety officers,  who would have to be registered with the government to be  eligible for the job.    Although at present large-scale and state-controlled  enterprises in China usually have safety units, they are not  obligatory. And for foreign-funded factories, except in highly  organised ones, safety units are a rarity.    Guangdong Labour Bureau safety chief Tan Shaofen said that  when accidents happened in these enterprises, owners would be  penalised.    Over the past two years serious industrial accidents have  been reported in southern China, some resulting in hundreds of  deaths and injuries, and occurring most often in factories  funded by Hong Kong and Taiwan interests.    "It's futile simply to hold owners responsible," Mr Lo said.  "And the newly issued document stipulates that anyone who wishes  to open a factory has to employ safe ty officers" he said.    He said the new safety officers needed to be properly  trained  in the relevant laws and regulations, industrial safety, and  what to do in case of accidents.    The new policy would be fully implemented in the SEZ within  two years, Mr Lo said. Mr Tan said there was no plan at present  to adopt the system in other parts of Guangdong, although he  said Shenzhen was moving in the right direction. "We will keep  a close eye on it," he said.    Mr Tan explained that "the system in Shenzhen is different.  All enterprises there come directly under the SEZ government,  while here we have bosses like the labour bureau, the union".    But he was quick to point out that foreign-funded  enterprises  could not be exempted from Chinese laws on industrial safety.    Mr Tan said his department suffered from a shortage of  staff.  This had paralyzed, to a certain extent, the enforcement of laws  and regulations on industrial safety, particularly in  foreign-funded enterprises.    "We have to rely on local governments to monitor the  situation. They will be responsible for any accidents occurred.  And the owners of foreign enterprises will also be charged," he  said.</p>

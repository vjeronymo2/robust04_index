Liang and Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Singapore, Jan. 4 (CNA) -- Republic of China [ROC]  Premier Lien Chan began his second full day of visit in  Singapore Tuesday [4 January] by golfing with Singaporean Prime  Minister Goh Chok Tong and other officials.    Before the round of golf, Lien had breakfast with Goh, Trade  and Commerce Minister Yeo Cheow Tong, and Environment Minister  Mah Bon Tan, during which they discussed joint development  projects on Mainland China's Hainan Province.    Lien said that petroleum and minerals would be the main  products worth developing on Hainan, and suggested that Taiwan  and Singapore establish a company financed by Taiwan and manned  by Singaporeans to process and export the products.    Goh and other Singaporean officials expressed interest in  the  proposal, and Lien asked Hsiao Wan-chang, chairman of the  Council for Economic Planning and Development, to keep in touch  with the Singaporean side on the matter.    Lien arrived in Singapore Sunday for a four-day visit  following his private visit in Malaysia.    Lien attended a dinner party hosted by President Ong Teng  Cheong Monday night, and will attend one given by Senior  Minister Li Kuan Yew Tuesday night.    Also attending the dinner Monday were Deputy Minister Lee  Hsieng Loong, Foreign [as received] Affairs Minister Jayakumar  Shunmugam, Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong, Labor  Minister Lim Boon Heng, Information and the Arts Minister Ker  Sin Tze, and Singapore Trade Representative in Taipei Chai Chong  Yi.    During his stay in Singapore, Lien has met with nearly every  cabinet official, and this will help boost substantial relations  between the two countries, observers said.    Lien's mission is comprised of Hsiao, Deputy Foreign Affairs  Minister Fang Chin-yen, and Jason Hu, director-general of the  Government Information Office.    Hsiao said Lien admired the public works, purchasing system,  rapid transit network and financial services sector in  Singapore, and was impressed by Malaysia's rapid economic  development.    Lien's mission will return to Taipei Wednesday.</p>

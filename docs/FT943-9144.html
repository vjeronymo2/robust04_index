			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Aluminium breaks its resistance level - Market Report There was a late-afternoon spike in ALUMINIUM and COPPER prices on the London Metal Exchange yesterday. Three-month aluminium broke through a technical resistance level at Dollars 1,485 to close at Dollars 1,485.25, up Dollars 14.50 a tonne from Wednesday's close. Dealers said the move was supported by positive technical indicators and improving fundamentals, and they were looking for an LME stocks drawdown today to keep the upward momentum. 'Prices may now have the strength to go above Dollars 1,500,' one dealer said. Copper also moved higher but remained in its Dollars 2,400-Dollars 2,430-a-tonne range. Dealers said copper could test the higher end of this range today, though they were wary that the LME may report another stocks rise today. Copper closed at Dollars 2,417.50, up Dollars 7. NICKEL staged a technical rally in choppy trading, though there was selling towards Dollars 5,900 a tonne. COFFEE prices slipped by Dollars 83 a tonne to see the November futures contract on the London Commodity Exchange close at Dollars 3,200 a tonne. The market had bounced off the day's low as some coffee roasting companies returned to buy stocks, but trading remained thin and jittery ahead of a report from the US Department of Agriculture today assessing the frost damage to Brazil's crop. The market has lost about 10 per cent of its value this week as fears of more frosts in Brazil have receded.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Royal Insurance trims deficit to Pounds 119m ROYAL Insurance, one of the UK's largest insurance companies, yesterday announced a Pounds 20m increase in its reserves against possible employers' liability claims arising from industrial diseases such as industrial deafness and repetitive stress injury. This indicates that the industry, hard hit by weather and recession-related claims in recent years, may soon face problems from a fresh source. The decision, combined with news of heavier than expected losses at Royal Re, the reinsurance subsidiary, clouded an otherwise impressive performance by Royal Insurance during 1992, which saw pre-tax losses fall to Pounds 119m from Pounds 373m in 1991. Royal, which omitted its final dividend last year, declared a final dividend of 3p, making a total of 5p (11.25p). The group also announced a Pounds 100m subordinated bond issue. The proceeds  -like those from a Pounds 75m convertible issue launched in December - will be used to repay short term borrowings, lengthening the repayment profile of Royal's debt. Royal has seen no increase in either notifications or actual claims on employers' liability business, but said that it was taking a more cautious stance in the light of the more 'pro-active' stance being adopted by trades unions. The group has a market share of employers' liability business of about 5 per cent, according to Mr Roy Elms, director of underwriting. Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive, said that the Pounds 254m improvement in trading reflected a lower level of weather and domestic mortgage indemnity claims in the UK but was achieved despite three major weather catastrophes in the United States. Improvements reflected 'the new creed' of tighter underwriting controls, added Mr Gamble. 'We don't write for market share. We write for profit.' Worldwide premium income fell to Pounds 3.42bn (Pounds 3.46bn), with life premiums dropping to Pounds 332m (Pounds 390m). The fall in general insurance income largely reflected exchange rate factors. However in the UK the company reduced its exposures sharply in motor business (down 10 per cent) and motor fleet (down 8 per cent). Underwriting losses fell to Pounds 588m (Pounds 887m), reflecting a decline in losses on domestic mortgage indemnity - which insure borrowers against a portion of their losses on the sales of repossessed property - losses from Pounds 257m in 1991 to Pounds 160m in 1992 and an improvement in most other lines. Mr Gamble said that reserves against DMI losses were Pounds 367m at the end of 1992. Some Pounds 60m in claims was paid out during the year. The group had not increased its most recent estimate of potential DMI losses. Claims frequency in motor business declined by 10 per cent, with UK underwriting losses in personal motor falling to Pounds 12m (Pounds 34m). Underwriting losses fell in the US and at Royal International, but increased by Pounds 3m in Canada. Underwriting losses at Royal Re rose by Pounds 40m to Pounds 96m, largely as a result of increased claims from recent catastrophe losses such as hurricane Andrew in the US last year. Investment income fell to Pounds 486m (Pounds 492m), while income from associated undertakings dropped to Pounds 21m (Pounds 34m). Estate agency losses rose to Pounds 33m, compared with a deficit of Pounds 19m in 1991. Costs associated with the restructuring of the network of offices by 67 to 517, more than outweighed the benefit of new cost controls, introduced by Mr Gamble. Capital and reserves amounted to Pounds 1.5bn (up from Pounds 1.41bn), but would have fallen without exchange rate gains of Pounds 198m. The solvency margin - the yardstick which measures net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income - amounted to 42 per cent, compared with 40 per cent at the end of 1991. See Lex</p>

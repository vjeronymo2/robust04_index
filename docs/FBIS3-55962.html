Some of its points are ill-thought, Shokhin told Interfax.    He described as ill-conceived the decision to scrap the post  of Vice Premier for trade cooperation with CIS states given that  they introduced similar posts following Moscow's suit. Shokhin  says this is a sudden diversion from the scheme that Russia has  itself introduced.    Attempts to try to saddle the First Vice Premier with that  duty in addition to his responsibility for areas of the economy,  finances and other macroeconomic matters is tantamount to  pushing CIS cooperation into the background which is  unacceptable, he said.    Shokhin said that though the Vice Premiers were at odds  about  the pace of CIS integration, the possibility of letting Yeltsin  and his Prime Minister know about them would no longer exist.    Nor is it clear, he said, why the Russian agency for  international cooperation and development is to be merged with  the ministry for foreign economic relations as a government  body. Shokhin said he would seek the repeal of the decree's  point on the agency and a new resolution on that body designed  to attract foreign investment.    He does not rule out being offered a Vice Premiership for  agrarian or social matters in the new government. However, he  says Aleksandr Zaveryukha, Yuriy Yarov, Yegor Gaydar and Oleg  Soskovets responsible for agriculture, social security,  economics and industry respectively may retain their jobs.    Shokhin believes other changes may take place if First Vice  Premier Vladimir Shumeyko fails to be elected as Speaker of the  Federation Council, the upper house of parliament.    It is most likely that new appointments will announced  piecemeal rather than in a matter of one day, he said.</p>

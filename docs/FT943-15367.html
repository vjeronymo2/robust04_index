			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Fisons finds its man The chief executive's job at Fisons has looked like a poisoned chalice in recent years. The sudden departure of the previous incumbent in December did nothing to dispel that impression. Mr Stuart Wallis, who is giving up the blue-chip comfort of Bowater, must reason that Fisons' troubles are now behind it. If good habits learned at Bowater can be transferred, Fisons stands a better chance of avoiding the kind of management errors which have dogged its recent progress. The 3 per cent fall in Bowater's shares yesterday suggests that the packaging group has lost a valuable asset. Yet the muted reaction of Fisons' shares points to scepticism about Mr Wallis's ability to add value in pharmaceuticals. Housekeeping measures such as cost-cutting and selling off unwanted assets are already in hand. The bigger challenge is to decide whether Fisons can survive as an independent drugs company and, if not, to find an alternative solution. While some investors might have preferred an industry insider, the task may be better approached from a dispassionate point of view. Mr Bob Bauman, architect of Beecham's merger with SmithKline Beckman, was also an outsider. As yesterday's performance shows, though, adding pep to Fisons' shares will not be easy. The company is already trading at a healthy price-earnings premium to the stock market average even though the rest of the pharmaceuticals sector stands at a discount. Lingering hopes that a predator will step in could be the explanation. If a bid seems less likely as Mr Wallis gets to grips with the business, the shares will be running to stand still.</p>

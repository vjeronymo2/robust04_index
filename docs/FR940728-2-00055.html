To obtain Tribal input into this process, as well as input on future Tribal matters, the EPA Administrator convened the Tribal Operations Committee (TOC) comprised of Tribal representatives and EPA Senior Managers. EPA is now seeking broader input on these approaches, and will consider comments received during the public comment period to ensure that the strongest options have been identified. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received by September 12, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments should be sent to Caren Rothstein, Tribal Operations Team, US EPA, Mail Code 1199, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Caren Rothstein at 202&hyph;260&hyph;7519. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The Environmental Protection Agency has made continual progress in building its Tribal program since issuance of the Agency's 1984 Indian Policy. In Fiscal Year 1993, approximately $35 million and 165 work years were utilized to implement EPA Indian programs, either through direct grants to Tribes or through Federal implementation and technical assistance to Tribes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regulations and guidance specific to Tribes have been developed under many of EPA's programs establishing the process for Tribes to apply for grants and program authorization. Over 90 Treatment in the Same Manner as a State determinations, formerly referred to as Treatment as a State, have been made under various water programs. Numerous Tribes have submitted water quality standards for authorization by EPA, and three have already been approved. Many more Tribal applications are expected in the future for a broad array of EPA programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The growth of EPA's Indian program has led to an increased understanding of the seriousness of environmental threats to human health and the environments within Indian Country by EPA and the Tribes. To promote improved communications and partnerships with Tribes to address these concerns, the EPA Administrator convened a Tribal Operations Committee (TOC) to meet with her and other EPA Senior Management as co-regulators, on a regular basis, and to provide Tribal input into Agency decision making that may affect Tribes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The TOC is comprised of 18 Tribal representatives, who are either Tribal Leaders or Tribal environmental officials selected by Tribes within EPA regions. There are Tribal representatives from each of EPA's regions except Region III, which has no Federally recognized Tribes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 17, 1994, at the first official TOC meeting, the Administrator committed to strengthening the Agency's Tribal operations and reaffirmed the Agency's 1984 Indian Policy. As one of the first actions for the Tribal representatives to the TOC and in response to Tribal recommendations, the Administrator authorized a group of Senior Managers from EPA Headquarters and regions to develop recommendations, in consultation with Tribal representatives to the TOC, on ways to strengthen EPA's Tribal environmental programs and daily operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over the last few months, the EPA Senior Team, working with the TOC, has identified options for advancing and strengthening Tribal environmental protection and improving relations between EPA and the Tribes, in the following program areas: organization, implementation and resource needs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure constant Tribal input while developing these options, weekly conference calls were held with the TOC. Two meetings have been held at which the TOC and Team met face-to-face. In addition, early in June 1994, a letter was sent to all Tribal Leaders providing information on the approaches the Agency was considering, and soliciting additional comment. These comments have been considered and the Agency hopes to obtain further input through publishing this Notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's Current Indian Program Structure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Agency's current Indian program structure, the central coordination responsibility has been one of many functions undertaken by the Office of Federal Activities (OFA) in the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. OFA is currently the central point of contact for Tribes at Headquarters, and also develops the budget for the General Assistance Grant Program, works with regions to oversee administration of such grants to Tribes, and fosters overall coordination between the various offices at Headquarters and the regions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Responsibility for administering specific programs such as water, air and waste are handled by those program and regional offices. This includes specifically (but not exclusively) provision of technical assistance, direct Federal implementation and program development and implementation funds as allowed by law. This will continue to be necessary because these offices have the technical expertise and the responsibility for developing and administering program-specific resources, policies, and regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's regional offices interact with each Tribe on matters specific to the Tribes and this should continue even though a national office will be responsible for the coordination of the Agency's Tribal program. In fact, regions and programs need to increase their efforts to assist Tribes in addressing environmental issues as part of the effort to enhance Tribal operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed National EPA Indian Operations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Altering the current structure by creating a national office, whose sole responsibility is Tribal operations, would provide a more consistent and streamlined approach for implementing EPA's Indian Policy. This new Office could also ensure that Tribal input and concerns are heard and integrated into the Agency's ongoing activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA Team identified, in consultation with Tribal representatives to the TOC, key factors, functions and organizational options to consider in establishing the new office. The Agency is seeking suggestions on functions for the Office as well as its appropriate title. Among others, titles such as ``National Office of Indian Affairs'' or ``National Tribal Environmental Management Office'' have been suggested to date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

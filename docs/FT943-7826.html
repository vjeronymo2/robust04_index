			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family Building societies' figures reflect mixed picture - At a Glance Savings inflows into building societies continued their yo-yo pattern last month, with net receipts of Pounds 286m after net withdrawals of Pounds 104m in June, according to figures from the Building Societies Association. Adrian Coles, BSA director-general, said it was not clear that inflows will continue given the strength of competition in the retail savings market. Societies' lending figures reflected a mixed picture and Coles said it was too early to claim a sustained recovery is underway here. New net lending rose to Pounds 1.16bn in July, a slight increase on June's Pounds 1.15bn but up by a more significant 14 per cent on July last year. However net new commitments, which are for loans agreed but not yet made, fell to Pounds 3.22bn down 10 per cent on June's figure.</p>

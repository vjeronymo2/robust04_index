			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Russia issues economic union ultimatum RUSSIA yesterday issued an ultimatum to other former Soviet republics either to join a trade, banking and currency union or face a dangerous regime of trade restrictions and higher prices. Mr Vladimir Mashits, the newly appointed minister for relations with other republics, said Russia had already agreed with Kazakhstan and Belarus to set up a single economic space and rouble zone. Kirghizia would be next on the list. 'With whom else will we sign such an agreement? . . . We'll see,' he said. 'We are ready to have one close group of friends and another not so close.' He said a preferential regime would be open to republics which: Dropped plans to issue their own currencies or surrogate money; Agreed on a system of consultation among their central banks; Resisted re-exporting cheap Russian energy for hard currency. The veiled threat of economic warfare if they did not comply reflects, in part, Russia's desperate need for a clearly defined currency and banking zone to strengthen the rouble. Mr Mashits used the tense relationship with Ukraine to illustrate the dangers of a trade war. He said if Ukraine insisted on charging a new high price for its coal of Rbs1,600 per tonne (as opposed to Rbs200), 'you can imagine what our retaliatory price will be for oil'. Alternatively, Russia could withhold sales of oil to Ukraine, but 'that would ruin her economy and we will stop getting metal, coal and chemical products'. He said his new ministry would deal with a host of practical problems resulting from the union's collapse. These included dividing up Baltic Sea fishing waters, formerly open to all former Soviet citizens. The tough stance also appeared to be aimed at public opinion, which not only bitterly resents the government's harsh economic reforms, but complains that Russia is subsidising other republics with cheap oil while their neighbours plot to wreck the rouble with separate currencies. The combative announcement followed claims by Lithuania on Tuesday that Russia had cut off oil supplies. Although he partially denied the claim, Mr Mashits said that Lithuanians had enough oil, accused them of demanding hard currency for deliveries of fertiliser to Russia and attacked their attempts to take over Soviet army property while demanding the evacuation of homeless troops.

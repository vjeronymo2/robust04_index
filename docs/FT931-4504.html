			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Weill set to regain Shearson brokerage empire for Dollars 1bn MR SANFORD WEILL, the Wall Street entrepreneur who built the Shearson brokerage empire in the 1970s before selling it to American Express, is about to recapture his creation for Dollars 1bn (Pounds 700m). The financial services and travel group, whose image has been tarnished lately by bitter boardroom battles, is understood to be only days away from selling Shearson's retail brokerage and asset management businesses which suffered heavy losses last year. It bought Shearson for Dollars 900m in 1981. Mr Weill, a former American Express president who left the company in 1985, now runs Primerica, the US financial services group which already owns Smith Barney, another broker. The purchase of Shearson would represent a return to the kind of daredevil deal-making that made the 59-year-old Brooklyn native a Wall Street legend in the 1970s. The proposed sale would create a securities powerhouse to rival Merrill Lynch as the biggest broker in the US, with combined annual revenues of more than Dollars 13bn, almost 500 branches and 11,400 brokers. It would also give Primerica ownership of commercial property in Manhattan, including a 40-storey office block and adjacent computer centre. Primerica and American Express yesterday confirmed the Shearson talks. One American Express executive said: 'My sense is that we are almost there. The agreement could happen within the next day or two.' The two companies discussed a similar proposal three years ago, but the talks stalled. Lehman Brothers, the investment banking arm of the Shearson group, has been left out of the present negotiations. It was, however, learnt yesterday that a management buy-out is being discussed by senior executives at Lehman Brothers. American Express insiders think it likely that the group, keen to bolster capital and focus on its core travel and card businesses, will eventually agree to a Lehman buy-out. Mr Weill started on Wall Street as a trading floor clerk for Bear Stearns, forming his own brokerage firm in the 1960s when still in his 20s. After selling Shearson in 1981, he became president of American Express. In 1985, he became one of several presidents to leave during the chairmanship of Mr James Robinson, who was himself forced to resign last month. Mr Weill, whose lawyers were yesterday examining the draft agreement, is a close friend of Mr Harvey Golub, the man who replaced Mr Robinson as chief executive of American Express. It was Mr Weill, a godfather to Mr Golub's son, who hired Mr Golub to run an American Express subsidiary in 1983. American Express executives said Mr Golub had less hesitation in selling Shearson than did Mr Robinson, who had boasted during the 1980s of using Shearson as part of a 'financial services supermarket'. News of the talks was well received by the stock markets. Primerica's share price jumped by Dollars 4 3/4 to close in New York at Dollars 44 3/4 and American Express's rose by Dollars 1 1/8 to finish at Dollars 27 7/8 . Shearson has been a big burden to its parent in recent years. It lost more than Dollars 900m in 1990, and after a brief return to profitability in 1991, racked up a loss of Dollars 116m last year while other US securities firms made big profits. Smith Barney, for example, earned a record Dollars 170m in 1992. If American Express sells the brokerage operations it would be the latest in a series of asset disposals. Only last week it announced plans to raise more than Dollars 1bn by selling more than half of its majority stake in First Data Corporation, the data and transaction processing company.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Bus Length and Access  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4006(b)(1) of the ISTEA amended section 411(a) of the STAA [49 U.S.C. app. 2311(a)] by inserting ``of less than 45 feet on the length of any bus,'' after ``vehicle length limitation.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4006(b)(2) of the ISTEA amended section 412(a)(2) of the STAA [49 U.S.C. app. 2312(a)(2)] by inserting ``motor carrier of passengers'' after ``household goods carriers.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first provision has the effect of requiring States to allow buses with a length of 45 feet or less on the NN and reasonable access routes. The second provision requires States to allow motor carriers of passengers to have the same access off the NN as household goods carriers, i.e., to ``points of loading and unloading.'' In the SNPRM, the FHWA proposed changes to the ``Length'' and ``Reasonable Access'' sections of part 658 to account for these provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments on this proposal were received from the Caltrans and the Department of California Highway Patrol. Both agencies recommended that a final rule include definitions of both ``bus'' and ``motor carrier of passengers'' to ``prevent confusion on the interpretation and application of the regulations.'' The FHWA agrees with this comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The STAA defines a ``commercial motor vehicle'' in part as ``any self-propelled *&blank;*&blank;* vehicle used on the highways in [interstate] commerce principally to transport passengers *&blank;*&blank;* (B) if such vehicle is designed to transport more than 10 passengers, including the driver *&blank;*&blank;*'' (49 U.S.C. app. 2301(1)(B)). While this definition applies only to subchapter I of chapter 32 of title 49, U.S.C., which makes grants available to States that agree to enforce Federal, or compatible State, safety regulations, it is an indication of congressional intent. For purposes of administering the commercial vehicle safety program, ``bus'' was defined in 49 CFR 390.5 as ``any motor vehicle designed, constructed, and or used for the transportation of passengers, including taxicabs.'' The Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 amended the definition of a bus to a ``vehicle designed to transport more than 15 passengers, including the driver *&blank;*&blank;*.'' (49 U.S.C. app. 2503(1)(B)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intent of Congress, as expressed in the ISTEA, is to guarantee national route availability and reasonable access for ``buses'' not exceeding 45 feet in length. Since virtually all States already allowed 40-foot buses to operate Statewide prior to the ISTEA, the number of passengers the vehicle is designed to carry is not an issue, simply the establishment of a national standard length. Accordingly, this final rule will use the most generic of the definitions already established, that found in 49 CFR 390.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the term ``motor carrier of passengers'' has not previously been defined, this type of operation can generally be characterized as belonging to at least one of three groups: (1) Common carriers that offer service on regular (and sometimes on irregular) routes, (2) contract carriers that provide charter service to groups, or (3) private carriers that do not serve the public but use buses as part of some other enterprise. Someone who uses a 45-foot bus for recreational or other non-business purposes would not qualify as a motor carrier of passengers. For this final rule ``motor carrier of passengers'' is defined as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Motor Carrier of Passengers <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _is a common, contract, or private carrier using a bus to provide commercial transportation of passengers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The list of definitions contained in 23 CFR 658.5 has been amended to include this definition. In addition, the provisions of &sect;658.13 (Length) and &sect;658.19 (Reasonable Access) have been amended to account for these provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Lengths of Trailers and Semitrailers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fruehauf Trailer Corporation (Fruehauf) commented that the FHWA should clarify the methods by which length is determined for trailers which are part of a multi-unit vehicle subject to the freeze. Because of the attention focused on the LCV length issue by the freeze, Fruehauf contends that it is important that all States (and enforcement agencies) have a uniform understanding of how the length of the individual units is to be determined. Fruehauf's specific concern is with full trailers used in LCV's which are actually made up of a semitrailer and a converter dolly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a Notice of Interpretation (NOI) published on March 13, 1987, at 52 FR 7834, the FHWA addressed the issue of trailer or semitrailer length, as part of an overall discussion of length and width exclusive devices. The first length interpretation is relevant here. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The length of a semitrailer equipped with an upper coupler (mates with a truck tractor fifth wheel) and a full trailer (with either a permanently mounted dolly or equipped with a converter dolly) is to be measured from the front vertical plane of the foremost transverse load carrying structure to the rear vertical plane of the rearmost transverse load carrying structure. The towbar of a full trailer is excluded from the length measurement (of that trailer) since, technically, it carries no load, but rather it is the means by which the trailer unit is drawn. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The length of any two or more units subject to the freeze requirements of section 4006 is to be measured from the front of the foremost transverse load-carrying structure of the first cargo-carrying unit to the rear of the rearmost transverse load-carrying structure of the last such unit. The upper coupler on a semitrailer is not to be included in the length determination of these units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

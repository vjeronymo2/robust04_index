			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> A MELANCHOLY SLIDE INTO MEMORY FROM DENNIS POTTER  </P> <P> An aging husband and wife enter a suite in a frayed seaside resort hotel. They  are hoping to bring back the romantic past, specifically their daring  premarital fling in this very same suite nearly half a century earlier.  </P> <P> Dennis Potter's "Cream in Your Coffee" is drenched in melancholy that is  genuine, poignant and ironic. The 90-minute British feature, an L.A.-area  broadcast premiere, lights up the "Dennis Potter Showcase" tonight at 10 on  KCET Channel 28.  </P> <P> Dame Peggy Ashcroft and Lional Jeffries, the brittle old couple whose love has  soured, are achingly authentic as relics of a sort beating their boats against  the tide. What catapults the story is its split focus between the past and the  present.  </P> <P> The script continually segues to the couple as innocent young lovers (Shelagh  McLeod and Peter Chelsom) enjoying a tryst at the hotel in 1934. Despite the  golden haze of their frolic and their undying love, you see the emotional  creases in these people that inform the acrimony at the end of their lives.  </P> <P> The hotel -- a perfect Potter touch -- is also a major player in "Cream in Your  Coffee" (a hit period song providing lyrical irony). The contrast between the  lush, glamorous 1930s hotel by the seashore and its raggedy descent into an  echoing resort for the geriatric set is a wicked metaphor for the whole story.  There's also a devilish portrayal by Martin Shaw of a cad who's one sweet  crooner.  </P> <P> The production's last scene, on a punk rock/ballroom floor with Jeffries'  balding husband deliriously caught in a time warp, is a leave-you-limp knockout  punch, dynamically staged by director Gavin Millar.  </P> <P> Finally, "Pennies From Heaven"-Potter catches the glaze of memory as it takes  over your life. "That's the trouble," the husband laments at one point.  "Everything is as if it was yesterday." RAY LOYND  </P></p>

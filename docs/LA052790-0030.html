			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> RESORT STUDIES THE FLIP SIDE OF ROCKY MOUNTAIN HIGH;  </P> <P> HEALTH: ONE OF FOUR VISITORS TO COLORADO MOUNTAINS IS AFFLICTED BY ALTITUDE  SICKNESS. TAKING A FEW DAYS TO REACH HIGHER GROUND IS EFFECTIVE PREVENTION,  DOCTORS SAY.  </P> <P> Altitude sickness afflicts one of four visitors to Colorado's mountains. Its  effects range from nausea and headaches to death, according to a study at this  Rocky Mountain resort.  </P> <P> One victim was Howard Shapiro, a 40-year-old New York City lawyer. He flew from  Newark, N.J., on a Monday morning in February, arrived in Denver about noon and  drove to this ski resort at above 9,000 feet altitude.  </P> <P> "I became very dizzy, lightheaded. At the onset I was short of breath, but that  seemed to abate pretty quickly. The headache went from mild to severe . . . and  then the constant vomiting," Shapiro said.  </P> <P> "At some point in time, dying seemed the lesser of two evils," he said.  </P> <P> In the morning, at the resort's Snake River Health Center, he was asked to  participate in an experimental program. He was placed in a red Gamow bag, which  resembles a backpacker's tube tent. Air pressure in the bag is increased.  </P> <P> "We take him down to higher pressure and lower altitude. It's a simulated drop  from Keystone's 9,300 feet to about 4,300 feet," said University of Colorado  graduate student Jim Kasic, who is involved in the study by the Colorado  Altitude Research Institute based at the clinic.  </P> <P> In two hours, Shapiro could eat and drink again.  </P> <P> Bengtake Jaurin, 35, a microbiologist from Umea, Sweden, complained of the same  symptoms after arriving at Frisco, altitude 9,036 feet. He went to his room and  was found dead the next morning, Jan. 19. An autopsy showed he died of  respiratory failure due to high-altitude pulmonary edema, an abnormal  accumulation of fluid in the lungs.  </P> <P> "The problem involves dozens of millions of people -- 13 million visitors to  Colorado alone each year," said Dr. Charles Houston, founder of the institute.  </P> <P> Altitude sickness has been found to afflict 23% of those surveyed so far, he  said.  </P> <P> "It doesn't mean they're incapacitated," said Houston, of Burlington, Vt. "But  with simple measures, we think we can stop at least a dozen preventable deaths  a year from altitude sickness in Colorado. Make that 12 to 20 deaths that are  preventable," Houston said.  </P> <P> The institute's study, staffed by graduate students and supervised by  doctor-board members of the nonprofit Snake River Health Clinic, began last  June. About 1,700 adults and teen-agers have been interviewed at Keystone ski  resort so far.  </P> <P> "No one has looked at the 8,000-to-10,000-foot level and Mr. and Mrs. Joe  Public, how well or how poorly they tolerate altitude, particularly if they  have heart or lung disease," Houston said.  </P> <P> He estimated the clinic's research could save each of the state's major ski  resorts $3 million to $5 million a year in lost income and litigation. He said  losses to the state's ski industry because of high-altitude sickness approach  $55 million a season.  </P> <P> Cathy Kruzic, spokeswoman for Colorado Ski Country USA, said the figures would  be hard to verify. During a recent meeting, she asked chief executive officers  from the state's ski areas about the estimates.  </P> <P> "They were extremely surprised by that figure and would certainly want  additional information to qualify those numbers because it's not something that  has been of major concern in terms of lost revenues to the areas," Kruzic said.  </P> <P> Houston, 76, began research on altitude while a mountain climber in the  Himalayas in the 1930s and 1940s and with the Navy during World War II.  </P> <P> Houston said altitude sickness is a mixture of problems that often occur  together:  </P> <P> * Acute mountain sickness, which includes headache, nausea, vomiting, shortness  of breath, fatigue and sleep disturbance.  </P> <P> * High-altitude pulmonary edema, water accumulation in the lungs that can be  fatal.  </P> <P> * High-altitude cerebral edema, in which water accumulates on the brain. It  also can be fatal.  </P> <P> Symptoms can be treated with medication, but the disease can be prevented,  Houston said.  </P> <P> "Prevention is to take a couple of days to get here, spend a couple days in  Denver (at mile-high altitude) and then come on up here" to 9,300 feet, he  said.  </P> <P> Houston explained what happens to the body within an hour of arriving at a high  altitude:  </P> <P> First, breaths come deeper and faster. Second, the heart beats faster and puts  out more blood per stroke. Third, bone marrow begins making more red blood  cells to carry oxygen.  </P> <P> In addition, body cells undergo enzyme changes, and the kidneys excrete more  urine to get rid of excess bicarbonate. "There is something going on in just  about every organ" as the body tries to adjust, he said.  </P> <P> Clinic medical director Dick Nicholas said acclimatization generally takes a  night at an intermediate altitude.  </P> <P> "We get people taking the all-night bus from Kansas City. They get on the bus  Thursday afternoon and get off here Friday. That's not enough time for most,"  Nicholas said.  </P></p>

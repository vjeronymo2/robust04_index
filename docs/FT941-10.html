			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Westland bought Westland's battle for survival looked almost over last night after GKN revealed it had captured 54.4 per cent, just 0.6 percentage point below the level it needs to declare the offer unconditional. Earlier in the day, GKN lifted its hostile offer from 290p to 335p a share, valuing Westland at Pounds 577m. Turnover came to 26m shares, the heaviest in the market yesterday, with the price gaining 8 at 333p. A Pounds 52.5m rights issue from Simon Engineering had been well flagged by the company and the shares slipped just 3 to 118 1/2 p. The five-for-nine cash call at 100p a share will be used to cut debt and bolster the balance sheet. Oil major British Petroleum fell 7 1/2 to 349p after Merrill Lynch joined the ranks of analysts cutting forecasts following the decision by Opec to maintain its oil production quota until the end of the year. Merrill's oil analyst in New York, Mr Gus Fliakos, dropped his estimate for the average price of Brent crude by almost Dollars 3 a barrel to Dollars 14.60. As a result he reduced his forecast for the company's profits for this year by Pounds 275m to Pounds 945m and his earnings per share estimate by 5p to 17.4p. BAT Industries moved ahead 7 to 448p after several marketmakers decided that the stock was oversold and worth picking up for the 6 per cent prospective yield. One analyst pointed out that the stock had underperformed the FT-A All-Share Index by 16 per cent over the past quarter. Pharmaceutical group Zeneca shed 18 to 727p, partly as the stock caught up with the slide elsewhere in the sector and also on concern over pressure on mail order sales of Zestril, its high blood pressure treatment, from rival Merck. Mining group RTZ slipped 11 to 833p. BZW argued that the release of a huge Japanese stockpile of copper on April 1 would have a 'major impact on the copper price'. Growing speculation that Great Universal Stores is poised to buy back a chunk of its equity saw the shares rise 10 to 591p. Dealers heard more rumours of activity by the company in the gilts market in preparation for the move. If GUS were to buy back a stake of around 15 per cent, the cost would be close to Pounds 1bn, a figure well covered by the company's estimated Pounds 1.7bn cash pile. Talk of improving margins at its B&amp;Q home improvement division, together with some positive noises from brokers, lifted Kingfisher 12 to 569p. Speculation that PepsiCo, the US soft drinks giant, is about to buy out its partners in the Britvic distribution consortium for around Pounds 350m was again heard and impacted on the shares concerned. Bass, which owns a 45 per cent share, had a roller coaster day, tumbling 12 at the outset and then rallying 19 as the Britvic story gathered strength, before fading towards the end to close a net 2 up at 535p. Turnover was 4.6m. Whitbread, which owns 22.5 per cent, slid 9 to 516p, with some worries over the company's next strategic move, while Allied-Lyons, also owner of 22.5 per cent, lost 4 at 553p. British Bio-technology jumped 20 to 490p on the view that its issue of warrants exercisable at the end of next year at 525p offered a cheap way into the stock. Dealers said James Capel, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley were all recommending the stock. Health products and photo processing group London International improved on an announcement from the Department of Trade and Industry that price controls on condoms would be lifted. However, the shares closed a net 2 down at 146p. Insurance brokers, which generate the majority of their earnings in dollars, responded to the weakness of sterling against the US currency. Leaders Willis Corroon and Sedgwick put on 2 at 228p and 208p respectively. Meanwhile, Hogg Group benefited from an upbeat statement with its figures and rose 7 to 141p. The insurance sector was restrained by the market and, to a certain extent, by the news that Norwich Union had suspended its sales staff. However, most stocks recovered from their troughs as bargain hunters moved in. Prudential closed 3 easier at 309p. A widely rumoured rights offer from Stakis saw the hotel group look to raise Pounds 67m, intended for selective hotel purchases. The one-for-four at 72p a share was well received, and the stock steadied at 84p, off a penny on the day. Rank Organisation said it was quitting the video and audio rack jobbing business in the US at a one-off cost of Dollars 75m. The shares lost 6 at 395p. One analyst said: 'It is a relief that they have got out, but why has it taken so long? The business has been losing money for years.' The wobbling property sector saw further retreats by the leading stocks and the expected nervous debut by Capital Shopping Centres. The shares, which received only 14.4 per cent acceptances for its public offering, came to the market at 230p and languished a good 20p off for most of the day, closing at 208p. Turnover was 4.3m. BOC shed 12 to 708p, some dealers suggesting that the stock was due for a correction. Waste group Shanks &amp; McEwan rose 6 to 87p after the company announced its strategic review. Analysts were relieved that there was no mention of a reduced dividend. But Mr Philip Morrish of Smith New Court said a question mark remained over the EU directive on importing waste, which comes into effect in May, and it was too early to turn positive. Newcomer to the market Inspec started trading at 178p, well above its 160p issue price, and ended at 185p, with Hoare Govett advising institutions that the speciality chemicals group was worth 200p a share in the short term.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with academician Boris Nikolayevich Laskorin, </F> conducted by Igor Saltykov: "The Living Water Is Close to Death"]    [Text] It was not an argument that erupted in the  academician's office, more like a little seminar on the subject  of what it is that threatens our survival. Many countries around  the world are having fits of ecological irresponsibility. The  extraction of gold, silver, diamonds, rare metals, timber, oil,  gas and coal is comparable, in terms of the effects of its  merciless haste, only with the effects of the Ice Age. Fertile  soils are being impoverished.    But the thing that is most tragic in its unnoticed frequency  is the increasing absence of living water. Water is dying. And  the death of water turned this seminar into a lecture/interview  with Russian Academy of Sciences member Boris Nikolayevich  Laskorin, chairman of the Russian Academy of Sciences Commission  on the Protection of Natural Waters.    Laskorin: It is hard to believe that, of all the  other natural resources, it is water that is being subjected to  cruel and harmful effects on the largest scale. Today it seems  that it is only being protected in wells. Yet it is being  recklessly poisoned in rivers, in lakes and even in the seas.  There are many sad examples of this in countries around the  world. It is embarrassing to talk about the Aral Sea -- it is  dying. The rivers of Europe and America are being mercilessly  polluted from source to mouth, and our own Volga River and the  limitless Siberian rivers are no exception. True, there is no  way to cover up individual disasters -- massive discharges of  industrial waste or fecal sludge. Condemnations are issued and  resolutions adopted -- urgent in name, indefinite in  implementation. There have been cases not only of bans on  drinking the polluted liquid, but even swimming in it. But as  for the day-to-day, implacable degradation of water's living  qualities, it is not merely forgotten -- no one even notices it.    But the time has come to protect living water as if it were  our greatest treasure. And to begin using it efficiently and  conservatively at home and in industry. Otherwise no amount of  doctors or pharmacies will be able to help us.    True, traditionally Moscow's water supply has been among the  most drinkable as measured by world standards. The water  supplied to the city is fully in compliance with public health  and technical standards and not only meets but in several cases  actually exceeds the quality of aqueous "raw material" in many  large cities in Europe and America.    However, I should note that the standard in use around the  world includes only a few requirements, and excessively general  ones at that, regarding the quality of water sources for all  uses. Thus far nowhere do we find clear definitions, and hence  no implementation, of standards for two basic concepts:  household water, consumed for purely natural needs -- washing  people and clothes, washing dishes, etc. -- and drinking water,  i.e. water that is suitable for internal consumption.  Furthermore, at this point there is no clear definition of what  is "drinkable," nor are there any clear-cut standards and  criteria, and therefore the concept is sometimes interpreted in  a rather arbitrary fashion, depending on views, needs, funding,  etc.    I am convinced that the time has come to commence objective  definition of standards and creation of an appropriate state  standard for drinking water -- water that is, I reiterate, for  internal consumption. Whereas in Moscow total household water  consumption is 500-550 liters per capita per day, drinking water  consumption is only 2-3 liters. It is clear that that much  consumption does not require a separate water supply. In order  to ensure the necessary degree of purification, particularly  under emergency conditions, I would recommend home  installations, well, not installations, actually individual  devices that attach to faucets and guarantee high-quality, truly  drinkable water every time. And in the event of accidents the  public should be provided with high-quality bottled water.    Saltykov: Which is already being sold at sidewalk  kiosks and in stores. The price of a one-liter bottle is  R1,500-2,000 [rubles]. Professor Viktor Doyenin has calculated  that his pay is insufficient to pay for food and transportation,  and is not even enough for tea and watery soups. Not for his  whole family. Not even just for himself.    Laskorin: That cannot be! Incidentally, we are not  selling domestically-produced water. This is obviously imported  water. Yet transportation overhead is sizable just to transport  water within Moscow, much less from Europe. The same goes for  the technical expense of purification, which would not justify  such high prices. If we were to start up production of bottled  drinking water locally then it would be affordable not only to  highly-paid segments of the population, but also to pensioners  and school children.    Saltykov: Then allow me to read this November  ITAR-TASS report: "Jordan has purchased from Russia devices that  are without parallel anywhere in the world and which allow  ordinary water to be used for the most unexpected purposes at  minimal cost. Tap water processed by a miniature electric  activator becomes a powerful disinfectant and an effective  medicine for many diseases, all without the addition of any  chemicals." Prior to this interview I visited about 10 stores  here in the capital, and no one had ever heard of these  "activators."    Laskorin: That is unscrupulous, misleading  advertising. Electrochemical processing simply cannot produce  that quality of water. Unfortunately, even worse "sleight of  hand" is being practiced. For example, in Moscow drinking water  is being used in industry for production-related purposes, and  in large amounts. Such use has repeatedly been banned, but the  bans are ignored. Furthermore, many Moscow enterprises --  industrial ones, not food-service enterprises -- are drilling  deep wells without any request for permission or authorization  whatsoever, pumping artesian well water for industrial needs --  the delicious, pure, living water that could serve as our most  affordable drinking water supply. But even for that purpose we  would have to calculate precisely how much of it we could use so  as not to deprive our descendants of their inheritance.    Saltykov: So where are we going to get drinking  water? True, just a quarter of a century ago there was talk  about using Lake Baikal, and there was some discussion about how  it could share its unique resources with the European part of  the Soviet Union.    Laskorin: Unfortunately, the struggle to keep Lake  Baikal pure is not over yet. Yet it represents 20 percent of the  world's supply of very clean water, and 80 percent of the supply  in the former USSR. Moreover, it has a unique and literally  inimitable chemical composition. It could be bottled and shipped  to Moscow even now. The obstacle is the cost of transportation,  which is rising faster than inflation.    Meanwhile the dispute over the use of a major paper combine  that pollutes Lake Baikal not only continues, but is actually  heating up. Over the last 25 years the decision to shut it down  has been made many times. Yet now it has been privatized and  continues to successfully pollute Lake Baikal "privately." Plus,  the "Baikal Commission" was established on the quiet and has  been granted the right to allow private corporations to develop  the combine, expanding production rather than curtailing it.    Saltykov: And so, Boris Nikolayevich, Lake Baikal  is not accessible and the cost of bottled water is more than a  majority of Russia's citizens can afford. Does that mean that  city dwellers -- and perhaps soon Muscovites as well -- are  going to have to go to the country and drill wells?    Laskorin: There is a solution. The drinking water  that flows to each apartment should receive additional  purification. The first steps have been taken with the  manufacture of Rodnik [Spring] individual filtration units. A  filter of activated silvered charcoal -- the silver used is in  very small quantities -- kills hordes of bacteria and completely  removes organic, toxic and carcinogenic substances and heavy  metals from water.    Saltykov: But they are still beyond the reach of a  majority of the population. In November a household products  store not far from your institution was selling the Rodnik  filter for more than R6,000.    Laskorin: But what do 10 eggs cost nowadays? On  our road to a free market we have run into a storm of  distortions. But even if you take that madness into account,  right now, in March, a Rodnik should not cost more than R3,000  in a state-owned store. And the Moscow government might even  offer a special price to pensioners, students and impoverished  teachers and instructors at higher educational institutions.  There is definitely a need for immediate intervention by the  Ministry of Health as well in order to perfect these little  devices, approve them and demand that they be produced by  state-owned industry immediately, even if only by a couple of  the 2,000 idled defense plants.    The things we have discussed are urgent needs. However, so  as  not just to prevent death from dead water but also to lay the  ground for major efforts on the living sources, deputies in the  Federation Council and the State Duma should quickly draft and  approve clear-cut state legislation on preservation of natural  drinking water resources, the inexpensive production of drinking  water, and the right of our country's citizens not only to land  but also to clean water. Primary attention should focus on  children's institutions, maternity homes, hospitals, schools and  other educational institutions, and pensioners. And we should  demand that scientists establish a definition of drinking water  that is understandable to every citizen, every deputy and every  administrator.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Sirdar hit by worldwide slump in hand-knitting A sharp increase in operating losses in hand-knitting yarns restrained pre-tax profits at Sirdar, the textiles group, in the year to June 30. At the pre-tax level, they slipped 3 per cent to Pounds 5.57m (Pounds 5.73m), though it was pointed out that, without the additional pension cost of about Pounds 350,000 arising from the latest actuarial valuation, profits would have risen 3 per cent. Mr Gerry Lumb, chairman and managing director, said he was 'disappointed' with the result. He said that hand-knitting as a pastime had slumped worldwide in less than a generation. This decline in knitters in turn led to fewer shops selling yarns. As a result, Sirdar has invested Pounds 3m - mostly in working capital, though some on machinery - to expand Tilsa Yarns into the production of lower-margin Repco yarns for supply to knitwear makers. These machine-knitting yarns now account for two-thirds of the division's output. Operating losses in the division were Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 93,000) on turnover of Pounds 20m (Pounds 20.4m). Profits in the other textile products division grew to Pounds 6.74m (Pounds 6.08m) on turnover up at Pounds 34.2m (Pounds 31.5m). Burmatex , the carpet business, lifted sales and profits by about 6 per cent, while Eversure, which makes curtains, raised turnover 10 per cent and profits 30 per cent. The Tilsa investment lifted borrowings to Pounds 5.5m for 'modest' gearing of 17 per cent. Earnings edged ahead, after a lower tax charge, to 6.9p (6.89p) per share and the final dividend is held at 3.7p for a higher total of 5.42p (5.35p).</p>

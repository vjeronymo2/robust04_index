			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- A record number of  Japanese Diet members have signed a letter to be sent to the UN  chief calling for freedom for Nobel peace prize winner Aung San  Suu Kyi and civilian rule in Myanmar [Burma], the Burmese  Association in Japan said Thursday [31 March].    Of a total of 763 Diet members, 403 have already put their  signatures to a petition to be sent to UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali, the association said in a press release.  Similar signature campaigns are being carried out in 108  countries around the world, it said.    A copy of the letter said the legislators will urge the  United Nations to do all in its power to see that Suu Kyi and  all political leaders are unconditionally released. It also  called for a "swift and complete implementation of a transition  to civilian rule."    The group hopes to receive 500 signatures of Diet members  through the good offices of United Social Democratic Party  leader Satsuki Eda by the time the letter is sent, said  association president Win Naing.    This is the second such letter to Butrus-Ghali. The first  plea by 374 Diet members was delivered to the secretary  general's office in March 1993 by Eda.    Last April 422 Diet members urged the government to put  pressure on Myanamr for Suu Kyi's release.    A founder of the National League for Democracy (NLD) which  won the 1990 election by a landslide, Suu Kyi has been under  house arrest since July 1989. She was scheduled to be freed  next July but the ruling military junta extended her detention  period for another year.</p>

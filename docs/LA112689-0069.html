			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL SHOWDOWN  </P> <P> At some point, Southern California must decide whether every last fine natural  area is going to be converted to houses, condos, office buildings, shopping  malls and parking lots. A perfectly logical spot for making that decision, for  drawing the line, is the Santa Rosa Plateau in southern Riverside County.  </P> <P> The 15,000-acre plateau in the Santa Ana Mountains south of Murrieta has been  recognized by UNESCO as a biosphere reserve, one of three such special places  in California. The Nature Conservancy has bought 3,100 acres for preservation.  The plateau is one of California's last intact enclaves of native grassland and  Engelmann oaks. Mountain lions prowl the plateau and golden eagles nest there.  Occidental College botany professor Jon Keeley told The Times' Jenifer Warren:  "This is not just a neat place; It is an extremely special place with  ecological value that extends far beyond the Riverside County line."  </P> <P> Developer Won Sang Yoo also believes Santa Rosa Plateau is a special place. He  owns 3,855 acres there and wants to build a new community called Santa Rosa  Springs. The development would include thousands of homes, commercial centers,  schools and roads.  </P> <P> Yoo's firm, Ranpac Communities, has gone to great lengths to plan the new town  so it will blend into the unique environment. About 400 acres would be parks  and golf courses, providing corridors for wildlife to roam. Only a handful of  the 2,400 oak trees would be removed. Some 2,000 acres would remain as passive  open space. This would be "a state-of-the-art project where people live as part  of the natural environment," said David Dillon, a Ranpac official.  </P> <P> Ranpac's efforts are commendable. But the fact is, the plateau will remain  natural and wild, or it will not. No amount of compromising, or of painting  houses in earth tones, will overcome the impact of development. If the Santa  Rosa Plateau is graded and paved, perhaps no other natural area in Southern  California is safe. This is something the Riverside County Board of Supervisors  must consider as it begins debating this week a proposed community plan that  would determine what, if any, level of development is tolerable at Santa Rosa  Plateau. The area's supervisor, Walt Abraham, says the ideal would be purchase  of the land for a regional park, but "I come from a world of reality, and we're  not made of money."  </P> <P> But the question should be: Can Southern California really afford to squander  what little is left of its precious natural heritage?  </P></p>

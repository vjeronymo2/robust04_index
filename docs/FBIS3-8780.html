			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Simona Popescu note: "The Romanian Intelligence Service </F> Commission: Virgil Magureanu Appears Before It"]    [Text] During its session yesterday [9 March] the  Supervisory Commission of the Activity of the Romanian  Intelligence Service [SRI] heard [SRI Director] Virgil  Magureanu, who presented the report of the institution that he  heads on "certain leaks from within the SRI and accusations  against certain persons or groups of persons whose actions might  affect the national security."    SRI investigations conducted thus far "indicate that this  institution has not been and is not involved in the mass media  dissemination of the respective materials" (materials published  by the ROMANIA MARE weekly, which contained accusations of  espionage for foreign secret services -- our editorial note).  However, as the report points out, the guilt has been passed  onto certain former employees of the counterespionage or foreign  intelligence services. In conclusion, the SRI report stresses  that "after studying and examining the materials published in  ROMANIA MARE, it has been ascertained that certain data sent to  legal consumers were the basis of articles published by Corneliu  Vadim Tudor [owner and chief editor of ROMANIA MARE weekly]";  consequently, the documents were not appropriated from SRI  archives, but were lost en route from one institution to another.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / The Property Market: The Iranian connection - Vanessa Houlder on a duo making its mark in London Rotch Properties, the investment vehicle of the Iranian Tchenguiz family, is one of the lesser-known property buyers to have emerged in the past three years of UK recession. Rotch, and its 50 per cent-owned sister company Wyn-Ro Properties, has bought more than Pounds 100m of property in the past 18 months, taking its portfolio to about Pounds 400m. It says it will sign another Pounds 40m of deals in the next few weeks. 'We think this is the best buying opportunity for 20 years,' says Adrian Goldsmith, a Rotch executive. Rotch, which is ultimately owned by a family-owned company incorporated in Panama, is run by two Tchenguiz brothers: Vincent and Robert, both in their 30s. Vincent, who used to work at Prudential Bache and Shearson Lehman Brothers, describes himself as a financier; Robert is the deal-maker. They started Rotch in 1982 with the help of a bank guarantee from their father Victor Tchenguiz, a wealthy property owner who fled Iran after the Shah's downfall in 1979. Their first purchase was a Pounds 50,000 flat in Marble Arch, London. They concentrated on residential development until 1985 when they bought an option on an old biscuit warehouse in Hammersmith, west London. Together with Scottish Amicable, they built a 215,000 sq ft office development, known as Windsor Plaza. From 1988, they switched their emphasis to investment. Their biggest deal was the acquisition of Sea Containers House, a 420,000 sq ft building on London's south bank. This building and several others were later absorbed by Wyn-Ro, a company Rotch set up with Allied Lyons Pension Fund in 1989. For a low-profile company, Rotch has demonstrated a taste for some high-profile deals. Their most conspicuous and (for the moment) the least successful deal was the acquisition in mid-1991 of South Quay Plaza 3, a 210,000 sq ft building on the waterfront in London's Docklands. Wyn-Ro paid the receivers Pounds 37m, but secured a three-year rental guarantee from the banks. Rotch dismayed the Docklands market by offering South Quay Plaza 3 to tenants at the (then) knock-down price of Pounds 10 a sq ft. The acquisition, which is still unlet, is described as 'a mistake' by Vincent Tchenguiz. His brother, however, defends it as 'the best building in the Docklands outside Canary Wharf. We are still keen on the Docklands,' he says. Another prominent and probably more successful deal was the acquisition of Lunar and Apollo House, a government-occupied building in Croydon for Pounds 46m, equivalent to a yield of 11 per cent. MEPC's decision to sell the building (on the grounds it had no growth potential) provoked criticism from Mr Harry Hyams, a large MEPC shareholder who thought the building had being sold for a bargain. Rotch has also bought a string of smaller buildings in the past 18 months, in places as diverse as Dover, St Pancras, Brighton, Harrow, Plymouth, Liverpool, Birmingham and Barry, south Wales. The aim of these acquisitions was to buy high-yielding property let to blue-chip tenants, the rental income of which would cover the debt. Tax factors also played a big part in these deals. Rotch believes that the tax benefits associated with the depreciation of plant and machinery are often undervalued. The twin constraints on Rotch's acquisition programme are the difficulty of finding the right buildings and obtaining finance. 'If the product and source of funds were there we would do another Pounds 100m of deals,' says Vincent Tchenguiz. The company's principle banker is Sanwa; GE Capital and Norwich Union have also been prominent sources of long-term funds. Rotch would like to attract more institutional funding. 'We are looking to refinance our borrowings through institutions rather than banks,' says Vincent Tchenguiz. He would also like to raise some equity from the institutions and plans to seek a stock market listing in a couple of years. Rotch borrows up to 100 per cent of the cost of its acquisitions, but it is unconcerned about the high level of debt it is amassing. 'We are not worried about our gearing. You could be 200 per cent geared provided you have cash flow to support your debt,' says Robert Tchenguiz. But Rotch's high gearing has resulted in the shrinkage of its net asset value during the steep downturn in the property market over the past few years. The combined net asset value of Rotch and Wyn-Ro was Pounds 143m in the year to May 1991. The Tchenguiz brothers say it has now fallen to Pounds 42m. This valuation of its portfolio underestimates the true value of the buildings' income streams in the view of Vincent Tchenguiz, who is a critical of UK valuation techniques. He believes that once the current phase of forced sales is over, property yields could fall by between 30-40 per cent. Property has lurched from a period of being over-valued to a period of being under-valued, he says. 'Every period of exaggeration is followed by another period of exaggeration.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Zakharchenko] </F>   [Text] Seoul May 23 TASS -- A recent proposal made by the  Russian Government to convene an international conference on  security and a nuclear-free status on the Korean Peninsula shows  Russia's intention to promote the settlement of the problem,  said President of South Korea Kim Yong-sam in an interview with  Russian journalists accredited in Seoul. The president spoke in  the run up to his visit to Moscow scheduled for June 1-4.    Moscow officials believe that in connection with North  Korea's readiness to secede from the Nuclear Non-proliferation  Treaty, the situation must be discussed at a multilateral  conference with the participation of Russia, China, the United  States, Japan, North Korea, South Korea and representatives from  the United Nations and IAEA. Welcoming this proposal, the  Korean president said that since at this stage and in connection  with its nuclear aspect measures are being taken jointly by the  United Nations and the IAEA, this proposal should be regarded  taking into account possible developments of the situation and  the position of other interested sides. "Probably, it will take  some time to realise whether the conference suggested by Russia  will be a means of the settlement of the problem," Kim Yong-sam  said.    He pointed out that this problem is of great importance for  peace on the Korean Peninsula, in the north-east Asia and in the  whole world. He believes that Russia is abiding by a principle  position, coming out against the creation of nuclear weapons in  North Korea, and therefore, upcoming talks at a summit level in  Moscow will make it possible to discuss ways of cooperation  between Russia and South Korea in this direction.    Asked by ITAR-TASS what message the South Korean president  would like to give to his North Korean counterpart, taking  advantage of this interview, Kim Yong-sam pointed out that if  North Korea really wishes peace and unification on the Korean  Peninsula, firstly, it should stop nuclear developments and  secondly, begin an open dialogue with the south, rather than  attempt to resolve Korean problems through the United States  only. The termination of the nuclear programme would be both a  means of survival for North Korea itself and a way of ensuring  peace on the Korean Peninsula, Kim Yong-sam said.</p>

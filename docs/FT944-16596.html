			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: US influences drive shares ahead at the close - Market report Excellent trading results from some of the big names in US industry gave a final boost yesterday to a London stock market already looking confident in early trading. The FT-SE 100 Share Index closed 40.7 up at 3,073, spurred on by the December futures contract on the Index which closed comfortably above 3,100. Institutional buyers came into the equity market towards the close as Wall Street's opening strength put 40 points on the Dow in UK hours and activated limit restriction on index-linked trades. The indications of a resurgent US economy drew further encouragement from firmness in Federal bonds, implying that inflation worries had not been reawakened ahead of Friday's important statistics on US industrial production. London was a little less sure of itself than the gain in the Footsie suggested. Until Wall Street opened, the gain on the Index was only around 25 points and trading volumes moderate. In the final hour of trading blue chip stocks swept ahead behind a strong US dollar. Concerns over inflationary pressures in the UK will be tested this morning when the announcement of the September retail price index will be followed by data on average earnings and unit wage costs. Analysts have been impressed by the rally in UK bonds but remain uncertain over likely trends in German and US bond markets. Second line issues were somewhat left behind in the late rise in the stock market. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index was content with a gain on the day of 24.1 for a closing reading of 3,506.9. Non-Footsie business made up nearly 58 per cent of yesterday's total, at the lower end of average daily trading patterns. Private investors, traditionally active in the second line issues, have been unwilling to trade in equities in recent months. The return of Wall Street to fully active trading after the Columbus Day break, which closed the Federal bond markets, was reflected in a similar return to normal business levels in London. The Seaq total of 662.3m shares in London yesterday was around 36 per cent up on the previous session, although retail business remained satisfactory at Pounds 1.42bn in Monday's session. Oil shares, although still firm, continued to respond calmly to events in the Middle East. The strongest gains came in those UK companies where profits are most closely linked to the fortunes of the US currency. Glaxo, HSBC and Unilever were all firm spots. An exception was Cadbury-Schweppes, upset by news that Virgin, Mr Richard Branson's airline and retail group, plans to launch a cola drink, in association with a North American group; Cadbury, jointly with Coca-Cola, produces Coke in the UK market. A generally favourable reading of the IG Metall union's decision on the impending pay round benefited UK construction stocks with exposure in Germany. Consumer stocks showed little nervousness ahead of tomorrow's retail price statistics, and leading store groups such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Sears made progress. These sectors have suffered severely in the recent shakeout and were seen as in line for a rally. However, trading volumes in these shares was modest yesterday, as institutions preferred the international blue chips. The advance on Wall Street was welcomed by those UK analysts who have pointed to the narrowing of the gap between the New York and London markets and identified it as a factor favourable to UK equities. But some pointed to the unwillingness of UK government bond prices to share in the general advance yesterday, noting that recovery in UK bonds is still seen as the necessary driving force behind the keenly-awaited upturn in share prices before the end of this year.</p>

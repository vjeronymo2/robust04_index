			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Council will cut the pay of teachers who reject tests CONSERVATIVE-controlled Westminster City Council is planning to dock the pay of head teachers and teachers who refuse to co-operate with the national curriculum tests, due to start in secondary schools next week. The council's approach angered the National Association of Head Teachers, which will be addressed today by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, while other teachers' unions suggested it was unnecessarily provocative. The three largest unions have all voted to boycott the tests for this year. A letter from Westminster's director of education to all the city's governing bodies and headteachers says: 'Head teachers who refuse to co-operate in carrying out national curriculum testing and teachers who refuse to follow a reasonable instruction to do so should have deductions made from their salary.' It adds: 'Even though teachers might be working normally in other ways, a refusal to co-operate in assessment and testing would still be in breach of contract and pay deductions should be made.' Westminster's line is more aggressive than the lenient conditions recommended by Mr Patten last month, which did not mention pay deductions or any other disciplinary action. He said heads would have performed their legal duties if they 'gave a clear lead that the professional course is to administer the tests', and 'satisfied themselves that teachers have been reminded of their duty to administer the tests'. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: 'Westminster's letter is inaccurate and requires heads to take on an obligation to deliver the impossible.' The NAHT would challenge any salary deductions, he said. He added that in the 'vast majority' of cases, responsible heads would cancel the tests altogether. Mr Eamonn O'Kane, deputy general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said changes announced by Mr Patten meant the test boycott would probably be lifted next year. He said: 'The reality is that the tests for this year are virtually defunct. I don't think a local education authority should try to ignore that reality, particularly over something which is on the way to general resolution.' Last night Westminster appeared to be isolated in its strong stance. Mr Donald Naismith, chief education officer of neighbouring Wandsworth, also Conservative-controlled, said his authority had decided against using pay deductions. Attack on league tables, Page 9</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Investor group may urge separate trading forum A City organisation of small-company investors and stockbrokers will meet next week to consider the establishment of a new exchange for start-up companies separate from the London Stock Exchange. The City Group for Smaller Companies (Cisco) is disappointed that the stock exchange has failed to publish the report of its own working party which recommended the establishment of a new so-called Enterprise Market for smaller company shares. The working party, which included several Cisco members, had broadly endorsed Cisco's call for the stock exchange to establish the Enterprise Market under its own auspices but with the addition of an independent board and chief executive. The stock exchange board met to consider the working party report last month. It decided both not to publish the report and to commission additional market research from MORI. Yesterday, following the final meeting of the working party, Mr Giles Vardey, the exchange's markets development director and a member of the group, said: 'The exchange is wholly committed to finding sustainable ways of meeting the needs of smaller growing companies. I want to make it absolutely clear that the board has not rejected the working party's idea of an Enterprise Market. What we need is stronger evidence of demand for a separate market on these lines which would still be sufficiently different from the Official List to be viable.' The stock exchange's actions have left small-company supporters disappointed. 'My feeling is that we now have to pursue an alternative,' said Mr Ronald Cohen, partner at venture capitalists Apax Partners and a member of both Cisco's board and the stock exchange's smaller companies working party. Cisco's board will meet next Tuesday to consider the matter. A stock exchange official said it was decided not to release the report as a discussion document immediately because 'the board did not feel it could endorse the recommendations. If it did release it, it would be difficult to avoid the impression that it was an endorsement.'</p>

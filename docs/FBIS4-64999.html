			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] President Mario Soares is going to try to talk  to Jonas Savimbi at the request of Angolan President Jose  Eduardo dos Santos. Soares met Eduardo dos Santos after Nelson  Mandela's swearing-in ceremony, and he has given details of the  conversation.    [Begin recording] [Soares] [passage omitted] I had a very  positive conversation with Eduardo dos Santos. I can say that  it was probably the most useful conversation I have had with  him. First, I found him very perceptive, I found him very  conscious of the situation, and very willing to move toward a  cease-fire. I also think this is the time for a cease-fire in  Angola.    I also spoke to Butrus-Ghali. President Eduardo dos Santos  asked me to speak to Savimbi, which I will try and do.    [Unidentified correspondent] Are you going to intercede?    [Soares] No, I am not going to intercede, I am going to  talk.  I am going to try to talk -- it is not easy to talk to Savimbi,  I have no direct channel of communication. He is the one who  sometimes telephone me. I will see if I can ask him to  telephone me. I would like to talk to him because this is  definitely the time for peace. [end recording]</p>

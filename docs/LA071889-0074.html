			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> A HISTORY LESSON AT THE BEACH  </P> <P> Like a poster painter or a muralist, any performance artist who brings a  program to a sunny, crowded beach is wise to grab viewers' attention with  bright colors and simple outlines. Still, no one would confuse the folks whose  designs brighten up city walls with the great masters of the mural.  </P> <P> Presented by the SMARTS Festival in collaboration with the Cactus Foundation,  Linda J. Albertano offered a mini-history of California on Saturday afternoon  at Ocean Park Beach in Santa Monica. Called "Calisaladia," the event was big on  multi-ethnic perspective and a homey sort of pageantry. Memorable movement,  text or imagery were in shorter supply.  </P> <P> A man in American Indian garb (Harrison Lowe) who did some ritual business with  a large feather was followed by flagellant monks in scary masks and red robes  snaking across the sand. Then came more Indians in tall black masks whirling  with black flags, a covey of children holding pinatas and doing a solemn  one-step, a body builder (Johnny Pequingnot) flexing away next to a state flag,  members of the East-West Youth Foundation in a Chinese lion dance, accompanied  by the vigorous clashes of pots and pans.  </P> <P> A collage of voice-overs alluded to the Japanese-American internment during  World War II, and a group of women smartly executed karate moves to the sound  of bombers. Keith Antar Mason grandly declaimed a hard-to-follow poem that  seemed to be about the black urban experience. And Albertano, a tall figure in  black, sang in English and Spanish and presided benignly over the whole  good-natured grab bag. CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

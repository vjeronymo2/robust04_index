Asked whether the Hong Kong governor's trip to Australia was  intended to play the "international card," Zhang Junsheng, who  was attending a Spring Festival party hosted by the General  Chinese Chamber of Commerce yesterday, said: It is not just now  that the Hong Kong governor is beginning to do this. He did it  as early as 1992. But it is of no use to play the international  card. As for the fact that some officials of other countries  chime in and agree with the governor's words, Zhang Junsheng  stressed: They do not have much of an understanding of Hong  Kong's affairs. Moreover, Hong Kong's affairs should only be  studied and discussed between the Chinese and British  Governments. A third country has no right whatsoever to  intervene in Hong Kong's affairs nor any right to say this or  that about the Hong Kong issue.    Regarding the Hong Kong governor's affirmation that his  "political reform proposal" does not violate the "three  principles," Zhang Junsheng said: If the Hong Kong governor  were honest, he should have a very good understanding whether or  not his so-called political reform proposal violates the Joint  Declaration, the Basic Law, and the understandings and  agreements reached between China and Britain because it has been  more than one and a half years now since October 1992.  Moreover, with so many views expressed by all sectors of Hong  Kong and the many views advanced by the Chinese side which have  been published in many newspapers and which have even been  compiled into booklets, how then can he take them as if he did  not see them.    He added: Even now, he still insists that his proposal does  not violate the Joint Declaration, the Basic Law, and the  understandings and agreements reached between China and Britain.  In fact, it is very difficult to understand why, as a governor  of Hong Kong, he can say this irrespective of any facts.    Regarding the second reading of the first portion of the  political reform proposal in the Legislative Council [Legco]  next Wednesday, Zhang Junsheng reiterated: The Chinese side had  favored that China and Britain could make good arrangements for  some affairs during the transition period with good cooperation,  particularly some questions including the electoral system. But  the fact that the British side does not cooperate has led to the  breakdown of the Sino-British talks over the arrangements for  the 1994-1995 elections. Therefore, given no cooperation and no  agreement between China and Britain, it is very clear that the  three-tier councils will all cease to be and will be reorganized  on 30 June 1997.    He pointed out: Under these circumstances, whatever things  or bills the Legco may pass and whatever a Legco is to be  established, which will only last for 20 months, are the own  affairs of the British Hong Kong Government, while the Chinese  side will attend to things properly, together with Hong Kong  residents, for Hong Kong's transition in keeping with the Basic  Law and the Joint Declaration and will set up a government and a  legislature for the special administrative region.    As for the fact that the British side stated the need to  publicize the contents of the talks, Zhang Junsheng said: The  Chinese side will not be opposed to this at all as long as the  British side does this through the diplomatic channel. However,  I hope the British side should not "curtail the context" as it  did when it publicized the seven letters exchanged between the  Chinese and British foreign ministers.</p>

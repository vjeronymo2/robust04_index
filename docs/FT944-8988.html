			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Observer: Free ride Good news for MPs rushing to list their outside interests for fear of being caught up in the row over sleaze. It seems there is no need to register those free trips to Paris on the newly-opened Eurostar tunnel rail link. Apparently since every MP was offered the trip it does not count as a declarable interest. The moral is clear. It is perfectly acceptable to bribe our representatives at Westminster as long as we bribe them all.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Ivan Ivanov and Gennadiy </F> Talalayev]    [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- After the end of the first  round of Russian-American summit talks, press secretary of the  Russian president Vyacheslav Kostikov told journalists that,  from the point of view of Russia, the meeting is taking place  "in a new political situation for the first time since the  adoption of the Russian Constitution."    "Russia has joined the club of constitutional democracies,  and this cannot but influence the talks," Kostikov stressed.    "The role played by the great powers in the world will  steadily grow," he believes. Kostikov reminded that the hope  for stabilisation in the world, cherished by people quite  recently, has not come true in a number of regions, speciically,  Yugoslavia, the transcaucasian region and Latin America. He  said "the world needs a strong new order, and Russia will play  the role of a great power in it."    Speaking about the content of the first round of talks  between Yeltsin and Clinton, Kostikov pointed out that "they  began in an atmosphere of genuine partnership." In his opinion,  both sides proceed from the assumption that nothing can be done  in the world without Russia and the United States.    Kostikov said that during the first round of talks the sides  discussed the problem of the correlation of power of the  president and the parliament. Yeltsin told the U.S. President  about the situation in the country after the December elections  in Russia. They also mentioned the recent summit meeting of the  NATO member states in Brussels.    Clinton set forth the main ideas of his "Partnership for  Peace" initiative. According to Kostikov, the initiative is  still little known in Russia. "So far it has been an attractive  formula which should be thought over carefully and thoroughly,"  he said.    Kostikov said as well that the problem of a possible  expansion of NATO was also mentioned during the first round of  talks. Yeltsin and Clinton stated the need, as well as their  intention, for promoting the elimination of all dividing lines  in Europe. The two presidents discussed as well the  implementation of the agreements, reached at the Tokyo summit  meeting of the seven main industrially developed countries.</p>

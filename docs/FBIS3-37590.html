			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 18 Feb -- "If this meeting brings no  results, I shall never again act as a mediator," Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev stated today before a meeting  between Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sargsyan, Azerbaijani  Defense Minister Mamadrafi Mammadov, and Bako Saakyan,  representative of Nagorno-Karabakh.    Asked by the conflicting sides to mediate at the talks, the  Russian Defense Ministry has proposed a plan for stopping the  military actions stage by stage.    Opening the meeting, Pavel Grachev noted that Russia's  impartial mediation in this conflict is in line with the  national interests of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Russia itself and  is being conducted within the framework of the UN Security  Council's resolutions on the Karabakh problem and the CSCE group  on Nagorno-Karabakh. "There are no strong-arm methods of solving  the conflict," Grachev said, adding that, since the parties  themselves are not yet capable of solving the conflict because  of its prolonged nature and complexity, mediation is extremely  important and should lead to positive results. Moreover, the  previous mediation efforts made by various countries and  international organizations have not brought any long-lasting  results so far.    The question of the legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh will  not  be tackled at today's meeting. Purely military decisions  concerning the stage-by-stage cessation of military actions and  the establishment of conditions for a political solution will be  discussed and, probably, adopted. According to the Russian  defense minister, a cease-fire and the disengagement of the  sides should be the first stage of the process, followed by the  withdrawal of all "foreign troops" from the occupied territories  and the deportation of all foreign mercenaries back to their  homelands. The next stage will be the exchange of hostages and  POW's.    Pavel Grachev said he was pleased to be offered the role of  mediator and reported that the meeting is being organized on the  eve of the summit between the presidents of Russia, Armenia, and  Azerbaijan.    Representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh  expressed the hope that the meeting will be fruitful and  agreements proposed by the Russian Ministry of Defense will be  reached.</p>

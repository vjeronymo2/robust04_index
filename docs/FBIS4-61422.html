			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "Provincial Chronicle" column] </F>   [Text] Nazran -- Isa Kostoyev, chairman of the Russian  Federation Council's Constitutional Legislation Committee,  stated that together with Ingushetia's justice minister he has  prepared for President Yeltsin proposals on settling the  Ossetian-Ingush conflict. In particular it is proposed -- under  the supervision of an authorized representative of the Russian  Federation president -- before 20 May to return all refugees and  forced resettlers to six residential areas in Prigorodnyy Rayon  and by 20 September to return them to all the rayon's villages.  "The provisional administration can do a lot if it wants to,  but its leadership has no such wish," Mr. Kostoyev said.  "Vladimir Lozovoy should be replaced and the provisional  administration moved to neutral territory."</p>

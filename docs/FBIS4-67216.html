			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anders Wiig: "Police Are Looking for Kingpin in </F> Hashish Case"]    [Excerpts] Easter catch: Police think that a 41-year-old  man is one of the main figures behind the hashish smuggling on  the coastal vessel Hela. Another suspect came to the police  headquarters yesterday bringing his toothbrush.    The narcotics police in Copenhagen yesterday took the  drastic  step of adding the 41-year-old former hashish smuggler Kim  Julskov Knudsen to the wanted list for being one of the main  figures behind Easter's big smuggling case at Helnas Bay on  South Fyn.    Knudsen is charged with being one of the men who instigated,  planned, and financed the smuggling of about 6 tons of hashish  from Morocco. Police made the greatest hashish coup in Denmark's  history when the coastal vessel Hela was boarded in the waters  off the coast of South Fyn. Four and a half tons of hashish has  been confiscated; some during the raid and some later after  being fished out of the bay.    Sixteen people are now in custody, and number 17--and one of  the alleged top kingpins--is the wanted Knudsen. He was  sentenced to one year in prison in a hashish case in the  beginning of the 1980's and has been charged by the police with  having supplied most of the circa 20 million kroner that was  needed in order to finance the Hela's trip to Morocco to obtain  the hashish.    Knudsen has perhaps escaped to Sweden or the Netherlands,  but  might be driving around in Denmark in a metallic blue Volvo  station wagon with licence plate OS 28.117. He was gone at 0500  Sunday [3 April] morning when the police stormed into his villa  in the northwestern part of Copenhagen.    Asked what his profession or possible cover profession is,  police commissioner Per Leo Jepsen says: "We do not know that.  We call him independent or self-employed." Knudsen is 190 cm  tall, with light blond hair, and a glass eye.  <H5>  Brought Book as Pastime </H5>   At 0800 Wednesday morning another old hashish smuggler came  to police headquarters. It was a 42-year-old man who had also  escaped the police Sunday. [passage omitted]    This 42-year-old has been charged both with the two  unsuccessful hashish trips on the vessel Mary in 1992 and 1993  and also with the 6-ton trip on Hela. Like one of the other men  in custody he has also been imprisoned in 1975 in North Africa  for smuggling hashish.    So far he has not said a word during questioning by the  police. That is also the case for the 47-year-old man who was  arrested in the same case the day before yesterday and who was  also taken into custody yesterday.    Yesterday military divers brought up 63 packages each  containing 25 kg of hashish from the ocean bottom near the coast  of South Fyn. By yesterday the police had retrieved 179 packages  with a total of 4,475 kg of hashish. There are still more  packages on the ocean floor. "And we will find them all," the  chief criminal inspector Per Larsen promised us.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Clifford Foods declines 60% CLIFFORD FOODS, the dairy products,fruit juice and food group which issued a profits warning in July, yesterday reported a 60 per cent decline in pre-tax profits which fell from Pounds 2.55m to Pounds 1.03m in the first half of 1992. Turnover was little changed at Pounds 70.1m, compared with Pounds 70.3m. As foreshadowed by Mr John Clifford, chairman, in the group's 1991 report and accounts, the period was affected by the substantial costs of modernising the Kidlington dairy, turning it into an automated carton milk unit. Profits were further reduced by the effects of the continuing recession on the sales of convenience foods by Danby's Foods and Roy's Quality Foods, and particularly by price-cutting among companies supplying milk in non-returnable containers to supermarkets, an area which generates more than a quarter of group turnover. Operating profits fell to Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 2.93m) with a further Pounds 120,000 (Pounds 126,000) from associates. Net interest payments declined to Pounds 380,000, against Pounds 401,000. During the latest period the company said fruit juices and drinks continued to perform well, as did doorstep milk rounds which are now about two-thirds franchised. Meanwhile Morton Food's new crumb factory generated significant new business. Mr Martin Bunting, chief executive, said the group expected trading levels in the second half to be significantly better than in either the first half or the 1991 second half. Poor weather in July and August depressed fruit juice sales, but milk prices have been increased. In addition Mr Bunting noted that the group's new fruit juice carbonation plant had started production in July and Roy's new factory was completed in August, drawing a large capital expenditure programme towards a close. Earnings per share fell by 60 per cent to 4.11p (10.23p). The company is dipping into reserves slightly to pay an unchanged interim dividend of 4.4p a share.</p>

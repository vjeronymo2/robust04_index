			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAX INCREASE: DEBATE OVER WHO WILL PAY  </P> <P> I am disturbed that our President and Congress can only think of increasing  taxes as the solution to the deficit. They have treated our outrageous foreign  aid as sacrosanct.  </P> <P> Forty years-plus is long enough to support the world! Our seniors are of the  generation that fought in World War II, rebuilt the world with their money,  preserved the peace with their sons and daughters, and now the politicians are  afraid they are too affluent and need to pay more taxes. None of the American  people need to pay more taxes. We need relief from giving money away to  countries which no longer need it and/or countries whose leaders line their  pockets while their people suffer.  </P> <P> Keep our military strong, utilize the Peace Corps for countries which need help  and discontinue foreign aid to pay off the deficit. I hope the politicians are  reading lips when the American people say no tax increase.  </P> <P> VEE STOVER  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

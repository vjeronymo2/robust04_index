			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> DEADLINE EXTENDED FOR PANEL APPLICANTS  </P> <P> The deadline for submitting applications for the Simi Valley Planning  Commission has been extended from today to Monday, city officials said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> To be eligible for appointment to the five-member panel, applicants must be  residents of Simi Valley and not be employed by the city.  </P> <P> There are four open seats on the commission, one of which became vacant when  the chairwoman, Judy Mikels, was elected to the City Council on Nov. 6.  </P> <P> Formal nominations and public interviews of the nominees by the council are  scheduled for the council's Monday meeting.  </P> <P> Each member of the City Council is responsible for the nomination of one  planning commissioner. The terms of the commissioners are concurrent with the  term of the nominating council member.  </P> <P> Mayor Gregory Stratton, who was reelected to a third term this month, Mikels  and another newly elected council member, Sandi Webb, will each be responsible  for nominating a planning commissioner. Because Mikels was Councilman Bill  Davis' appointee to the planning panel, he will also have to select a new  member to sit on the commission.  </P> <P> The commission, which advises the council on development matters, generally  meets two Wednesday evenings a month.

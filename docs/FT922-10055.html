			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Spens allowed to re-open fight for an acquittal LORD SPENS, former corporate finance managing director at Henry Ansbacher, the merchant bank, was yesterday given leave to challenge the refusal to grant him a formal acquittal after the collapse of the second Guinness trial. A High Court judge granted him leave to seek a judicial review of Mr Justice Henry's refusal to give him a formal not-guilty verdict on the fraud and false accounting charges he had faced, or to order that the Pounds 400,000 costs Lord Spens incurred before being granted legal aid should be paid out of public funds. However, Mr Justice Macpherson said that, while he recognised that Lord Spens felt a sense of injustice and had an arguable case, 'I do not wish it to be thought that I believe there is much strength in this case.' The second Guinness trial was halted in February because of psychiatrists' concern that Lord Spens' co-defendant, Mr Roger Seelig, a former corporate finance director of the merchant bank Morgan Grenfell, could no longer adequately defend himself. Further prosecution of Mr Seelig was halted by a nolle prosequi, a decision which stayed proceedings against him but was not an acquittal. The Serious Fraud Office decided that in the circumstances, it would not be fair to proceed further against Lord Spens. In March Mr Justice Henry said that an order staying proceedings against Lord Spens, with the charges left on the file, not to be proceeded with without the court's permission, would put him in the same position as Mr Seelig. Refusing to grant Lord Spens a costs order, Mr Justice Henry said he had brought the prosecution on himself by not consulting the Takeover Panel when asked by Mr Seelig to recruit share supporters for Guinness under indemnities against loss.</p>

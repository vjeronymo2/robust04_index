			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored from Havana radio and  television sources in Spanish between 18 and 25 June:    Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 18 June reports that the  Cienfuegos Province Finance Directorate's fine control office  collected 1.1 million pesos in 1993. Their collection goal for  1994 is 2 million pesos, 66 percent of which has already been  collected.    Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 21 June reports that the  Ministry of Metal Industry reported that than more than 74,000  bicycles were produced during the first five months of the  current year. The aim is to exceed 250,000 units since  production in Cuba started in 1991. Santiago Delgado, production  director of the national organization of bicycles, said those  numbers are very encouraging because despite current shortages  in supplies, the 20 enterprises involved in production aim to  fulfill the commitment of 300,000 bicycles.    Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 21 June reports that the  Govenment of India donated a full electric power project to  illuminate a rural community of 120 homes in Santiago de Cuba.    Radio Reloj at 1952 GMT on 22 June reports that Pinar del  Rio  Province is the leader in the sugarcane planting program with 90  percent of the goal fulfilled. The other provinces are lagging  behind, thus Pinar del Rio has definite possibilities to meet  its planting goals.    Radio Reloj at 1958 GMT adds that Holguin Province has  experienced a slight economic recovery during the first five  months of 1994. During this period, production revenues were  aproximately 306 million pesos, 30 million more than during the  same period in 1993.    Radio Reloj at 1959 on 23 June reports that the Basic  Cooperative Production Units in Havana have planted 37  caballerias of tubers, vegetables, rice, and beans for self  consumption.    Radio Rebelde at 0900 on 24 June reports that Jose Luis  Astrolea, president of the hydraulic resources institute, stated  in Santiago de Cuba that Cuba currently has 185  minihydroelectric units. Astrolea added that the goal, which is  obtainable, is 600 units.    Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 23 June reports that Bayamo's  Farming Sciences Higher Institute and Guerrero State's  Autonomous University, Mexico, have extended their cooperation  program with the signing of a new cooperation accord.    Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT adds that Guantanamo Province's  Frank Pais contingent will mark its second anniversary by  pledging to produce 500,000 million quintals of vegetables.    Cuba Vision Network at 0000 GMT on 24 June reports that  following recent rains which affected the sugarcane harvest in  Camaguey Province, six mills are currently grinding and workers  are fully committed to repair the damage to the sugarcane fields.    Cuba Vision Network at 0000 GMT on 24 June adds that 86  percent of the Cuban merchant fleet is operational despite  current limitations. Two years ago, less than 60 percent was  operational. Revenue of over 20 million in hard currency was  attained by the fleet between January and May. A meeting held in  preparation for October's Fourth Merchant Fleet and Port Union  Congress focused on efforts to reduce costs and increase  efficiency. It was also reported that over 400 crew members are  employed in foreign vessels yielding revenue of over $2 million  in salaries.    Cuba Vision Network, in the same newscast, adds that the  American Freedom to Travel activists who arrived in Cuba in  defiance of the travel ban brought along a donation, no figures  given, of medicines and school supplies.    Radio Reloj at 0200 GMT on 24 June reports that increased  weeding efforts are essential to improve the sugarcane yield.  The Sugar Industry Ministry's plans include manually weeding  more than 144,000 caballerias in the first half of 1994. It was  announced at the 10-day harvest assessment meeting that Holguin  Province surpassed its weeding goals and that Camaguey, Granma,  and Las Tunas Province have made significant progress in this  endeavor.    Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on June 24 reports that the  Spanish  Politurs Discount Tourism Agency has doubled its sale of trips  to Cuba during the first five months of 1994 in comparison with  the same period in 1993. This means that approximately 3,500  Spanish tourists -- of the 14,000 expected in 1994 -- have  already visited Cuba before the peak season in July and October.    Radio Reloj at 0200 GMT on 25 June reports that the  Ibero-American Cooperation Institute has granted a $20,000  donation to the Federation of Cuban Women, FMC, to modernize the  documentation center of the FMC Cadres School. FMC President  Vilma Espin attended the ceremony where the first $10,000 of the  donation was issued to the FMC.    Radio Reloj at 0200 GMT on 25 June adds that the six Basic  Cooperative Production Units in Nueva Paz Municipality are  behind schedule in the spring planting of diverse crops with 20  caballerias planted out of a 49 caballeria program. The delays  were due to, among other things, excess humidity in the soil, a  shortage of tires, and weeds. Candido Palmero, first secretary  of the Communist Party of Cuba in Havana, pointed out that if  this situation continues, the planting goal is not going to be  met, and added that a Youth Labor Army farm will be created to  help with the labor.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 25 June reports that Cuba  signed  an accord with the UN program for population stability and  family planning. The United Nations will contribute over  $700,000 and Cuba will contribute over 2 million pesos to the  effort. Raul Taladrid praised the UN contribution.</p>

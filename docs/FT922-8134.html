			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Holiday operators expect a tough year AN EXPECTED post-election boom in package holidays has failed to materialise, leaving tour operators facing a second difficult year. A number of tour operators have cut the price of holidays in May and June by as much as 60 per cent to fill empty seats - in some cases up to a quarter of their capacity. With Thomson, the largest operator, last-minute bargain-seekers can buy for Pounds 199 a fly-drive holiday to Florida which would normally cost more than Pounds 400. Analysts also point to a new trend for holidaymakers to wait longer before making bookings, depriving tour operators of the benefit of early deposits. The move to last-minute bookings means that tour operators now have less cash on deposit earning interest over several months. The Civil Aviation Authority yesterday published figures showing that tour operators had overcapacity of 1.6m holidays in the 12 months to September 30 last year and a turnover of Pounds 440m less than the tour industry had predicted. The 40 largest operators had obtained CAA licences for 11.9m passengers, but actually carried only 10.3m. This year, tour operators have told the authority they expect to carry 13.5m passengers, an increase of more than 30 per cent on last year's actual figures. Authority licences for this year project turnover of Pounds 4.44bn, a substantial increase on both the forecast for 1990-91 (Pounds 3.65bn) and the turnover achieved (Pounds 3.21bn). Thomas Cook, the travel agent, said yesterday that those in the industry who expected 'a post-election expansion of package holiday demand' had been disappointed. Holidays for May and June have 'not been selling as well as would have been liked' but Thomas Cook said the case would be different in the latter part of June through to September. Summer bookings - where discounting has not yet been necessary - are already 'full to the brim'. Thomas Cook believes that the projections by some operators of an increase of 20 per cent to 40 per cent in demand this year is over-optimistic. 'Those which are looking for a 7 per cent to 10 per cent increase are being more realistic', it said. Mr Harry Coe, group finance director of Airtours, the third largest operator, said the level of discounting was not unusual. 'Every year there is excess capacity in May and June, and every year there is price-cutting in the late bookings market in order to move it,' he said. Lex, Page 20</p>

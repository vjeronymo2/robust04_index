			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / European factories 'outclassed' Only one in 50 European manufacturers are genuinely 'world class' - yet three out of four believe they can compete with the best of their international rivals, according to a four-country survey published today. The apparent gap between companies' perceptions of their competitiveness and the reality is revealed in 'Made in Europe' by Mr Philip Hanson of IBM Consulting Group and Professor Chris Voss of London Business School. Their study of more than 650 factories in Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain is billed as the largest and most comprehensive of manufacturing practice and performance in northern Europe. The findings have important implications for manufacturers. 'The best in Europe is equal to the best in the world,' says Prof Voss. 'But the challenge for Europe is to bring all companies up to this standard. In too many companies and sectors in all countries, inertia and complacency are the main enemies, but there are also success stories.' Germany, the Netherlands and Britain have similar numbers of world class manufacturers, but overall, the UK comes bottom of the four in both practice and performance. This is because it has a much longer 'tail' of poorly performing companies, depressing its overall position. Using a strongly Japanese-influenced model developed by London Business School, the study found just 14 of the 663 sites were world class, as measured by qualities ranging from executive vision to effective use of 'lean' production techniques and manufacturing systems. The performance is disappointing, say the authors. However, 46 per cent of the factories came in the next best category, and, with determination, could become world class. Throughout the four countries, the self-opinion of international competitiveness runs well ahead of evidence of world class best practice, says the study. And those close to being world class were much more realistic than less advanced companies. There was also clear evidence in all the countries that foreign-owned companies - especially Japanese-owned - outperformed domestically-owned ones in almost every area of practice and performance. Among the big surprises was the performance of companies in former East Germany. Restructured under new owners, far more sites than expected were moving towards world class status.

			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ESCONDIDO POLICE CHIEF JOINS RACE FOR SHERIFF  </P> <P> Escondido Police Chief Vince Jimno announced Wednesday that he will run for San  Diego County sheriff in the June 5 primary.  </P> <P> Jimno, who became Escondido chief in 1987 after seven years as Carlsbad's  police chief, joins three others who have filed statements of intention to  raise funds for the campaign. They are Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache, former San  Diego Police Chief Ray Hoobler, and the incumbent, Sheriff John Duffy.  </P> <P> "Strong leadership is needed" to boost morale in the Sheriff's Department,  Jimno said, adding that he believes he can beat Duffy.  </P> <P> "It's time for a change," he said.  </P> <P> At the top of his agenda, he said, would be the staffing and running of county  jails and dispatching officers more quickly.  </P> <P> However, Jimno, 47, would not comment Wednesday on specific programs he might  propose.  </P> <P> Instead he pointed to what he called insufficient hands-on leadership in the  department, "a jail system which has been so plagued by so many problems it may  be taken away," and a lack of cooperation from Duffy that he said has led to an  inadequate department and increased costs.  </P> <P> "When the board and the sheriff argue, and nothing is done for months, costs  increase. The failure to act on issues continues to drive costs up," Jimno  said.  </P></p>

Therefore, it was difficult to prevent  the incident. However, more preventive measures are now  required for important places, while cooperation is being  undertaken with various countries in preventing serious  incidents, and good relations are to be maintained with Middle  East countries. [passage omitted]    Police General Prathin Santipraphop, director general of the  Police Department, said that the arrest of the culprits seems  unlikely because it is believed they have already left of the  country. However, cooperation has been sought with other  countries that are expected to have a criminal background on the  group of terrorists so that further police action can be taken  to arrest them.

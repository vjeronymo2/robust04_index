Hosokawa was  asked by reporters at his official residence for comment on  exchange rates as the dollar fell below 103 yen in Tokyo Tuesday  morning for the first time since last August.    Asked how the government plans to cope with the yen's rise,  Hosokawa said he will make every effort to weather the adverse  effects of the stronger yen on the economy.    The premier was asked whether he believes the yen's rise is  the result of his failure to reach agreement with U.S. President  Bill Clinton last week in Washington on a new framework for  bilateral trade. "I believe it's not a question like that,"  Hosokawa said when asked whether he believes the yen's surge is  a high price for saying "no" to Clinton over U.S. demands for  numerical trade targets.    In a related development, a government source said the yen's  surge is a concern and expressed hope that the dollar will stay  at around 115 yen.    "I believe it (the stronger yen) will probably trouble the  United States too. I believe they don't think it's OK to leave  the situation as it is because it will lead to an erosion of  confidence in the dollar," the source said.</p>

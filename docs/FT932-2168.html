			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Arts: Squeezing the dancing classes - Off the Wall WHEN THE number two minister at the Department of National Heritage admits to taking the artistic views of MP Terry Dicks 'extremely seriously' the arts world should start to tremble. Dicks is the professional 'bovver' boy of the arts in the House of Commons who likes nothing more than roughing up subsidised ballet dancers, actors, artists and the like. That Iain Sproat, the ferocious right winger who was a surprise choice at the recent re-shuffle to bolster Peter Brooke at Heritage, should agree this week that most people think the Pounds 225m a year spent on the Arts Council would be better invested in three new hospitals, seems like surrendering to the enemy without a fight. It suggests that the arts are on target to do very badly out of the intense Treasury examination of public expenditure. Already the Arts Council is set to receive Pounds 5m less in 1994-95, its first ever reduction in grant: suddenly it seems to face even greater surgery, which would trigger off wholesale cutbacks and closures among its clients. And the Arts Council is not making things easier by choosing this moment to finally get around to selecting winners and losers among arts organisations, giving more to contemporary dance and the visual arts, and less to regional theatres. In the event, when it announces its plans next month, the Council's hit list is likely to be tiny. Only a handful of companies will be penalised, one or two losing all their subsidy, a few more suffering a reduction. The excuse will be that they are just not up to standard. Less than Pounds 1m will be released to bolster dance and art. At the same time the Council will announce a much longer list of companies that will suffer if the government goes ahead with the planned Pounds 5m cut in its budget. The hope is that this will cause such an outcry that the government will have second thoughts. It is a nice idea, but with a weak minister, a monetarist number two, and a philistine crew at the treasury, the only hope for the arts is direct contact with the Prime Minister, who is thought to have a soft spot for the argument that, as well as being a good investment, a flourishing arts scene is a sign of a nation at ease with itself. At every level the arts world is out to lobby John Major. Corporate sponsors of the arts are keen to play their part, making it clear this week that they will not make good any shortfall in subsidy. With the government aware of the 'new' money destined for the arts and the heritage from the Lottery in early 1995, it may feel that it can withstand a spate of closure and outrage stories, even though the promise was that the Lottery was to be an extra, not an alternative, to government aid. Lobbying by the arts to preserve funding has begun already. As ever, the warm hearted Philip Hedley of the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, was first into the field, chairing a gathering at the National Theatre this week which was alerted to the pitiful state of Theatre-in-Education. The capping of councils has forced many local authorities to cut spending on this area - the most dramatic casualty, Harlow Theatrevan, has lost its entire Pounds 146,000 grant - but in all 22 companies that bring play acting into schools are under threat. The campaign wants the DNH to cough up Pounds 1m to keep alive this first experience of theatre for most children. An even more necessary pressure group is that assembled to convince Education Secretary John Patten that discretionary grants for dance and drama students should be made mandatory. Once again it is reductions in local authority spending that have persuaded half the councils in the country to axe such grants. In 1992 the number of accepted students who were forced to turn down places because they failed to receive sufficient grants rose by 75 per cent in drama, and 100 per cent in dance. In all, around 40 per cent of students offered places last year were unable to take them up. The experience of the London Contemporary Dance School is typical. It has just launched a Pounds 100,000 appeal to raise money for scholarships. This year, of the 86 students it has accepted for the new intake in September, just 21 are British, a third of the usual number. Even some of the British students who have accepted a place will be forced to drop out before, or during, their course because of lack of funding. It means that our dance schools are dominated by overseas students and our drama schools by middle class students, financially supported by their parents. It is unfair that geography should determine who will become a professional dancer or actor. It is also unfair that art and music students are protected with mandatory grants, art students because they are seen as part of the craft and design industry, music because Ted Heath willed it so when he was in power. Dance and drama needs an equally powerful supporter today. Most unfortunate of all is the fact that these two campaigns, which are trying to make good earlier cuts in funding, will be overtaken by the campaigns likely to start in the next few months to counter even more dramatic reductions in spending. One alarmed group in the arts world is adopting a softly, softly approach. In its review of the workings of the Arts Council, consultants Price Waterhouse suggested that the touring department should be closed down, its functions spread around the specialist art forms with the aim of eventually privatising its role. This would save 12 jobs - although, of course, the Council would have to pay the outside company handling the service. This is part of PW's Option Two, which Peter Brooke seems inclined to accept. But this week the directors of the 50 leading receiving theatres, and the main touring dance, opera and drama companies in England expressed concern at the proposal. They think the current system, which brings a leavening of subsidised artistic events to commercial theatres like the Palace Manchester and the Theatre Royal Nottingham, works well. Rather than make a public expression of their concern they have asked for private meetings with Peter Brooke and Arts Council chairman Lord Palumbo to argue their case.</p>

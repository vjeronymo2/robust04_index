			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE SCHOOLS  </P> <P> The decisions by San Diego school board members Shirley Weber and Kay Davis to  send their children to non-public schools ("2 Board Members Put Children in  Private Schools," Sept. 27) should educate, not shock the public.  </P> <P> Leading scholars on the subject of what it takes to make public schools  effective increasingly find that this is not possible without the competition  that non-public schools afford.  </P> <P> One part of the solution to today's educational problem therefore is to offer  more choice to parents about the schools their children will attend. Weber and  Davis are fortunate enough to be able to pay for this benefit for their  children. Low-income parents are systematically denied this chance for the  betterment for their offspring, however.  </P> <P> The remedy for this unfairness is the voucher system, in which parents receive  financial warrants they can redeem at schools of their choice for their  children's education.  </P> <P> PATRICK GROFF  </P> <P> Professor, School of Teacher Education  </P> <P> San Diego State University  </P></p>

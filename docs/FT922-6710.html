			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Panel ruling on Davy payment A Takeover Panel ruling yesterday diminished the chances that former shareholders in Davy Corporation, which Trafalgar House took over last June, will ever receive their second payment of Pounds 54m. The Panel ruled that shareholders were given all the information and warnings necessary concerning the Ocean Emerald rig, the conversion of which cost Davy its independence. Trafalgar made the second payment, worth 45p per share, conditional on it receiving payment from Midland and Scottish Resources, which ordered the rig but has so far been unable to draw on letters of credit to pay for it.</p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE FAULTS BILL TO ELEVATE EPA  </P> <P> The White House, which proposed elevating the Environmental Protection Agency  to Cabinet level, declared Thursday that it opposes the House bill to bring  about the change because it contains provisions that "raise serious  constitutional concerns."  </P> <P> In particular, the Administration said it objects to creating a  semi-independent Bureau of Environmental Statistics over which the executive  branch would have limited control.  </P> <P> "Unless these provisions are deleted or modified satisfactorily, the  President's senior advisers, including the administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency and the attorney general, would recommend that the bill be  vetoed," the Administration said in a formal "statement of Administration  policy" sent to Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> Under the House bill, the new statistics bureau would be given the power to  collect data on environmental hazards and would be required to widely publicize  its findings.  </P> <P> Presidential appointees, including the head of the new environmental  department, would be forbidden to review the statistical bureau's reports, and  the head of the bureau would be protected from firing.  </P> <P> The Administration maintains that those provisions would make it impossible for  the secretary of the environment to run the department. Administration lawyers  said the bill also infringes on the President's constitutional power to run the  executive branch of the government.  </P> <P> However, congressional Democrats said that the independent status is needed to  make sure that environmental information dispensed to the public is credible  and nonpartisan. During the Ronald Reagan Administration, the Democrats point  out, political appointees at EPA were accused of hiding information that  conflicted with White House policy.  </P> <P> "It would be a sham and a shame to place another chair around the Cabinet table  with a law that places a gag on the department's ability to protect the  environment in an effective and nonpartisan way," House Majority Leader Richard  A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) said, noting that he "deeply regrets" the Administration  veto threat.  </P> <P> The threat was made at an unusually early stage in the legislative process.  Bills to create the new environment department are being considered by  committees in both the House and Senate and could face months of consideration  before a final vote is taken.  </P> <P> But Administration officials, who have been widely criticized on environmental  issues in the last several months, do not want to be put in the position of  threatening to veto an environmental bill once its passage is imminent. By  taking a strong stand now, an Administration official said, the White House  hopes to head off potential problems early.  </P></p>

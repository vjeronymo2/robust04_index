Kiev Is  Ready To Get Rid of the Weapons, But After Some Bargaining"]    [Text] This week a high-ranking delegation including Yuriy  Dubinin, special envoy and chief of the Russian Federation state  delegation to talks with Ukraine; Atomic Energy Minister Viktor  Mikhaylov; and Colonel General Yevgeniy Maslin, from the 12th  Main Directorate of the Defense Ministry, held difficult talks  in Kiev on specific measures to eliminate Ukrainian nuclear  weapons.    Upon returning to Moscow, Ambassador Yuriy Dubinin told your  SEGODNYA correspondent that "we have agreed on the content of  the document that will enable us to implement the agreements on  eliminating nuclear arms in Ukraine, which were reached by  Presidents Yeltsin, Kravchuk, and Clinton on 14 January."  Presently, the results of the talks are being "reported" to the  presidents of Ukraine and Russia. According to official  reports, however, President Yeltsin has caught a cold and is  currently inaccessible.    Meanwhile, the Russian and Ukrainian delegations agreed that  until the results achieved in Kiev are approved, no details  about the process of the talks should be made public. No press  conferences. It was disclosed, however, that they had "entirely  substantive talks in Kiev" that were held in "a constructive and  businesslike atmosphere." Translated from diplomatic-speak into  plain language, this usually means a tough showdown.    The Kiev military and political establishment had long ago  decided in principle to get rid of what it sees as costly,  dangerous, and rather useless nuclear weapons, but the  bargaining over the deal's specifics is set to be long and  tedious.</p>

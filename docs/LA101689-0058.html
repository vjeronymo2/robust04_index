			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TO RUSSIA FOR LOVE;  </P> <P> MOVIES: SOVIETS COOPERATE IN FILMING OF LE CARRE'S LOVE STORY SET AGAINST A  BACKDROP OF INTERNATIONAL ESPIONAGE.  </P> <P> The skies were leaden, the Ukraina Hotel was equally gloomy and the passers-by  were already bundled against the cold wind from the Moscow River as Sean  Connery stepped between two dirty black Volgas, the cars of Soviet  apparatchiki, in one of those seemingly casual meetings that spies so carefully  arrange.  </P> <P> The actor who became James Bond in half a dozen movie thrillers -- including  "From Russia with Love" -- in the 1960s, Connery was again in the role of a  British secret agent, but this film's theme is more "to Russia for love" than  about foiling the plots of the Soviet KGB.  </P> <P> Connery is playing Barley Blair, the central character in John Le Carre's new  novel, "The Russia House," and he was meeting Katya, played by Michelle  Pfeiffer, who begins as a courier for a Soviet scientist smuggling secret  military information to the West and becomes the woman for whom Blair is ready  to sacrifice everything.  </P> <P> "Glasnost and perestroika seem to be serious," Connery said, referring to  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies of political openness and overall  reforms. "They are letting us do this film here although it's about spies and  traitors and that sort of thing, and they are going to publish Le Carre's book  themselves in Russian. You have to say that the system here has changed a bit.  </P> <P> "Five years ago, they would not have let us in, and probably would have  denounced the film as 'anti-Soviet.' Today, they are helping us all they can to  do this film. I think they have gotten over their secretiveness and paranoia."  </P> <P> To Paul Maslansky, the film's co-producer, "The Russia House" is far more a  love story in a setting of espionage than one of East-West politics merely  spiced with a bit of romance.  </P> <P> "I think Le Carre wanted to write a love story, a story about people and what  motivates them and what predicaments they find themselves in as a result of  love, and naturally he set it in the world that he knows best," Maslansky said.  "But it's also quite true that Gorbachev's Russia is not the 'evil empire' as  people used to imagine the Soviet Union to be, and that means it is a place  where this kind of romance can happen without some threat to the state.  </P> <P> "A Le Carre novel, however, is very difficult to make into a movie. He is very,  very wordy, but he uses words to draw pictures that are hard to reproduce on  the screen. He seldom writes action sequences -- there are no car crashes, no  chases -- and he loves ambiguity. I hope this picture will be a tapestry of  Moscow and Leningrad, one of great mood and rich feeling."  </P> <P> Maslansky, who has produced two other movies in the Soviet Union, said that  script was reviewed by Moscow Film Studio, one of whose affiliated companies  has contracted to provide some equipment and crew and arrange the scenes for  filming.  </P> <P> "In the past, they wanted script control, and they insisted on it," Maslansky  said. "This time, they just wanted to make sure there was no pornography,  nothing anti-Soviet, nothing that would give the Soviet Union a bad image. But  this is a story in which everyone comes out quite human."  </P> <P> With a screenplay by Tom Stoppard, "The Russia House" has Fred Schepisi as its  director and producer and a budget of $21 million from Pathe International. Its  cast includes Roy Scheider, James Fox, John Mahoney and Klaus-Maria Brandauer.  </P> <P> Filming began in Leningrad two weeks ago and will continue here until early  November, when the cast and crew move to London, Lisbon and Vancouver. The film  is scheduled for release next autumn.  </P> <P> Although Maslansky and Schepisi praise the cooperation they received from  Corona Films, the Soviet-West German joint venture that is assisting them here,  the filming is something of a study in mismatched cultures.  </P> <P> "For us, time is money, and the meter is running all the time," Maslansky said.  "For them, there is always tomorrow, so no need to push so hard today. They get  paid no more for working harder or faster, but we lose money if we don't. What  we use five or six people to do -- say, lighting a scene -- they will use 11 or  12.  </P> <P> "On the other hand, our directors can do a lot of takes of a scene, maybe a  dozen, and theirs are given much less film, enough to do perhaps four takes,  making them more careful in setting up a scene."  </P> <P> None of this surprised Maslansky, who made one film, "The Red Tent," with  Connery here 25 years ago, and then took over the production in Leningrad of  "The Bluebird," with Elizabeth Taylor and Jane Fonda in 1974.  </P> <P> "Nothing has changed really," Maslansky said. "Time has generally stood still.  Their system still constrains them in many ways. And it is tough to get people  to work 14 hours a day when they get no more out of it than if they worked six  or seven.  </P> <P> "When we did 'Bluebird,' we had the right people, and it worked. This also is  working well, extremely well. As many mistakes are made by my side as by  theirs. But, when you have shooting costs of maybe $10,000 an hour, the  time-money ratio is severe."  </P> <P> The filming is a massive undertaking in logistics. More than 50 specialized  vehicles, everything from catering wagons to sound trucks, have been brought  from Britain and Finland. Tons of food have been imported to feed the cast and  crew, about 60 from abroad and a similar number hired locally, so that there  will be a minimum loss of shooting time.  </P></p>

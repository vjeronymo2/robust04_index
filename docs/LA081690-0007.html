			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CRITICS OF AMERICAN CULTURE  </P> <P> In his July 31 article ("Nibble at Freedom, and Risk Losing It All,"  Commentary) we see Judge Irving R. Kaufman supporting the Federal (taxpayer)  funding of trash "art," because of the First Amendment. Tell me, where in the  Constititution does it say that any federal funding of art is allowed?  </P> <P> Where does it say no tax dollars may go to show the Christian faith in a good  way, but may be used to discriminate against it?  </P> <P> May antisemitic or racist "art" also be funded?  </P> <P> Does the good judge, who is so supportive of the Constitution, also support the  Second Amendment as fully?  </P> <P> Lastly -- as democracy is even coming to the Soviet Union, why not the U.S.A.?  Would the judge support having the taxpayers vote for how their money is spent  -- as in what "art" is funded?  </P> <P> RICK SCHWEMLER  </P> <P> Santa Paula  </P></p>

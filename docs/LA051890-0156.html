			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> U.S. EXPORTS INCREASE TO RECORD LEVELS;  </P> <P> TRADE: THE GOOD SHOWING ABROAD IS TEMPERED BY A SURGE OF IMPORTS THAT PUSHED  THE NATION'S TRADE IMBALANCE TO $8.4 BILLION.  </P> <P> Sales of American-made goods overseas jumped to record levels in March, the  Commerce Department reported Thursday, but a surge in imports widened the  nation's trade deficit to $8.4 billion.  </P> <P> Economists expressed little alarm at March's trade imbalance, which was  slightly higher than expected after a revised $6.1-billion deficit in February.  But they hailed the strong export showing as a clear signal of increasing  economic strength.  </P> <P> "It's clear that foreign exports are giving momentum to the U.S. economy now,"  said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch in New York, noting that  exports during the first quarter were 11% higher than a year earlier. "If they  keep that up, there's no way the economy can fall into a recession this year."  </P> <P> In another encouraging sign, the United States' trade deficit with Japan posted  its first significant decline since the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance emerged as a  serious international and political irritant in the mid-1980s.  </P> <P> During the first quarter of 1989, the deficit with Japan was $12.4 billion, the  Commerce Department reported. The figure dropped to $9.6 billion this year, an  impressive 23% decline.  </P> <P> "The monthly deficit number was worse, but the underpinnings of this report  means a stronger economy," said economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. "The  record high exports are very encouraging and that says strong economic growth  overseas is helping our exports and providing an important prop to growth in  our economy."  </P> <P> Indeed, last month's increase in the trade deficit was exaggerated by seasonal  adjustments as well as by the previous month's unusually favorable figures.  February imports were at their lowest level in a year as U.S. importers and  retailers worked off inventory, while exports were boosted by a surge of  overseas aircraft sales in the wake of last fall's Boeing strike.  </P> <P> Aircraft exports declined somewhat in March. But other exports, primarily  manufactured goods, easily made up the difference, the government reported.  </P> <P> The big gains in exports, which reached a record $33.3 billion in March, were  led by computers, telecommunications equipment, scientific instruments and  other high-technology manufactured products, industrial supplies and even  automobiles.  </P> <P> Although March imports of $41.7 billion were second only to a peak reached last  October, the first-quarter import total was running only 5.5% above the same  period in 1989 -- roughly half the growth rate for exports.  </P> <P> "In the next few months, imports are not going to rise this fast again, because  domestic demand is weak . . . , especially for consumer goods and big-ticket  consumer durables," said Merrill Lynch's Steinberg. "And that's what we have  been buying from Japan."  </P> <P> The nation's trade deficit averaged just under $8 billion a month during the  first quarter, and economists said that it now appears the deficit will finish  the year in the $95-billion range. Until recently, most analysts were  predicting only minuscule improvement over last year's $108.9-billion deficit,  which averaged slightly more than $9 billion a month.  </P> <P> Howard Lewis, an international economics and trade specialist with the National  Assn. of Manufacturers, noted that most of the improvement in U.S. trade in the  past few years has been in exports to other industrial countries.  </P> <P> In the first quarter of 1989, for example, the United States posted a trade  surplus of just under $900 million with the European Common Market. This year,  the first-quarter surplus with the Europeans was $2.1 billion. It was $1  billion in March alone.  </P> <P> Lewis noted that economic problems in most developing countries largely have  eliminated any demand on their part for U.S. manufactured goods. A global  expansion of agricultural production, meanwhile, has made it much tougher for  American farmers to find steady markets for U.S. grain in non-industrial  countries.  </P> <P> In addition, U.S. dependence on foreign oil has resumed the upward march that  was interrupted by the oil price and supply disruptions of the 1970s, and fuel  has become a steadily growing trade deficit item.  </P> <P> In March, oil imports were nominally the same as in February at $4.8 billion,  but a slight decline in price masked an actual increase of 18 million barrels  to a monthly total of 261 million barrels.  </P></p>

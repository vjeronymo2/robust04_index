			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Harald Stanghelle] </F>   [Text] A slim majority of the voters would say yes to  Norwegian membership in the EU [European Union] if Finland and  Sweden join, according to the polling firm Opinion.    A poll that Opinion conducted for AFTENPOSTEN confirms the  impression that the yes side is gaining support. Some 41 percent  say yes, 39 percent say no, and 19 percent still have not made  up their minds. This is the first time since the negotiations  started between Norway and the EU that there is a majority in  favor. In January 36 percent said yes and 42 percent said no  when we asked the voters their opinion on Norwegian EU  membership if our two Nordic neighbors were members.    Several polls this month show that the yes side has been  strengthened at the expense of the no side. Opinion's February  poll shows that 37 percent of the voters now say yes to EU  membership unconditionally. A full 48 percent say no, however,  and 15 percent have not decided. So there can be no doubt that  the no side continues to have the upper hand, even though there  has been migration within the electorate in the last two months.  The yes side has advanced by 11 percent since December in  Opinion's polls, and the no side has declined by 6 percent.  Another fact is that the yes side has become more convinced. The  yes alternative "definitely yes" was chosen by 10 percent more  supporters in February than in December.  <H5>  Negotiations </H5>   One important factor in the trends that this and other polls  show may be the strong focus on Norway's negotiations with the  EU. The negotiations have led to the issue becoming more  imminent, and at the same time the main point of the no side's  argument is overshadowed by the tug-of-war going on in Brussels.  Another reason the voters are confident that the government is  protecting Norwegian interests may be the impression created by  what former Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen termed  "rigid Norwegian positions."    According to Opinion's poll there can be little doubt that  the outcome of the negotiations is important to the voters'  stance on the EU. When we asked, What importance do you ascribe  to the outcome of the negotiations in your vote on Norwegian EU  membership? 54 percent said "great" (28 percent) or "some" (26  percent) importance.    The figures also show that a full 58 percent of the  undecided  voters ascribe great importance (40 percent) or some importance  (18 percent) to the negotiation outcome in determining their  final position.    The outcome of the negotiations has the greatest  significance  for Labor Party voters: A full 66 percent say it is of  importance to their view on the EU issue. Only 31 percent of the  Progress Party's voters say the same thing, while the other  parties go from 45 percent (Center Party) to 52 percent  (Christian People's Party).    We find some of the same trends in the underlying data in  the  question that links Finnish and Swedish EU membership to the  Norwegian voters' position. Of the Labor Party's voters, a full  58 percent say yes provided our neighboring countries are  members, and 28 percent say no. If we consider the decidedly  no-leaning Socialist Left Party, 15 percent say yes, and 70  percent say no under the same conditions. The corresponding  figures for the Christian People's Party are 18 and 70. The  background data support the impression that the Center Party is  the purest no party. Even if Sweden and Finland become members,  only 3 percent of the Center Party's voters will say yes to the  EU, 88 percent continue to say no, and the rest are undecided.    Today's poll has two other features worth noting: When the  yes percent rises, the disparity between opinions among voters  in urban and rural areas grows. In the cities there are 41  percent in favor, while there are only 32 percent in favor in  the rural areas. Among the rural voters 55 percent say no, while  the no percentage in the urban areas is 42.    Another interesting feature is that increasing numbers of  Labor voters are saying yes to Norwegian membership. To our  unconditioned question of EU stance, 53 percent of the Labor  voters say yes, while 34 percent say no. The Progress Party is  becoming more of a no party: Fifty percent of the party's voters  are against Norwegian membership, and 35 percent are for.    Opinion's February poll was conducted between Monday [7  February] and Wednesday of this week. It is based on interviews  with 1,003 persons. We always caution against placing too much  importance on a single opinion poll, but several polls in the  last few weeks show the same trend. There can be no doubt that  the February poll is a psychological breakthrough for the yes  side. It is the first time in a long time that a poll shows a  majority in favor of membership under conditions that are  central to the arguments of the yes side. The belief that  nothing can change the Norwegian people's opposition to the EU  has suffered a blow.    Paradoxically, this poll could also have a positive effect  for the no side whose leaders have had trouble keeping their  followers from assuming victory in advance.    EU Membership if Sweden and Finland Are Members: Yes: 41,  No:  39, Undecided: 19 percent.    Importance of Negotiation Outcome: Great: 28, Some: 26,  Little or None: 38, Undecided: 8 percent.  <H5>  Good for Prices, Not for Welfare </H5>   Norwegian EU membership would be good for prices, defense,  security, and the environment, but a drawback for jobs, welfare  institutions, the districts, agriculture, and fisheries.    This is how the voters respond in an extensive poll on how  Norwegians believe EU membership would affect important issues.  Opinion has conducted the poll for AFTENPOSTEN.    The voters do not believe that Norwegian membership in the  EU  would have any overall effect on their own financial situation.  Some 15 percent think membership would be an advantage, 14  percent a drawback, and a full 56 percent believe Norwegian  membership is irrelevant to their own financial situation.    In spite of this, the voters have very clear opinions on  what  membership will mean for important, much-discussed issues. It is  interesting to note that the assessments do not automatically  coincide with each individual's standpoint on the EU.    All of 57 percent think membership would be an advantage for  price levels in Norway. Only 11 percent think it would be a  drawback. We get the same clear-cut response to such issues as  agriculture, districts policy, and fisheries. Only a minority of  the voters, even among those who favor membership, think that  membership is advantageous in these areas.    What is interesting is that as many as 35 percent of the  voters think that EU membership will be disadvantageous to  employment, while only 19 percent think it will be advantageous.  These responses have to be viewed in the context of the notion  of welfare institutions: Some 40 percent of those interviewed  think EU membership would be a drawback to the Norwegian welfare  institutions. Only 11 percent think membership would be an  advantage in this area. In these two very significant areas  Norwegian voters believe that EU membership will lead to decline  in comparison with today's conditions in Norway.    It would appear that the so-called Zhirinovskiy effect is  present when a full 39 percent believe that EU membership would  be an advantage in terms of Norway's defense and security  position. If we are to believe the figures of this poll, an even  closer relationship with our allies seems reassuring. It is also  worth noting that while such groups as Norwegian Environmental  Protection Association is strongly opposed to EU membership, 32  percent believe it would be good for environmental efforts if  Norway joins the EU, while 27 percent do not.     -  EU Membership and Employment--Advantage: 19, Drawback: 35,  Irrelevant: 29, Undecided: 18 percent.    -  EU Membership and  Prices--Advantage: 57, Drawback: 11, Irrelevant: 15, Undecided:  17 percent.    -  EU Membership and Districts Policy--Advantage: 10,  Drawback: 55, Irrelevant: 12, Undecided: 24 percent.    -  EU  Membership and Norway's Defense and Security--Advantage: 39,  Drawback: 12, Irrelevant: 22, Undecided: 28 percent.    -  EU  Membership and Welfare Institutions--Advantage: 11, Drawback:  40, Irrelevant: 25, Undecided: 25 percent.    -  EU Membership and  Environmental Protection Efforts--Advantage: 32, Drawback: 27,  Irrelevant: 18, Undecided: 24 percent.    -  EU Membership and  Norwegian Agriculture--Advantage: 9, Drawback: 68, Irrelevant:  5, Undecided: 18 percent.    -  EU Membership and Norwegian Fisheries  Sector--Advantage: 15, Drawback: 57, Irrelevant: 7, Undecided:  21 percent.    -  EU Membership and Personal Finances--Advantage: 15,  Drawback: 14, Irrelevant: 56, Undecided: 15 percent.</p>

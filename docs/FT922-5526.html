			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / International Company News: Court backs Continental voting rights restrictions HOSTILITIES between Continental, the German tyre company, and Pirelli, its Italian rival and former suitor, heated up yesterday after a court decision. A Hanover court approved the German company's rules on voting rights, annulling a vote by shareholders on the issue last March. In common with a number of large German companies, Continental has a rule which limits voting rights per shareholder to 5 per cent of the total, no matter how big that shareholder's stake. Pirelli, which was in merger talks with Continental for almost 18 months until negotiations broke down last December, said it would challenge the ruling, claiming that voting right restrictions such as those in place at Continental were 'detrimental to the interests of all shareholders'. Pirelli said it believed that voting rights restrictions - in place at a number of large German companies - 'in general negatively influence the value of shares'. The aggressive move comes shortly after it emerged that Pirelli, which owns 5 per cent of Continental and has options over a further 34 per cent of its shares, is launching another challenge to the rule. This will be voted on by Continental shareholders on July 3. In the ruling yesterday, the court found that the outcome of last year's meeting was invalid, on the grounds that Pirelli should have disclosed at the meeting that it spoke for more than 25 per cent of Continental's shares. At the special meeting last March, the motion calling for the the overthrow of the 5 per cent limit, which required a simple majority of more than 50 per cent, was backed by shareholders with 65.97 of the votes. However, the restriction has remained in place pending the courtroom appeal. Speaking at the company's annual press conference last week, Mr Hubertus von Grunberg, Continental's chief executive, said the move from Pirelli to put the issue to shareholders again had to be seen as 'hostile'. Pirelli responded by saying the move was not hostile, but an attempt to clarify the value of its stake. This resurfacing of hostilities comes despite the fact that Continental is holding friendly discussions with Pirelli, with a view to buying some of its non-tyre operations. It is hoping for the Italian company's support for a large rights issue announced earlier this month. The companies have not ruled out the idea of a merger in two or three years, Mr von Grunberg said last week. Analysts have suggested that the latest Pirelli move is, in essence, a negotiation tactic designed to put pressure on Continental amid discussions over Pirelli's non-tyre operations. The situation is complicated by the fact that the Continental management is hoping for the support of Pirelli for its forthcoming rights issue - part of the proceeds of which may be used to buy businesses from Pirelli.</p>

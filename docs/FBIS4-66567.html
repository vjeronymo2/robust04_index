The  Defense Committee met for three hours and discussed the defense  budget, the Kashmir resolution, Sindh operation, reinstatement  of U.S. aid, purchasing important equipment for the army, navy,  and the air force, the situation in Afghanistan, and the  national defense and security.    All the issues discussed in the Defense Committee meeting  are  very important against the background of the regional and  international political situation. However, national defense and  an increase in our armed forces are priority issues because of  the withdrawal of the resolution on human rights violations in  Kashmir that was presented in the UN Human Rights Commission and  the Indian reaction to it. The political and geographical  situation of the region in which Pakistan is located, especially  the Kashmir dispute and the attitude of Indian government about  it, does not allow any Pakistani government to even think about  taking the risk of reducing our armed forces. Pakistan has  always maintained that permanent peace in this region can be  established if the Kashmir issue is resolved according to the UN  resolutions. After it, bilateral discussions with India can be  held to reduce military spending in both countries. However, No  Pakistani government can take a step to ignore its national  security just because the United States or some other country  wants Pakistan to unilaterally sign the NPT or roll back its  nuclear program. Neither can such a decision of a superpower be  imposed on Pakistan.    After assurance by some friendly nations and seeing the  stance of some member nations of the Human Rights Commission,  Pakistan had postponed the resolution on human rights violation  in occupied Kashmir by India. However, the Indian government  reacted to it by refusing permission to Pakistani and Libyan  ambassadors to visit occupied Kashmir. It has not permitted  Amnesty International to visit occupied Kashmir to investigate  the situation there. It even turned down offers by Iran and  other countries to help with reconciliation over Kashmir. India  announced this in response to the Iranian representative's  statement in the United Nations offering to continue work on  reconciliation over Kashmir. The Indian attitude shows that it  is not willing to give any importance to the UN resolution and  give up its customary rigidity over the Kashmir issue.  Therefore, Pakistan has no alternative but to decide not to  reduce its defense budget or reduce its armed forces. Instead,  in the light of bitter experience of the past, Pakistan badly  needs to improve its defense capabilities. The U.S. restrictions  on weapons aid calls for us to focus on purchasing weapons from  other countries and to use all our resources to strengthen our  defense.    In the light of the situation described above, there is no  room for disagreeing with the government's decision. The  decision of the Defense Committee reflects the feelings of the  people. Since these decisions are related to our national  security and independence, it would not be inappropriate to  expect the opposition parties to show their agreement with the  government despite their political and ideological differences  in the greater interests of the nation. These are the kind of  affairs that require all national groups to show full  cooperation and agreement. It is the duty of the government in  this situation to soften its policies in order to get the  opposition's cooperation and work with it. Efforts must be made  to get the support and cooperation from all political groups.  The cooperation of the government and the opposition will  guarantee stability within our administration and the government  will be able to confront the Indian situation with more  confidence.</p>

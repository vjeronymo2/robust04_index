			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ROADBLOCKS TO DAYTIME HOMELESS CENTER CRUMBLE  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian signed legislation Tuesday clearing the way for  construction of the Neil Good Day Center for the Homeless on the fringes of  downtown San Diego.  </P> <P> The proposed $695,000 facility, which has been enmeshed in red tape for more  than three years, would be downtown's first place where the homeless can go  during the day for showers, laundry and other services.  </P> <P> The legislation opens the way for the state Department of Transportation to  sign a lease with the city for $1 a month and administrative fees for a  25,000-square-foot piece of property along Interstate 5 and 17th Street between  K and L streets.  </P> <P> "We hope that this will once and for all be the last obstacle to building this  center," said Frank Landerville, project director for the Regional Task Force  on the Homeless, the group that originated the project. "It seems clear to us  that virtually everyone in the community is in support of this project."  </P> <P> The city, which has signed the proposed lease, expects Caltrans to sign the  lease within the next few weeks, said Paul Downey, spokesman for Mayor Maureen  O'Connor. Landerville also said the homeless task force expects Caltrans to  sign the agreement soon.  </P> <P> San Diego Caltrans officials were not available for comment.  </P> <P> The second step toward building the center is selecting a new contractor. The  first contractor backed out after realizing that he had miscalculated and  underbid himself by about $95,000, Landerville said.  </P> <P> The rebidding process should not delay construction, officials said. New  construction bids for the 5,000-square-foot building and 5,000-square-foot  outdoor lounge are scheduled to be put out in August and a contract is expected  to be signed by late October, said David Allsbrook, projects director for the  Centre City Development Corp., the city's downtown redevelopment agency.  </P> <P> Construction is to begin by late fall and be complete by late April, Allsbrook  said.  </P> <P> Tuesday's legislation appeared to remove the final legal obstacle, declaring  that the tract earmarked for the center is not "excess" Caltrans property and  did not need to be advertised to potential buyers.  </P> <P> A nearby property owner, Weldon W. Griffin, president of Weldon Griffin Realty  &amp; Mortgage Co. in La Mesa, had filed suit seeking to block the proposed  lease between Caltrans and the city.  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge refused to grant a temporary restraining order, and  Tuesday's legislation reaffirms Caltrans' position that the property is not  surplus, meaning that the state agency can use property for future road  expansion.  </P> <P> Griffin declined comment. His attorney, Jon P. Chester, was not available for  comment.  </P> <P> Plans call for the center to accommodate up to 200 homeless people and provide  bathrooms, showers, mail and message service, laundry, storage of personal  belongings and public telephones.  </P> <P> Center staff will assist the homeless with social service and public assistance  programs, mental health and substance abuse counseling, job training, legal  assistance and other services.  </P></p>

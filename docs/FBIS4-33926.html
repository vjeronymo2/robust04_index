			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alexandra Ballestas from the "RPC Television </F> News" newscast]    [Text] Captain Jose Delgado, the deputy director of the  General Consular and Ships Directorate, reported to RPC that  Panama has the largest merchant marine fleet in the world  because it offers many facilities.    [Begin Delgado recording] Panama occupied second place for a  long time. However, due to our aggressive policy, Panama was  able to take first place from Liberia in June 1993. [end  recording]    Capt. Delgado explained that the flagging of ships dropped  considerably when Panama suffered its economic crisis in 1989.    [Begin Delgado recording] We lost a bit less than 2 million  tons during the crisis. Immediately thereafter, in 1990,  however, we started an aggressive program and visited the main  ship owners, participated in the main international maritime  events, and more importantly, attended events at the  International Maritime Organization. This organization is  seated in London, and all the international maritime agreements  and norms are debated there. Our program prompted ship owners  to regain confidence in us, and they have given us their  support. [end recording]    The principal countries that request Panamanian flagging are  Japan, Greece, Hong Kong, and Korea.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Men in the News: Bongs of Big Ben sound the alarm - The ITV Bosses / Raymond Snoddy on Fiasco at Ten The normally unflappable senior ITV executive, Mr Andrew Quinn, allowed himself just one pointed comment as he walked through the central lobby at Westminster on Thursday. 'I wonder if any of them have ever been in business?' he asked of the MPs on the national heritage select committee who had just given him a grilling. The session had been called to consider the ITV companies' view on the future of the BBC. At the last moment it was transformed into a prolonged and occasionally bad-tempered interrogation of ITV executives on how they could dare consider moving a British institution - News at Ten - to an early evening slot. Emotion had already been heightened by the unprecedented intervention of both Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr John Smith, Labour leader, who made it clear they opposed such a move. But the performance that unfolded in Committee Room 15 was still extraordinary. The ITV executives wanted to talk about the business, market and competition background to their proposal and how they were losing out to other channels at 10 o'clock. The MPs on the committee - a majority of them Conservative - wanted to talk about public service broadcasting obligations. If News at Ten perished, the public would no longer see live votes in the House of Commons, and would have to wait until 11pm for late-breaking stories from the US or the evening football results. 'Margaret Thatcher told us not to talk to her about public service broadcasting. We were all told to become market people,' said Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association, the umbrella organisation of the ITV network. On Thursday he was still rubbing his eyes in disbelief at what he saw as the lack of knowledge of some of the MPs, who seemed unaware that the 1990 Broadcasting Act reduced the public service commitments of ITV. If parliament wanted News at Ten to stay put, why did it not say so, Mr Dyke asked. The act simply stated that ITV should run high-quality news 'in prime time', defined as between 6.30pm and 10.30pm. The ITV executives were repeatedly questioned by the committee about why they should be trying to make such an apparently radical change just six months into their new 10-year franchises. 'When you start losing market share, you do something about it. You don't wait for five years,' said Mr Quinn. ITV makes 70 per cent of its annual Pounds 1.6bn revenues in prime time, so there was a commercial imperative to win every time slot in the ratings to maximise revenues, he argued. The ferocity of the debate over News at Ten has meant a busy and uncomfortable week for some of the movers and shakers of ITV. Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Television, the London weekday company, and also chairman of ITN, was giving private assurances that moving News at Ten had not been his idea, although Carlton Television executives had clearly supported the concept. As ITN chairman, he issued a statesmanlike comment on Wednesday, saying: 'It is clearly right for the television companies to take time to allow for a measured consideration of the issues.' Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central Television, the second-largest ITV company, said of the News at Ten debacle: 'We have handled the whole thing very badly. This has obviously hurt ITV.' Mr Hill has consistently argued that there should be fewer, larger ITV companies, and that the rules preventing the nine largest taking each other over should be relaxed. The fear is that, as Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, pointed out, hostility in parliament to the notion of moving News at Ten could easily spill over into opposition to relaxing the takeover rules. Another leading ITV boss, Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of London Weekend Television, wrote rather plaintively to the Daily Telegraph, pointing out that the British attachment to ancient regiments, schools clubs and hospitals was legendary. 'But to a time?' he inquired. By the middle of the week, Sir Christopher was giving up any hope that changing the time of the evening news could be considered rationally - at least until the dust had settled. To Mr Gerry Robinson, the softly spoken chief executive of the Granada Group, the episode shows just how difficult it is to reach sensible commercial policy decisions when you are dealing with 15 companies. 'It was much more muddle than conspiracy,' said Mr Robinson, who believes that a rationalisation of the number of ITV companies is now needed. The immediate row over News at Ten is likely to fade as ITV chiefs try to distance themselves from the embarrassment. At Monday's meeting of the ITV Council, which brings together the chief executives of the companies, there will be calls for further research and a prolonged period of consideration. What has been highlighted is the unresolved contradictions and conflicts in the 1990 Broadcasting Act between commercialism and public service broadcasting obligations. This is just the first skirmish. The issue is unlikely to go away as the speed of technical change accelerates and competition increases. Although ITV is still riding high in the ratings, with an 8 to 10 per cent lead over the BBC, the 15 regional companies face a series of potent threats and uncertainties. Channel 4, which since the beginning of this year has been selling its airtime competitively against ITV, is estimated to have taken as much as 18.5 per cent of television advertising in some months. Mr Stuart Butterfield, Channel 4 director of marketing and sales, says that some advertisers are now buying national channels such as Channel 4, GMTV, the breakfast station and satellite television first, before going on to negotiate with the ITV companies. Back in 1989 Mr Dick Emery, now marketing strategy director at ITV, forecast in a speech that, if Channel 4 was allowed to sell its advertising nationally, the impact 'would be dramatic'. As a result of growing competition, ITV could lose 4 per cent of its revenues this year, a serious matter in a largely fixed-cost business. Its costs include: a Pounds 540m network programme budget for 1993; an annual Pounds 53.6m inflation-linked news supply contract over five years with Independent Television News. In addition, the companies will pay the government Pounds 367m this year - the proceeds of competitive tenders for new licences and a slice of advertising revenue. Under the old system, it would have been about Pounds 150m. The Independent Television Commission, the regulatory body, suggested this week that many channels could be created by moving to digital rather than the existing analogue broadcasts. Unless ITV gets its hands on some of those channels, according to Mr Guy Lamming, media analyst at James Capel, the stockbroker, 'it will be terminally bad news'. In September, British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite venture, plans to launch a subscription package of 14 channels for Pounds 5.99 a month - free to existing subscribers. The consortium, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake, hopes to increase the package to as many as 20 channels. Mr Dyke concedes that by 2000 - certainly by 2005 - cable and satellite could be in most UK homes. Further uncertainty for ITV appeared this week when Granada paid Pounds 67m for a 15 per cent stake in London Weekend Television. This helped to push up the share price of other ITV companies which might be prime takeover targets  -Central, Scottish and Anglia. Such companies are now valued on the expectation that the law will be changed to allow takeovers. If it does not, as James Capel says, 'their share price could come whizzing down'. The ownership dilemma is compounded by the fact that, from January 1, European Community companies will find it easier to take over an ITV company whether or not the rules are relaxed for the ITV companies. Mr Robinson of Granada believes it inevitable that someone will come into the UK market from the continent. If the barriers to ITV companies taking each other over come down, then Mr Green of Carlton and Mr Robinson of Granada are well placed to become the dominant players in the industry because they have the weight of large corporations behind them. Meanwhile, as the companies press ahead with cost-cutting and streamlining to meet competition, they will do so with the bongs of Big Ben still introducing News at Ten - whatever comedy Channel 4 chooses to schedule against it.</p>

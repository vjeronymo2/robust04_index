			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Texas Inst to enter PC chip sector TEXAS Instruments, one of the largest US semiconductor manufacturers, will today announce its entry into the market for personal computer microprocessor chips with the introduction of its own version of an Intel-designed device. Texas Instruments could become a formidable challenger to Intel, which is already facing increased competition from Advanced Micro Devices and other chip companies that have produced 'clones' of its leading microprocessor products. In advance of Texas Instrument's announcement, Intel yesterday announced that it would slash the price of its 486SX microprocessors by 50 per cent in the third quarter of this year. Intel aims to steer computer makers away from the older 386 generation of microprocessors toward the 486. In particular, the company aims to take advantage of the high growth in low-cost personal computers through mass merchants in the US. 'Now for the about the same price, computer users will be able to buy an Intel 486SX based system that outperforms any 386-based system on the market,' including those containing competitors' versions of the 386, said Mr Paul Otellini, vice-president and general manage of Intel's microprocessor group. Intel said its price cuts were not related to Texas Instruments' anticipated announcement. However, TI's product introduction might provoke a legal battle between Texas Instruments and Intel, pitting two of the largest US semiconductor manufacturers against one another. Intel has filed suit against other chipmakers that have launched 'clones' of its microprocessors, including Advanced Micro Devices, Chips &amp; Technologies and Cyrix. Although Intel and Texas Instruments have a long-standing agreement to cross license each other's patents, Intel may have other grounds for complaint, industry analysts predicted.</p>

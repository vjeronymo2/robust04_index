			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROP. 60 GRIDLOCK  </P> <P> Regarding the Speaking Out article by Jenny Erickson ("Property Tax Transfers  Hit Gridlock," July 16):  </P> <P> The essence of government is to implement laws and serve the people.  Apparently, this is not the case in the offices of the assessor and tax  collector.  </P> <P> I was outraged upon finding that Proposition 60 was being "bungled" and stalled  in the Hall of Administration bureaucracy. As a result, thousands of senior  citizens who have sold their homes and re-purchased residences in Los Angeles  County under Proposition 60 may have tax liens upon their properties. Upon  investigation, many homeowners who have filed their Proposition 60 papers find  inadequate administration of the program, thus jeopardizing titles to their  properties.  </P> <P> As a city founder and former councilman, I assumed leadership of our state  volunteer organization upon the passing of Howard Jarvis. I know the system,  and how it should work. And, I can tell you -- frankly -- that Howard must be  turning over in his grave thinking about how a county with its $9.6 billion  budget, is balancing its cash flow by excess collections of taxes from senior  citizens.  </P> <P> Now, if the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors needs help in putting this  Proposition 60 program on track, we would be willing to help them straighten  out this mess fast. Otherwise, the taxpayers of the county, who have been  affected by Proposition 60 adversely, may have to resort to class-action  litigation.  </P> <P> I hope these public officials realize the seriousness and immediacy of this  problem area.  </P> <P> ERNEST DYNDA  </P> <P> Agoura Hills  </P> <P>  Dynda is president of the United Organizations of Taxpayers Inc.  </P></p>

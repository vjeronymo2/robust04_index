			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Mexican power sale setback MEXICO'S ambitious programme to privatise electricity generation has received a blow after investors pulled out of buying a plant in the northern state of Coahuila. The Carbon II plant was to be sold for Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) to a consortium 49 per cent owned by Mission Energy, a subsidiary of Southern California Edison, and 51 per cent owned by Mexico's Grupo Acerero del Norte and Organizacion Autrey. It was to be the first privately-owned electricity plant in Mexico. However, US environmentalists complained that pollution from the plant would blow over the border into the Big Bend National Park in Texas, and demanded that smokestack scrubbers be fitted at a cost of about Dollars 300m. Such scrubbers are demanded by US law, but not by Mexico. Mr John Bryson, chief executive of Southern California Edison, said in a statement issued by Mexico's energy ministry that circumstances were not favourable to conclude the deal. The problems over the plant have highlighted growing pressure on Mexico to upgrade environmental regulations to the levels in the US even though this is not required by Mexican law. Mexico has recently been willing to cede to the US over the environment, in an effort to win support for the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>

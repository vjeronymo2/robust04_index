			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / World Trade News: US set to spill beans on its EC oilseeds 'retaliation' - Dollars 1bn in sanctions being considered in Washington to offset 'unfair' European subsidies THE BUSH administration is debating a list of Dollars 1bn in sanctions it is threatening to impose on European Community products in retaliation for the EC's oilseeds regime which the US claims has cost it billions in soyabean sales. Foods, wines and beer are likely to head the list, but a number of US officials believe it might provoke a greater outcry if industrial products are included. The question has been forwarded to the Bush cabinet for discussion, perhaps as early as this week, after an interagency group committee was unable to agree. For its part, the EC has yet to decide how to respond to the US threats. It is said to be considering a compensation proposal. Complicating the issue is the agreement reached last week by the EC farm ministers to reform the Common Agricultural Policy, and the possibility that the changes ultimately will at least partly address US complaints by reducing EC oilseeds production. The US made public its intention on April 30 to impose sanctions after the EC blocked a report finding that EC oilseeds subsidies were illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The EC indicated that it would accept the report at a Gatt Council meeting in June and at the same time propose a remedy. Meanwhile, the Bush Administration, unasked, is getting industry's ideas. The National Association of Wheat Growers, for example, has recommended new tariffs on pasta and wheat gluten to level the 'uneven playing field'. US imports of EC pasta, made from heavily subsidised wheat, have increased 70 per cent in the past decade. Both the Uruguay Round and the oilseeds dispute are expected to be on the agenda when Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC commissioner in charge of trade, and other EC officials meet today with Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state; Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, and Mr Edward Madigan, the US agriculture secretary. Without a breakthrough Mrs Hills is likely to roll out a list containing Dollars 2bn in sanctions for 30 days of public comment, after which the list will be pared. Mrs Hills talks of how she was promised 'with a handshake' that the subsidies would be 'fixed' in time for the 1991 growing season. US patience has been 'rather endless,' she said, but if the Gatt process is to have any credibility, she must act. The role of domestic politics cannot be dismissed. Mrs Hills says President Bush has clung fast to his free-trade principles, though only 35-40 per cent of US farmers support his position in the Uruguay Round. There are no senators who do not have farmers in their districts, she said. 'There are some districts that are 100 per cent agricultural and could indeed tip the election.' The EC oilseeds programme, which set Community prices at about double the prevailing world levels, was designed to draw Community farmers away from surplus grain production. Between 1980-1990, EC producers more than tripled the land area devoted to EC production of rapeseed, sunflower seed and soyabeans, and boosted planting from 4m to 13m acres. At the same time US exports of soyabeans fell 63 per cent. In 1987 the American Soyabean Association gave up waiting for farm reform in the Uruguay Round to solve the problem and filed a case against the EC oilseeds regime, which the US trade representative took to the Gatt. After many delays, a Gatt panel concluded in 1990 that the subsidies impaired the advantage the EC had promised when in 1962 it agreed to 'bind' its oilseed import tariffs at zero duty. After more postponements, the EC revised its oilseeds regime. Instead of making payments to oilseeds processors for using EC oilseeds, it would make them directly to EC farmers. In the US view, this was an improvement because the regime no longer discriminated against foreign oilseeds, but it still subsidised production and thus devalued the advantage promised when zero tariffs were negotiated. The US returned to the Gatt, where a panel again found against the EC oilseeds regime. The EC blocked adoption of the panel's report on April 30 but promised a 'concrete proposal' for settlement before the June 1992 Gatt Council meeting. The US indicated that it would impose sanctions if the proposal was not satisfactory. EC officials, who complain that the US is impatient and impulsive, say the Bush administration is acting 'totally without justification' and lacks legal basis because the oilseeds report is still pending. American officials see the EC as consistently delaying the inevitable; they believe that by blocking the panel report the EC is violating the spirit of the Gatt and they have the right to take action.</p>

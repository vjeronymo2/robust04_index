			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Books: An outsider who never quite made it - The politician from Birmingham who exercised influence without much power JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN: ENTREPRENEUR IN POLITICS by Peter T. Marsh Yale University Press, 725 pages The life of Joseph Chamberlain was so full and varied that his official biographer, JL Garvin, needed 15 years to complete the first three volumes, then gave up. Julian Amery picked up the baton and took another 20 years to complete the story. Amery's work was published in 1969. There have been other, shorter books, but the long, detached study comes only now from the North American historian, Peter T. Marsh. One can see the difficulties. Chamberlain conforms to no recognisable pattern in British politics. He grew up in London, but made his name in Birmingham. He left school at 16, but was already pretty well educated. His father put him into business. In Birmingham he became known as the screw king, because it was screws that his companies manufactured. He was arguably the most successful mayor in the history of British local government. Under his stewardship in the mid-1870s, no corner or institution in Birmingham was left untouched by his reforms. Then he went into national politics. For a time he flirted with Newcastle, and had a fling at Sheffield where he failed. So he fell back on Birmingham which provided his political base for the rest of his life. The political society of the time did not understand such an outsider. London's reaction to Chamberlain was distinctly snobbish. There was a terrible row about his putting up his relatives for the Reform Club. Years later, when he was Colonial Secretary and in the absence of the prime minister had to entertain the Kaiser at Windsor with the Queen, a foreign office mandarin noted: 'We can only hope that Birmingham has not given himself away.' In short, he was thought to be unsophisticated. His political career, though it had some peaks, was turbulent throughout. Some of the troughs, and the reason why he did not make it to Downing Street, were undoubtedly of his own making. Chamberlain was initially a radical Liberal, much more so than Gladstone. But, as Marsh demonstrates, it was more his personal rivalry with Gladstone rather than a difference of political beliefs that led to the two men falling out. Chamberlain could have sought a compromise on Irish policy; instead he became a Unionist, Gladstone stuck to Home Rule and the party split. The other result was that Gladstone stayed as leader. Chamberlain was to change his mind again, and damage other parties, on other subjects. He became the great imperialist and advocate of tariff reform, having once been in favour of free trade. He may thus go down as a wrecker rather than as a politician of achievement. Yet there is something in the phrase that he exercised influence without much power. Most of the social reforms of the late 19th century had something to do with him: education, pensions, compensation for industrial accidents. He was politically astute in realising that the Conservatives could be a reforming party because they drew support from both ends of the social spectrum. There were more tangible monuments. Chamberlain founded the University of Birmingham. As Colonial Secretary he was a great promoter of tropical medicine. He was partly responsible for the founding of the state of Nigeria. True, there are murkier sides. Even now it is still not clear how far he gave implicit encouragement to the Jameson raid in South Africa; certainly he gave a very indiscreet briefing to the African correspondent of The Times, who had a direct line to Cecil Rhodes. On the whole, however, Chamberlain was his own man. Winston Churchill wrote of him in Great Contemporaries in 1937: in British affairs 'Joe was the one who made the weather'. Marsh adds perceptively: 'But no man could change the climate'. The rest of the country was not like Birmingham. Chamberlain's entrepreneurial career peaked in the mid-1870s, just as the US and Germany were beginning to overtake Britain's industrial capacity. In politics he thought that the development of the empire could be used to raise the standard of living of the British working class. In the most devastating comment of all, Marsh concludes that the industrialist turned statesman thus overlooked the technological advances being made elsewhere. He turned his back on innovation. The truth is that Chamberlain had the good German virtues. He admired Bismarck for his social policies and belief in education, but became an imperialist partly because he did not want British possessions overseas to pass to the Germans. Chamberlain remained essentially a loner: the nicest story about him is that musically he was so tone deaf that, even as the arch man of empire, he could not recognise the national anthem.</p>

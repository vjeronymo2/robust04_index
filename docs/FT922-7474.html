			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Observer: Our selection So who should the UK premier pick? The experience of other countries shows there's nothing to be lost by playing safe. The Treasury favours Eddie George, the current deputy governor. Sir David Walker has his fanciers. Conventional City wisdom is that Warburg's Sir David Scholey would be ideal. But surely Major ought to look more widely. In the US, someone like the London School of Economics' Professor Charles Goodhart might be a contender. Then again how about an industrialist like Courtaulds' Sir Christopher Hogg?. Not only is he a Bank director but, as chairman of Reuters, he knows a thing or two about financial markets. Observer's tip, however, is Bruce Pattullo. One of Britain's best bankers, he's a leading light at the Bank of Wales besides being Governor of the Bank of Scotland. At 25-1 against, Ladbrokes' current odds for him might well be worth taking.</p>

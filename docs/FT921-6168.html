			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Midland Bank The question one has to ask about Midland is whether the bank that fell hardest is now the best recovery hope. On an initial reading of yesterday's results that appears to be the case. Thanks to a Pounds 107m profit in the second half, Midland has generated the wherewithal to still leave over Pounds 100m in distributable reserves. Assuming the momentum can be kept up, the bank should be able to produce a fairly rapid recovery in profits. Growth at the net level should be even faster because a substantial backlog of unrelieved Advance Corporation Tax will reduce its tax charge. The striking thing about the profit swing between the two halves of last year, however, was that it was almost entirely due to the Pounds 150m fall in provisions. That does not mean the bank was massaging the charge: its 3.9 per cent ratio of outstanding provisions to lending is high compared with its competitors. But it does expose a disconcerting failure of trading profit to improve in the second half compared with the first. Admittedly the full year figures do show a 28 per cent improvement compared with 1990, but the second half performance suggests a plateau. Midland has already pared costs to the bone. There is a limit to how much further it can go. On its own admission it cannot risk the quality of its service. The challenge for the new management is thus to keep costs under control while securing a steady increase in income. Only then will it have pulled off the full recovery the market appeared to anticipate with yesterday's 9 per cent surge in the share price.</p>

During the Cabinet meeting last Tuesday, the president  directed the immediate establishment of a Philippine council to  pursue the implementation of the BIMP-EAGA. He also ordered  various government agencies to undertake activities for the  operationalization of the EAGA and to identify additional  flagship development projects in Mindanao to support the same.    To boost awareness and speed up implementation, Mr. Ramos  likewise ordered the creation of additional investment and  tourism promotion councils (ITPCs) in major cities of Mindanao  to conduct awareness campaign on the BIMP-EAGA.

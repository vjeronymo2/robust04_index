			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Technology: Video publishing put in the picture - Worth Watching The availability of low-price, high-performance personal computers, laser printers and sophisticated page composition software ushered in the desktop publishing revolution. Now desktop video publishing has arrived with a plug-in card for Apple Macintosh PCs. Called VideoVision, it mixes computer graphics, text, video and sound. Tapes can be tailor-made for viewing on any standard VCR. Previously, prohibitively expensive equipment was needed to produce professional-quality videotapes. But the single slot digital card - which costs Pounds 1,995 - has built-in video input, video output and 24-bit graphic display capabilities and an external connector panel for video and audio connections. The card fits into a slot on any Macintosh or Quadra computer (except the Macintosh IIsi) and works with Apple's Quicktime multimedia software. Radius: US, 408 434 1010; UK, 0635 38531.</p>

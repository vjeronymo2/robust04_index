			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (6): Industry prepares to enter a new phase - Alice Rawsthorn finds cautious confidence among design consultants in the aftermath of recession There is a modest, though unmistakable air of optimism among Europe's design consultancies as the industry slowly but steadily emerges from recession. Design - the business which expanded so rapidly in the 1980s, has had a gruelling time in the early 1990s. Some of the industry's best known names have disappeared in a maelstrom of takeovers, receiverships and redundancies. But the economic tide is now turning. The design business in most European countries is coming out of the doldrums and is poised for recovery. 'We've been through a hellish period,' says Martin Beck, chairman of Fitch, the London-based retail design business which was forced to mount an emergency financial restructuring in 1992. 'But the worst is over. Business is more buoyant and there is so much pent-up demand in the European design market that the long term prospects are excellent.' As the industry prepares to enter a new phase in its fortunes, the critical questions are whether the recession has wrought long term changes in its structure, and which type of consultancies will be best placed to benefit from the expansion of the European design market in the future. Perhaps the most accurate illustration of the scale of the changes within the industry is the annual league table compiled by Design Week magazine in the UK (arguably Europe's most mature design market, but also the base for most of the consultancies operating on a European basis.) Design Week recorded a steady decline in the fee income of the 100 largest consultancies in 1990, 1991 and 1992 until 1993, when it registered a 2 per cent increase to Pounds 307m. Yet last year's increase means that the 100 largest consultancies are still earning considerably less than in the peak year of 1989, when their combined fee income totalled Pounds 429m. Furthermore, the Design Week survey suggests that the bigger businesses have borne the brunt of the recession. The number of companies employing over 100 designers has fallen from 19 in 1991 to eight today. The fastest growing consultancies are those employing 25 to 49 people. At first glance, the contraction of the big design groups appears to reverse one of the key themes of the industry during the 1980s - the transformation of strong, local design consultancies into European networks working in different countries across the continent. In the past, international design projects tended to be the province of high profile individuals who had formed close personal relationships with their clients. The new breed of retail, packaging and corporate identity consultancies were working on a larger scale. They mimicked the advertising industry by opening offices and studios to sell their services and implement projects across Europe. The leading US consultancies such as Landor, part of the Young &amp; Rubicam marketing group, and Siegel &amp; Gale, a Saatchi &amp; Saatchi subsidiary, also expanded their European operations. The rigours of the recession forced some companies to freeze their European expansion plans; others closed their new offices and studios. The multinational marketing services groups, such as Euro-RSCG of France and the UK's WPP, streamlined their design interests by merging some of their subsidiaries. The industry now faces the dilemma of deciding how to service its international clients in the future. The market for multinational projects remained reasonably buoyant throughout the recession: indeed, some UK consultancies could not have survived otherwise. The market also has considerable long term growth potential as the activities of the design industry's clients become increasingly international. 'We have no choice but to be a European business,' says Brian Boylan, deputy chairman of Woolf Olins, the London-based corporate identity consultancy. 'It isn't simply a question of picking up new jobs outside the UK. Our UK clients are nearly all international companies and we can't do our work for them properly unless we operate in a European context.' Perhaps the most useful lesson of the recession was that the industry's finances are too fragile to support advertising agency-style networks of offices and studios. It is instructive that one of the few large London consultancies to have expanded steadily during the recession is Pentagram, which has always stuck stubbornly to its original concept of operating as a co-operative of individual designers. 'It's no secret how we've done it,' says John McConnell, a partner. 'It's because we stuck to our guns and resisted the temptation to expand in the 1980s.' The new consultancies which have sprung up in the early 1990s have adopted a similarly prudent policy. One new area of design to have emerged in the recession is branding, or brand development, which has grown out of the packaging design business and spawned dynamic young consultancies such as Scott Libby Heming and Wickens Tutt Southgate, both of which are based in London but are already executing European projects. 'We saw what happened to the design groups which expanded aggressively in the 1980s,' says Mark Wickens, a founder of Wickens Tutt Southgate. 'We're absolutely committed to expansion in Europe but we'll do it in a much more focused way.' Meanwhile, the established consultancies have pared down their operations and are now operating in Europe on a more flexible basis. 'It's horses for courses,' says Brian Boylan of Wolff Olins. 'We've thought long and hard about how to handle international projects. The fact is, we don't have stereotypical clients, so we can't offer them standard solutions. We've got to be flexible.' Woolf Olins still has an office in Spain and has formed associations with local companies in Italy and Portugal. But it services its German and Scandinavian clients from its London headquarters. Similarly, Landor Europe operates across the continent from full-scale offices in London and Paris, with satellite operations in Madrid and Milan. This flexible approach to European design projects may last longer than the industry expected. This is partly because of the changes in the industry's relationship with its clients. The financial pressures of recession, coupled with the changes within mass-marketing, have prompted many large multinational companies to reassess the way they work with external suppliers, including design consultancies. Some companies have set up internal design departments to co-ordinate their design activities. These departments often handle the implementational side of projects, leaving external consultancies to concentrate on the conceptual and advisory side of design and thereby reducing the need for large local teams of people working on the ground with clients. Similarly, advances in technology have reduced the cost and complexity of orchestrating cross-border projects from different countries. Fitch uses video conferencing and modems to link its US and European offices. Its employees also use the Internet to communicate among themselves and with their clients. Fitch is putting its own experience with new technology into practise by diversifying into new multi-media fields such as home shopping systems. 'Technology will play a central role in the future of the design industry,' says Martin Beck. 'In some respects the newer firms have an advantage over the older companies because they are starting fresh with technology at the core of their business.'</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Beijing breaks ranks over N Korea's nuclear stance CHINA yesterday clashed with other members of the International Atomic Energy Agency's governing board over North Korea's nuclear programme. At a meeting of the 35 governors in Vienna, China refused to back a motion referring the dispute over inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities to the United Nations Security Council. Talks are due to continue today. An IAEA official said the board could overrule China with a majority vote. However, Algeria, chairing the meeting, urged consensus. The meeting was also expected to call on Mr Hans Blix, the agency's director general, to continue efforts to find a way out of the dispute. On February 25, the IAEA gave North Korea a month to agree to inspections of two facilities near its Yongbyon nuclear complex. North Korea announced 15 days later that it was withdrawing from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which it signed in 1985. Western governments have been counting on a co-operative attitude from China in their efforts to persuade North Korea to change its mind. But Beijing has already made clear it opposes the imposition of Security Council sanctions. South Korea yesterday continued to urge a cautious response and suggested that the problem could be resolved through diplomacy. President Kim Young-sam said he expected talks between the two Koreas could resume soon following the recent end of the US-South Korean 'Team Spirit' military exercise that Pyongyang cited as one reason for its rejection of the treaty. Meanwhile, the North Korean ambassador to Vienna indicated yesterday there was room for compromise on inspections. Mr Kim Kwang-sup told South Korea's state television that Pyongyang is willing to accept 'temporary inspections' of nuclear facilities by the IAEA.</p>

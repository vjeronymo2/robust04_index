			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BINGO RAID EVIDENCE PRESENTED;  </P> <P> IDENTITY INC.: TORN-UP CHECKS FOUND IN TRASH CANS WERE UNCASHED PAYMENTS FROM  WORKERS' RELATIVES, POLICE SAY.  </P> <P> Some relatives and wives of workers at the city's biggest charity bingo parlor  might have played for free because their checks were found torn up in a trash  can during a recent police raid, according to evidence presented Monday during  an administrative hearing.  </P> <P> The uncashed checks -- including one written by the wife of an off-duty Los  Angeles police officer who worked as a security guard -- were pieced together  by police and presented during the third day of a city hearing that could lead  to revocation of the bingo license held by Identity Inc.  </P> <P> City investigators said they believe the destroyed checks were payment for  bingo cards and that those who wrote them ended up playing the game for free,  an illegal misappropriation of charitable funds.  </P> <P> Edith Ryan, founder of the Woodland Hills charity that helps disabled people,  is accused of illegally paying those who run the games, a violation of state  law. Three former workers have testified that they were paid between $100 and  $300 a night. Ryan has denied these claims and has said her accusers lied and  stole money from the Identity bingo operation.  </P> <P> The accusations of the volunteers are under investigation by the Los Angeles  Police Department's Internal Affairs Division, and Monday's hearing was  monitored by a sergeant with that unit.  </P> <P> Two current Police Department officers, who said they worked off-duty at  Identity, testified Monday that they were unaware of any illegal payments to  the volunteers.  </P> <P> The checks were introduced by Assistant City Atty. Byron Boeckman after Ken  Welch, a bingo volunteer at Identity, testified on behalf of Ryan that he was  not paid to help run the games.  </P> <P> One of the checks found during the Aug. 19 search was written by Welch's  mother. The $65 check represents the amount charged for three packs of bingo  cards, a standard amount purchased by players.  </P> <P> In questioning Welch, Boeckman indicated that a financial benefit to his mother  also benefited Welch, who lives with his mother.  </P> <P> Also, a $65 check written by Nancy Hurwitz, the wife of Los Angeles police  Officer Ken Hurwitz, was found among the discarded checks. Ken Hurwitz was  working off-duty as a security guard the night of the raid.  </P> <P> Two other torn checks totaling $115 and drawn on accounts of relatives of  Identity volunteers were also found in the trash can, and a check for $97  written by a woman described by investigators as a friend of Ryan's was  recovered.  </P> <P> In early testimony Monday, Ken Hurwitz said he never saw any illegal payments  to workers at Identity while working as a paid security guard. Under state law,  security guards can be paid with bingo proceeds although the volunteers who run  the game can not.  </P> <P> After testifying, Hurwitz declined to discuss whether his wife or other  officers' wives played for free.  </P> <P> Another police officer, Ronald Ponzi, also said he never saw any payments to  volunteers or heard workers discussing the issue.  </P> <P> Last week, three former Identity workers made accusations to a Times reporter  that officers knew of the payments to volunteers. Under oath Monday, Debra  Basham and Cindy Houseman, two of the three former workers who said they were  paid, testified that they believed officers were present when volunteers talked  about compensation.  </P> <P> "Conversations? I'm sure they overheard conversations," Basham said.  </P> <P> Ryan's attorneys sought to discredit Basham's testimony by reading from sworn  statments she made in June, 1984, denying that she had profited from working  for Identity.  </P> <P> At the start of Monday's hearing Ryan was allowed to respond under oath to two  Times articles that repeated allegations of possible police misconduct. She  said contrary to news reports, she instructed officers to closely monitor  workers whom she suspected could be "diverting or mishandling funds."  </P></p>

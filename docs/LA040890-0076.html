			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIVIA CORRECTIONS  </P> <P> I am amazed that with your wealth of travel information you would allow such  serious mistakes on the part of Robert Guenther's "Can You Guess?" He places  the Tiger Balm Gardens in Singapore rather than Hong Kong, where they belong,  and has the Pitti Palace transferred from Florence to Venice. Shame on you.  </P> <P> JACK D.

The modernization experiment  will be initiated in the Turku-Pori military province and will  involve 3,000 conscripts plus a few hundred members of the  regular cadre at three defense installations.    The experiment will involve the previous year's last class  and this year's first class of the Pori Brigade, the Turku  Coastal Regiment, and the Varsinais Suomi Antiaircraft Regiment.    The development project is being directed by Major General  Hannu Sarkio, the commander of the Turku-Pori military province.  According to Sarkio, the reason for the experiment is the ever  more critical assessment of the training by the conscripts  themselves.    The Armed Forces have also become concerned that an  increasing number of conscripts are prematurely terminating  their tour of duty. Last year as many as 8 percent of the age  group terminated their tour of duty prematurely. The shortening  of the alternative civilian service option also appears  attractive to increasing numbers of youth, according to Sarkio.    In Sarkio's opinion, the training could be made more  efficient. This might decrease the number of premature  terminations. Sarkio feels that the training should not be  interrupted by factors like "the drill instructors are no fun"  and they "raise the hackles of the conscripts."    If the drill instructor does not have respect, then Sarkio  feels "something must be done." "Exhausted or weary instructors,  who just cannot get it done anymore, could get transfers to  duties in, for example, headquarters, maintenance, and  administration," says Sarkio.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Information received on county facilities indicates that there are instances where detainees or inmates have been transferred to other facilities due to the insufficient number of accessible cells. Of 11 counties surveyed by the California Board of corrections, four expressed a need for more accessible cells, and the operators of Texas county jails surveyed indicated that inmates with disabilities are relocated when accessible cells are full.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPRM also asked whether there are instances in which persons with a disability are sentenced or assigned to facilities other than a prison or jail due to a lack of accessibility. A few comments indicated that this does occur. One State agency noted that some prison operators may house persons with disabilities in State or local hospitals or medical centers. Among States responding to the ASCA, only one State noted that persons with disabilities are housed in facilities other than jails or prisons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The issues of scoping and dispersion are closely related. For clarity, however, this discussion first addresses the minimum number of accessible cells and then addresses issues of dispersion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPRM sought recommendations on the minimum number or percentage of general housing cells in correctional facilities and holding cells in detention facilities that should be accessible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A strong majority of the comments, most from State correctional agencies, recommended minimum percentages of either one percent or two percent. The Illinois Department of Corrections, whose comments were supported by 22 States and Puerto Rico, recommended a maximum of two percent scoping for general housing cells. A few comments recommended less than one percent, and several commenters recommended either three, four, or five percent. The Bureau of Prisons recommended that three percent of the cells be adaptable, which means that the cell can be easily converted to an accessible cell when needed, but which is not fully accessible as part of new construction. Information provided by commenters on existing State codes indicates that the minimum percentage among States varies, ranging from Washington State's one percent to Wisconsin's five percent. The Florida Department of Corrections noted that its facilities are designed so that two percent of the housing cells are accessible, which it considers adequate, if not excessive, for the determined need. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments concerning detention facilities, most at the local level, recommended one cell for each facility, such as a police station, or recommended percentages of one or two percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Board has specified in ADAAG 12.4.1(1) that a minimum of three percent, but not less than one, of holding or general housing cells or rooms be accessible in new construction. This requirement is consistent with the recommendation made by the Bureau of Prisons, although it had recommended adaptable, as opposed to fully accessible, cells. The Board has not specified adaptable cells or rooms because it considers the concept of adaptability impractical in the jail or prison environment. Even if adaptability were required, the clear floor space necessary for accessible cells would most likely be provided as part of new construction due to the structural requirements of cells. Further, other elements often provided as adaptable features in other types of facilities, such as grab bars, would most likely be installed as part of construction so that they could be secured to the degree necessary in the prison environment. A few commenters stated that while grab bars are easy to secure in new construction, to do so as an alteration or retrofit may necessitate reconstruction of cell walls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The three percent scoping requirement, which is slightly higher than the percentage recommended by a majority of commenters, is also based on certain additional considerations. One consideration involves the aging of the prison population and existing data demonstrating that the prevalence of disability increases with age. A few comments, including one from a State disability agency, called attention to this consideration, but they did not provide any survey data or documentation on the aging of the prison population. One State correctional authority commented: ``There are very few instances where the inmate's disability occurred while incarcerated *&blank;*&blank;* [but] because of lengths of sentences, we are beginning to deal more and more with an aging population.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another concern stems from comments made on retrofit and alterations in detention and correctional occupancies. These comments, which are further discussed below under ADAAG 12.4.5 (Alterations to Cells or Rooms), raised concerns about the significant structural difficulties that exist in making existing jail or prison cells accessible. Consequently, it is particularly essential that a sufficient level of access be provided in such occupancies as part of new construction. A guideline that ensures that the need for accessible holding or general housing cells is met in new construction will undoubtedly facilitate detention and corrections operators in fulfilling their obligations under the ADA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The dispersion of accessible cells is another issue of strong concern to many detention and corrections officials. The Board indicated in the NPRM that it may require cells to be dispersed within facilities consistent with ADAAG requirements for the integration of accessible spaces and elements. The concept of an integrated environment may be limited in the restricted environment of prisons and jails. The NPRM sought information in this area in order to determine whether dispersion of accessible cells or rooms was necessary or justified and, if so, to what degree. The NPRM asked questions about dispersion within an entire facility and within individual housing units or buildings. A third level of dispersion, raised by many corrections officials, concerned dispersion within an entire prison system at the State or local level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many State and some local correctional officials felt that flexibility and discretion were necessary in determining where inmates with disabilities are housed within a correctional system. It was recommended that these guidelines take into account existing assignment policies or practices, including those that determine which facilities will house inmates with disabilities. Some systems have certain locations or facilities which are considered more suitable for such inmates because programs, services, supervision, and necessary medical treatment are more effectively provided in some locations. Certain assignment policies could make it unlikely that an inmate with a disability will be assigned to a specific facility, including one that is newly constructed. A corrections system may have a policy of assigning persons with certain severe disabilities to a prison more fully served by, or in closer proximity to, a major medical center. Representative of this concern was a comment from the City of New York indicating that its correctional system already has or is in the process of constructing facilities that will accommodate inmates with disabilities. They indicated that other facilities, including those that may be constructed in the future, should not be required to provide accessible cells since inmates with disabilities will not be assigned to these locations under current policy. Many of these commenters argued that accessibility should be addressed in regard to a city or State's correctional system as a whole instead of at each building or facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Roche advances 29% to SFr1.9bn ROCHE, the Swiss pharma-ceutical and chemicals group, yesterday reported in a preliminary statement a 29 per cent rise in consolidated net earnings to SFr1.9bn (Dollars 1.27bn) on revenues up 13 per cent to SFr12.9bn. The net income figure comfortably exceeds the SFr1.5bn figure published by Ciba earlier this week and SFr1.49bn from Sandoz last week. Like their counterparts at Ciba and Sandoz, the directors of Roche have proposed a dividend increase, of 32 per cent to SFr37 per share or dividend right certificate. Roche has substantial liquid reserves and the directors made clear that 'very good non-operational revenues' contributed to 'this gratifying result'. But they also reported 'significant improvements' in operating results. The net income figure for last year was reached after a non-recurring charge of SFr208m for future post-retirement healthcare benefits of employees in the US. Cash flow rose 29 per cent to SFr2.9bn.</p>

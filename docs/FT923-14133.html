			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Walesa picks lawyer as new Polish premier PRESIDENT Lech Walesa has agreed to nominate Ms Hanna Suchocka, a 46-year-old lawyer from Poznan as Poland's next prime minister in a move towards the solution of Poland's month-long government crisis. Ms Suchocka is expected to head a coalition government containing seven parties with Solidarity movement origins. The president yesterday told Ms Suchocka, who is from the pro-market Democratic Union (UD) party, that he was 'respecting democracy' by approving her nomination. Ms Suchocka's candidacy could be voted on as early as tomorrow. The new coalition has bowed to President Walesa's wishes by keeping in place his nominees for the defence, interior and foreign affairs ministries and kept out the right-wing Centre Alliance. The remainder of the projected new government marries the Democratic Union, the largest of 29 parties elected at last October's general elections, and the Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD) with the fundamentalist Catholic and right-wing nationalist ZChN party as well as the Solidarity farmers' groups. These seven parties control some 190 votes in the 460 seat parliament and the coalition can also count on support from the Solidarity group which should be enough for a working majority.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Alexandru Schendrea and Iulian Chifu: "King </F> Mihai I Reiterates His Intention To Return to His Homeland, but  Only in his Capacity as Monarch"]    [Text] In an interview for the Russian daily IZVESTIYA on  9 April, King Mihai I affirms that the Romanian Government is  afraid of his justified demands to the country's throne, and  said that, in 1947, the Communists resorted to threats and  forced him to abdicate. "I believe that the current Bucharest  regime does not feel confident" said the king, and invoked as  arguments in support of this statement the numerous lies that  were invented about him. Among other things, King Mihai  mentioned that on Christmas Eve, the Romanian Television Station  scheduled a documentary on the prime minister's Press Bureau in  which he, the king, is accused of having betrayed the country,  accusations that according to His Majesty are simple  fabrications. The king reasserted his intention to return to  his homeland only in his capacity as king and showed willingness  "to serve the country faithfully and to help it regain the place  it used to hold in Europe before the Communists came to power."    In accordance with the declarations of His Majesty King  Mihai, Princess Margaret will become his successor to the throne.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Arts: Messiaen's final 'Illuminations': Max Loppert attends this posthumous premiere by the New York Philharmonic The first three performances of Olivier Messiaen's Eclairs sur l'au-dela . . . were given last weekend, on three successive evenings. They formed the first big 'special event' on the New York Philharmonic's 1992-93 schedule, which has as its purpose a season-long celebration of the orchestra's 150 years of existence. The composer died last April, aged 83. The premiere was, therefore, posthumous - but it was not at all solemn. Instead, the occasion was gripping and exhilarating throughout its course, by turns awesome and exuberant in sound-quality and invention - continuously uplifting, indeed, even to a non-believer in the Catholic faith that directly inspired all of this composer's music. Eleven movements and 70 minutes long, Eclairs sur l'au-dela . . . was composed for a 128-strong orchestra, typically rich in percussion but untypically lacking the solo piano and ondes Martenot, those Messiaen hallmarks. The title can be translated as 'Illuminations of the Beyond . . .'; in the formidably copious and detailed programme notes written for the New York Philharmonic by Yvonne Loriod, the composer's widow and pianist-muse, the work is described as a 'set of meditations on the Beyond . . . In this work we find . . . the inward peace of the mystic, the anticipation of his repose in the luminous tenderness of God'. Before conducting it, Zubin Mehta, the orchestra's immediate past music director (and instigator of the commission), told the audience of a letter from Messiaen in which there was explained something of his vision of the spiritual life after physical death, and of his conviction that he would finally achieve an 'understanding of the invisible'. From all this it is clear that, having completed the work only last year, not long before his death, Messiaen consciously intended it as a 'final statement'. Anticipatory thoughts of death are inevitably connected with final thoughts of life; and musically the work seems to range across the entire span of Messiaen's compositional creativity. All the preoccupations are there: primarily, bird-song captured in music as a celebration of faith; but also the chord-colours, the 'architectural' approach to orchestral-writing and to formal construction, the devices of repetition, block-building and superimposition used to create the illusion of vast tracts of space and time suspended in sound; the oriental influences on rhythm and texture; the sudden rapturous sweetness of melody in which love, human as well as divine, is hymned (here in the fifth movement, 'Demeurer dans l'Amour', for strings). As this might suggest, Eclairs sur l'au-dela brings to mind a large number of previous Messiaen works - sometimes closely. In the already-mentioned fifth movement, the opera St Francois is invoked. In the seventh ('Les Sept Anges aux sept trompettes'), so are the mighty graded gong and tam-tam climaxes of Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum. The ninth movement, 'Plusieurs Oiseaux des arbres de vie', displays its 'many birds' (25 in all, from across the world) singing independently in woodwind voices above triangle trills, in an ecstatic whirl that gloriously recalls, and subtilises, almost every previous avian inspiration in the Messiaen orchestral canon. This might suggest, in turn, that Eclairs de l'au-dela is a tapestry of self-quotation rather than an original composition. The effect is the converse, the impression rather of radiant self-renewal. Once again, the forging of a distinctively personal, coherent, and communicative musical language - a musical 'whole world' - out of such disparate and (to this particular non-Catholic listener) often unsympathetic elements comes to seem one of our century's most monumental artistic achievements. There is newness: it lies in the final-statement economy that marks every note, that ordains the exact internal balance of parts, the pithy brevity of most of the movements, the luminous spareness of so much of the scoring. I heard the first and second performances. Neither was ideal. Though New York has hosted its share of notable Messiaen events - Des Canyons, the previous orchestral work, had its premiere here, in 1974 - a degree of audience restlessness (particularly during the second performance) hinted at an absence of familiarity with the Messiaen sound and substance. The Avery Fisher Hall lacks the necessary acoustical resonance, and lends an unwelcome edge to wind sound. (The Albert Hall should prove ideal: is a Prom performance already planned?) Mehta, though obviously a Messiaen devotee, had not rehearsed the score to a state of complete Messiaen virtuosity. Radiance was missing from the string tone, noble sonorousness from the brass; sections were not bound into cohesive movements - indeed, patches of untidy ensemble led one to wonder whether the players were still tethered at the stage of nervous beat-counting. And withal, it was a privilege to be there. Eclairs sur l'au-dela . . . seems in its totality to sum up everything that made Messiaen not just the dominant figure of French music in the 20th-century, but one of the original voices, the vital forces, of all 20th-century music.

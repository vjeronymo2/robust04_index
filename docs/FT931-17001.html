			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Merger wave gets ready to break - Deals A NEW wave of corporate activity could be about to break as companies face up to the competitive pressures of the single market. The removal of trade barriers coincides with a trend for recession-hit groups to define their core activities more rigorously. Companies looking to make acquisitions may well find opportunities among the non-core divisions put up for sale by debt-laden concerns. The recessions spreading across Europe have helped to bring down the prices of target companies to more affordable levels. Lower interest rates are increasing the attraction of debt-financed deals, although banks have become more selective in their lending. This will lead to a greater emphasis being placed on the industrial logic of an acquisition. To limit the cash outlay, deals may well take the form of mergers or joint ventures. Mr Mark Nicholls, a director at SG Warburg, says: 'The UK might be a beneficiary if there were a new wave of buying by companies based in countries with harder currencies.' The relatively low ratings of some quality UK companies and the country's recovery prospects increases the attraction. The single market was already a force behind mergers and acquisitions in the late 1980s. Figures from the M&amp;A database of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, show that cross-border deals involving EC companies from 1988 to 1992 peaked in 1989 at Dollars 53.5bn, before slipping to less than half that level in 1991. Preliminary figures for last year show activity recovering to Dollars 41bn. Financial services saw the largest amount of money changing hands, with deals adding up to Dollars 32bn over the five years. Hongkong &amp; Shanghai's purchase of Midland Bank represented the largest cross-border acquisition in this category. However, in this case, 1997 was probably a more important date than 1992. Food, drink and tobacco was the second busiest sector with deals worth Dollars 28bn, while the electrical and electronics sector totted up Dollars 20bn. However, 'you have to be careful about ascribing deals to one motivation,' says Mr Guy Dawson, head of corporate finance at Morgan Grenfell. 'There has been a significant move towards cross-border expansion in Europe that would have taken place irrespective of the single market.' Nor will its advent cure all problems with mergers. Mr Douglas Brown, a director at Baring Brothers, says: 'There is some opportunity for more M&amp;A activity, but as an industry becomes more consolidated the opportunity for competition problems to emerge increases.'</p>

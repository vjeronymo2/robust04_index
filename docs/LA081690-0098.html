			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: IN TENNIS, SHE HAS SET STANDARD  </P> <P> If I were to tell you one of the greatest athletes of the 20th Century -- and  maybe the greatest of our times -- would be appearing in Manhattan Beach this  week, would you go there expecting to see: (a) Jose Canseco, (b) the ghost of  Jim Thorpe, (c) Nick Faldo, (d) Pete Rose, (e) Joe Montana or (f) any Detroit  Piston?  </P> <P> What you would find there is none of the above. What you would find is an  athlete who is pound for pound, inch for inch the greatest of the era, an  athlete who weeps in victory, smiles in defeat, wears designer clothes and  actually looks good in earrings.  </P> <P> No one is sure whether God is a woman, but it just may be that the greatest  tennis player in history is.  </P> <P> Listen, when you talk of all-time sports feats, hitting in 56 consecutive  baseball games, pitching six no-hitters, scoring 100 points in an NBA game or  winning three Super Bowls stand out.  </P> <P> But winning nine Wimbledons?! That makes the list with any of them at any time.  </P> <P> It is the tennis feat of all time. It makes Martina Navratilova the best ever  to play that game. Big Bill Tilden? He won three Wimbledons, thank you. Don  Budge? Two Wimbledons. Rod Laver? Four Wimbledons. Bjorn Borg? Five Wimbledons.  Ivan Lendl? None.  </P> <P> You have to dip into antiquity to find a matchup for Navratilova. Only the  elegant Helen Wills Moody, who won eight Wimbledons, is in her class.  </P> <P> That's what you have to do with the truly marvelous -- measure them not against  their contemporaries, but against their ancestors, against history. Helen Wills  was to tennis what Babe Ruth was to baseball. Henry Aaron breaking Babe's  all-time record was no greater an accomplishment than breaking the great Queen  Helen's. People thought neither of them would ever be matched.  </P> <P> Martina won more than a tournament. She won her way into legend. She now plays  for the ages. She escapes the fine print. To be in the same paragraph with  Helen Wills is an achievement. To reduce her to a footnote is to take over  tennis.  </P> <P> Helen Wills used to play with the fixed expression of someone trying to win a  pot with two treys. Martina plays with the intensity of a deer fleeing a forest  fire, but she turns as coldly efficient as a serial killer when the Queen's cup  is on the line.  </P> <P> She is in a business where the average age seems to be somewhere between 14 and  19 but, at 33 nearing 34, she manages to dispatch these younger, fiery  schoolgirls with the steady competence of someone plucking chickens.  </P> <P> Martina never seems to come to a game in emotional disarray. She is as tough  and focused as Mike Tyson with his man on the ropes or Nolan Ryan with a guy  looking for the curve.  </P> <P> She dispatched a schoolgirl (Debbie Graham, Stanford) in a little over 45  minutes Tuesday with almost bored nonchalance. It was like watching someone  pull wings off a butterfly -- except that Martina treats every match as if it  is a Wimbledon final. She confided afterward that she was fearful after a  five-week layoff that she might have forgotten how to play.  </P> <P> How could Martina forget how to play tennis? What does it take to win nine  Wimbledons in the first place? What does it take to be and remain Martina  Navratilova?  </P> <P> Plenty. It calls for the tenacity of purpose of a bulldog on a rope. In Helen  Wills' time, tennis was not exactly a profession. It was more of a pastime for  the not-so-idle rich. Tournaments were spaced, outdoors and relentlessly  amateur. Silver cups were at stake, not silver Rolls-Royces.  </P> <P> The competition was genteel. Tennis was largely something to do before the  cotillion started.  </P> <P> Today, it's Wall Street with rackets. Big bucks, high pressure. It's a jungle  out there.  </P> <P> You need your own masseuse. You need your own osteopath. You travel in an  entourage. You're on an airplane, in a limo -- or on the court.  </P> <P> You have to watch what you eat. "Your body is like a vintage Rolls-Royce,"  Martina says. "You have to be careful what fuel you put in."  </P> <P> You have oatmeal and carrot juice for breakfast. Doughnuts are out. Even orange  juice. "Sugar is a drug," Martina insists. "A mind-altering drug. It is the  most abused drug in America. It gives you a high and then it does what all  drugs do -- brings you down and in despair. Robs you of precious energy."  </P> <P> Red meat is OK. Once a month. "I love hamburgers," Martina admits. "But if I  ate them every time I wanted them, I wouldn't make the quarterfinals."  </P> <P> The body is treated as deferentially as a sovereign. Some women check the  mirror for their beauty. Martina checks it for her health. It is her belief  that only her mind is 33 years old. The rest of her is still in her teens.  </P> <P> "It's a narcissistic life," she says. "But it's necessary."  </P> <P> Most people wear glasses so they can see 20/20. Or even 20/30. Martina can  already see 20/20 with the naked eye. She wears glasses because they correct  her vision to 20/10. Martina takes every edge into the match she can muster.  </P> <P> She lifts weights not to build up her muscles, but to build up her endurance.  Martina's body is not a set of muscular knots. It's chorus-line round.  </P> <P> She ices her knees after every match. She's a late sleeper. The body is  pampered, but Martina shows little patience with the athlete in it. She is an  expert skier, defiant of the possibility of a fracture.  </P> <P> If tennis were a morality play, Martina would be the villain. She has a nice  smile but in the early years of her career, she used it sparingly. She had come  into the game out the gloom of Kafka's Czechoslovakia, where smiles were  rationed like sausages. She learned to play tennis hitting a ball against a  barn door. "It's hard to learn the game when your competition is a wall." When  she began to beat the golden Chris Evert and everybody's darling of the center  court, Evonne Goolagong, Martina was treated like a truck driver at a royal  lawn party. Not anymore. Martina is the royalty on the court now. The crowds  come to see her in the Virginia Slims tournament at Manhattan Country Club this  week. She is an American heirloom.  </P> <P> She is, typically, hardening her body and toughening her mind for the U.S.  Open. After all, she has only won four of those. (Borg never won any).  </P> <P> But her ambition is not a 10th Wimbledon or a fifth U.S. Open, it's to win a  gold medal for the United States in the Barcelona Olympics in '92.  </P> <P> It's an interesting ambition. Even curious. Until you remember that Helen Wills  won one in 1924.  </P></p>

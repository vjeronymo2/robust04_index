			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Community lifts ban on Polish meat deliveries POLISH MEAT deliveries to the European Community, halted three months ago because of a foot-and-mouth disease scare, are to resume. The EC imposed bans on imports of livestock, meat, milk and dairy products from 18 central and eastern European countries in early April after cases of the disease were discovered in northern Italy. Most of the bans were lifted later that month following the agreement of tighter quarantine rules and stricter enforcement of export certification procedures, but the controls on imports from Poland remained. The latest Brussels decision follows a compromise with the Poles on quarantine for animals before shipment. Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, Poland's minister in charge of European integration said yesterday: 'It's obvious that the disease was used as a pretext to try and eliminate the export of Polish calves and lambs to the EC.' The ban had meant the loss of Dollars 30m worth of meat exports, he added. 'This wasn't a catastrophe but it was important as it was the first time in our relations with the EC that we have had to deal with subterfuge by the bureaucrats in Brussels.' Polish meat exporters' costs will increase by about 10 per cent as a result of the new quarantine rules. The Poles estimate that the break in sales means that the country will only be able to use up two-thirds of this year's meat quota, which includes 190,000 head of cattle, 150,000 calves and 750,000 sheep. No cases of foot-and-mouth disease have been identified in Poland for 21 years.</p>

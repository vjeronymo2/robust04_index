			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Arts: The KGB and all that - Radio GORBACHEV and Yeltsin have done all they can, but in the popular mind Russia is still the land of revolution. Saturday's Classic Serial on Radio 4 is Conrad's Under Western Eyes, in which a St. Petersburg student, Razumov (Patrick Brennan) is unwillingly involved in politics to help his friend Haldin (Neil Roberts), who reckons he killed the President with his anarchist bomb. The adaptation by Brian Miller, rather closely condensed, moves between St. Petersburg and Geneva, where Haldin's sister is learning English. The revolution in question is not the 1917 job, however, only a less successful one in 1911, though Russian security seems as strict as it is - or was - in our own time. Tonight will see the conclusion. Alison Hindell directed. The real KGB has been at work on Radio 5 daily from Monday to Friday, though this is only in a serial for young listeners, Nothing Ever Happens Here by Bill Gilham. In this, Joey, a 10-year-old American boy believes England to be a dull place before he has seen more of it than Heathrow. Before they have left the airport, his father, who is working on Star Wars, is kidnapped with his mother, and he himself is held as a hostage. He makes various brave, unsuccessful, attempts to get free, but in the end the enemy is defeated. As a sentimental touch, the agent who has been in charge of him escapes and sends him a thank-you card from Moscow. I probably wouldn't have listened to all of this if Kerry Shale hadn't been reading it. Shale, the American actor, is cunning with voices, and in this serial he gives us American, broken English, RP, cockney and a notably effective police-constable sound that might have come from The Bill on television. More seriously, he took part in Saturday's Kaleidoscope on Radio 4, which was about teaching actors how to speak. Here he gave Hamlet's talk to the Players, 'Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue', in a variety of accents, from standard English to New York Yiddish. These decorated the programme, which, presented by Paul Allen, more earnestly concerned the matter that Shaw treated in Pygmalion, the effect of proper speech on one's life. We heard Patsy Rodenburg, Head of Voice at the Royal National, and Cicely Berry, who does a similar job at the RSC, and we heard Saskia Reeves of the National being polished by Andrew Wade. The most memorable observation of the programme, I thought, was Miss Rodenburg's demand, 'Never tell anyone that their accent is inferior.' Shaw's Professor Higgins might not have agreed. Wings and Landings may suggest flying, but these are also features of prison architecture, and this is a sequence of six talks (Mondays on Radio 4) by John Williams, who has served nine sentences in gaol, most recently doing 12 years for armed robbery. Lately he kept a journal of his daily life (a privilege never granted to Oscar Wilde) and he makes prison sound rather friendly, with a television lounge, the chance of carpets and curtains in the cell, a budgie, and freedom to take tea and cigarettes with mates in their cells. Drugs too if you had them, and that did not seem so hard. He makes himself sound friendly, too - admittedly gay, 'what I've always found most attractive about prison, male bodies' are for ever around. There was little talk about the social effect of his or his fellow-prisoners' deeds. One of his friends had killed an old lady, but was still his friend. When television news showed a mass shooting in a village one prisoner was avid to watch it. A request for a calendar arose from desire for the 4-year-old girl in one of its pictures. It is easy to say that one doesn't know how one would react to years inside; yet many of my contemporaries were imprisoned for years by Germans, Italians or Japanese and still seem normal. Even Terry Waite does. Produced by Chris Paling, four more programmes are to follow the two I've heard, and one must hope that some kind of conclusion will be reached.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Boost for US home shopping industry THE US television home shopping industry got a boost yesterday when two separate cable television groups announced ventures involving CUC International, which provides offers home shopping to some 30m Americans via the telephone and computer. Viacom, the cable company bidding for Paramount Communications, said it would be testing a home shopping service, in conjunction with CUC and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, in the Castro Valley, California, where Viacom and AT&amp;T are due to launch a full-scale test of interactive television services next year. Time Warner, the second largest US cable operator, said it had agreed with CUC to create an interactive home shopping service in Orlando, Florida, where Time Warner is establishing its first commercial interactive-television service, the Full Service Network. Viacom, whose bid for Paramount is competing against a higher but hostile offer from QVC - one of the largest television home shopping networks - said the Castro Valley test would give customers the same broad range of products and services CUC currently offered to members through telephones and computers. Time Warner said its service would offer merchandise from CUC's database of 250,000 brand-named products and would allow customers to view and purchase items on demand. CUC would use its existing systems to process orders. In another home shopping move, Time Warner announced last month that it and Spiegel, a leading specialty fashion retailer and catalogue company, were joining forces to create two new cable channels, focused mainly on women.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Westinghouse bows to activists WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the troubled US conglomerate, yesterday bowed to pressure from shareholder activist groups and announced a series of changes to its corporate governance provisions - the rules which determine how a company is run. They include the establishment of a new board committee, composed entirely of outside directors, which will handle the nomination of new board members and other governance issues; and the elimination of the company's 'poison pill' anti-takeover device. However, the company did not split the roles of chairman and chief executive, which has been urged by some investors, such as Washington-based Lens Inc. The board expressed its confidence in Mr Paul Lego, chairman and chief executive, who has been criticised by some shareholders. The measures adopted by the board underline the growing importance in the US of a movement for better corporate governance, which involves shareholder rights groups targetting poorly performing companies and demanding changes in their rule books. Westinghouse has become a prime target of shareholder dissatisfaction, largely because of its financial services division, which has suffered heavy losses on poor real estate investment. The company last week announced plans to quit financial services, sell off four other businesses and take a Dollars 1.13bn after-tax charge in a bid to restore Wall Street's faith in its management. It faced a barrage of shareholder resolutions on corporate governance matters to be put to a vote at its annual meeting, in April. But yesterday's action should eliminate the need for many of these so-called 'proxy proposals.' Yesterday's provisions include the removal of all impediments to confidential voting on company matters by shareholders. This is a widespread demand of the activist movement, which argues that lack of confidentiality can intimidate some shareholders into backing management. Until now, Westinghouse has excluded proxy contests from confidential voting. The company is also moving from a system where directors are elected on a staggered basis over several years - a popular anti-takeover device - to one where all will be elected on an annual basis. The board's compensation committee, which oversees top management's pay, will continue to be composed only of outside directors but will retain independent, paying consultants to advise it.</p>

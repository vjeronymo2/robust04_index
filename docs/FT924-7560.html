			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Serb sanctions ECONOMIC SANCTIONS have not had a good press lately. In the case of Iraq, the evidence is that many countries, including the US, Britain, France and Germany, did not respect either national guidelines or United Nations resolutions on the subject. The fact that sanctions are broken, however, does not prove that they never attain their objectives. Few people now doubt that sanctions made an important contribution to the eventual defeat of the former white regime in Rhodesia. UN sanctions against Serbia have proved no exception to the rule. By requiring all nations to stop trading with Serbia in any commodity, including oil, for which Serbia relies on imports for 75 per cent of its needs, the embargo had the potential of crippling the economy. As so often before, the sanctions have proved very leaky. The extent of the violations was underlined last week by Mr Cyrus Vance, one of the UN mediators for Yugoslavia. Mr Vance told the Security Council that oil was getting through in ever larger quantities to Serbia and that queues at petrol stations in Belgrade had virtually disappeared. The US, meanwhile, has accused owners or managers of ships in several nations of violating sanctions in the Adriatic. Yet the new UN sanctions resolution, due to be adopted this week, is not just an empty gesture. It is intended to plug the loopholes in the present regime by giving the international naval force in the Adriatic the right to stop and search suspect ships, instead of just monitoring them. Tighter controls will also be established by international 'sanctions assistance missions' at key transit and transhipment points along the Danube and at border crossings with Serbia-Montenegro. It would be naive to believe that these measures will totally cut Serbia's supply lines. But it should make life much more difficult for sanctions-busters in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Greece. With a political solution still remote, the effective application of sanctions remains the most powerful tool in the hands of the international community to bring Serbia to its senses.</p>

Lourdes Taylor, the UK Embassy's cultural attache, asserted  that the process will be completed by September 1994. She  added, however, that a small UK military detachment would remain  in Belize to operate a jungle training installation. "This  action (the troop withdrawal) reflects the UK Government's trust  in the much-improved relations between Guatemala and Belize and  the determination of the governments of both countries to  resolve their bilateral differences peacefully," Taylor asserted.    The official's statements alluded to Guatemala's historic  claims to Belizean territory. The tone of those claims eased  after former Guatemalan President Jorge Serrano recognized  Belizean independence in 1991.    AFP talked on the phone to the spokesperson of Prime  Minister  Manuel Esquivel in Belmopan, and he explained that the UK troop  withdrawal will be a gradual process, which was planned over the  past seven months. It will be "a change of style in UK  assistance" to Belize, Carlos Perdomo, who is Esquivel's private  secretary, asserted. The official added that after the  approximately 1,800 soldiers leave Belizean territory, the UK  will maintain 100 military advisers to operate a special  training school and that a changing number of UK soldiers will  come to be trained at that school.    Last week, Prime Minister Esquivel stated that the frequent  raids by Guatemalan soldiers on Belizean territory could be "a  bad sign" and indicative of a possible invasion. Guatemalan  authorities denied this possibility. Perdomo disclosed that  there is no "immediate" fear that the Guatemalan Army will take  advantage of the UK troop withdrawal to take their demands by  force.    The prime minister's statements, explained his secretary,  were triggered by the fact that Guatemalan opposition sectors  have insisted on disavowing all the actions taken by former  President Serrano, including his agreements with Belize, and  declared them as unconstitutional. "If an opposition government  sets in, it is possible that it will act differently from  Presidents Serrano and (current President) De Leon Carpio have  acted. This was the reason for the prime minister's  statements," he added.    Belize obtained its independence from the UK in 1981, but UK  troops have remained on the territory as guarantors of its  territorial integrity. Ten years later, when it recognized  Belizean independence, Guatemala renounced a large part of its  demands for the territory of the young nation. It, however,  maintains its intentions to negotiate a passage to the Caribbean  sea through the Belizean Province of Toledo. Guatemala already  has access to the sea in the extreme southeastern part of its  territory. Negotiations for the opening can only be initiated  when the recognition of Belizean independence is ratified by a  referendum in Guatemala.</p>

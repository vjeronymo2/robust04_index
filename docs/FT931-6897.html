			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (2): Tough times increase the charges risk - Accounts BANKS HAVE had a tough year, during which they have been lambasted over high charges and poor service. The introduction of charges by Robert Fleming/Save &amp; Prosper on its current account for those in credit is seen as the beginning of the end of free banking. One of the measures taken by banks and building societies to weather the recession has been a widening of their margins. This has affected borrowers more than savers (see L for loans). The main effect of the recession on savers has been a greater need to be vigilant about their accounts so that they do not find themselves paying unnecessary charges. Competitiveness in the banking sector has increased the number of services, such as telephone and postal banking as well as the range of different accounts, for example, high interest cheque accounts. Customers can enjoy a greater choice but they must also do more work to select the right kind of bank and type of account for their needs. To do this, anyone with a bank account should put himself into one of two categories: the customer who does not expect to need an overdraft and the one who foresees going into the red intermittently. If you are in credit. Interest-bearing current accounts. The level of overdraft rates is not a concern. Instead, you can choose between the interest-bearing current accounts of banks and building societies. These should provide features such as a Pounds 100 cheque guarantee/debit card, credit cards and good service. Almost all banks and building societies give tiered rates of interest, but some give significantly better returns on higher deposits. The difference can be startling. For example, earlier this month net percentage rates on current accounts with Pounds 10,000 were Abbey National Current (0.38); Bank of Scotland BankSave Plus (2.48); Britannia React 365 (3.19); Co-op Pathfinder (4.38); First Direct (1.13); Lloyds Gold (2.25); Midland Meridian (2.40); Woolwich Current (2.93); Robert Fleming/Save &amp; Prosper (3.38). It is important to check the terms and conditions of the accounts. For example, the Co-op Pathfinder account offers standing orders and direct debit, but has no chequebook facility. There are monthly charges on the Lloyds Gold and Midland Meridian accounts, if the balance falls below Pounds 1,000. First Direct and Robert Fleming/Save &amp; Prosper do not have branches but are telephone banking operations. High-interest cheque accounts. These aim to pay higher rates of interest on large deposits than interest-bearing current accounts, but they usually require a large minimum balance. There may also be a minimum withdrawal size and many, such as Caledonian Bank's Hica, do not offer a cheque guarantee card or direct debit. Instead, Caledonian's Hica pays a flat rate of interest which is unusual, because most Hicas pay lower rates on smaller deposits. These accounts are designed to complement rather than replace current accounts, but some customers may find it more convenient to operate a current account alongside a savings account (see V for Variable rate investments). Other types of account include those provided by Midland's Orchard and Royal Bank of Scotland's Balanced Banking, which allow customers an automatic transfer of funds between a choice of accounts. If you are overdrawn. If you are likely to be overdrawn either consistently or at periodic intervals, charges are the most important consideration. Banks and building societies have been ruthless about widening their margins and, in their attempt to retain savers in the face of lower base rates, they are happier to pass the cost on to borrowers. Accounts which pay high rates of interest to those in credit are the ones most likely to have draconian charges for those who go into the red. Overdraft charges are in two parts. The first is the annual rate of interest, which will be substantially higher on an unauthorised overdraft than on one which has been arranged. For example, National Westminster's authorised overdraft rate on its current account is 19.2 per cent per annum and 32.9 per cent for an unauthorised overdraft. The Co-op is unusual in making no difference in rates between an authorised and unauthorised overdraft. However, customers will be less aware of the second set of charges. These may be additional fees for exceeding an arranged overdraft, as well as charges for sending out a warning letter or bouncing a cheque. Transaction charges may also be made. Some banks, such as Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, allow the customer to be overdrawn by Pounds 100 before imposing overdraft fees. In its last survey of current accounts, Which?, the Consumer Association's monthly, found that the banks which came out best in terms of overall satisfaction to the customer were Abbey National, Co-op, First Direct, Royal Bank of Scotland and Yorkshire Bank. Those that were above average were Bank of Scotland, Girobank, Halifax and Nationwide. The ones voted worst were Lloyds, Midland and NatWest. Moneyfacts (0692 500765) and Blay's Moneymaster (0753 880482) are monthly publications which include details of bank and building society interest rates on accounts, credit cards, Tessas and mortgages.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Major attacks MPs with too many paid interests Mr John Major last night underlined his determination to shake off the charges of sleaze that have damaged his government by launching a robust attack on MPs who take on too many paid outside interests. The prime minister used his annual speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet in London to defend the right of MPs to have outside interests and to argue that the UK would not benefit if parliament were populated by 'wholly professional' politicians. He said, however, that Westminster should not be 'a hiring fair'. Parliament should not be a 'way' to other jobs, 'as frankly it sometimes has been'. Speaking as MPs prepare to return to Westminster for tomorrow's Queen's Speech detailing next year's legislative programme, Mr Major emphasised that the recently established Nolan committee would have a continuing role in policing standards in British public life. The body's task was not just to meet 'immediate questions', he said, but 'to act as a running authority of reference - almost, you might say, an ethical workshop called in to do running repairs'. In a speech billed by Downing Street as more than usually his own creation, Mr Major said it was important to attract the 'right people' into public service and urged commentators to use their 'very great' freedom to attack and expose with responsibility. 'We no longer live nowadays, thank goodness, in a 'deference society', where you are respected for who you are not what you are,' he said. 'But let's not swing too far in the opposite direc-tion.' Acknowledging the need to improve the accountability of the public service, he said that government had been 'too secret too long'. 'It is damaging if there appears to be some kind of inside track - a gulf between those who know how to play the system and others who do not,' he said. His sympathy was with those on 'the outside track'. Mr Major was speaking as it emerged that one feature of the Commons debate after the Queen's Speech may be a speech by Mr Neil Hamilton, the former corporate affairs minister, who resigned last month following allegations of impropriety which he strongly denies. Friends of Mr Hamilton said last night that he was 'minded' to try to take part in the debate. But they added that he would not say anything which was likely to militate against his resuming ministerial office. Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, attacked the speech as 'depressingly complacent'. He said Mr Major was 'whistling in the dark'. In a speech that ranged more widely than the occasion's traditional focus on foreign affairs, Mr Major also commented on the economy, business and Northern Ireland. Welcoming recent remarks on the need for responsibility in setting executive pay levels, he said there was 'no doubting the resentment that large and often unjustified pay rises' could cause. He said British capitalism had become 'capitalism with a conscience, but there was still more that business could do to improve its image'.</p>

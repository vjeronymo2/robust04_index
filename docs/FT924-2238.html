			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Arts: The Witches - Theatre On one side of St Martin's Lane you can see the opera Hansel and Gretel (at the Coliseum). On the other you can see The Witches (at the Duke of York's). It is amazing how much the two works have in common, especially in this particular pair of stagings. A witch is not just a crone living in the faraway depths of a wood any longer. Some children this Christmas will be taken to the one, some to the other. An enterprising parent might do well to take their children to both. The witches in Roald Dahl's story do not bake children or eat them - they turn them into mice. And the best fun of seeing The Witches as a play comes in watching these transformations - how are they done? - and then in watching the boy-mice adapting to their new circumstances. In fact, the mice scenes resemble another show opening this weekend, Frederick Ashton's Tales of Beatrix Potter; the opening of the play's second half reminds me of what Ashton said to his mice-dancers 'Wouldn't it be lovely to have a tail, think of all the things you could do with it, you could pick things up and carry them, you could skip rope with it . . .' Otherwise, Dahl's story holds an audience simply because he tells a story so well. It does not have the mythic power of the Grimms' fairytale, but its modern liveliness and its whimsical philosophical touches have their own impact and wisdom. Boy learns from Grandmother that the world is full of witches; and to us, watching, the witches (as in Humperdinck's opera) are both alarming and absurd. Boy and Grandmother save the children of England from the witches; but Boy himself has to stay a mouse, and learns how to cope with that. The adaptation and staging are by David Wood, and they proceed at a more plodding, heavy-handed pace than last year's staging of The BFG Karen Briffett plays Boy with over-wide eyes and a shrill voice about half an octave too high, but is otherwise engaging. The performance I watched was largely attended by school-parties of young children. They were not driven to any particular peaks of fright or amusement, but they were completely attentive to every turn in the action. The grown-ups fidgeted only a few times.

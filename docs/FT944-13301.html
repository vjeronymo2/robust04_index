			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Textile exporters hit at pace of reform First steps in a 10-year programme to liberalise world textile and clothing markets agreed in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks will do little to open rich-country markets, Third World textiles exporters said yesterday, writes Frances Williams. The International Textiles and Clothing Bureau, which groups 21 developing country exporters, noted 'with dismay' that the three biggest textile and clothing importers - the US, European Union and Canada - had decided to start with products not currently subject to import restraints. They 'have hardly liberalised any significant MFA restriction on any developing country,' the bureau said, referring to the Multi-Fibre Arrangement that now allows quotas on most Third World textiles and clothing exports to the industrialised nations. Under the Uruguay Round accord, MFA importers must bring 16 per cent of textiles and clothing trade under normal world trade rules next January and another 17 per cent in January 1998. The bureau calculates that, with more than a third of US and EU textile and clothing imports now unrestricted, they would be able to delay real liberalisation until the third stage of the MFA phase-out in seven years' time.</p>

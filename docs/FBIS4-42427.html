			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Stephan Koole and Wilco Boom: "Purple Coalition </F> One Step Closer"]    [Text] The PvdA [Labor Party], the VVD [People's Party for  Freedom and Democracy], and the D66 [Democrats 66] have reached  agreement on the main terms of a major package to provide around  9 billion guilders [G] in tax cuts. Almost half of the tax cuts  will enable companies to employ low and unskilled workers at  lower costs.    The parties negotiating for a "purple" coalition [comprising  the PvdA, the VVD, and the D66] agreed that structural  unemployment is one of the country's major problems. The  partial agreement brings the formation of the new government  closer, it is being said within the potential coalition parties.    The party specialists, brought together within the so-called  A Team, are recommending that their party leaders (Kok,  Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo) allocate around G5 billion to  resolve this problem. They want to use that money to reduce  costs to the employer.    Insiders point out that the agreement is a "first step." The  party specialists did not consider the effect of the proposed  measures on incomes. "They will have to discuss this with the  politicians appointed by the crown to assess the feasibility of  the various coalitions."    Despite this partial agreement, the extent of spending cuts  remains the principal point at issue during negotiations on the  formation of a government consisting of the PvdA, the VVD, and  the D66. The threatened new financial shortfall of G3 billion  is playing a part in the negotiations. PvdA leader Kok believes  that the negotiators must find a solution to make up for this  deficit.    Kok: "I have a sort of double role, negotiator on the one  hand and finance minister on the other; it is therefore in my  own interest to prevent complications, as otherwise it is I who  will have to face them later."    Kok believes that the G3 billion deficit is "not casting a  shadow" over negotiations between the three parties.    Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo were once again optimistic  yesterday about the prospects of forming a "purple" coalition.</p>

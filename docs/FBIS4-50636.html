			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Russia's government  officials today reacted positively to NATO's decision to give  Moscow a "special partnership".    Anatoliy Krasikov, President Boris Yeltsin's deputy  spokesman, said the Russian Government welcomed the "fact that  Russia's particular features will be taken into account."    NATO ambassadors agreed in principle on Wednesday [18 May]  to  offer Russia a special relationship, which would reflect its big  power status.    The relationship will be somewhat different from the  "Partnership for Peace" program, a new form of military  cooperation between the 16-nation NATO and former Warsaw Pact  countries.    Russia had refused to sign the Partnership for Peace after  NATO air forces attacked Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina  last month.    Krasikov hailed NATO's decision Wednesday "a right step,"  arguing that Moscow has never refused to join Partnership for  Peace.    Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Grigoriy Karasin said,  "The reports coming from Brussels show the proposal is of great  importance, and its tone sounds generally positive to us."    The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) wants to build  an informal relationship of intense contacts with Russia on  issues like Bosnia, peacekeeping and nuclear arms without giving  Moscow the right to consultation on security questions.    NATO's decision came one week before Russian Defense  Minister  Pavel Grachev is to visit NATO headquarters in Brussels next  Tuesday to outline Russia's views on "Partnership for Peace."    Eighteen countries have so far signed the "Partnership for  Peace," a program regarded by most of former Warsaw Pact nations  as the first step towards full NATO membership.</p>

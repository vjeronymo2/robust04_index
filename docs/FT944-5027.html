			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Cult of the big company - Peter Brooke, pioneer of venture capital for high-tech companies in Europe, talks to Richard Gourlay Peter Brooke thinks his time at Harvard Business School was the worst two years of his life. The presumption that there was an answer to every problem in business irritated him. But the American entrepreneur, who was to found Advent International and become a pioneer of venture capital investment in high-tech companies in Europe, did take a course taught by Georges Doriot on management. Doriot founded American Research and Development, which became one of the first successful US venture capital organisations in the 1950s. But Doriot was much less successful when he returned to his native France to try to repeat the US success in Europe. That failure then provided Brooke with an invaluable lesson when he followed his former tutor across the Atlantic to built Advent International. Instead of trying to find and evaluate deals from a central office, as Doriot tended to do, Brooke made sure he had partners in each country who could unearth potentially interesting businesses and understand local ways. Twenty years on, Brooke says Europe remains a difficult environment for venture capitalists. Hindered by the lack of a true single market and a constrained entrepreneurial culture, Europe is still very different from the US as a market for private equity investment. But it is not impossible. Over the past 18 months, Advent International has raised Dollars 315m for a global equity fund, forty per cent of which is to be invested in Europe and some of which will be invested alongside the Dollars 1bn its affiliates already have available for investment on the Continent. 'The main opportunity in Europe is in those countries that are restructuring to handle the competitive future,' Brooke says. The break-up of large corporations and return to core businesses means companies and management teams are on the move. And the transfer of family-owned companies from founder to a next generation provides another opportunity. But Brooke is gloomy about Europe's chances of producing a large number of high-tech opportunities for venture capital backing. Advent International's own 1980 technology fund is making money, 14 years later, but the returns are not exciting, he says. The issue is not that entrepreneurial flair and technical skills do not exist. It is just that in Europe these abilities have tended to stay hidden inside large companies. 'There is a certain reluctance among good technologists and managers to leave the womb of a Siemens or Alfa Lavell to go into a small company,' Brooke says. 'It is not necessarily a lack of entrepreneurial spirit, it is a matter of custom and culture. Success is measured by how well you have done within Siemens. Leaving is almost regarded as being anti-social.' Brooke believes this cult of the large company in Europe still prevents talented individuals from going it alone. 'Take the structure of the German industrial management,' he says. 'You have engineers, production managers, marketing and finance people. But if an engineer does a spin-off he has absolutely no idea of marketing.' Brooke's view of Europe as a venture capital opportunity is at odds with moves by some large private equity investors, such as CVC Capital Partners, Barings and Hambros, which have been expanding steadily into continental Europe. But without naming names, he is not sure some of the larger fund managers are particularly venturesome. He is scathing about private equity investors who do not build companies, engineer 'simple leveraged buy-out' deals and 'sit around having lunch trading deals'. True venture capital, he says, involves the identification of an area of technology and detailed research into its application followed by active selling of the idea that venture capital can help build businesses. 'A lot of people have lost sight of this with all the leveraged buy-outs,' he says. Advent International, he claims, never engages in this practice, even when - as now - the most promising area for venture capital investment arises out of restructuring businesses. 'If we do use debt in a deal we would never use anything but free cash flow (after research and development expenditure) to pay down the debt.' One way Advent International has attempted to add value is by providing support from its Boston headquarters to the businesses it backs. It will, for example, help with strategic issues such as entering new markets or how to approach the Federal Drug Administration to get approval for a new product. Brooke believes this service sets Advent Interantional apart from other venture capitalists. But he also knows competition is likely to hot up. Established investors of private equity in the UK and Europe have recently raised large new funds and are just as aware that they need to add value if they are to outsmart the competition. 'If there is an oversupply of capital we have to continue to prospect and not do things so that pricing gets out of control,' Brooke says. Brooke is enthusiastic about plans now being worked out to form a European equivalent to Nasdaq, to provide dynamic companies with earlier access to capital. But, he says, some companies should be nurtured in private longer. Too many float to provide exits for investors and not to raise new money. After more than 40 years in venture capital, Brooke attracts disciples, just as Doriot did. His goal is still to build Advent International into the world's best private equity investor. But at 65 he wants to get out of the business. His trouble is that right now - as when he was at Harvard - he doesn't have the answer for how to do it.</p>

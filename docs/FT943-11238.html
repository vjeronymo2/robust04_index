A leading delegate at the conference in central Nigeria is due to table a motion asking the head of state, Gen Sani Abacha, to release Mr Abiola.

A four-week strike which has already forced a 300,000 barrels a day cut in oil production - about 20 per cent of normal output - is set to intensify this week.

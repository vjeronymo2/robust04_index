			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Tokyo may aid restructuring JAPAN'S ailing petrochemical industry may be offered fiscal incentives to encourage rationalisation, writes Paul Abrahams. A strong possibility exists that tax exemptions, interest-free loans and other incentives could be offered to the industry in an effort to help restructuring, said Mr Hajime Furuta, director of the basic chemicals division of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Restructuring was needed because the Japanese petrochemicals industry was weak and uncompetitive, added Mr Furuta, in London for the Financial Times conference on petrochemicals. The plight of the Japanese industry, the world's second largest after that of the US, with an annual turnover of nearly Dollars 65bn was worse than in the last recession 10 years ago. Consumer demand seemed saturated and the inventory adjustment would last longer than during the last recession. Raw material prices were lower this time. The industry had severe structural problems because of excessive competition. The sector was highly fragmented, with 12 ethylene manufacturers. The largest had 12 per cent of the market and the smallest 6 per cent. Alliances and other forms of co-operation were needed with both domestic and foreign partners. In the scramble for market share, excess capacity had been built up. Annual Japanese production next year would be 7.3m tonnes, while demand would be 6m tonnes. The industry's profits last year had already fallen 45 per cent to under Dollars 80m.</p>

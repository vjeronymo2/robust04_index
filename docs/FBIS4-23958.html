			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 17 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela on  Friday [17 June] said a cabinet decision giving effect to  amnesty for about 100 political prisoners and people awaiting  trial, granted by former State President F W de Klerk, had been  taken in his absence and he had yet to be briefed on the move.    Mr Mandela said he had been in Tunis attending a gathering  of  the Organisation of African Unity on Wednesday when the cabinet  took the decision. "I'm not very clear on the actual decision  that has been taken," he said. "I will be briefed on this on  Monday."    He added the cabinet was trying to resolve the matter in a  way that would do justice to all the parties and unite the  government.    The people indemnified by Mr de Klerk include former Civil  Co-operation Bureau head Maj-Gen Eddie Webb.    Minister of Justice Dullah Omar said earlier this month the  amnesties had been "frozen" and the matter was being handled by  Mr Mandela.    Lawyers for Human Rights National Director Brian Currin on  Friday distanced himself from the cabinet decision. Mr Currin  is chairman of an advisory committee set up by Mr Omar to review  about 800 applications for indemnity.    He said: "We understand that this decision was taken on the  basis of a legal opinion received from the state law advisers.  It was apparently not based on an assessment of any of the  cases under scrutiny. I wish to place on record that the  advisory committee chaired by myself had made no recommendations  whatsoever as at Wednesday, June 15, regarding the  indemnification or release of the persons under consideration.  As chairman of this committee I wish to state that I therefore  had nothing whatsoever to do with the release process now under  way."</p>

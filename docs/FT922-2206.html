			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Swedish property group advances to SKr249m NCC, one of Sweden's leading property and construction groups, improved its profits (after financial items) for the first four months to SKr249m (Dollars 44m) from SKr158m for the same period last year. Consolidated sales fell to SKr7.228bn from SKr7.682bn for the first four months of 1991. Its construction division profit (after financial items) fell to SKr270m from SKr295m while sales also dropped to SKr5.457bn from SKr5.636bn, but orders were up by 4 per cent to SKr6.1bn from SKr5.8bn. The SKr10m loss from the international division was less than the one of SKr15m suffered in the first four months of last year. But there was a marked deterioration in NCC's special company business with a loss of SKr40m against SKr5m for the same period of 1991. However, the group's property activities showed signs of improvement. From a loss of SKr48m for the January - April period of last year it recorded a profit of SKr92m for the same months of 1992 with a SKr149m gain from property sales, while sales rose to SKr408m from SKr307m for the first four months of last year. Metsa-Serla, Finland's third-largest forestry group, reported yesterday a FM2m (Dollars 476m) loss for the first four months compared with a FM59m deficit for the same period of 1991. Mr Timo Poranen, the company's president and chief executive, said he expected 'greatly improved financial result' over last year's FM117m loss, although a small loss was likely . Net sales climbed by 6 per cent in the first four months to FM2.637bn from FM2.486bn and the operating profit rose by 76.2 per cent to FM229m from FM130m. However, there was a loss per share of FM8.35 compared with a loss per share of FM13.35 last year.</p>

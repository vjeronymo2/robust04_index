			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): LVMH - Other Companies Investors have long been prepared for gloomy news when the French luxury goods group publishes its 1993 results on Thursday. Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman, warned last autumn that 1993 had been a tough year. Hoare Govett in Paris expects net profits to have slipped to FFr2.9bn (Pounds 330m) in 1993 from FFr3bn in 1992. Mr Arnault can offer the consolation that the recent reshuffle of LVMH's cross-shareholding with Guinness has revitalised its finances.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kuzmenkin: "The Council--New, the </F> Chairman--Previous"]    [Text] Undoubtedly the central event of the first day  of the first session of the Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of  Deputies was the election of its chairman.    Some people saw this as a real theater with all the  trimmings: the director, the actors, the intermission, and the  buffet; some saw it as a political game; and some saw it as a  real drama....    In the morning 34 people's deputies approved the agenda,  excluding from it the point about considering the oblast's  socioeconomic situation at the session. It was reasonable to  exclude this since the oblast administration had decided to  revise the figures taking into account the results of the recent  scientific-practical conference in Novosibirsk. The deputies  also formed seven committees and immediately demonstrated their  attitude by refusing to allow the leader of the chancellery, a  deputy of the Federation Council, Aleksey Manannikov, or Olga  Lesnevskaya to attend the session. After a brief but stormy  discussion with the participation of the oblast procurator they  agreed that the decisions would be adopted by the soviet based  on the number of elected deputies--34. (Let us recall that there  should be a total of 49 deputies in the oblast Council.)    After the recess the deputies elected the chairman and, in  spite of expectations, (the people intended to go home by 1500),  the elections dragged on. There were three people in the  running: Anatoliy Sychev, Aleksandr Kiselnikov, and Pavel  Isayev. The head of the former Soviet of People's Deputies noted  that he could "consider himself a professional in this business"  and discussed in detail the tasks of the new Soviet of Deputies  (without the epithet "people's"). His major opponent was the  well-known Novosibirsk economist-analyst A. Kiselnikov, who also  discussed in detail his vision of the future work of the  deputies. The third candidate, incidentally, a recent candidate  to the State Duma, Pavel Isayev--a scholar from  Akademgorodok--put himself in the running and defined his main  task as to break down the image of Novosibirsk Oblast as "the  most conservative and irreconcilable region." It was clear that  the battle would be between the first two candidates. And that  was the way it went: Sychev received 14 votes, Kiselnikov--six,  and Isayev--three. But in order to become chairman it was  necessary to gain the support of a minimum of 18 deputies. In  the first round 11 deputies did not vote for anyone, and here is  what is interesting: Among the deputies were 11 administration  chiefs (Nikolay Krasnikov--the administration chief of Koltsov,  representing Russia's Choice--was not counted)....    Thus began the theater or game or call it what you will. The  VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK correspondent learned from reliable  sources that the scenario became known in the morning, and this  was brilliantly confirmed during the day. During the second  round A. Sychev garnered 17 votes and A. Kiselnikov--11, and, in  keeping with the election regulations, a new nomination was  started. Aleksandr Kiselnikov withdrew his candidacy and it was  suggested in a cheerful voice from the microphone that they  elect a "rural person." That is what Nikolay Baraulin,  Toguchinskiy Rayon administration chief, was. In his extremely  brief speech he stated that he had already been elected 24 times  and if they trusted him, he was ready. Precisely who "should"  was not stated aloud, but everyone understood that now the  aforementioned 11 people would express their opinion. Many  deputies were disturbed about the "games" and deputy Plyushkin,  a physician by profession, suggested that they give a lot of  thought to what was going on in the hall and express their  opinion anyway because "abstention was dangerous to the health."  As a result, the people's elect took the doctor's advice and in  the meantime, breaking the opponent's game, started playing  their own. Anatoliy Sychev gathered 19 votes, and his  opponent--only 13.    And so Anatoliy Pavlovich Sychev was elected chairman of the  Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of Deputies.</p>

Final  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> PILKENTON SUSPENDED IN INFRACTION  </P> <P> Bruce Pilkenton, the leading quarter horse rider at Los Alamitos this summer,  was handed a five-day suspension Thursday night by the track stewards.  </P> <P> Citing Pilkenton for "crossing over without sufficient clearance" while riding  Streakin Rampage in Wednesday night's 10th race, officials gave Pilkenton a  5-day suspension to be served July 17 through July 21.  </P> <P> As of July 8, Pilkenton held an eight-win advantage of former riding champion  Kip Didericksen with 75 winning mounts compared to Didericksen's 67.  </P> <P> Dash For Speed, the mare who narrowly missed two World Champion titles, sets  her sights on the elusive prize again this year opening her 1990 campaign in  Sunday's $50,000 Anne Burnett Invitational Handicap at Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> The Anne Burnett, among the top Grade I events in the nation for fillies and  mares, brings out a field of 10 3-year-old and older fillies and mares facing  off down on Los Al's 400-yard straightaway.  </P> <P> Dash For Speed makes her first appearance in the starting gate since finishing  third in the Breeders Championship Classic at Sunland Park last October.

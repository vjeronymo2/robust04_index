			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>   [Text] Britain today fiercely denied accusations of  harbouring anti-Iranian terrorist organisations as the bitter  war of words between London and Tehran rages on unabated.  Relations between the two countries now stand at their lowest  ebb following Britain's protest to Iran for allegedly supplying  the Provisional IRA with cash or arms.    Tehran formally denied that and hit back today with new  allegations claiming that Britain was sheltering terrorist  organisations working against the Iranian Government. The  Tehran Times said that Britain had no right to question Iran's  adherence to international conventions against aiding  terrorists. "Western powers, Britain among them, cannot plead  ignorance when it comes to the terrorist nature of anti-Iranian  groups they harbour in the West," the newspaper said.    But a Foreign Office spokesman said: "The Government denies  any contact of any kind with the Mojahedin-e Khalq group.  Opposition groups from any country are free to operate in the  United Kingdom within the law. If they break the law they will  be prosecuted. If the Iranian have evidence of illegal activity  they should let us have sight of it."    Earlier this week, Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas  Hogg summoned the Iran charge d'affaires Gholam Reza Ansari to  give him a dressing down about Iran's alleged involvmenet with  the Provisional IRA. Afterwards, Iran flatly denied this  allegation, although Britain remains convinced that there were  such links.    The paper says that the British protest about the IRA was "a  smokescreen to hide the fact that Western-based anti-Iranian  terrorists are providing material and personnel to the  Iraq-based terrorists to attack targets inside the Islamic  republic."    Britain's relations with Iran have been in a state of  turbulence ever since the late Ayatollah Khomeyni passed  sentence of death (a "fatwa") on author Salman Rushdie in 1989  for alleged blasphemy in his novel The Satanic Verses. This was  a call to Muslims the world over to kill him. The sentence has  never been lifted and Rushdie has been forced into hiding ever  since.</p>

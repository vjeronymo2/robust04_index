			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western disagrees. Western complies with requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the CRSP Act of 1956, other relevant legislation, and DOE Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RA 6120.2 in assuring repayment of all CRSP costs assigned to power.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Legislation takes precedence when there is conflict with DOE Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RA 6120.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treatment of depletions in the same manner has been approved by FERC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> twice prior to the present rate adjustment. Two of FERC's criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for rate approval are whether the proposed rate will repay all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations assigned to power in full and on time consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the CRSP Act and whether the methodology which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieves this result is in compliance with DOE Order RA 6120.2. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested FY 1995 rate adjustment meets these criteria and satisfies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all repayment requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If power rates are set without providing for future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depletions, it will affect Upper Basin development under the (Colorado River and Upper Colorado River Basin) compacts. Every time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> someone wants to build a project or open a business that will deplete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water, the power rates will have to go up if those increased depletions have not already been factored into the rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Can full repayment be truly represented by rates derived assuming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water is available for release through powerplants when that water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not be available because of depletions by the Upper Division  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States above the powerplants?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Total depletions forecasted by the Basin States for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of Colorado River water have been included in the proposed rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The water has been allocated by compacts for use by the Upper Basin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States. Furthermore, Western is obligated to assure that funds are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available on schedule to meet repayment requirements regardless of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depletion schedules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its proposed treatment (deferral) of uncertain depletions, Western  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumes that greater amounts of Colorado River water will be available for release through CRSP powerplants than would be suggested by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current rapid-growth forecasts of water development projects and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their associated depletions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western's experience has been that out-year depletion estimates are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to frequent revision. It is reasonable, therefore, to give  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more weight to near-term projections. Western prepares an annual PRS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for every project to assure that repayment is proceeding satisfacto-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rily. Thus, there will be many future opportunities to revise the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Integrated Projects rate appropriately as the near-term projections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are changed and more accurate long-term estimates are made available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western has determined that depletions affect the firm power rate, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most, by 0.32 mills/kWh (composite). The impact is small enough so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that power rates could (and would) be adjusted to assure full repayment, if more rapid depletions take place in the Upper Basin States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is not likely that this small impact on power rates would constrain water depletions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Super-minister who fell in clash over D-Mark: Obituary of Karl Schiller Professor Karl Schiller, who has died at 83, was the West German 'super-minister' who came spectacularly to grief in a conflict with the Bundesbank over exchange controls in 1972. His resignation as economics and finance minister in defence of free market economics and strong budgetary policies in July of that year unsettled the Social Democrat-led coalition government of Chancellor Willy Brandt and, for a period, appeared to jeopardise its electoral prospects. But Schiller lost influence after an ill-judged dalliance with the Christian Democrat opposition party ahead of the general election that November. Although he continued to be highly regarded as an economist, the re-election of Willy Brandt's left-liberal coalition meant Schiller was never again a political force in Germany. Karl Schiller was born on April 24, 1911 in Breslau (now Wroclaw), in what was then German Silesia. After studying economics at the universities of Kiel, Frankfurt-am-Main, Berlin and Heidelberg, he began an academic career at Heidelberg in 1934 before moving in 1935 to the Institute for World Economy in Kiel where he headed a research group. After serving in the German army in the second world war, he returned briefly to Kiel before becoming professor of economics at Hamburg university, where he was rector between 1956 and 1958. Schiller's involvement in politics began in 1946, when he joined the Social Democrat party. By 1948 he was economic senator in the federal state of Hamburg and an adviser to the economics ministry in Bonn. By the time the Social Democrats and Christian parties formed West Germany's 'grand coalition' government in 1966, Schiller had held numerous party offices and was a member of the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament. He had played a key role in steering his party away from traditional socialism towards free market economic policies. He was appointed federal economics minister in 1966 and for a time formed a remarkable partnership with Franz-Josef Strauss, the finance minister. At first sight, the young-looking, slight, bespectacled, didactic academic from Hamburg hardly seemed the type to coexist with the burly, beer-swilling leader of Bavaria's Christian Social Union. But Strauss was also a gifted, highly educated man with a powerful intellect. The two developed a mutual respect. Together they steered the German economy to recovery after a shallow recession in 1967. However, tensions grew over how to respond to upward pressure on the D-Mark in the increasingly enfeebled post-war Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate regime. Breaking with conventional business opinion, Schiller came to recognise that revaluation was unavoidable. When the coalition broke up in 1969, Schiller was one of the Social Democrat party's stars. His intellect, communication skills and mastery of economic policy, combined with the respect Germans of that time had for professors, were important in winning the electorate for the unknown: a Social Democrat-led government. With hindsight, the election of September 29, 1969 was Schiller's high-water mark. He returned to government as economics minister - this time in a coalition with the Free Democrats. But storm clouds were gathering over the West German economy, largely because of its trading success relative to other industrialised nations. At Schiller's behest, one of the new government's first acts was to revalue the D-Mark to DM3.66 to the dollar compared with DM4 previously. This, however, failed to stem the flow of speculative funds into Germany. Currency turbulence in turn increased inflationary pressure as Bundesbank intervention to curb the D-Mark's rise resulted in a sharp increase in domestic money supply. Schiller won a temporary respite for the D-Mark by floating it against the dollar in May 1971. But the coalition also faced budgetary problems as it tried to meet its election promises for greater social expenditure after having promised not to raise taxes. Symptomatic of growing tension was the resignation, also in May 1971, of West Germany's finance minister, Alex Moller. Schiller added Moller's portfolio to his own, becoming 'super-minister'. But he found his authority increasingly challenged as he tried to secure support in cabinet for spending cuts. Unrelenting speculative inflows into Germany, particularly after the D-Mark was repegged against the dollar in December 1971, brought him into conflict with Karl Klasen, president of the Bundesbank. Klasen, like Schiller, was a Social Democrat from Hamburg. But there the similarities ended. Tall, commanding, with a dislike of detail, Klasen had come to the Bundesbank in 1970 from Deutsche Bank, Germany's most powerful commercial bank. He was far more concerned than Schiller that the rising value of the D-Mark would cripple the country's export industry. Schiller was convinced of the need to revalue the D-Mark to safeguard Germany from imported inflation and advocated a joint float of European Community currencies to protect the country's competitiveness. Tension between the two men reached crisis point at the end of June 1972 when Klasen, attending a cabinet meeting in Bonn, proposed exchange controls to combat the inflow of funds into the D-Mark. In a long and bitter resignation letter, Schiller complained that Klasen had sat next to him at a European Community meeting in Luxembourg only two days before without mentioning his plans, even though he had already advised the chancellery of them. In the letter, Schiller acknowledged that he was in conflict with the majority of the cabinet. 'In this war of attrition - rich in personal defamations - the minister of finance and economics often stood alone,' he wrote. Without doubt, Schiller's tangled personal life added to his problems. Four times wed, his marriage to his third wife, Eta, during 1971 attracted unfavourable comment and hostility in the Social Democrat party and undermined his standing. His resignation from the cabinet was followed by his departure from the party presidium and the party itself. In the months following his resignation as a minister, there was intense speculation that Schiller would join the Christian Democrats in opposition to the Brandt government. He allowed his name to be used in the campaign against the governing coalition, but never jumped fully into the opposition camp. Schiller's waverings made enemies across the pol-itical spectrum. Even the most charitable observers queried his judgment. Willy Brandt's election victory left Schiller politically high and dry. Schiller's policies, however, survived his political eclipse. The final collapse of the Bretton Woods currency system in March 1973 meant that Germany again floated the D-Mark. The exchange controls that provoked Schiller's resignation had been inadequate to cope with huge currency inflows in a time of widespread international currency turbulence. Successive West German governments supported and promoted his idea of a European joint float, leading to the creation of the European Monetary System in 1979. That was in large part the achievement of another super-minister: Helmut Schmidt, a pupil of Schiller's from Hamburg, who succeeded him as minister of finance and economics in 1972 before becoming chancellor in 1974. The nature of Schiller's departure from government also had a profound effect on economic and monetary affairs in Germany and beyond by contributing to the reality and legend of Bundesbank power.</p>

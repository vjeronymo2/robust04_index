			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Jobs: Stress at work - a question of upbringing: Vulnerability in face of pressure is often linked with experiences during childhood 'WHAT'S a challenge to one person may be stress to a second, and a third's breaking point.' Besides being perennially one of the truer maxims about working life, that saying can rarely if ever have been of more urgent relevance to so many people. Recession added to sharpening trade rivalry create conditions suited only to supreme optimists, who characteristically see every setback as short-term, one-off and above all the fault of someone or something other than themselves. Challenges to them tend to be anxieties to those of us who are less sure of our own perfection, regarding failures as symptoms of personal deficiency. Nevertheless even habitually self-critical people's tendency to be stressed by things others take nonchalantly is often not their own fault. I say that on the evidence of research by the Leeds University psychologist Jenny Firth-Cozens which, although focused mainly on junior hospital doctors, has produced findings her other work suggests apply to executives too. Her studies show that proneness to stress is linked with conditions of upbringing. So it seems probable that by recognising such links, people suffering from the liability can make themselves more robust. For instance, readers who feel stress-prone may care to consider their father's age at their birth. The research revealed an impressive contrast in robustness between those respectively born to fathers under and over approximately 35. Among the junior doctors, all aged 22-23, those who never felt stressed had fathers whose average age at the time of the study was 52. That compared with 59 for the dads of the doctors who were 'cased' - the technical term for people who, although still physically well, are distractingly worried. Another factor apparently strongly linked with vulnerability was the mother's death before the child was 15. On the other hand, divorce had only a weak link and death of the father showed no association at all. But in the particular case of executives, the Leeds psychologist believes the main contributor to vulnerability is paternal rather than maternal influence. Among managers she has studied, it was those with powerful and critical fathers who most saw their bosses at work as sources of anxiety. The explanation may be that, as Freud conjectured, they project their father's stressful personality onto their chiefs, interpreting them as ogres although they may in fact be considerate souls. Even so, Jenny Firth-Cozens is well aware that bosses can be exceedingly stressful in their own right. Witness her finding that, regardless of personal vulnerability, the junior doctors in teaching hospitals - where top consultants have traditionally treated their underlings in domineering style  -were markedly more stressed than the juniors employed elsewhere. That, she says, is noteworthy evidence that something in the management of teaching hospitals is wrong. To the Jobs column's mind, it is also something even hospital chiefs short of money ought to be able to put right. NOW to the table alongside giving a sample of the results of Day Associates' latest quarterly survey of pay and perks in some five dozen international banks and investment houses in the City of London. Anyone who wants the full report, which covers 191 types of staff, should contact Joe Clark at Suite 2.31, 75 Whitechapel Rd, London E1 1DU; tel 071-375 1397, fax 071-375 1723. The price to concerns not taking part in the survey is Pounds 175 plus VAT. My figures refer to a mere 15 fairly senior positions. First come base salaries, the lower quartile representing the person a quarter way up from the foot of a ranking of all in the same kind of work, the median the person mid-way, and the upper quartile the one a quarter way down from the top. Then we have the average salary, followed by the percentage of it typically received as an additional bonus. Lastly come the percentage of the people in each type of job who have a company car, and its average price. HEADHUNTER Paul Chambers of the Freshman Consultancy seeks two recruits for separate clients he may not name. So he promises to honour applicants' requests not to be identified to the employer at this stage. His first quarry is a head for the German sales operations of an American financial information group. Although its Frankfurt office where the newcomer will be based is small, it already has numerous established customers. The job is to take the lead in building up the German business, and candidates should have a record of go-getting success in the financial information market. They must also be fluent in German. Salary indicator DM200,000-250,000. Car among other benefits. The second post, London-based but again with a US group, is for a seller of software for capital markets uses. Computer knowledge is not needed, but candidates must have detailed understanding of capital markets trading especially in off-balance-sheet instruments. Salary plus bonus on results about Pounds 50,000. Perks include car. Inquiries to 81-103 Euston St, London NW1 2ET; tel 071-388 3111, fax 071 388 3588.</p>

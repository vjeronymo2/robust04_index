			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of European Business Locations (11): It's been bad news for investors - Events this year have exposed Italy's threadbare fabric of maladministration CONVINCING foreigners that Italy is the right location for their companies has become even harder over the past six months. In a year that has probably seen as much bad publicity as any since the war, the lira's abandonment of the exchange rate mechanism in September was only one of several events that exposed a threadbare fabric of maladministration. Revelations of widespread and large-scale corruption in public sector contracts have been making news since the spring, as businessmen, civil servants and politicians have been brought into the investigators' net. The assassinations of leading anti-Mafia magistrates in Sicily in the summer highlighted the state's weakness in tackling organised crime. Such news can only have discouraged foreign companies evaluating potential locations for their operations to look at Italy before making their choice. Why opt for Italy when its problems seem so numerous and apparently so intractable? Earlier this year the Institute for Southern Development (Istituto per l'Assistenza allo Sviluppo del Mezzogiorno - IASM) published the results of a study it had commissioned into international corporate attitudes to investment in the mezzogiorno. There were worrying findings for politicians and regional planners. Business sentiment is extremely cautious about southern Italy. Crime is an important factor that discourages foreign companies from venturing south. There has been little interest in the bottom part of the Italian boot and the islands; the Calabrian toe has attracted less than 0.5 per cent of foreign investment in Italy, and Sicily only 1 per cent. Italy's justice and home affairs ministers often speak about a state of war in much of the south, and this summer's despatch of army troops to Sicily and Sardinia underlined their concern. Large areas of Sicily are dominated by the Mafia, and its cousins the 'ndrangheta hold sway in Calabria and the Camorra in Campania. Even Apulia is now the territory of organised crime. When foreign companies have decided to take advantage of incentives to invest in the south, they have overwhelmingly decided to stay as far north as possible in the eligible area. In this they follow the example of Italy's largest private sector company. Fiat's three main factories in the mezzogiorno are in the northern part; the Termoli engine plant, the assembly operation at Cassino and the integrated plant being built at Melfi. Political interference is another deterrent to foreign investment in Italy, both north and south. The scandals reported this year have exposed the tangled party political web within which business must operate. Easing a relocation operation may require contributions to party representatives or the recruitment on to the payroll of people recommended by local politicians. Slow payment of grants is a recurring complaint of companies in the mezzogiorno, with delays being measured in years rather than months. And this spotlights the uncertainty of rights; the gap between what legislation lays down and what actually happens. Many companies have found, however, that unofficial procedures exist for accelerating grant payments. For companies in the south, distance from markets (Reggio Calabria is nearly 800 miles from Milan) is exacerbated by weaknesses in infrastructure. Few companies in the south have remained unscathed by bad roads, electricity black-outs, poor signposting, telecommunications difficulties, inadequate public waste disposal systems or the like. Northern businessmen also complain about the handicap of poor infrastructure, but it is considerably worse in the south. Yet prospects of significant improvements seem slender in the present economic climate. The need to put public sector accounts in order means fewer resources for infrastructure projects throughout the country, as well as further delays in receiving grants for investment in the south. However, in addition to being affected by shortcomings in physical infrastructure, companies in Italy suffer from inefficient services. 'National and local utilities, the banking system, distribution, government offices and local authorities provide services with a poor quality-cost ratio,' said Stefano Micossi, head of the research department at the industrialists' confederation Confindustria. This complaint wins support from the Bank of Italy. Addressing its annual meeting at the end of May, the governor repeated observations that he had made on other occasions about unsatisfactory productivity and price rises in the tertiary sector. The choice of an Italian location for manufacturing plant poses challenges to foreign companies, not least regarding the productivity and costs of their own workforces. The IASM study on business attitudes to investment in the mezzogiorno reported that labour costs in Spain and Ireland were about 25 per cent less than in southern Italy, in spite of the large reductions in social security charges that business enjoys in the south compared to northern Italy. But it is not only a question of payroll costs. Italy's industrial relations system places obstacles to part-time working, job mobility and other forms of flexibility. And Italy has not benefitted from encountering and absorbing the working practices that other more competitive industrial countries, particularly Japan have adopted. This is pronounced in the south, where foreign companies complain about the absence of an industrial culture. Italy expresses interest in attracting foreign investment, yet often seems closed to outsiders. 'It is a cultural matter. There are few businessmen who genuinely want more investment in Italy by foreign companies,' said Mr Micossi.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- WORKING TIME REGULATIONS                    Maximum                 Maximum                  working week              overtime                     hours                  allowed  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria             40                    60 hours a year Belgium             40                    65 hours a quarter Denmark       no legislation                 no legislation Finland             40                    20 hours per two week period France              39                   130 hours a year Germany             40                    60 hours a year Greece              40                   150 hours a year Ireland             48                   240 hours a year Italy               40                       no legislation Luxembourg          40                     2 hours a day Netherlands         48                    12 hours a week Norway              40                   200 hours a year Portugal            44                   160 hours a year Spain               40                    80 hours a year Sweden              40                   200 hours a year Switzerland      45-50                   350 hours a year UK            no legislation                 no legislation  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Comparitive study on rules governing working conditions in the member states, 1989, European Commission/ National Governments  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jun 16, BNS -- Aloyzas Sakalas, the head  of the parliamentary faction of the Lithuanian Social Democratic  Party (LSDP) and deputy parliament chairman, presented the  Seimas [parliament] Thursday with a draft vote of no confidence  to the Lithuanian government led by Adolfas Slezevicius. "We  cannot look indifferently at how our economy has been  deteriorating," Sakalas said.    The Social Democratic faction who initiated the motion of  non- confidence blame the government for failing to stabilize  the national economy or "to make the life of Lithuanian people  easier."    However, the LSDP says that the main motive for no  confidence  to the Cabinet of the governing Lithuanian Democratic Labor  Party (LDLP), is the failure to carry out the commitments the  party took on in the pre-election period last June. "Then it  /LSDP election program/ was the best basis for reforming the  Lithuanian economy," said the chairman of the LSDP faction.    "The left-wing government has fallen short of coming up with  an industry restructuring programme foreseeing the directions of  its development; the best ways of using energy resources,  scientific and labor potential; and sales on foreign and  domestic markets," said Sakalas.    85 percent of foreign loans assigned to Lithuania was used  by  the government for consumer purposes. Each Lithuanian citizen  owes foreign creditors $120 which were "eaten up instead of  investing," according to the LSDP lawmaker.    In the sphere of agriculture the government has failed to  coordinate the production of farmers and food-processing  industries, Sakalas said.    He termed the tax and budget policy as "being badly  implemented. Heavy taxes burden people who live merely on their  salaries, while no indexing of budgetary expenditure is carried  out and inflation rates are not taken into account."    The Social Democratic MP stated that the Slezevicius-led  government has also neglected its pledge to set equal salaries  for state-employed specialists with equal qualifications. "Why  are teachers, physicians, and culture workers paid 2 to 3 times  less than employees in the energy system?," Sakalas said.    The government missed the most favorable moment for indexing  people's savings devaluated by inflation -- this should have  been done while introducing the national currency, according to  the chairman of the LSDP.    The only consequences of the Slezevicius-led government is a  decrease in the Gross Domestic Product, industrial production,  and construction of flats by 35, 46 and 38 percent,  respectively, during the year 1993, Sakalas said.    The economy has failed to be stabilized, the savings of  people are further being devaluated by the ever-widening gab  between prices and interest rates. "The standard of living has  declined, social stratification has been on the rise  dramatically, while no stabilization was reached in either the  economic or social developments," Sakalas pointed out.    The head of the Social Democratic Party noted that the  curbing of inflation processes "does not guarantee economic  stability as always stressed by the prime minister."    After the statements of the Social Democratic faction,  Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius, who is also  chairman of the LDLP, answered question put forward by members  of parliament.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / PIA urged to register agents individually The Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect private investors, should register every adviser and sales agent individually, one of the regulators it is replacing said yesterday. Sir Kenneth Clucas, chairman of Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for independent financial advisers, told the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs that Fimbra was 'disappointed' that the PIA had been deterred from opting for individual registration because the number of sales agents employed by life companies was so great. Fimbra registers IFAs individually, but the numbers in that sector of the financial services industry are significantly smaller. Both a system of individual registration and a publicly available register of those who have been subject to disciplinary action have been among the ideas backed most by MPs in the inquiry into financial regulation. Sir Kenneth, who originally proposed a single regulator for retail financial services, also suggested that the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, should be made more accountable. He proposed that it should be answerable to the Audit Commission, the government's spending watchdog. In the Commons MPs raised some fundamental doubts about the regulatory system - in particular about the way it had operated over the sale of personal pensions to people transferring or opting out of occupational schemes. Addressing what he admitted was an area of concern, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said the government would soon issue guidance for employers on how they could advise their employees about pensions - including personal pensions - without infringing the Financial Services Act. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, accused the government of having allowed 'unacceptable practices' to develop in the selling of personal pensions. Mr Alistair Darling, Labour spokesman on City affairs, forecast that the establishment of the PIA would prove to be a 'stop-gap solution'. Replying to the debate, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, described the PIA as the 'best show in town' and said he believed it was 'on track'. He insisted: 'The PIA should not be deflected by the self-interest of some of its detractors.' A Labour motion condemning the government's failure to prevent widespread abuse in the sale of personal pensions and advocating direct regulation of the pensions and financial services industry was defeated by 55 votes (309-254).</p>

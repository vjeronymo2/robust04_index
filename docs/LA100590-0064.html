			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> CAMARILLO STATE HOSPITAL TARGET OF INVESTIGATION  </P> <P> A team of investigators from the state auditor general's office is combing  through records and talking to patients this week at Camarillo State Hospital  to determine if mentally retarded children there have abused each other, as  they reportedly did at a state hospital in Sonoma.  </P> <P> Hospital officials say the probe is part of a statewide investigation and are  confident that Camarillo has no similar problems.  </P> <P> "I'm confident that we're doing fine," said Myron Dimmett, Camarillo's  standards compliance coordinator.  </P> <P> But an aide to state Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose) said Thursday that  abuse among mentally retarded patients appears to be widespread in state  institutions and that legislators are expecting to find violations at virtually  every facility.  </P> <P> "The system is rife with problems," said Peggy Collins, legislative coordinator  for McCorquodale. "These kids have been physically abusing themselves and each  other. There are kids who have been beaten up and no one knows what happened."  </P> <P> Once the auditor general's report is completed, it is expected to be the  impetus for legislative change, Collins said. "This is going to be a major  issue," she said.  </P> <P> Assemblyman William Filante (R-Greenbrae) said legislators hope that the audit  will clearly define how state and local agencies should be spending their money  to better serve mentally retarded children.  </P> <P> "We want to look at apportionment of money," Filante said. "We should put our  money where our mouths are and try to do the best we can."  </P> <P> The issue at the Sonoma Developmental Center arose last October when a group of  parents complained that their children had been beaten and sexually molested by  other patients and routinely deprived of programs mandated by law.  </P> <P> Several parents complained that their children had multiple bruises, and one  person said a child was restrained and placed in a closet at the Sonoma  facility. Some also complained that their children had been neglected because  of understaffing.  </P> <P> Officials with the state Department of Developmental Services repeatedly have  denied that the abuse occurred.  </P> <P> "Our position is the same," said Greg Sandin, spokesman for the developmental  services department. "We deny those charges."  </P> <P> But, according to Collins, the center has recently implemented changes to  address the alleged problems.  </P> <P> For example, she said, violent children are no longer housed with frail  children.  </P> <P> "The situation has improved there," she said.  </P> <P> According to Collins and other state officials, the problems at Sonoma started  after several private facilities were closed and the patients -- many of whom  were violent -- were sent to the state institution.  </P> <P> Sonoma was not prepared to handle the influx of aggressive patients, who  consequently were mixed with the weaker children, officials say.  </P> <P> "You almost need a one-on-one treatment for those type of patients," said  Joanne Hussey Bovee, chief of staff for Assemblywoman Bev Hansen (R-Santa  Rosa).  </P> <P> Shortly after the reports of abuse surfaced at Sonoma, several legislators  requested that the auditor general's office conduct an investigation of all  seven of the state facilities for the developmentally disabled.  </P> <P> "We believe that Sonoma was not an isolated incident," Bovee said. "That's why  we asked for the audit. Basically it's a performance audit to figure out how we  can do things better."  </P> <P> Kurt Sjoberg, acting state auditor general, said the report should be completed  after the first of the year.  </P></p>

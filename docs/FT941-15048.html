			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Entrepreneurs see slow recovery European entrepreneurs believe Europe could start to emerge from recession this year, but recovery will be slow and the employment crisis will persist. Those are the main findings of a survey of 100,000 small and medium-sized companies, carried out in November by Eurochambres, the European association of chambers of commerce. A survey of 5,000 European companies published last week was similarly gloomy about the immediate prospects for an end to the effects of recession. Accountancy firm Grant Thornton and the consultancy Business Strategies, which plan to publish the full survey in May, concluded that smaller businesses expected no rise in profitability, employment or investment this year. Eurochambres' survey of business prospects - the first and probably the largest of its kind - found clear differences in expectations across the EU. British entrepreneurs were among the most optimistic about prospects for 1994, while about a third of the west German companies questioned expected business to develop unfavourably this year. Sir Tommy Macpherson, president of Eurochambres, yesterday warned the European Commission and national governments not to ignore small and medium-sized companies. He said that they would provide the main source of employment growth in the coming years. Eurochambres European Economic Survey 1994, Rue Archimede 5, 1040 Brussels, Belgium.

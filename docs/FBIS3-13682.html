A Syrian official has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that  Israel caused that impasse and that only international and U.S.  action can resolve it by putting pressure on Israel to return to  the basis on which the peace initiative was founded, and by  doing that on all fronts without putting pressure on the  Palestinians to implement the Oslo agreement, because that  agreement has been proven to be a failure and is unacceptable to  the Palestinian people.    The source said that there was no alternative to an Israeli  declaration of willingness to withdraw completely from all the  occupied territories in order to ensure the success of the  negotiations. He added that the settlements issue has become an  urgent matter which must be discussed to determine the fate of  the settlers and to work for their evacuation from the occupied  Arab territories because they have become a daily threat and  danger to the Palestinian people, as Hebron's al-Ibrahimi mosque  massacre demonstrated.    The official said that the aim of Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to the United States was to make  Washington pressure the Palestinians into completing the  separate peace agreement to enable the occupation authorities to  impose the settlements for five more years at least, and also to  paralayze the Security Council and prevent it passing an  anti-Israel resolution and providing protection for the  Palestinian people.    He said that Syria was still interested in peace and had  from  the beginning responded to the prerequisites of the peace  process, but Israel was placing many obstacles in the way of any  progress. There will be no progress, he said, as long as Israel  continues to pursue a policy which does not serve peace in any  way. [passage omitted]</p>

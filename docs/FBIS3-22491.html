The  survey showed that estimates of Chinese population with active  TB is 523 per 100,000, and population with positive TB is 134  per 100,000. Estimates of patients contracting active TB and  positive TB are around 5.39 million and 1.51 million  respectively, despite recent decreases of 2.8 percent and 3.0  percent of patients with active TB and positive TB. Experts  believe that the above decreasing rates are still too low  compared with that of other diseases. Although large cities such  as Beijing and Shanghai have shown sharp decreases at an annual  rate of 19.2 percent and 15.7 percent respectively, active TB  and positive TB cases in autonomous regions and the rural areas  such as Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Guizhou, and Xinjiang have  increased approximately 2.4 times and 2.8 times that of large  cities.</p>

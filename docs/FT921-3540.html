			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Election 92: Slim finance bill faithful to Budget THE FINANCE bill which will be published this morning and rushed through the Commons today will be a mere shadow of the Budget statement, but with much the same outline. The 11-clause bill will contain these provisions: Alcohol: extra 28p on a bottle of spirits, just under 5p on a bottle of wine, and just over one penny on a pint of beer. Tobacco: extra 13p on a packet of cigarettes, 10 per cent rise on cigars and other tobacco products, except pipe tobacco where the increase is only in line with inflation. Petrol: duty on unleaded petrol and diesel raised in line with inflation, but a 7 1/2 per cent increase in leaded petrol. Vehicle excise duty: extra Pounds 10 on vehicle excise duty on cars, taxis and light vans. General betting duty: cut in general betting duty from 8 per cent to 7.75 per cent. VAT: the change setting up a system of monthly payments on account for large businesses, though they can still submit VAT returns quarterly. There will be a separate clause bringing in changes to the serious misdeclaration provisions - removing penalties on underdeclarations of tax up to Pounds 2,000, and cutting the penalty rate from 20 per cent to 15 per cent and the maximum default surcharge from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. Car tax: halving of special car tax from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. Income tax: introduction of the lower rate 20 per cent band for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. There will be a separate clause freezing the married couple's allowance. All the other Budget measures, even those which are uncontentious, will not be enacted before the election. Apart from the changes to inheritance tax, the most notable omission is the change to the transitional arrangements for the uniform business rate - enabling some businesses gaining to realise their gains more quickly, and ensuring that no business faces an increase above inflation. This is delayed because it requires a local government finance bill which could not be prepared and passed in time. The extra help for pensioners on income support are not due to take effect until October, while other tax changes, such as those to help the film industry, will apply in arrears. Changes in personal equity plans allowing Pounds 6,000 to be invested in unit and investment trusts over a tax year, may not need to be in the bill. The Unit Trust Association said the government had statutory powers to alter Pep rules. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, made a slip in his Budget speech when he gave the wrong figure for the new annual turnover above which companies will pay VAT, the Treasury confirmed yesterday. The new threshold is Pounds 36,600, not Pounds 38,000 as Mr Lamont stated on Tuesday. 'It was a slip of the tongue,' said the Treasury. 'This isn't the first time this has happened to a chancellor on Budget day.' Job gains likely, Page 9</p>

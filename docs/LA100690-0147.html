			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE STUMPED AFTER SEARCH FOR WOMAN;  </P> <P> DISAPPEARANCE: ANAHEIM RESIDENT WITH MENTAL CAPACITY OF A CHILD HASN'T BEEN  SEEN SINCE LAST WEEK. INVESTIGATORS STILL DON'T HAVE A SINGLE CLUE.  </P> <P> Police are still searching for a mentally disabled woman who was last seen more  than a week ago walking her school-age cousin to a junior high school.  </P> <P> Despite conducting an extensive search for 20-year-old Tufa Petelo since she  was reported missing on Sept. 26 by her aunt, investigators have been unable to  come up with a single clue, Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said.  </P> <P> "We haven't been able to find her," Hedgpeth said. "Now we're really starting  to get concerned."  </P> <P> Hedgpeth said that police and Petelo's aunt, Sutatia Tausili, with whom she  lives, were particularly disturbed by the young woman's disappearance because  she has the mental capacity of a 12-year-old.  </P> <P> On the day of her disappearance, Petelo was seen walking with her cousin to  Brookhurst Junior High on Brookhurst Street about 7 a.m., Hedgpeth said.  </P> <P> "We are assuming she was returning home," Hedgpeth said. "She has not been seen  since."  </P> <P> Petelo routinely walked the path, which included a long stretch alongside a  "remote" flood control channel, Hedgpeth said.  </P> <P> "We've made several searches for her in that area," Hedgpeth said. "We've  canvassed the area and walked the flood control channel. We've had no success."  </P> <P> On Thursday, teams of detectives passed out 400 flyers bearing her picture and  physical description to residents living in the neighborhoods near the flood  control channel, Hedgpeth said.  </P> <P> And on Friday, members of the department's juvenile detail were back out in the  area, searching through ditches and bushes for any sign of the woman.  Detectives have also contacted the Adam Walsh Center, which publicizes and  catalogues missing children nationally.  </P> <P> Petelo is described as a Samoan with a wide-bridged nose and a false tooth on  the upper left side of her mouth. She is 5-foot-2 and weighs 138 pounds.  </P> <P> She was wearing blue, knee-length pants, a red shirt and a black-and-white  sweater when she disappeared.  </P> <P> Anyone with information about the missing woman is asked to call Anaheim police  at (714) 999-1947.  </P></p>

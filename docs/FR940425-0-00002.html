Rinderpest has not existed in Germany since 1870 and there have been no outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease since January 1988. This revision will remove the prohibition on the importation from Germany into the United States of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from ruminants, and will relieve restrictions on the importation from Germany of milk and milk products from ruminants. This final rule does not relieve restrictions on the importation from Germany of swine and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from swine, because Germany has not been declared free of hog cholera and swine vesicular disease. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are also adding Germany to the list of countries that, although declared free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease, are subject to restrictions on the importation of their meat and other animal products into the United States. Finally, we are also adding Germany to the list of countries from which the importation into the United States of llamas and alpacas is restricted. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  May 10, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Dr. Elizabeth Klontz, Staff Veterinarian, Import-Export Products Staff, National Center for Import and Export, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 758A, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;7830. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The regulations in 9 CFR part 94 (referred to below as ``the regulations'') govern the importation into the United States of specified animals and animal products to prevent the introduction into the United States of various diseases, including rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy, African swine fever, hog cholera, and swine vesicular disease (SVD). These are dangerous and destructive communicable diseases of ruminants and swine. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 94.1(a)(1) of the regulations provides that rinderpest or FMD exists in all countries of the world except those listed in &sect;94.1(a)(2), which are declared to be free of both diseases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 20, 1994, we published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 3029&hyph;3031, Docket No. 93&hyph;159&hyph;1) a proposal to add Germany to the list in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;94.1(a)(2) of countries declared to be free of rinderpest and FMD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also proposed to add Germany to the list in &sect;94.11(a) of countries declared free of rinderpest and FMD that are subject to special restrictions on the importation of their meat and other animal products into the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, we proposed to add Germany to the list in &sect;94.1(d)(1) of countries in which rinderpest or FMD has been known to exist and that were declared free of rinderpest and FMD on or after September 28, 1990. All countries in which rinderpest or FMD has been known to exist and that were declared free of rinderpest and FMD on or after September 28, 1990, must be added to the list. Adding Germany to this list would prohibit the importation or entry of llamas and alpacas from Germany into the United States, unless in accordance with 9 CFR 92.435. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 60-day comment period ending March 21, 1994. We did not receive any comments. The facts presented in the proposed rule still provide the basis for this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effective Date <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective less than 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This rule removes the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from Germany, of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from ruminants and relieves restrictions on the importation from Germany of milk and milk products from ruminants. We have determined that approximately 2 weeks are needed to ensure that Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service personnel at ports of entry receive official notice of this change in the regulations. Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this rule should be made effective 15 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

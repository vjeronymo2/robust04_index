			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with George Sa'adah, leader of the Lebanese </F> Phalangist Party, by Radio Monte Carlo reporter Antoine  Kustantin in Beirut; date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Sa'adah] In view of what is currently happening on  the ground, which has created the fears we have spoken about, we  announced yesterday through the Voice of Lebanon radio station  that we abide by these decisions. However, we understand that  they are extraordinary measures which will last for a short  period of time until the new law on organizing the media has  been implemented as part of the national reconciliation document.    [Kustantin] Don't you fear that this [words indistinct] will  take a long time?    [Sa'adah] That is what we fear and is why we have many  questions. If the intent is to sacrifice liberties for a short  period of time for the sake of providing people's safety and for  stability in Lebanon, then this is acceptable. But if the  intent is to gag people, especially opposition radios, so the  rulers will get some relief, this is something else. Therefore,  we will contact senior officials to speed up measures to pass  the new media law and end measures to prevent radio stations and  other media from carrying out their duties.    [Kustantin] Concerning stopping the private media from  broadcasting news, does this decision have any legal or  political justifications? Are you convinced about the  justifications?    [Sa'adah] If the justifications are for a short period of  time, it is possible to control news related to the movements of  the army and security forces and the investigation. Although  the Voice of Lebanon, which belongs to the Phalagist Party, was  licensed as a news station long ago, we submit to the Council of  Ministers' decision if such a decision leads to providing relief  for the Lebanese public. But this public will not rest if  liberties disappear. This is what we will watch in the coming  days. We will not remain silent about any repression of  liberties.    [Kustantin] Concerning the Christian issue, reports say that  the Phalangist Party was relieved by the decision to dissolve  the Lebanese Forces Party, as it gives it a free hand to become  the sole representative of the Christians. Certain papers also  write about the possibility of your acting within the law to  regain property over which you are in dispute with the Lebanese  Forces. How true are these reports?    [Sa'adah] Concerning legal actions, some law suits were  lodged long ago. Other suits have been prepared despite the new  developments. As for us being relieved by these measures and  now having a free hand, we have always called for party  multiplicity and for a political, principled, and ideological  competition. We are not relieved merely because the Lebanese  Forces Party has been dissolved. We are relieved because the  series of explosions have been halted. If the state and the  security organs had not taken the measures they took, the series  of explosions would have expanded, spreading the terror we have  seen recently.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with 'Ali Reza Rahmani, "member of the </F> Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization," by unidentified correspondent;  date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Close-up shot of Rahmani talking to camera,  interspersed with shots of bombed shrine at Mashhad and funeral  procession of those killed; interviewer not shown]    [Rahmani] In the name of God, the Merciful, the  Compassionate. My name is 'Ali Reza Rahmani, alias Hamid Reza'i.  I was a member of one of the operational teams of the  Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization [MKO]. I was sent into the  country in order to place a bomb in Mashhad. I have been in  prison for the last 20 months. Although I had given all the  information I had, I was not prepared to take part in a  television interview. However, following the recent crime  carried out by the grouplet in the shrine of the eighth imam, I  announced my readiness to take part in a television interview.  I have two motives for this interview: First, to expose the  antihuman nature of this evil grouplet; and second, to give a  message to people like myself who have become puppets in the  hands of this grouplet. [video of bombed shrine]    After I left this country I was arrested by Iraqi  intelligence and taken to prison. After interrogation in the  Iraqi intelligence prisons, I announced that I entered Iraq from  Iran in order to join the organization [MKO] and I provided them  with the specific code. After giving them the specific code and  other codes, the intelligence officers arranged a meeting  between me and the leadership of the organization, who were in  touch with Iraqi intelligence. I met Mehdi Bara'i and Fereshteh  Yeganeh. At this meeting I gave the code and specifications I  had, and managed to gain their trust. It became clear that I  was one of the organization's supporters inside the country.  After I was fully recognized, Mehdi Bara'i and Fereshteh  Yeganeh sent me to the MKO camp, called Ashraf, which is near  Baghdad. We were housed inside U-shaped buildings inside the  camp. We were separated from other members of the organization.  During this time, we received training in the use of colts,  grenades, bombs, and destruction, and in weapons' recognition.  Those directly responsible for this training were Fereshteh  Yeganeh, Nasrin Berenji, Mehdi Madavi, and Sa'id.    The single and group combat training took three months. At  the end of the training period they put on certain ceremonies  for us, called arming ceremonies. During these ceremonies, Pari  Yusofi, representing the MKO leadership, read a message. The  text of the message was: You are the best group of home  headquarters [setad-e dakheleh] inside the country. You will be  our vanguards inside the country. We hope that you will carry  out your operations successfully. Yours, your brother Mas'ud.    At the end of the ceremonies, the next day, we were divided  into 16 groups. Each group consisted of two people. Each group  was prepared for operations inside the country. We were the  third group, which was dispatched into the country. The group I  was in comprised of myself and Mohammad Javad, and because of  the sensitivity of the task....[pauses] I mentioned that I was  dispatched on a mission in Mashhad. Because of the sensitivity  and worry that the organization had concerning that mission they  separated us from the rest, and all the programs and  explanations that we had were carried out separately and in  total secrecy. My immediate briefing officer was Mehdi Bara'i,  Fereshteh Yeganeh, Nasrin Berenji, and Sa'id. Fahimeh Arvani  had direct supervision. For seven days we were in a building  that was separate from the rest. During those seven days we  learned more about the methods of bomb placement, methods for  placing bombs, methods of reconnoitering the area and finding  out about routes and traffic. And, in general, the buildings I  was supposed to bomb were the municipality in Mashhad, the  Justice Department in Mashhad, and the area near the Imam's  courtyard in the immaculate shrine. Those were demonstrated to  me on models. The places I had to bomb were all pointed out to  me. I was briefed by maps.    At that time I used to think that for the sake of the  success  of the organization any tasks must be carried out. Essentially  I never thought that by placing a bomb in the municipality or  the shrine or the Justice Department that some innocent people  would be killed.    After the briefings -- which I received from Mehdi Bara'i  and  Sa'id -- ended, Maryam Rajavi met me directly. At that meeting  she once again reminded me of Mas'ud's message, and wished me  success in my missions. She told me: When you complete your  mission and return we will put resources and complete welfare  facilities at your disposal here. We will even send you outside  the country -- outside Iraq -- to study if you wish. And a  series of empty promises.    That night, after the end of the ceremony and the talks, we  were briefed by 'Ali Shiraz about the route that we were to take  into the country. 'Ali Shiraz was the head of the dispatch team  responsible for dispatching forces into the country. On the map  placed on the table he clearly briefed us on the route we were  to take. Later, Mehdi Bara'i gave me three packages of cooking  oil, which contained explosives and bombs, and said they are to  be taken for operations at designated places. They gave me  cyanide tablets and said I should not be arrested alive and that  I should commit suicide if I felt in danger. They also gave me  false identity cards to help me on the trip. We started off the  following morning and were accompanied by 'Ali Shiraz, 'Ali  Abolfathi, Hassan, and Sa'id. Coordination had been made with  Iraqi posts along the way and we travelled from Baghdad to an  area near the Qasr-Shirin border with no difficulty. We even  changed cars at the Iraqi posts and received equipment. Finally  we reached the Qalavand post, which is next to Naftshar on the  Iraq border. With the cooperation of Iraqi officers there we  used long-distance binoculars in the observation post to study  the route we were to take. The dangerous points and Iranian  posts were studied and noted. We were again and finally briefed  by 'Ali Shiraz about the map. At night, Mohammad Javad, 'Ali  Abolfathi, and Hassan and I started off on the designated route.    We entered our own country, with the aim of placing our  bombs  in the designated areas once we reached our objectives, and we  would carry out our mission in the best possible way and please  our masters.    I was arrested before I could reach Tehran. And in prison I  learned that my team mate, Mohammad Javad, had been killed by  his own bomb in Naser-Khosrow Street [in Tehran], while he was  preparing it.    Out of eight teams dispatched to the country, 14 persons  were  arrested, one was killed, and one escaped.    [Correspondent] Mr. Rahmani, the question here is, why did  you choose Mashhad to carry out the operation?    [Rahmani] At the time, in 1371 [year starting 21 March 1992]  Mashhad witnessed a lot of unrest. That was why the  organization paid particular attention to Mashhad. As they said  themselves, another commotion; uproar had to be created in  Mashhad again. That was why they offered Mashhad to me. They  offered areas to me; after 20 months in prison I now realize  just how many innocent people would have been killed if I had  exploded a bomb in the municipality or the Justice Department.  [video shows crowds shown chanting: "Death to the MKO;" "Death  to the Shameless MKO;" "Death to America." Crowd begins to  repeat chants after a chant leader: "This is proof of America's  crime;" "The Plot of the Shameless MKO;" "Where have these  petals come from; they have come from the immaculate shrine of  Imam Reza."]    [Correspondent] You pointed out that you were to place the  bomb in holy Mashhad and at the holy shrine of His Eminence Imam  Reza, peace be upon him. Why was this place chosen?    [Rahmani] Basically the aim of the organization in sending  me  to Mashhad and placing bombs in places I mentioned was because  the places were crowded. The main aim of the organization was  to explode the bomb in crowded places. It was emphasised to me  to place the bomb in the municipality when the mayor was  present, when the municipality would be the most crowded. As an  answer to your question: The organization chose them simply  because they were crowded.    [Correspondent] As you say yourself, the municipality and  the  holy shrine of His Eminence Imam Reza are crowded places. What  was your motive?    [Rahmani] The atmosphere and the misguidance was such that I  imagined everything was possible. Even killing and massacring  people seemed normal to me. I was prepared to do anything to  better present myself to my responsible officers and masters. I  thought that the organization was all important. It was my  father, mother and sister. There was misguided propaganda.  They even told me that if I was arrested I would have boiling  water poured over my body and I would be flogged. However,  since the time of my arrest not the slightest disrespect has  been shown toward me. I was under the influence of emotions and  did not know what I was doing. Finally, I ask for the  forgiveness of the martyrdom-rearing nation and the leader of  the Islamic revolution. I can only say that I am sorry.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Federal Counterintelligence Service Director </F> Sergey Stepashin by Vitaliy Tretyakov under the rubric "Special  Services"; place and date not given: "Today the Russian  President Holds a Conference With the Federal  Counterintelligence Service Leadership; the Day Before, FCS  Director Sergey Stepashin Answered NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  Questions"]    [Text]    [Tretyakov] As we agreed, my written questions will revolve  mostly around FCS participation in economic crime suppression.  Therefore, let us, please, start with this: Does today's FCS  have the resources for a serious--and most importantly,  effective--fight against economic crime and corruption? One gets  the impression that state security cadres are crushed or  demoralized. Many can be bribed because life is hard and bribes  are generous. Is there a program to combat economic crime--for  example, one that would allow the netting of a whole mafiosi  clan, freezing its bank accounts, arresting the leaders,  neutralizing the musclemen, etc., in one day?    [Stepashin] This year an economic counterintelligence  directorate and corresponding local units have been set up  within the FCS; their tasks include, among other things, the  problems you mentioned. The system of economic  counterintelligence was not created from scratch--it was build  on the basis of BKK (suppression of contraband and corruption)  units in the former Ministry of Security [MB], which had  accumulated considerable experience in this work. Operational  units recently were staffed by young operatives--FCS Academy  graduates. People are in the mood for work.    Of course, we lost a number of highly skilled specialists.  Some went to work for commercial structures (our professionals  are highly sought everywhere and offered salaries that sometimes  are tens of times higher than what they were paid in the  government service); some went to the tax police, where salaries  also are one and a half to two times as high. And some simply  got tired of endless reorganizations and uncertainty.    I want to mention, by the way, that unfortunately our  society  has not yet realized that a poor--and hence weak--special  service in the final count costs the state dearly. For instance,  they calculate how much it costs to maintain us (which, by the  way, is considerably less than in developed countries) and  complain that this burden has to be carried by the taxpayer. A  special service that functions normally, however, not only pays  for itself but also saves the state enormous money. It is just  that the results are not always on the surface for everyone to  see. But such is the specificity of our work. For instance, you  can calculate in rubles the gain from counterintelligence  preventing a deal worth billions that is known to be  disadvantageous for the state, or illegal exports of oil from  Russia by train load. But how do you put a price on closing off  a channel through which commercial information leaks to foreign  competitors, halting the activities of a bureaucrat who takes  large bribes, liquidating an international narcotics ring,  keeping foreign crooks from participating in the privatization  of a domestic plant, or keeping the authorities informed of  concrete threats of a strategic nature in the economic sphere?    A considerable part of our operational information along the  line of suppression of economic crime and corruption is put to  use through investigative units of other law enforcement organs  (the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD], Procuracy, tax police,  and customs). This fact is frequently overlooked.    In unmasking dangerous manifestations of economic crime we  also actively work together with internal affairs organs and the  Procuracy. As to "netting" an entire mafiosi clan, technically  this is not a problem for us. The tricky part is the law, which  still does not define what constitutes organized crime and a  criminal organization. As they say, you cannot nail down  something that does not exist--so if there is no clan, there are  no leaders and no bank accounts. What does exist are individuals  committing (or even not committing) concrete crimes covered by  the Criminal Code.    To strong-arm groups we can apply Criminal Code Article 77  (gangsterism), but it covers "armed gangs intent on attacking  state or public enterprises or individuals." As you can see,  those who "quietly and peacefully" pocket illegal billions  cannot be charged under this article.    [Tretyakov] Few people in society doubt that corruption has  reached the very top. But the FCS is not the former KGB; there  are already special services of higher rank--for example, the  presidential. Can the FCS effectively fight corruption in the  top echelons of power under these circumstances?    [Stepashin] Current legislation places corruption  suppression  in the top echelons within FCS competence, and the fact that  there exist other special services does not keep us from  carrying out our tasks. I will note in passing that I do not  believe that there are special services of "higher" or "lower"  rank. Although if you mean financial maintenance, then some  Russian special services are indeed "above" the FCS. But we get  "consolation" from the better skills and higher professionalism  of our staff. This is what keeps us going.    Speaking, however, of law enforcement organs whose interests  may cross, our opinion is unequivocal: Monopolism in the sphere  of combating corruption and dangerous types of economic crime is  absolutely impermissible. Not only is there enough work for  everyone--there will still be some left. Also, do not forget  that corruption has penetrated law enforcement organs as well.    [Tretyakov] Do you have a feeling that important information  quite often is leaked from your agency and other agencies, and  also that propaganda campaigns are launched that play into the  hands of corrupt structures?    [Stepashin] Our society has become more open today.  Sometimes  more than necessary. Nowadays some staff members of our agency  quite often (perhaps too often) give interviews to the mass  media. We have not had leaks of important information, though.  In the country as a whole, however, such a trend regretfully  does exist. What can one do... society becomes commercialized;  information has become a commodity, too, and some bureaucrats  are not above selling it.    As to propaganda campaigns, we feel it very clearly these  days. Criminal structures have enormous money, and propaganda  also is an investment, and potentially very profitable. They  gain a lot, for instance, from discrediting law enforcement  organs and special services. They understand very well that the  attitude towards counterintelligence on the part of not only the  society but also of the president is formed to a large extent  under the influence of the mass media. Discreditation is  conducted both in general and on specific cases.    In the course of investigation and trial in the case of an  attempt to illegally export from Russia a large consignment of  diesel fuel, there were frank attempts to discredit FCS  investigators and operatives. Materials organized in the  newspapers KOMMERSANT, SVOBODNAYA ZONA, and 24 portrayed special  services as structures standing in the way of economic  transformations, organizing persecution of "private"  entrepreneurs. Along the same lines, through connections of the  accused, a television report was organized. After the  allegations had been checked authoritatively, the rulings on all  complaints were in favor of the investigation, while the  Baltiyskiy Rayon court in Kaliningrad indicted a group of  persons on the charges of smuggling. There are quite a few such  facts.    There have been numerous actions of this kind in connection  with the investigation of criminal abuse of an official position  by the former head of administration of Penza Oblast--when his  unlawful activities were made public some mass media presented  it as an attempt to "discredit a democratic official."    You probably noticed at the time the tidal wave of materials  promulgating the theme that shadow capital will give a positive  impulse to the national economy. As we can see now, there is  no--and had not been any--impulse, while enormous unlawfully  obtained capital had been successfully "laundered" and now every  day we see on television the commercials of some companies,  whose prosperity was built on an extremely questionable  foundation. Here is an example of profitable propaganda.    Alas, some newspapers, radio stations, and television  companies actually turned into frankly commercial enterprises. I  would like to use this opportunity to address the mass media: Do  not be so omnivorous. Find in yourself the strength to refuse a  good profit if the information offered to you leaves a bad  aftertaste or comes from questionable individuals.    [Tretyakov] Much is being said about economic crime and  corruption, but I cannot recall any major or at least  sensational disclosure, let alone a trial. What can the FCS show  in this respect?    [Stepashin] I do not agree with you. There have been and are  disclosures. And will be. Examples? Here are some of the latest  that I can now talk about.    In November 1993, on the basis of materials of the former  MB's Yaroslavl Oblast Directorate, at the oblast procuracy's  request, A.F. Gusev, deputy head of the oblast administration,  was dismissed from his job for participating in commercial  structure activities for personal gain.    In January 1994, the FCS's St. Petersburg city and oblast  directorate initiated criminal proceedings against L.V.  Savenkov, deputy mayor of St. Petersburg and chairman of the  mayoralty committee on trade, public catering, consumer services  and city food supply, who had attempted to organize the  smuggling out of the city of 7.5 tonnes of caviar worth R40  million, as well as setting up production of a platinum group  metal--osmium-187--for selling abroad. Among items confiscated  from Savenkov were more than $10,000, other foreign currency,  R3.5 million, credit cards and documents indicating existence of  accounts in foreign banks, 15 kinds of foreign-made television  and radio equipment, a Walther handgun with ammunition, and  other unregistered weapons.    On the basis of materials collected by the Russian FCS's  Pskov Oblast Directorate, the Procuracy initiated criminal  proceedings under RSFSR Criminal Code Article 78 (contraband)  against A.I. Kabanov, deputy chairman of the oblast committee  for the administration of state property, who had organized the  smuggling of metals out of the country and weapons into the  country. Eight persons were arrested with him. The materials  were referred to court.    The economic counterintelligence directorate has uncovered  unlawful activities of a far-flung criminal association with the  participation of central staff officers of the MVD and a number  of other law enforcement organs (more than 20 persons  altogether). In exchange for large bribes, they carried out the  orders of professional criminal groups in the Moscow  region--dropping criminal charges against their members who were  under investigation for muggings, robberies, smuggling, and  illegal possession of arms, as well as changing the measure to  secure court appearance, reducing the sentence handed down by  the court, and so on. Criminal proceedings were initiated and  referred to the office of the procurator general of Russia.    I would like to note that the experience of FCS units shows  considerable difficulties that arise in investigating and  stopping incidents of corruption among high-ranking officials,  who actively use their official position, influence, and  connections in higher echelons of power and administration to  circumvent the measures aimed at unmasking and documenting their  unlawful actions.    It does not help to fight corruption in the top echelons of  power that there is no legal--and much needed--mechanism to  require persons authorized to perform state functions to declare  their income, real and personal property, bank deposits, and  securities.    We also hope that the process of developing and adopting  laws  on suppression of corruption, organized crime, witness  protection, and protection of members of law enforcement organs  and special services will be speeded-up.    [Tretyakov] How can the FCS help to solve the problem of  holes in the borders--a very important problem in crime  suppression?    [Stepashin] The problem of holes in the borders is directly  tied with the plundering of the national wealth of Russia. It is  common knowledge on what an immense scale raw materials,  components, and products are illegally exported abroad.  Counterintelligence organs, within their competence, take steps  in the existing circumstances to close the contraband channels.  But the extent of the "transparency" of the borders makes it  impossible to fight contraband effectively not just with our own  resources and means, but also for the border troops, the customs  committee, and internal affairs organs. Many issues need to be  resolved not so much from the angle of "enforcement" agencies as  through reducing the intensity of economic problems and  regulation of export mechanisms. This involves first and  foremost the transit of freight into Kaliningrad Oblast, a  considerable part of which does not reach its destination and  remains in the Baltic countries, from where it proceeds to the  West.    A major problem is bringing order into the entry, exit, and  stay of foreigners, as well as persons without citizenship, in  Russia. Today there is complete chaos in this. We can only guess  more or less how many and of whom there are here. On the other  hand, members of criminal groups, gangsters, easily obtain  Russian foreign-travel passports in assumed names and travel  abroad.    We need a single interagency system of registration for  foreigner entry, exit, and stay, an integrated electronic  databank. This will enable us in principle to monitor the flow  of foreigners, identify undesirables (terrorists, international  crooks, persons wanted by Interpol and other law enforcement  agencies) as they enter our territory.    This, however, presents another problem. Such a registration  system will only be effective if the border is "under lock and  key." And what do we have now? We periodically run into a  situation where known intelligence officers easily slip into  Russia undetected through the borders of CIS countries, and we  only learn of their presence here by accident.    [Tretyakov] In this connection, what is the level and volume  of contacts with the sister special services of CIS countries?    [Stepashin] Being a legal successor of the Russian MB,  including in matters of international cooperation, the FCS works  on the basis of previously signed agreements on cooperation and  interaction with special services and security organs of most of  the CIS member states. We are doing some practical rewriting and  preparation work to get analogous agreements with other CIS  member states special services and security organs ready for  signing. This creates and strengthens the contract-legal base  for cooperation in the form of intergovernment and interagency  international agreements.    We maintain regular contacts with our foreign partners'  representatives in Moscow, exchange delegations on the agency  level, hold working meetings of experts.    All of this permits the Russian FCS to interact with  partners  in CIS countries on various issues for the purpose of preventing  harm to Russia's interests in political, economic, and  military-strategic areas.    Built on this basis, cooperation between special services  produces concrete results. We have examples of successful  counterintelligence operations conducted with partners from CIS  countries in the sphere of disrupting illegal drug trafficking,  combating terrorism, and smuggling arms and explosives. The  cooperation that is developing along the lines of combating  transborder organized crime also is producing results.    In the sphere of economic counterintelligence, we work  together on such matters as halting illegal exports of petroleum  products from Russia, uncovering, preventing, and stopping  crimes in the financial and banking sphere, ensuring security of  transportation, and others.    [Tretyakov] Can we hope that the FCS, while not ready today  to deal a decisive blow to economic crime and corruption, at  least is accumulating information that creates a beachhead for a  future offensive?    [Stepashin] First of all, I want to say that this problem  has  been neglected for too long. Therefore we cannot hope to solve  it overnight. We work on the premise that we will have to  conduct a protracted, so to say, trench warfare against economic  crime, including corruption. This is the target we set for our  operational directorates. Taking this into account, we currently  considerably increased information analysis work. You see, in  the new environment the economic mechanism in some elements  develops spontaneously, which immediately is taken advantage of  by dishonest businessmen and corrupt officials. It may not be  very difficult to catch them red-handed, but to reveal the  hidden springs of economic crime, its, so to speak, nature in  different spheres of economic-financial activities is one of the  most important tasks of information analysis work. We our  analysts are oriented toward in-depth analysis of the  information we receive, preparation of predictive evaluations,  and conclusions for the higher political leadership of the  country. They also incorporate proposals on changes needing to  be made to legislative acts and normative documents in order to  close the loopholes permitting abuse. This is, briefly, our  contribution to, as you put it, the beachhead for a future  offensive.    By the way, although, as I said, in fighting economic crime  we have always coordinated our work with other special services  and law enforcement organs, with which we have signed (or are  getting ready to sign) agreements on cooperation, it would  benefit our common cause to delineate more clearly the sphere of  competence between different agencies dealing with economic  crime.    [Tretyakov] Facts, versions, and rumors related to the  murder  and funeral of Otari Kvantrishvili undoubtedly plunged the  society into pessimism regarding the balance of forces in this  sphere. Everybody (or almost everybody) saw that today even the  former KGB, let alone the MVD, is virtually powerless in facing  the mighty "kingpins" of organized crime. Would you care to  argue this?    [Stepashin] Facts, versions, rumors--let us sort this out.  Facts are the basis of versions that are now being developed by  the investigative organs jointly with operational units. Rumors,  on the other hand, which are spread mostly by journalists in the  mass media, help to form precisely that kind of public opinion  "regarding the balance of forces" that you are talking about. I  cannot agree that these rumors "unquestionably plunged society  into pessimism." My colleagues, who also are a part of  society--and a considerable, active, and educated part of it at  that--despite the absence of laws on organized crime (how many  years have they been under discussion, and finally the State  Duma recently adopted in the first draft the law on corruption),  without sufficient material and technical support, and many  other things that I will not enumerate because it has been said  an uncountable number of times--today, loyal to their duty, do  everything possible to disrupt the criminal activities of  mafiosi clans without falling into the "pessimism" of feeling  "powerless" in facing the "mighty kingpins of organized crime."  And I must tell you that they are working in this direction  increasingly more confidently and achieving the desired results.  So, in my view, there are no reasons for pessimism.    [Tretyakov] Democratic countries a have well-developed and  efficiently operating system of parliamentary special service  activities oversight. In your capacity as a deputy in the last  Russian Supreme Soviet, you were one of the first people to  begin to plant this practice on our soil. What is happening in  this respect now? Who and how frequently will they inspect your  agency; will you be presenting reports to special committees?  How deeply, in your opinion, may parliament members get into  your affairs?    [Stepashin] The need for counterintelligence organ activity  oversight is predicated on their role and place in the total  Russian state security system and their use of specific forms  and methods of activities in dealing with the tasks with which  they are charged, and keeping in mind that carrying out certain  functions does not involve a certain limitation of citizens'  rights and freedoms [sentence as published].    The basis of the concept of overseeing counterintelligence  organs activities must consist of two most important principles.    First, it is a guaranteed observance of rights and freedoms  of the individual in counterintelligence organs carrying out  their direct functions, when restriction of rights is permitted  only on the grounds, conditions, and in accordance with the  procedure envisaged by federal laws, and only with respect to  persons committing actions aimed at inflicting harm on  individuals, society, and the state.    Second, in carrying out and developing counterintelligence  organ activity oversight forms, it is necessary to take into  account their covert nature necessitated mainly by the  specificities of combating intelligence and sabotage activities  of foreign special services and organizations against the  Russian Federation.    There is no question that those carrying out oversight of  counterintelligence activities must have a different scope of  powers defined by their role and place in the system of state  and society. Among those authorized to carry out such oversight  within the scope of their powers established by the Constitution  and other legislative acts of the Russian Federation are the  president, the Federal Assembly, and the Russian Federation  Government. There is also judiciary oversight.    Currently, counterintelligence organ activity oversight is  carried out by the Russian Federation president. The Russian  Federation parliament has the right to oversee the use of the  federal budget through the part of the means appropriated for  the Russian FCS through the Accounting Chamber especially formed  for these purposes. In addition, on matters of security,  relevant Federation Council and State Duma committees may hold  parliamentary hearings to which they may invite  counterintelligence organ leaders.    Judiciary control and oversight by the procuracy organs play  an increasingly greater role and significance with respect to  compliance with the law in counterintelligence organs carrying  out their activities.    [Tretyakov] What is the current "range" of FCS officers'  pay?  What percentage of officers leaving your agency do so for  financial reasons?    [Stepashin] Of course, any serious company strives to  acquire  a specialist who has received a good education, has excellent  professional training, possesses knowledge and skills that are  so much needed in the difficult situation that exists today,  especially in the sphere of business.    The so-called "range" of military rank pay for  counterintelligence organ operatives is between R130,000 and  R160,000. Otherwise, the cash pay of our officers, as well as of  all Russian military servicemen, is set by the current  legislation. If you take an "average" operative, that is, an  officer with certain work experience, skills, years of service  record, I can say that his cash pay does not exceed  R280,000-R300,000 a month.    Speaking the language of figures, for instance, in 1993 up  to  29 percent of personnel were discharged at their own request and  in connection with a transfer to civilian organizations and  agencies. But I would not define the issue so narrowly. There is  always a whole set of motives in leaving a job.    I have to be honest: There are instances when officers who  have developed a negative attitude towards the service decide to  leave under certain circumstances--for example, after receiving  lucrative offers from commercial structures.    Does it create problems? Undoubtedly... For any special  service the task of preserving and increasing the cadres'  potential is a centerpiece issue. Its resolution affects to a  large extent the coordination and effectiveness of  counterintelligence organs operations.  <H8>  * * * </H8> <H5>  When the answers to the questions submitted in advance </H5> were ready, I met with Sergey Stepashin and continued the  interview verbally.    [Tretyakov] Sergey Vadimovich, although you said (in  particular, when you were in Kazakhstan and also in written  replies to my questions) that the unlawful actions of a number  of high-ranking bureaucrats--in the capital, as I gather--have  been uncovered recently with the help of FCS; nevertheless,  lately we have not heard of especially sensational resignations  or trials.    [Stepashin] You simply missed some resignations. For  example,  Kuntsevich, some functionaries in the State Committee for the  Administration of State Property.    [Tretyakov] I know of these, of course, but somehow did not  connect them with FCS activities. Will you continue in this  direction?    [Stepashin] We work on it all the time. You see, we set two  tasks for ourselves. It is the kind of prevention, where a case  that is not fully documented is put to work, because we do not  have a sufficient legislative base to get the case to court.  This is a topic that has been beaten to death, but you  understand very well that many cases simply fall apart despite  the fact that there obviously is a crime--abuse of official  position or economic (not in the old meaning but as it is  currently understood). But it is practically impossible to prove  it. Therefore we summarize the facts, and since I have the right  to report directly to the president and the prime minister, I  report it to them. And I can say that there has not been a  single instance where a corresponding reaction did not follow.  And second: Unlike our former vice president, I will never  permit myself to mention a single name until a decision is made.  This is a sacred rule; otherwise you are pushing me back into  the 1930's. But I can tell you that there are a great many  instances of this kind.    The president now has signed several very tough edicts,  which  had been prepared with our participation; they will help in this  work. I do not want to criticize the Duma--show me who does not  engage in Duma-bashing these days--but for reasons you are aware  of, right now it will not adopt such tough but necessary  documents--there is a rather powerful lobby there that simply  does not want them to come through.    [Tretyakov] But then it follows that in the near future,  until the new economic and political structure of the society  settles in, crime, the mafia--call it whatever you like--will  have a considerable handicap, will they not?    [Stepashin] Undoubtedly. Both we and the MVD, working in new  economic and political conditions, right now are behind in legal  reinforcement. This is one thing. Another is that there is a  group of people who by old socialist norms are law-breakers, but  in reality are enterprising people, sometimes very famous, who,  using loopholes in the law, not only make a lot of money for  themselves but help others get richer. Where is that line? How  do we find it?    Americans have the same problem. It is an established  democracy, as we call it, but, nevertheless, it is a fact that  there exist large mafiosi groups in both the economic and  political life of the United States. In 1991, I met with the FBI  leadership and asked them: How do you fight this? Very simple:  They have their own agent network, and moreover, certain  agreed-upon rules of the game, which the criminals cannot  violate with impunity. And they know it. And finally, the most  important part: a perfect tax system. The latter we do not have  so far. As soon as it develops, we will be able to work very  forcefully and effectively.    And, of course, the courts. This is what represents a  headache today. We try to maneuver, talk about expanding rights  of individuals, without understanding that today, in the  environment of the disintegration of the USSR and the growing  criminal element that is encroaching on political power, we have  in some way given up the cut-and-dry understanding of human  rights. I am not calling for a return to the 1930's, but  survival of the society is at stake. Although in this we also  have to find a certain line that justice cannot cross.    [Tretyakov] I think there is a dramatic change taking place  in the public mind now in its attitude toward the agency of  which you are the head, even if we take its old name--the KGB.  Some people, who in the past could not speak of this  organization without hatred, devote expansive panegyrics to it  and generally appeal to it as the last resort that can protect  society and them personally from danger. Unfortunately, this  shows that society is scared--and very much so--by what is  happening.    [Stepashin] You are right, the attitude is changing. And not  only because people are scared (which unfortunately is true). No  state service has undergone as much reforming over the past  three years or has been X-rayed as much as the security service.  I came into it in 1991 through the investigation commission on  KGB activities, and I simply saw these people. And still it has  retained its potential, and a certain integrity is still there.  Wherever I go--and now I travel around the country a lot--the  attitude is the same everywhere: We still trust them. And we  have moved away from what we had been criticized for. The  criticism was not against the KGB (by the way, this was a good  acronym from the standpoint of contents--state security); the  criticism was for one small part--the notorious Fifth  Directorate that persecuted dissidents, and in fact very often  stepped over the limit of the permitted and legal. But this was  just a small part of the KGB--3 percent of its personnel.  Although, of course, this was a real threat to individual  freedom. However, we have to keep in mind three things here.  That society was a closed one and this dictated certain actions  of special services, which were secondary in relation to this  function of preserving its closed nature. Second, and this is of  principal importance for me. And by the way, President Clinton,  addressing CIA personnel three months ago, actively emphasized  this idea: Cooperation with special services is a sacred duty of  every American citizen. Through such cooperation, including  defending U.S. interests abroad, we defend the interests of all  citizens of the United States of America. Is this a bad premise?    And I know that a considerable number of U.S. citizens,  including journalists, without being CIA agents carry out  certain tasks for it, first and foremost of an informational  nature. I consider it quite natural. And we also should use such  channels. And the third, the most important part--the  1920's-1930's: repressions, terrible murders--nobody has any  question that this was abhorrent. But this was mainly the work  of the NKVD [People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs] and  other organs. When we started looking into this, however, those  who worked in the Committee for State Security became the fall  guys, although they were mainly engaged in intelligence and many  other things that constitute normal state functions. Now, after  having worked here for several years, many things have become  obvious to me. The reports, the most interesting memoranda that  were going to Gorbachev, to the Politburo. I saw the latter's  notations, the reaction--or, to be precise, most of the time the  absence of any reaction.    Apparently these things have become obvious to many people  today, and that is why the attitude toward us changed.    [Tretyakov] Since we have already wandered away somewhat  from  the economic crime topic, I wanted to ask you this question. Are  there not too many special services in Russia now? To my  knowledge, the so-called operational-investigative activities in  Russia...    [Stepashin] ...are a province of six entities.    [Tretyakov] Now perhaps six, but in the Soviet Union there  were only four.    [Stepashin] One--only the KGB.    [Tretyakov] Then we have to define more precisely what  "operational-investigative activities" are.    [Stepashin] Yes, there was the MVD, and the Procuracy, but  all technical measures--only we, including for the MVD.    [Tretyakov] And now there are six. And in the future, as far  as I know, according to some plans--15 or 16. I think that when  everybody "listens" to everybody, this creates more problems  than security for the state. And, by the way, a much greater  chance that these numerous special services will carry out tasks  in the interests of internal political struggle than the state  as a whole.    [Stepashin] This is a difficult question. Where did it all  start? The tragedy of the USSR disintegration. And when the  question had to be decided on splitting up special services, the  decision was generally correct--there should not be a monster,  monopolization of the entire structure, including the  operational-technical part, in the business of ensuring state  security. At the time, I believe, the motivation was logical. By  the way, it did not raise any particular questions on the part  of anyone.    Now regarding the current situation. That there are several  services is good--there should be competition. This is a  positive competition. But with respect to  operational-investigative activities I agree: We need to reduce  the number of structures that have a right to do this, because  spreading the ability to conduct operational-technical measures  takes these services from under control and I think that at a  certain stage both the president and the government may lose  this control. There is, however, another side to it, which is  purely technical. We are somewhat behind in technology, but many  commercial structures now have the ability to conduct the same  operations, including tapping--today they are better equipped  than we are, or even than the Main Protection Administration and  the Presidential Security Service. We have to keep this danger  in mind. In this area, technical countermeasures are needed.    We have prepared a memorandum for the prime minister on this  subject, regarding a tough control, and sometimes a ban, on what  is being manufactured and sold in Russia in this respect. We  talk a lot about banning arms, but this is also a weapon.  Sometimes an even more formidable one--a psychological weapon,  if you wish.    As to these many services, in the law on the FCS that is now  being prepared we will try if not to monopolize then at least to  outline more precisely our primacy in conducting  operational-technical measures. Even now we service a great  number of MVD requests.    We are now moving toward agreements between our special  services. We have already signed an agreement with the SVR--the  presidential protection service. Within the next few days we  will be ready to sign the same kind of agreement with the Main  Protection Directorate.    There will be a whole package of orders in this area,  including those issued together with the minister of internal  affairs. Today, after three years of hiatus, we are coming to  legal formalization of our relations. This is the first step.  And this is our mutual desire, approved by the president.    [Tretyakov] I would like to once again come back to the  problem of borders. Actually, Russia currently does not have  borders.    [Stepashin] Russia does have borders.    [Tretyakov] How transparent is the obviously existing  apparent border between Russia and the Baltic countries? As  compared, for instance, to the border between Russia and Poland  in 1985?    [Stepashin] Of course there are problems in this respect,  but  I think that before the middle of next year technically the  borders will be tightly sealed.    [Tretyakov] And what about Caucasus?    [Stepashin] In the Caucasus, the situation is more  difficult.  On the president's behalf, I traveled to the North Caucasus  republics in May. The latest trip was to Dagestan. There are  numerous questions. Take for instance the border between Russia  and Azerbaijan in Dagestan. In our opinion, it should be closed.  The problem actually is not Azerbaijan per se but rather third  countries--it is arms and many other things. We have different  monetary systems. This causes substantial economic losses, first  and foremost for Dagestan. This is obvious. But on the other  hand... There are 200,000 Lezgins living on the territory of  Azerbaijan, and 120,000, on the territory of Dagestan. Lezgins  lived together for thousands of years. And now all of a sudden  they will be told: This is it, a state border will cut through  here. Their reaction is obvious.    Two points are important here. First: Azerbaijan is a CIS  state. Therefore all of this should be firmly taken to the  interstate level, setting up joint protection of the  Azerbaijani-Iranian border, including in the interests of  Russia. Because the "transparency" of the border in the Derbent  area is beneficial for both Russia and Azerbaijan. Second. What  is more important: to declare that this is a state border or to  enforce border regulations? The latter, of course. Therefore, we  need to create conditions for normal contacts between  inhabitants of border areas, but at the same time, having set  barriers through customs, through border guards, through the  FCS's operational capabilities, to keep the interests of third  countries--both intelligence and contraband--from succeeding.    In general, I would be very cautious in speaking of state  borders with the former Soviet Union republics. I am deeply  convinced that sooner or later we will be together. It will not  be the Union in its old form, but to set a firm border means to  draw a separation line both politically and psychologically. I  talked on this subject, for instance, with Nazarbayev--he also  supports this view. Kazakhstan's border with China? Yes, it  needs to be closed. Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan? Yes,  it needs to be closed. And with the participation of Russia.    [Tretyakov] Sergey Vadimovich, I want to ask about a problem  that seems very complex and acute to me. Moscow today has turned  into something that Paris was in the 1920's, when the bulk of  Russian emigration at the time concentrated there. But that was  mainly the Russian diaspora. Today in Moscow, because the former  USSR republics now have become independent states, we have at a  minimum 14 diasporas, quite often also consisting of conflicting  sides: pro-government and opposition Tajiks; Tajiks and Uzbeks;  Dniester region residents and Moldovans; Azerbaijanis and  Armenians; Georgians and Abkhazians, and so on, and so on. Not  to mention the warring groups from our North Caucasus republics.  All of them, by the way, have to "lobby" the Russian leadership,  various government and parliamentary structures in Moscow. This  means money, which can be obtained from drug trafficking, and on  top of that arms. And controlling traditional Moscow criminal  groups of "ethnic coloration." I will not enumerate  everything--let me just say that they can start a real war  against one another in Moscow. This is the situation in the  capital city that is completely new for Russian special  services, especially considering that special services of the  former Union republics, even if they do not work here against  Russia, have to keep an eye on the situation in "their" diaspora.    [Stepashin] A timely question, because this problem exists  and is becoming more acute, but we are only beginning to look  into it. Yes, we know that there are such groups. Yes, we have  some operational approaches through the prism of work against us  on the part of special services of some CIS countries, but that  problem which we have so far overlooked is a fact. We have  looked habitually only at "classic" emigration--from China,  Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and so on. But we, much like the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have taken a long time to become  aware that those people who come today from other CIS countries  are no longer Soviet citizens, that is, they are not Russian in  its current sense, and they may have their own interests.    [Tretyakov] A question about our society "bearing arms"  today. Since, as I assume, most weapons flow into private hands  from the military, has the FCS established some control over the  processes of weapons "leakage?"    [Stepashin] I have a very good reason to believe that the  bulk of arms do not come from the military. We do have these  processes under control over there through military  counterintelligence--this structure is subordinate to us. We do  not always do it well, but nevertheless the system is in place.  Considerable quantities of weapons were lost in the beginning,  when the Soviet Union disintegrated, but unified armed forces  still existed. This is when a huge number of "appropriations"  occurred. A huge number! Quite enough to arm several tens of  thousands of men. A smaller part was used to set up our own  armed forces, and the greater part went into the market. This is  the most important point.    There is another aspect. As recently as a year ago there  were  many instances of uncontrolled production and sales of arms,  including firearms, by many enterprises and organizations. Today  it has been placed under control, albeit as yet incomplete.    And the third source is the flow of arms coming as transit  shipments through third countries. For instance, an Estonian  commercial company purchased 300,000 TT handguns in China, which  went into Russian markets. We catch them mostly in St.  Petersburg--once we seized a consignment of several hundred  handguns at once. But this is only one example.    And fourth: I believe that we were too hasty in adopting the  law on arms. I am categorically against selling arms to the  population, because the population is not going to protect  itself with these weapons--first and foremost they will end up  in the hands of criminal elements.    [Tretyakov] And the last question: on the "classic" presence  of Western special services in Russia.    [Stepashin] Nobody is making a secret of the trend for more  vigorous activities by Western special services in Russia. This  stems from three reasons. First: Western Europe and the United  States are concerned about what is happening in Russia and where  it may lead. Second--the economic difficulties, especially in  the military-industrial complex, and the tremendous interest in  our new technological developments. They know that we have great  technological achievements on the level of the 21st Century. It  is very easy to get your hands on them now. And the third reason  is traditional. As long as the state exists, special service  activities against other countries will continue. I am convinced  that nobody intends to destroy Russia, but there are many who do  not want this huge country, after it finally gets on its feet,  to present increasing political and economic competition to the  West.</p>

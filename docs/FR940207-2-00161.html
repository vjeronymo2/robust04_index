Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change would allow PTC to establish a method for calculating the percentages ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  margin) to be deducted from the market value of CMO securities, as distinguished from GNMA securities, currently eligible for deposit or which may become eligible for deposit at PTC. Currently, the only CMO securities eligible for deposit at PTC are VA REMICs. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A REMIC is a Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit. VA REMICs are securities for which the full and timely payment of principal and interest is guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission approved VA REMICs, guaranteed by the United States government, as eligible for deposit at PTC in Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 30792 (June 10, 1992), 57 FR 27495, and 31914 (February 24, 1993), 58 FR 12295. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequent to its initial filing, PTC submitted additional information concerning the method by which margin for VA REMICs will be calculated.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  letter from Leopold S.

Net Free Equity represents PTC's calculation of the amount of excess equity, available in a participant's account, which PTC may borrow against or liquidate in the event a participant's debit balance is not satisfied at the end of the day. Under Article II, Rule 9 of PTC's Rules, a certain percentage, as determined by PTC (``Applicable Percentage''), of the market value of securities is included in the computation of Net Free Equity. Net Free Equity is calculated as the sum of: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The cash balance; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The Applicable Percentage of the market value of securities in the account; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The value of the optional deposits to the Participants Fund which are allocated to that account; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) 20% of the mandatory deposits to the Participants Fund for the master account; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Reserve on gain. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Applicable Percentage is determined by deducting certain percentages ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  margin) from the market value of securities. By including only a portion of the market value of securities in Net Free Equity, PTC attempts to limit the risk caused by fluctuations in the market value of these securities. For GNMA securities (other than construction loan, project loan, and mobile home), margins are set at 5%, which is a rate that exceeds their largest historic consecutive two-day downward price movement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unlike GNMA securities, CMO securities are structured as a series of tranches or classes. Each tranche within a CMO is a separate security with unique characteristics, such as differing payment schedules and price volatility. In addition, historical price data, to determine volatility, exists for GNMA securities, whereas historical price data to determine CMO securities' volatility does not yet exist. For CMO securities, therefore, PTC has developed a model utilizing the yield on Treasury securities to predict the potential movement of a CMO tranche based on the rise or fall of interest rates. Under PTC's model, the largest two day movement for CMO tranches which exhibit positive effective duration was a 35 basis point upward move in the underlying Treasury securities. For CMO tranches which exhibit negative effective duration, the largest two-day move was a 50 basis point downward move in the underlying Treasury security. For CMO tranches which cannot be modeled, PTC will set the margin at 100% ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Applicable Percentage will be zero). PTC proposes to establish the margin for each CMO tranche based on this method, rather than assigning a specific percentage for CMO securities, because each CMO security has unique characteristics. Without historical information, such as that available for GNMA securities, PTC believes the use of an analytical model is the best method to determine the expected volatility of a CMO tranche. The margin for each CMO tranche will be set by PTC management, on the basis of the stated analysis and formula, as the CMO tranche is deposited in PTC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the proposed rule change provides for the safeguarding of securities and funds within PTC's custody or control or for which it is responsible, PTC believes it is consistent with Section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to PTC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PTC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Carmakers to fuel new US export region - Trade-based investment in the south-east WHEN Mercedes Benz, the German luxury carmaker, recently chose Alabama as the site of its new American assembly plant, it joined an increasing number of manufacturers, large and small, that have identified the American south east as a good place to make and export their products. Mercedes says its intends to export half the four-wheel drive sports utility vehicles it will produce in Alabama. BMW, its main German competitor, also aims to export about half of the new line of cars it will begin assembling in neighbouring South Carolina in 1995. The two big car companies are likely greatly to lift the region's export figures. But exports from the south east have already been picking up in recent years as the region has undergone a transformation from a low-tech industrial backwater that once produced mainly for the domestic market. Over the past decade pockets of high technology have developed and the motor industry, especially from Japan and Europe, has moved in to take advantage of its relatively low production costs. While a number of the recent investors are multinational companies such as Nissan, Robert Bosch, and Michelin, which export routinely, many small and medium-sized local companies are discovering overseas markets, according to economic development officials and experts in the region. Between 1991 and 1992, exports from eight south-eastern states - North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky and Tennessee - grew at more than twice the rate of the nation as a whole. Exports from south-eastern states rose 13.5 per cent, from Dollars 44.9bn to Dollars 51bn, while those for the nation as a whole grew a little more than 6 per cent, from Dollars 421bn to Dollars 448bn. This surge in export activity has caught the eye of regional bankers, who are focusing new attention on trade services, particularly to small and medium-sized companies. Trade experts note that this is a especially welcome development because, next to finding a market, finance is a small exporter's chief problem. After a period of massive expansion by acquisition, First Union, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank, for example, is focusing much of its energy on trade services. With the third-largest branch network in the country, says Mr Andrew Oliksiw, First Union's trade services division manager, 'there's no reasons for our customers to use Citibank for trade and us for everything else'. Trade transactions of small and medium-sized companies may not generate much fee income, but big banks such as First Union can sell these customers an array of other services that make the overall relationship profitable, says Mr Oliksiw. First Union had previously left the field open to its biggest competitor, Nationsbank, the fourth-largest US bank, also based in Charlotte. Nationsbank has an already well established reputation among small companies. 'But', says Mr Erwin Carter, Nationsbank's chief of trade finance, 'the challenge with a bank this size is and will continue to be on the customer service side.' Small exporters frequently complain that they are given short shrift because their transactions are relatively tiny and that dealing with big bank bureaucracies takes too much time. The creation of a new, small British-owned bank that promises better service looks set to provide some added competition. AmTrade International Bank, with branches in Atlanta and Miami, began operating earlier this year under a bank holding company controlled by Sir Michael Sandberg, former chairman of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. It is targeting small and medium-sized exporters in the South East and is almost exclusively devoted to trade finance. Sir Michael is building AmTrade on the foundation of a Dollars 6.5m acquisition of First American Bank of Miami, which had a thriving trade finance operation largely with Latin America. State-level economic development officials, anxious to raise their state's exports, are hoping that more bank competition will mean better trade services for small companies. Tougher competition would be good, says Mr Charles Schroder, chief of export promotion for the Georgia Housing and Finance Authority.  --------------------------------------------------------       EXPORTS FROM THE SOUTH-EASTERN STATES  -------------------------------------------------------- KENTUCKY                     S EAST TOTAL  -------------------------------------------------------- 1991   Dollars 3.22bn        1991     Dollars 44.98bn 1992   Dollars 3.65bn        1992     Dollars 51.07bn Change    13 per cent        Change     13.5 per cent  -------------------------------------------------------- N CAROLINA                   TENNESSEE  -------------------------------------------------------- 1991   Dollars  8.54bn       1991      Dollars 3.74bn 1992   Dollars 10.37bn       1992      Dollars 4.22bn Change     19 per cent       Change       13 per cent  -------------------------------------------------------- S CAROLINA                   MISSISSIPPI  -------------------------------------------------------- 1991   Dollars 3.74bn        1991      Dollars 1.74bn 1992   Dollars 4.22bn        1992      Dollars 1.96bn Change    13 per cent        Change       13 per cent  -------------------------------------------------------- GEORGIA                      ALABAMA  -------------------------------------------------------- 1991   Dollars 6.82bn        1991      Dollars 3.33bn 1992   Dollars 7.65bn        1992      Dollars 3.63bn Change    12 per cent        Change        9 per cent  -------------------------------------------------------- US TOTAL                     FLORIDA  -------------------------------------------------------- 1991   Dollars 421.9bn       1991      Dollars 13.26bn 1992   Dollars 448.2bn       1992      Dollars 14.43bn Change    6.2 per cent       Change        8 per cent  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

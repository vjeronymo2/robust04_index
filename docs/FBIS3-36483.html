			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Today's World" program] </F>   [Text] We will talk about the possibility of resolving  diplomatically the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.    This concerns a plan under which the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] will inspect the DPRK nuclear facilities to  confirm whether any attempt is made to produce atomic weapons in  those facilities.    DPRK and IAEA representatives have held several rounds of  talks on inspections. However, the IAEA says it could not find  a solution to this DPRK issue.    Of course, [words indistinct] in connection with nuclear  inspections aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula, and  [words indistinct].    Washington warns that unless the DPRK resolves the issue  concerning international nuclear inspections by 21 February, it  will present this to the UN Security Council for deliberations.    The United States says international economic sanctions  [kyongje cheje chochi] can be imposed on the DPRK.    Moscow has different views on resolving the nuclear crisis  on  the Korean peninsula.    At a news conference, Mikhail Demurin, a Russian Foreign  Ministry spokesman [as heard], said:    [Begin Demurin, recording in Russian fading into Korean] The  Russian Foreign Ministry thinks diplomatic means to resolve the  nuclear issue have not been completely exhausted. Therefore, it  is necessary to persistently and continuously try to find  solutions to all the problems. [end recording]    The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman also said: Russia is  working in three directions. Russia supports dialogue between  the DPRK and the United States, dialogue between the DPRK and  the IAEA, and dialogue between the North and South of Korea.    He stressed that it is fully possible to solve the problem  of  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula by  working in these directions.    Russian Ambassador to the ROK Georgiy Kunadze has the same  view. He told the YONHAP News Agency that no tactics of pressure  must be used against the DPRK and that the DPRK must not be  driven to a difficult situation.    We concur with these remarks. It is clear how Pyongyang will  react if further pressure is brought on it. This may bring  about an opposite result. Therefore, diplomatic efforts will be  better than the tactics of ultimatum or pressure in resolving  the nuclear issue on the peninsula.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Italian showdown Italy's financial markets are seriously shaken, and no wonder. Mr Silvio Berlusconi's coalition government looks increasingly fragile. The sharp fall in the lira and in Italian bonds and equities over the past week all point to an intensification of political uncertainty in the weeks ahead. It is a shame that politics should have brought the markets to this pretty pass. Debts apart, the economy is in an unusually robust state. Italy is one of the few European countries to have a primary, or pre-financing, budget surplus. Helped by the weak currency, growth is strong. Inflation, though climbing again, is low by historical standards. And yet Italian bonds stand at a near 5 per cent premium to German bunds, with a tremendous real yield of 8.4 per cent. The elephantine budget deficit is the bugbear: it will fall next year if the watered-down budget passes before Christmas, but only to L139 trillion or 8 per cent of gross domestic product. On fundamentals, Italian markets look attractive  - real bond yields are high and corporate earnings growth is set to be robust. But investors yearn for political stability. This would allow for a determined attempt to reduce debts, the interest on which is gobbling up over 10 per cent of gross domestic product  - and growing as interest rates rise. It is a vicious circle from which only a new government, led perhaps by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi or Mr Antonio di Petro, has a chance of escaping. Investors' enthusiasm for such a change would lead to lower rates which would, in turn, reduce the cost of financing the deficit. But any rally before then is likely to be seized on as a selling opportunity.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon will run for office on  21 August against the other eight presidential candidates. Three  of them have expressed their opinions on the nomination of  Zedillo Ponce de Leon.    [Begin recording] [Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, candidate  for  the National Action Party] By reason of the public posts that  Dr. Zedillo and I have held, I have been in direct contact with  him. I consider him to be a respectable man and politician.  Now that the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] has  appointed him to replace Luis Donaldo Colosio, may he rest in  peace, I once again have an opponent.    [Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, candidate for the Cardenist  Front  for National Reconstruction Party] I imagine he must be good  because he has a long history of public service. When I was in  jail back in 1966, Zedillo was one of the students from the  Polytechnic Institute who participated in a march called The  Path for Freedom, that demanded my freedom. At that time, I was  a member of the National Association of Democratic Students.  Ernesto Zedillo has a good record. He is going to be a great  opponent for us. [end recording]    For Jorge Gonzalez Torres, candidate of the Mexican Green  Ecologist Party, the selection of Ernesto Zedillo as new PRI  candidate represents renewed hopes for democracy in our country.  When asked about the PRI nomination, Gonzalez Torres pointed out  that the voters will decide on Ernesto Zedillo's nomination on  21 August. He added that Luis Donaldo Colosio's death should not  be used as sentimental blackmail, and votes should be cast in a  reasonable and not emotional manner.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In Gaza, talks have been continuing between the  Israelis and the Palestinians on the transfer of authority and  facilities. In the Strip, as this was happening, was reporter  Alan Ben-'Ami, who is on the line. What is the situation as of  this moment, just over one day after the accord was signed?    [Ben-'Ami] You could say that today, for the first time,  some real concrete steps towards having the Palestinians take  control on the ground in the Gaza Strip and have the Israelis  pull out, concrete steps began today. Basically, there was a  meeting with the Palestinian police liaison team -- some senior  Palestinian officers headed by General Ghazi Jabali and Major  Ziyad 'Arif. They have been meeting with the top rank of the  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] in Gaza and the Civil Administration  people, like Brigadier General Yomtov Sami', the former  commander of the Gaza Strip, who is now in charge of liaison  between Israel and the Palestinians from the Israeli side; and  Brig. Gen. Doron Almog, the current commander of the Gaza Strip.    They have had more than five hours of discussions. After  that, the Palestinian liaison team of about 17 men split up,  going off to look at police stations and various security  facilities throughout the Gaza Strip, either with Israeli  policemen or with IDF officers.

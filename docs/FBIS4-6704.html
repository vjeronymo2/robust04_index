			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Minoru Nagaoka, head of  the Tokyo Stock Exchange [TSE], said Tuesday [19 April] the  exchange is studying measures to prevent foreign firms from  pulling out of the market. Nagaoka said the study will focus on  ways to reduce listing costs, and the exchange will accept some  documents prepared in English by foreign firms to provide  investment information to customers.    Measures are needed to internationalize the market's  operations as the English language sphere, including Asia, is  expanding, he said. He added, however, that details of the  study have yet to be worked out.    Nagaoka took a cautious attitude toward the listing of Asian  companies on the Tokyo market.    Economic development in Asian countries has made extensive  progress but measures to protect investors have to be studied,  he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The 1994-1995 State Revenue and Expenditure Budget  Bill [RAPBN] is set to be balanced at 69.7 trillion rupiahs.  Although the total is 11.9 percent higher than the present APBN  [State Revenue and Expenditure Budget], the government will  achieve some savings by setting development priorities and by  determining to avoid waste and leaks. To accelerate state  revenues from the nonoil and gas sectors, the government will  depend to a greater extent on the contribution of the tax  sector, which will reach 40.1 trillion rupiahs, or 69 percent of  total domestic revenues.    For that purpose, the government will continue to deregulate  and debureaucratize in order to eliminate obstacles in the  national economic system and to mobilize the efficient movement  of funds. By stabilizing the institutionalization and the  apparatus of all sectors, the goal of economic growth can be  accelerated to 6.2 percent per annum.    President Suharto made these and other statements when he  delivered the Financial Memorandum and RAPBN for 1994-1995, the  first year of the Sixth REPELITA [Five-Year Development Plan],  to a plenary session of the DPR [Parliament] at the DPR Building  in Jakarta yesterday. The entire Sixth Development Cabinet and  ambassadors were present at the session, which was led by  Wahono, chairman of the DPR/MPR [People's Consultative Assembly].    The president said that this 69.7 trillion rupiah RAPBN  consists of 59.7 trillion rupiahs in domestic revenues and 10  trillion rupiahs in development revenues (cashing in foreign  aid). The revenue projections assume a crude oil price of $16  per barrel.    Routine expenditures will be 42.3 trillion rupiahs and  development expenditures will be 27.4 trillion rupiahs. The gap  between domestic revenues and routine expenditures means that  the government will have savings of 17.4 trillion rupiahs. "This  means that we will have an increased independent ability to fund  development," said the president.    The rise in the 1994-1995 RAPBN is actually not very  different from the previous year's rise of 11.1 percent. But,  the head of state said, in this budget year the government will  not increase the wages of civil servants and of members of the  Armed Forces. The government will also not make funds available  for the construction of new buildings for government departments  and nondepartmental institutions, either in the capital or in  the provinces.    The routine expense budget has in fact risen by 14.2 percent  over last year to 42.3 trillion rupiahs, almost half of which is  used to pay for the cost of the civil service, both in the  capital and in the provinces. But the rise is just the result of  last year's average 12-percent rise in civil service and Armed  Forces salaries and of plans to increase the Armed Forces food  subsidy from 1,800 to 3,000 rupiahs per person per day.  <H5>  Provincial Development </H5>   According to the head of state, most of the development  budget, 5.5 trillion rupiahs, will be devoted to provincial  development. Of this, 5.3 trillion rupiahs will be in the form  of INPRES [Presidential Instruction] funds, consisting of six  programs: village INPRES, district-level INPRES,  provincial-level INPRES, underdeveloped village INPRES,  elementary school INPRES, and health INPRES.    Twenty million rupiahs of underdeveloped-village INPRES  funds  (IDT) have been set aside for each village; 389 billion rupiahs  will be spent on this. Village INPRES funds will be increased  from 5.5 million rupiahs to 6 million rupiahs for each village.  District-level INPRES funds will be increased by 135 percent to  2.4 trillion rupiahs, and provincial-level INPRES funds will be  increased by 55 percent to 1.2 trillion rupiahs. On the other  hand, elementary school INPRES funds will be decreased by 33  percent to 497 billion rupiahs, and health INPRES funds will  stay at 393 billion rupiahs.    Beginning with the first year of the Sixth REPELITA, the  president said, a number of INPRES programs will be simplified  by giving the provinces greater responsibility. This step is  intended to develop a provincial autonomy which is more real,  more compatible, more dynamic and more responsible, by placing  greater emphasis on the district level. "This shows the great  trust that we place on the abilities of our provincial  development apparatus," said the head of state.    Other big budget sectors are transportation at 5.2 trillion  rupiahs, mining and energy at 3.5 trillion rupiahs, education at  almost 3 trillion rupiahs, and the irrigation sector at 1.7  trillion rupiahs.    Other sectors with budgets over 1 trillion rupiahs, the  president said, are the defense and security sector at 1.2  trillion rupiahs and health at over one trillion rupiahs. The  agricultural sector, which has been separated from irrigation,  will receive 900 billion rupiahs, followed by the housing and  residential sector at 888 billion rupiahs.    "If other sectors do not receive large amounts of funding,  it  does not mean that they have a lower priority. They have low  budgets because they have different needs from the sectors which  require large investments," said the head of state.    The industrial sector, which the president gave as an  example, received a relatively small development budget of 450  billion rupiahs, even though industry is an important sector in  the Sixth REPELITA. The reason, he continued, is that the  business world, including the BUMN's [state-owned corporations],  carry out industrial development. "The government guides and  fosters it and creates a healthy climate for the growth of  industry".    The president stated that he had instructed his ministers to  set precise priorities, to increase efficiency, to put a stop to  waste and leaks, and to motivate their rank and file to work  more actively and efficiently and to comply with our basic  philosophy, so as to achieve optimal results.    "In particular, I ask you to make sure that what we have  built up to now--the infrastructures, facilities, production,  projects, and buildings--are really treated well and cared for  so that they function in an optimal way. There is no use in  building something if what we build does not function as it  should and there is no use in building something new if it is  neglected over time," said the president firmly.  <H5>  Taxes Raised </H5>   The president also said that we must continue to enhance the  national economy, especially the industrial sector, which we  depend on not only to provide employment, but which will also  gradually take over the role of the agricultural sector. But he  also warned that the agricultural sector will continue to play a  strategic role and will still be an important means of  livelihood for a large part of the work force.    By stimulating the business world the government hopes that  domestic revenues can best be gotten from tax revenues. With tax  revenues of 40.1 trillion rupiahs, or 78.6 percent of total  domestic revenues, it is hoped that the structure of state  revenues will be able to face external fluctuations in a firmer  and more dependable way.    Taxes are the key to the success of future development. That  is why the president asked everyone to be an honorable citizen  and pay his tax obligations. "I especially direct this request  to businessmen and to those who are fortunate enough to have  greater income and assets than other members of society," the  president added.    Besides taxes as the primary contribution to nonoil and gas  revenues, the government also still depends on development  revenues of 10 trillion rupiahs. This figure is 4.8 percent  higher than present development revenues. "This relatively small  increase indicates the decreasing role of foreign aid and  development expenditures."    In another area, the president stated that economic growth,  supported by steady economic stability, has stimulated the shift  of the economic structure towards greater firmness and balance.  In 1991 the role and contribution of industry surpassed the  contribution of the agricultural sector--20.8 for the former and  19.6 percent for the latter. The dependency on petroleum is  decreasing; in 1992 it contributed only 13 percent to national  production. This also strengthened the acquisition of foreign  exchange and state revenues.    The development of the national economy is still very  encouraging in 1993, even though there has been a slow-down in  several sectors. Steps taken over the past few years to cool  down the economic engine resulted in macroeconomic stability in  1993, even though the rate of inflation is still rather high.    The president said that the 1993 current transaction deficit  rose slightly over the previous year. The increase in nonoil and  gas exports is rather impressive, even though it is not big  enough to cover the increase in nonoil and gas imports. Foreign  commercial loans by the private sector and by BUMNs, the head of  state continued, began to slow down in 1992; on the other hand,  foreign exchange reserves continued to rise and were sufficient  to pay for five months of import needs.  <H5>  Deregulation and Debureaucratization </H5>   The president admitted that positive economic development  does not mean that the national economy no longer has any  problems. "We must continue to guard against increases in the  current transaction deficit and in the balance of payments. We  must continue to maintain growth in next year's nonoil and gas  exports so that the current transaction deficit remains below 2  percent of the gross national product.    "I have asked all my ministers to be cautious and to refrain  from easily proposing projects with commercial credit costs from  foreign export credits".    The president went on to say, "We must try as hard as  possible to keep inflation in 1994 lower than in 1993," adding,  "We must continue to implement cautious fiscal and monetary  policies. We must safeguard those steps already taken to  deregulate and debureaucratize," said the president.    We must continue to carry out and complete the consolidation  of the financial and banking sectors, including improvements in  the system for examining banks and financial institutions so as  to avoid any difficulties. We must gradually overcome any  obstacles to the physical infrastructure, such as electricity,  ports, roads and telecommunications, so that they do not  obstruct economic growth.    In the uncertain economic conditions of today's world, the  president said, increasing exports will face serious  constraints. The growth of economic blocs, the existence of  various political issues connected to trade and economic  cooperation, and the rise of new competitor nations can have an  effect on increasing exports.    "With the enactment of the GATT agreement of 1994, obstacles  to world trade have decreased and this has given us the  opportunity to increase exports on the international market. But  the consequences are that the domestic market is also opening up  and is facing competition. There is no other way; we must  increase our ability to compete in the export market and to  compete in the domestic market," said the president.  <H5>  Wahono's Introduction </H5>   Meanwhile, Chairman of the DPR RI Wahono opened the session  by saying that the DPR will always exercise political oversight  over various government policies, supported by the results  obtained from the Financial Auditing Board. This is an effort to  help the president, in line with what he conveyed in his  inauguration speech of March 1993, which hoped for the support,  correction, and oversight of the DPR.    "The Parliament is ready to form a Sixth REPELITA Special  Committee, which will carry out a detailed, sector-by-sector  examination of the economy, with the hope that responsibility  will lie with the Sixth REPELITA, which spells out the 1993 GBHN  [Main Outlines of National Direction]," he said.    Wahono said that the Parliament hopes that various policies,  such as those spelled out in the GBHN and its implementation,  will really be supported by the ability, good will, hard work,  and a high degree of discipline of the government bureaucracy.    To match all of this he invited all members of the  Parliament  to carry out their tasks with greater quality and seriousness in  the areas of legislation, determining the APBN and in their  oversight tasks.    Wahono also emphasized that President Suharto has achieved  success after success in his efforts to play a more active role  in various international forums, both as the head of state of  the Republic of Indonesia and as the head of the Nonaligned  Movement, which has the role of voicing the interests of the  nonaligned nations.    The Parliament hopes that the progress achieved in  international forums can be maintained and increased by trying  to work on the domestic conditions which support it, such as the  implementation of PANCASILA [Five Principles of the Nation]  Democracy, by improving human rights and by handling  environmental problems.</p>

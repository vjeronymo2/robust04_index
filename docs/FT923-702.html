			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Singapore slumbers in mood of despondency - The market is in the slow lane Brokers are a breed not known for shyness. But in Singapore these days market analysts are reluctant to talk, at least publicly. The coyness is due to an ongoing investigation by the island republic's Internal Security Department into how second quarter growth figures were leaked to a local newspaper in advance of official disclosure. Brokers, as well as journalists and civil servants, have been among those questioned. 'It was difficult enough to sell Singapore stocks before this happened' said one broker. 'The market will come back eventually but now it is all pretty grim.' From a year high at the end of January of 1,546, the Straits Times Industrial Index (STI) has lost nearly 12 per cent so far this year and at one stage at the end of August plunged below the 1,300 mark, seen as a danger level by many locals. A slight, short-lived rally earlier this month did little to lift the overall mood of despondency. In trading yesterday the STI put on 14.43 to 1,339.75 in volume of 62.5m shares. Singapore continues to seem lethargic in comparison with the performance of other regional markets. Not so long ago Singapore vied with Hong Kong for regional market supremacy. But over the past year trading volumes in the island republic have stagnated at about Dollars 100m per day while Hong Kong's have soared to more than Dollars 700m per day. With a recent spate of large privatisations in Malaysia, Singapore has also lost its position as number one bourse in south-east Asia to Kuala Lumpur, where total market capitalisation is now almost double the island republic's. Ask why Singapore has been such a laggard and market analysts scurry round for definitive answers. The government remains highly sensitive to any criticism of economic performance. Though the controversial second quarter growth figures, at 4.7 per cent, were lower than anticipated, overall performance is still creditable, given that Singapore's main export markets are simultaneously in the economic doldrums. Interim company profits, particularly of Singapore's four big banks and the shipyards which together tend to dominate the market, were, like the official growth figures, generally lower than expected. There is concern about excess liquidity in the system, and the government's strategy in accumulating massive savings. A widening gap between wage and productivity growth and the rise of the Singapore dollar against its US counterpart are seen as factors which could seriously effect export competitiveness. 'Nothing specific is driving equities down; it's just that there is a general lack of interest in the market here at the moment,' said one broker. 'It's not really a question of which stock to sell, more a general 'sell Singapore' sentiment. When news of the second quarter figures came out, many foreign fund managers used them merely as an excuse to clear out of Singapore and go elsewhere.' It is estimated that foreign investors account for more than one half of the volume traded on the Singapore exchange. At one time, being involved in the Far East meant having a substantial presence in Singapore stocks. Not any more. Investors can now pick and choose from the region's newly emerging markets. These often offer more excitement and volatility than Singapore, which is perceived by some as over-regulated and a trifle dull by comparison. There is no doubt that a large amount of funds have been taken out of Singapore, and have been invested in Hong Kong. Money has also gone north to Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian stocks once accounted for about 40 per cent of the Singapore market's total capitalisation. Kuala Lumpur's break with the Singapore exchange in 1990 was a severe blow to the island republic. Moves by the KL exchange to go for paper-free trading next year are likely to dampen activity further. Analysts say that locals, who at one time would have played the market even during its quiet periods, are staying away: having caught the prevailing nervousness about the economy, they are sitting on their money, or also moving funds elsewhere. The government has been criticised for its tardiness in bringing state companies to the market. The government's answer is there is no need to rush when these companies, in contrast to the case in most other countries, are already well-run and profitable enterprises. Brokers are hoping that the government will stick by its undertaking to float the telecommunications utility, Singapore Telecom, next year and so bring some much needed excitement to the market. For the time being, Singapore seems resigned to the fact that its old rival, Hong Kong, is stealing the stock market show. Analysts feel that when the steam has gone out of the Hong Kong market and once fund managers - nowadays acknowledged to be a less conservative, more risk prone breed - have suffered a few market bruises, then Singapore, offering steady if unspectacular long term growth, will come back into fashion. When that will be is the big question.</p>

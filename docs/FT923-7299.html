			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Hungary in IMF credit talks HUNGARY is holding talks with the International Monetary Fund aimed at unfreezing credits withheld because of Budapest's failure to contain public spending. Negotiations began this week in Budapest as it became evident that the Fund had not disbursed a tranche of SDR79.6m (Pounds 59.5m) due in May as part of a three-year programme to finance Hungary's economic transition. The fate of that and a further instalment due in the coming month hinges on the Hungary's ability to convince the IMF it has turned over a new leaf and will contain next year's budget deficit even if this year's is beyond repair. Budapest is confident the IMF will tolerate a public sector deficit of Ft180bn (Pounds 1.2bn) or between 6 and 6.5 per cent of gross domestic product this year, but only if Hungary gives a commitment to keep the 1993 shortfall to that level in nominal terms. Even though the forecast 1992 deficit is several times the 1.9 per cent IMF target, achieving even that figure will require a package of spending cuts and revenue increases amounting to Ft40bn. The government will have to force its budget proposals through parliament at a high political price.</p>

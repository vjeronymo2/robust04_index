			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank/Midland Bank: Local bank with overseas growth ambitions HONGKONG Bank's proposed merger with Midland casts another shadow over the Hong Kong unit's long term future at a time when the outlook for its other overseas acquisitions has started to improve. Despite the bank's international ambitions, it remains closely linked to Hong Kong. Founded by merchants to finance trade on the South China Sea, the bank still earns the bulk of its income from the colony, where it and its Hang Seng Bank subsidiary control more than 30 per cent of the mortgage market and benefit from guaranteed profitable spreads from the colony's interest rate cartel. Last week HSBC Holdings, the London holding company for the bank's worldwide assets, announced a 83 per cent increase in profits after tax to HKDollars 5.66bn (Pounds 424m) for 1991. Most of the increase was due to lower losses in its US and Australian operations, which added more than Dollars 2.2bn. Although the bank does not disclose earnings from Hong Kong, analysts suspect as much as Dollars 5bn of total group profits of Dollars 6.8bn stemmed from the colony. In the 1980s the bank used its strong Hong Kong earnings to finance expansion into the industrialised world. It bought Marine Midland in the US and started the Hongkong Bank of Australia. Partly because of unfortunate timing, but mainly due to insufficient management, these overseas arms performed disastrously in 1990 and 1991. Last year Marine Midland lost Dollars 189.9m (Pounds 108m) despite two years of cost cutting and reduced loan portfolios. More damaging still, Hongkong Bank was forced to pump in Dollars 200m of extra capital to preserve Marine Midland's capital ratios in 1990. Hongkong Bank's problems with its overseas ventures stemmed from the style and structure of its management. Like many other Hong Kong companies, it lacks depth in management and prefers a lean head office. Overseas subsidiaries were initially given considerable autonomy. The result was that when the overseas businesses ran into trouble with recession and bad loans, the bank lacked the spare senior management necessary. One indirect consequence was the calling off in December 1990 of merger talks with Midland. Analysts believe the worst is over. Mr John Mulcahy, director of research at Peregrine Securities, estimates Marine Midland will return to profit this year and make about Dollars 70m. Before the Midland announcement, he estimated the whole Hongkong Bank group would make about HKDollars 9.4bn pre-tax this year, an increase of 38 per cent. Despite all its foreign troubles, the bank is still believed to hold about HKDollars 20bn in inner reserves. These will probably be revealed in the Midland offer document and could provide a crucial push to Hongkong Bank's share price. Although Hongkong Bank has had plenty of time to size up Midland, it has not yet decided how it will manage it. The most difficult decision will be whether to risk allowing Midland considerable autonomy, as with Marine Midland. But even if Hongkong Bank did want to take closer control, it lacks the management. Mr William Purves, chairman, is to retire within the next two years and Mr John Gray, chief executive, is 57 and likely to retire soon. Finally, there is the question of culture clash. The momentum for the initial link up was largely maintained due to the friendship between two individuals, Mr Purves and Sir Kit McMahon, the former Midland chairman. Otherwise, there is no evidence as yet that Midland will take kindly to Hongkong Bank's essentially colonial view of the world.</p>

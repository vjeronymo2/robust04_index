			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Airedale wins more breathing space after Pounds 56m interim loss AIREDALE, the private holding company for the Magnet kitchen retailing business, has won another year's breathing space from banks which it owes over Pounds 660m, writes Simon London. Announcing an interim loss of Pounds 56.1m for the six months to the end of September, against Pounds 58.3m last time, Mr Louis Sherwood, chairman, said that senior lenders have agreed to continue rolling up interest and repayments of principle. The position will be reviewed again in December. While interest costs of Pounds 47.3m (Pounds 43.3m) were charged, no cash payments are being made. On the trading side, Magnet managed to trim first-half operating losses from Pounds 15m to Pounds 8.8m, although there was no improvement in trading conditions. Sales were down 11 per cent at Pounds 99.9m. While senior lenders are continuing to support Airedale, the company faces a claim from GE Capital, which is pressing for early repayment of Pounds 70m mezzanine debt. The debt was provided in 1989 to finance the management buy-out of Magnet. GE is claiming that it was misled over the conditions under which the loan was made.</p>

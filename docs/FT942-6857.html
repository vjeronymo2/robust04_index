			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow nudged lower by Philip Morris Wall Street US stocks were mixed yesterday but a big loss by Philip Morris nudged the bellwether blue chip index into negative territory, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.84 lower at 3,753.46, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was a scant 0.72 better at 457.06. Advancing issues led declines by 1,170 to 891 on moderate volume of 255m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite added 0.37 to 439.62, while the Nasdaq composite eased 0.43 to 731.64. Activity was listless as investors began to square their positions ahead of the three-day Memorial Day weekend. The market had only a shred of economic news to guide sentiment. The Labor Department said that initial claims for state unemployment benefit had receded by 1,000 last week, against an expected decline of 7,000. The figures, combined with an upward revision of the total number receiving jobless benefit, suggested that the labour market was weakening a bit. But the data was not viewed as compelling evidence of an economic slowdown. The bond market, meanwhile, offered neither an obstacle nor a source of encouragement for stocks. Treasury prices were little changed. A flurry of buying that followed the release of the jobless numbers soon gave way to profit-taking on the heels of the previous session's late rally. Among the Dow components, Philip Morris stood as the only impediment to further improvement by the index, which had followed bonds to a modest gain during the previous session. On Wednesday, trading in Philip Morris was halted for the entire session, an unusual move which coincided with a day-long meeting of the company's board. During the conference, the directors had considered a proposal to split the company's tobacco and food businesses into separate entities. After the markets closed, Philip Morris announced that it had rejected such a move 'for the foreseeable future'. When the stock resumed trading after a brief delay yesterday morning, it was quickly marked down Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 50 5/8 amid disappointment over the board's decision. Breaking the company up has been suggested as a way to limit the financial impact of future tobacco-related lawsuits. The stock's downturn partially offset a big gain by Boeing. The aerospace group's share price jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 46 7/8 on news that it was nearing completion of a Dollars 5bn deal to deliver more than 50 commercial aircraft to China. Upjohn climbed steadily during the afternoon amid speculation that the company would become a takeover target. The stock closed Dollars 3 3/4 higher at Dollars 32 7/8 . Deere shed Dollars 2 1/4 in heavy trading even though AG Edwards issued a 'buy' recommendation on the issue. After Wednesday's burst of activity, technology stocks were relatively quiet. Computer Associates International, however, surged Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 in volume of nearly 4m shares. The software company beat analysts' forecasts by posting fourth-quarter net income of 93 cents a share. Elsewhere, Compaq gave back Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 117 5/8 after a Dollars 3 gain the previous session. On the Nasdaq, Lotus Development dropped a further Dollars 2 to Dollars 61, after reaffirming its initial second-quarter earnings estimates of between 42 and 50 cents a share. Canada Toronto ended mixed in moderate trade, the TSE 300 Composite index rising 39.34, or 0.92per cent, to 4330.71 in volume of 59.3m shares. Twelve of the 14 stock groups increased, with transportation stocks recording the day's biggest rise of 5.55 per cent. Mining and industrial products were up 1.42 per cent and 1.39 per cent respectively. Consumer products added 1.24 per cent. Golds were moderately lower. Toronto-Dominion Bank gained CDollars  5/8 to CDollars 22 1/8 after reporting much higher second-quarter earnings. Mexico Equities closed lower for the first time in seven sessions because of profit taking and Wall Street's slight decline. The IPC index closed off 16.71 points at 2,455.45, a loss of 0.68 per cent. Volume totalled a moderate 1.2bn new pesos on 109.1m shares traded. Brazil Sao Paulo fluctuated widely but ended the day almost flat on profit-taking. The Bovespa index rose 404 points, or 1.8 per cent but only 0.5 per cent in real terms.</p>

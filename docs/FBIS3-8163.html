			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Let us hear what the leader of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation, Justice Minister Kasim Trnka, has  to say about the current talks and their continuation:    [Begin Trnka recording] As our public already knows, a  preliminary agreement was concluded in Washington regarding a  federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina for Bosnia-Herzegovina to  transform its internal constitutional system. The federation  would for the time being encompass predominantly Croat and  Bosnian-populated areas, while Serb controlled areas would have  the opportunity to either join the federation or join the peace  process and find appropriate solutions, through which the  territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina is always emphasized.    The essence lies in the fact that the constitutional system  should be transformed into a new form of a cantonal type, in  which federal units would be cantons and would be set up  exclusively on an ethnic basis. This national element was taken  into consideration. The essence lies in the fact that a number  of cantons should be set up in which important state competences  would be discharged. The central government would have much  wider competences than envisaged by the Vance-Owen and the  Owen-Stoltenberg plans. The central government's competences  include the Armed Forces, foreign affairs, issues related to the  monetary system, the economic market, the free flow of goods and  capital, issues concerning citizenship, managing resources, and  so on. This is a wide range of competences.    The second range of competences would be realized through  the  cooperation between the central authorities and the cantonal  authorities; it would include an infrastructure shared by  several cantons and cooperation in a series of other fields.    On the cantonal level, state bodies would be set up: from  the  assembly to the executive bodies and judiciary. Cantonal  competences would cover everything that has not been enumerated  on the level of central authorities and central-cantonal  cooperation.    Within each canton there would be municipalities; they would  have their local self-administration. A special arrangement has  been agreed upon in this regard: Municipalities where the  majority population is not the majority population of the canton  would have a special status, a much higher degree of autonomy  than other municipalities within the same canton.    The intention of the council here is to work further on the  principles laid down in the Washington agreement, initially  referring to the constitution of the federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. An eventual agreement on the confederation  with the Republic of Croatia should also be prepared, and then  military experts should work on military arrangements and other  measures should be examined with Croatia for the new  constitutional order.

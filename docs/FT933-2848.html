			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Federal Express recovers in first quarter FEDERAL Express, the biggest overnight delivery company in the US, cut operating losses in its international operation by Dollars 24m to Dollars 33.2m in the three months to end August, helping to treble net income compared with same quarter last year. After-tax earnings for the first quarter of its financial year were Dollars 32.9m, up from Dollars 10.1m a year ago before the effect of accounting changes. Mr Frederick Smith, chairman, said the results were encouraging, but warned: 'Because last year's first-quarter results were disappointing, the year-on-year comparison for the rest of this fiscal year may not be as dramatic.' Future earnings growth will depend on further revenue gains in the international priority sector, which were up 17 per cent in the first quarter.</p>

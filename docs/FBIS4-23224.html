			<p>BFN     [Text] Colonel Segala, chairman of the Cease-Fire  Commission [CCF], in Maputo today presented a working plan to  the government and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo]  delegations until the country's pacification process has been  completed. The plan will be debated at a tripartite meeting  scheduled for 7 June.    At the meeting, Renamo asked for the closure of its assembly  areas in Timanganine and Chinhanguanine, and the reopening of  two new assembly areas in Tete and Zambezia Provinces.    The government delegation protested against the accusation  made by the head of the Renamo delegation, that the Mozambican  Government is said to have abducted a eyewitness connected with  the alleged training of troops in Nachingwea, Tanzania. The  government demanded that an investigation be carried out as soon  as possible to clarify the circumstances surrounding the  disappearance of the eyewitness.</p>

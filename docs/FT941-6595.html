			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cantab loss doubles to Pounds 2.9m Cantab Pharmaceuticals, the bio-technology company quoted both in London and on Nasdaq in the US, blamed increased research spending for a doubling of losses. The Cambridge-based group said pre-tax losses rose to Pounds 2.88m (Pounds 1.4m) in the 12 months to December 31. Analysts had been expecting losses of up to Pounds 3.6m as Cantab broadened its product portfolio, and Mr Nicholas Hart, finance director, said the increased deficit was 'well within budget'. Further spending on new drugs to treat ailments as wide-ranging as cervical cancer and genital warts will be financed from cash reserves of Pounds 20.6m (Pounds 6.85m), he added. Those reserves were boosted last year by a Pounds 13.8m flotation in London and a private placing in the US, which together raised Pounds 16.9m after repayment of finance lease obligations. Although Cantab hopes to bring some of its new drugs to market on its own, it admitted that it would have to form collaborations with international pharmaceutical groups to proceed with most projects. Of those drugs, only LM-CD45 - developed in collaboration with Baxter Healthcare, the US corporation - is close to marketable production. Baxter has exclusive manufacturing and marketing rights for the drug, designed to reduce rejection in kidney transplant operations. Mr Hart said licence fees and contract development revenue from Baxter formed the bulk of Cantab's turnover, which fell 40 per cent to Pounds 1.02m (Pounds 1.7m). Mr Hart warned that losses would increase in 1994 as R&amp;D spending rose further and it began construction of a pilot-scale manufacturing facility in Cambridge. Losses per share rose to 42p (26p).</p>

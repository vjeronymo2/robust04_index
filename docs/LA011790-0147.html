			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> TAMMY WYNETTE NOW A HIGHWAY  </P> <P> Country singer Tammy Wynette returned to her adopted hometown in northwestern  Alabama for the dedication of a highway bearing her name.  </P> <P> Mayor Billy Bolton, friends and family members and Wynette watched today as a  stretch of Alabama 24 was officially named the Tammy Wynette Highway.  </P> <P> "This is so wonderful," said the 47-year-old singer. "I just love Red Bay. It's  a neat little town."  </P> <P> Bolton said the request to rename the highway was in recognition of Wynette's  contributions to the town, where several of her relatives live. The 1989  Legislature approved a resolution renaming the road.  </P> <P> Wynette, who lives in Nashville, Tenn., held a concert last year to benefit Red  Bay School. Wynette said the only other thing that bears her name is a park in  her husband's hometown of Malden, Mo.  </P></p>

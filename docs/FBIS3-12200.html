AL-THAWRAH daily for today editorialised that amidst the sea  of the Hebron Mosque martyrs, the whole world stands face to  face before the U.S. law unsheathing its sword at the earth  nations necks and their rights and dignity. And here is the  U.N. Security Council, despite the Palestinians Friday carnage  and others shot dead by Zionist soldiers in punishment for  expressing their grief on the murdering of their brothers, is  still holding unofficial consultations and waiting for formulae  that would renew confidence in Israel's government and its  ability to tackle the situation "in justice and wisdom".    One would wonder, the daily editorial maintains, had this  crime been perpetrated by a party other than the Zionist entity,  were he to hear similar to this U.S. diplomacy characterised by  calmness, or witness speedy international resolutions and  military concentrations, let alone pressures and land, air and  sea political and economic sanctions.</p>

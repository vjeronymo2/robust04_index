			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Secondary school class sizes increase sharply CLASS sizes have increased sharply in secondary schools in England's cities despite government claims to have improved the pupil-teacher ratio, research by Oxford Brookes University has found. The research by the university (formerly Oxford Polytechnic) based on recent Department for Education figures, shows that in 48 metropolitan local education authorities (LEAs) the pupil-to-teacher ratio at secondary level worsened by 0.5 or more pupils per teacher between January 1989 and January 1992. In only seven metropolitan LEAs has the ratio remained steady. In not one has it improved by more than 0.5. In some inner-city areas, the deterioration in the three years completely wiped out the gains of the previous 15 years. In Knowsley, Merseyside, the pupil-teacher ratio in secondary schools rose from 13.7 pupils per teacher in 1989 to 16.4 in 1992, almost back to the 1978 figure of 16.7. Other areas that have seen sharp increases include Newham, London, where the ratio is up from 13.6 to 16.1 in the three years; South Tyneside, up from 14 to 16.1; North Tyneside, up from 13.8 to 15.5; Rochdale, up from 14 to 15.5; and Walsall, West Midlands, up from 13.6 to 15.2. Last week the education department highlighted findings in the annual Social Trends survey of reduced class sizes as evidence of 'significant improvements in education'. But this was based on national figures to 1991, which showed a drop in the ratio from 17.8 to 15 since the 1970s. Mr John Howson, deputy director of Oxford Brookes's school of education, said: 'Restrictions on local authority spending seem to be the main cause of the sharp deterioration. 'The local management of schools policy, under which budgets are devolved from councils to head teachers, cannot put more teachers in the classroom if grants do not keep pace with education inflation.' It had been expected that local management would direct more education resources into classroom teaching, but Mr Howson believes it may be diverting resources into repairs, equipment and non-teaching posts such as bursars. The research shows a slower rate of deterioration in county district class sizes. In the three years to 1992 the secondary-level pupils-to-teacher ratio worsened by more than 0.5 in 14 county LEAs - the biggest rise being 1.2 in Derbyshire, a county with acute financial problems. In None saw an improvement of more than 0.5.</p>

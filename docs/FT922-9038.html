			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Arts: Violence on the high seas - Nicholas Woodsworth needed no fairy dust to find these pirates WHEN Wendy Darling and Peter Pan flew to Never-Never Land they used a complicated process involving fairy dust and the thinking of happy thoughts. When I stumbled out of a West End cinema one afternoon after watching Dustin Hoffman single-handedly take on Peter and the Lost Boys, I, too, felt like visiting the land of the pirates. Fairy dust is a nice professional flourish, but quite unnecessary. I simply strolled down to the Thames below Charing Cross, hopped onto a river bus, and headed east. In fiction, pirate country is a sunny, far-away place of desert islands, squawking parrots and endless noggins of rum. Pirates themselves are jolly, hearty types, a bit wild and roguish at times, but loveable enough in their own peg-legged way. In reality nothing could be further from the truth. Never-Never Land begins at Wapping, and pirates are the most desperate, unlovable characters you could ever stumble across. As the river bus skimmed past ferries and barges, warehouses and offices, it all looked innocuous enough. But as we passed through Wapping, one of the crew pointed out Execution Dock and a long flight of steps leading down into the water. It was here, at low tide mark - territory falling under Admiralty jurisdiction - that for centuries captured pirates were hanged on gallows erected on the river bed. There was nothing jolly or romantic about this. Consider the notorious William Kidd who, mercifully, was roaring drunk the day he was hanged here in 1701. The first time he was strung up the rope snapped and he fell staggering in the mud below. After the job was finally finished Kidd was left to be submerged and re-exposed by the tide for a day or two, then his corpse was tarred, strapped in an iron harness, and for years left to swing in the wind on a gibbet as a warning to other buccaneers. It is a story that would make the Darling children think twice about fooling around with magic dust. Had Wendy and her brother accompanied me a little further down-river to Greenwich, they would have been unlikely to leave their beds ever again for Never-Never Land. For at the National Maritime Museum pirates in their true awfulness are on display in a new exhibition. With Fact and Fiction as its sub-title, Pirates exposes the popular, glamourised view of pirates for what it really is: a fanciful concoction, best consumed in a snug armchair on a rainy day, with little basis in reality. It is not only pirate classics such as Barrie's Peter Pan, Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, or Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons which are the culprits. Stage musicals such as Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance and a slew of Hollywood films featuring the likes of a cutlass-swinging Errol Flynn are also to blame. From Lord Byron, whose 1814 manuscript of The Corsair is displayed, to Steven Spielberg, whose film costume for Hoffman's Hook is on exhibit, we are all guilty of wilful fabrication. So much so that there is no evidence to show that real pirates had ever even heard of 'walking the plank'. This is not to say that pirates as they actually existed - and still exist - are not worthy of interest; the larger part of the exhibit, in fact, is given over to them and shows that they are more intriguing than anything Spielberg could dream up. Piracy has existed throughout history and in many parts of the world; rather than the stock, cardboard cut-out figures we usually imagine, they were a collection of individuals of highly different origins, motives and destinies, with little holding them together as a group other than a willingness to use violence to gain wealth on the high seas. Contrast, for example, Sir Francis Drake and my own favourite pirate, Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard. Drake was the greatest seaman of his age, the Queen's servant, and also a privateer - a man who sailed with a letter of marque, or Crown commission, authorising him to plunder Spanish shipping on its behalf in time of war. So lionised was he by the English public that not even unofficial plundering and daring peacetime raids on Spanish colonial ports prevented his being knighted by Elizabeth I. Blackbeard, on the other hand, was a horrific, Rasputin-like figure who brutalised the men who served him and terrified opponents by appearing in the thick of battle with ribbons tied in his enormous beard, three pairs of pistols strapped to his chest, and smoke-belching slow fuses tucked under his hat. When the end finally came, it took five bullets and more than 20 deep cutlass wounds to bring Blackbeard down. But different as they may seem, Drake, Blackbeard, Kidd, John Hawkins, Henry Morgan, 'Calico Jack' Rackham, the cross-dressing female pirate Mary Read and a score of other infamous pirates are in one sense much of a likeness - they emerged from a 'golden age' of piracy which lasted from the 1670s to the 1830s and was based largely in the Caribbean, first on the island of Hispanola (present day Haiti) and later at the Jamaican pirate town of Port Royal, 'the wickedest town in Christendom'. One of the exhibition's attractions, then, is that among its graphic displays, film extracts, sound simulations, robotics and documents and memorabilia from pirate life, room has been found for inclusion of the greater pirate world - mayhem in the Mediterranean, plunder in the Indian Ocean, rapine off the south east-Asian archipelago, terror off Chinese coast. Such an inclusion is merited, for east Asian piracy took place on a vaster scale than it did in even in the Caribbean; witness the great 19th century pirate fleet of the female pirate Ching Shih, who controlled 800 large junks and a pirate community of some 80,000 men and women. But violently acquisitive as pirates were, few indeed led the luxurious life myth has created for them. Most immediately spent what money they did gain on drink and gambling, leaving little for the gentler pleasures, or even essentials of life. If they took life easily. they gave it easily as well - many died violently or of disease and destitution, without a penny in their pockets. Measure these facts up against the colourful fiction of piracy, however, and it is fiction that wins every time. Just ask the bloodthirsty hordes queueing outside West End cinemas. 'Pirates: Fact and Fiction' runs at the National Maritime Museum until September 6</p>

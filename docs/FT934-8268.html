			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cautious start to new equity account THE NEW equity trading account, to be featured this week by the outcome of the Nafta vote in the US Congress and which will also take the stock market to the very brink of the Budget from the UK chancellor of the exchequer, made a cautious start yesterday. Trading volume was around 23 per cent down from Friday's total and well below the average levels of the past three months. The FT-SE 100 Index trod an erratic path, losing the 3,100 mark in early trading, then retrieving it with a gain that extended to more than 10 points, only to slide away again when Wall Street came in sharply lower in UK trading hours. At the final reading of 3,093.3, the Footsie showed a loss on the day of 5.8. At the opening of the market, attention focused on the Seaq overnight ticker, which reported the equity trades executed on Friday and identified as a move out of equities and into gilt-edged securities by a UK insurance institution. The US securities house which took the equities trade, worth around Pounds 250m, had then covered itself by selling stock index futures on Friday, in what was probably the largest deal recorded in that sector. Yesterday's market was also affected by the latest round of results from leading British companies. Although trading figures from British Airways and then from British Steel were not too far from expectations, both companies disappointed the market with unpromising comments on the outlook. Poor trading volumes showed a final total of only 493.6m shares through the Seaq network, compared with Friday's 639.4m. Business in non-Footsie stocks was also light, making up only about 46 per cent of the day's total. But with marketmakers quicker to mark down quotations in the second liners, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index continued to fall, shedding 4.6 to 3,416.5. The outcome of the Nafta vote in the US congress troubles securities analysts because of its significance for the GATT trade negotiations and the fear of an international trade war. The UK stock market this week also faces a heavy list of important data on the domestic economy. The high point will come tomorrow with the October Retail Price Index; while most UK securities houses hope that annualised inflation will remain at 1.8 per cent, some fear that it may have begun to creep higher. Inflation is seen as the key to the chances for a cut in base rates around the time of the Budget speech at the end of the month. Thursday will bring the latest average earnings statistics, also a potential source of inflationary pressure and the October unemployment figures. The same day also features the regular policy meeting of the Bundesbank and will inevitably prompt speculation of impending cuts in German interest rates. Against this somewhat dangerous backcloth, fund managers and securities houses alike are now unwilling to take on heavy trading positions ahead of the Budget. The market was held back by a mixed performance from the pharmaceutical stocks following further allegations of malpractice by leading companies. Oil stocks, too, lacked supporters in London and the whole of the international sector looked dull at the close of the session.</p>

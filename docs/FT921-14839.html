			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Bass preference offer to stand BASS, the UK brewing group, intends to proceed with an offer to repay holders of its 4 per cent preference shares less than they are formally entitled to under its articles of association, despite objections from one small holder. The offer, of 57.5p a share, will only go ahead if holders agree to vary their rights at a special meeting convened for later this month, said Ms Gisela Gledhill, company secretary. Under Bass's articles, preference shareholders are entitled to repayment at par - Pounds 1  - in a winding-up or reduction in the group's capital. The offer for the shares, which compares with a previous market price of 38p, was made after taking advice from J. Henry Schroder Wagg, the merchant bank, and consultation with institutional holders.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Business Travel: Seat without a view - Why it is increasingly difficult to see through aircraft windows As we cruise at 37,000 feet, passengers on the right-hand side of the aircraft can enjoy a spectacular view of the Greenland ice-cap glinting in the sun . . .' Or rather, they could if it were not for the sunlight glinting back from the network of tiny cracks on the outside of the cabin windows. This 'crazing' of the plastic (acrylic) windows fitted to cabins of all modern aircraft often irritates frequent flyers, whose view is obscured by eye-wearying dazzle. And airlines confirm passengers' impressions that the problem has become much worse over the past two years or so. Scientists say the cause of the current crazing epidemic is a large increase in the concentration of sulphuric acid droplets in the atmosphere. Volcanic er-uptions are ultimately responsible. The main culprit is Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, which has released an estimated 20m tonnes of sulphur dioxide into the upper atmosphere since June 1991. 'Although the acid concentration is now falling, there are still 10 times more suphuric acid particles in the atmosphere than there were before the eruption, and it will take several years to get back to the pre-Pinatubo level,' says Dr Lamont Poole, an atmospheric specialist with the US National Aeronautic and Space Administration. Crazing is not a safety issue because it only affects the windows' outer surface and does not weaken their structure. (Cockpit windows are made of glass laminate, not plastic, and are not affected by acid.) Even so, airlines are responding to their passengers' concern by changing cabin windows more frequently than before. The acrylic is designed to have a normal working life of 20,000 flying hours, equivalent to five years of operation. But British Airways, for example, now checks all windows every 15 to 18 months and finds that many need to be replaced then. The long-term solution is to develop new windows with greater acid resistance. BA has a joint programme with Boeing, the US aircraft manufacturer, to flight test alternative materials. One BA 747-400 jumbo jet is flying with 11 different window types fitted by Boeing; another has four more types made to BA's own specification. 'Our long-term goal is window working life that pushes the current five-year norm to eight years,' says Mr Russ Jones, BA chief fleet engineer. Meanwhile Pilkington Aerospace, California-based subsidiary of the UK glass company, is promoting CrystalVue, a new cabin window which it says is two to three times more resistant to crazing than previous materials. Its acrylic composition absorbs less water from the atmosphere - low water absorption reduces acid attack - and for additional protection it is coated with a thin layer of polysiloxane. Pilkington's launch customer, Japan Airlines, has flown Boeing 747s fitted with CrystalVue for up to 20,000 hours on its polar routes, where there is greater exposure to acid than at lower latitudes. All the passengers still have a craze-free view of the ice cap.</p>

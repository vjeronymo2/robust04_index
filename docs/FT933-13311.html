			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Observer: Fall girl Spy mistress turned cover girl Stella Rimington has had an uncomfortable time since being pushed into the limelight as part of John Major's campaign for openness in government. First, she had to undergo moving house while trying to dodge the press in endless cat-and-mouse games before her face was freed for front- page consumption. Then, she had to suffer the professional embarrassment of seeing the IRA, with its continued string of atrocities, dent the credibility of the service's counter-terrorist operation. Now she has to spend valuable time powdering her nose for all those photo opportunities. But Observer's moles in St James's are unruffled. They believe Rimington is performing her job just perfectly - suitably diverting attention from the real boss who remains as incognito as ever, whatever the prime minister may say.</p>

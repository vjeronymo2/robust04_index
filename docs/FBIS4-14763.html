			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages contained within quotation marks are recorded] </F>   [Text] Gennadiy Zyuganov, the leader of the Russian  Communist Party, held a news conference on 1 April. He is also  the initiator of the Accord for Russia movement. Over to our  correspondent Yevgeniy Zherebenkov.    [Zherebenkov] The Accord for Russia movement is actively  engaged in setting up organizations in the localities and is  preparing to hold a congress, Gennadiy Zyuganov announced,  adding that Aleksandr Rutskoy is taking part in constant  consultations with the movement's leaders. Zyuganov said:    [Zyuganov] "The leaders of the movement have a weekly  meeting. The general philosophical principles upon which such  accord may be reached have been drawn up. Consultations have  been conducted with all government structures, we are trying to  find mutual understanding and are formulating our basic demands  that will bring the country out of civil conflict and war, and  will halt any further territorial, social, and economic  collapse. We have held meetings with all those who determine  the foundations of the genetic development of the nation; with  representatives of fundamental science and academic science,  with representatives of the military industrial complex and  heads of major enterprises, and with leaders of other movements,  parties, and associations. Many of our representatives,  including deputies, have gone out to the localities, where they  are briefing people on the essentials of the movement and  tackling organizational work. I will not rule out that there  will be a congress or assembly in May, which will finally work  out the manifesto and nature of the movement's activities, and  will define its attitude to all administrative structures,  including government structures."    [Zherebenkov] Speaking about the new party in opposition to  the Communists which Yegor Gaydar has set up, with the symbolic  name of Russia's Choice, Gennadiy Zyuganov said the following:    [Zyuganov] "From a purely personal viewpoint, I want to tell  you that the more politicians of Gaydar's type that manage  various parties, the better for us."    [Zherebenkov] As for another opponent, Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy,  Gennadiy Zyuganov's position in regard to him is like this:    [Zyuganov] "He actually exists, he has his own program and  policy. I repeat for all to hear: Today I will work together  with anybody, no matter whom, for whom the integrity of the  country and belief in our state and the welfare of every citizen  is the highest value."    [Zherebenkov] All that is splendid, of course, but Gennadiy  Zyuganov's desire to work together with anybody, no matter whom,  puts one on one's guard.</p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UTILITY SUES IN THEFT OF POWER  </P> <P> San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. filed a $500,000 lawsuit against a Lakeside  couple for allegedly stealing more than $40,000 worth of gas and electricity  from the utility over three years. Beth Eagleson, SDG&amp;E's corporate  attorney, said Friday that the suit against Jerry P. and Cathy A. Goulart seeks  to recover punitive damages and about $42,500 worth of energy stolen from the  utility. "Based upon measurement of actual use compared to their load  information, a back bill for gas and electric service was prepared," Eagleson  said. According to company spokesman Dave Smith, load information refers to the  energy used by household appliances. The law allows utilities to try to recover  the cost of stolen electricity, plus treble damages. In this case, Eagleson  said, that amounts to $127,789.50. In addition, she said, SDG&amp;E is seeking  $300,000 in punitive damages. Eagleson did not say how the Goularts' case was  discovered. According to the San Diego County district attorney's office,  criminal charges are also involved. In addition to fiscal penalties, Eagleson  said, "It's important to remember that energy diversion is also dangerous."  </P></p>

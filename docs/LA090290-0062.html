			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MCGEE COULD STILL WIN NATIONAL LEAGUE BATTING TITLE  </P> <P> The Athletics' acquisition of Willie McGee late Wednesday night did more than  bolster their championship chances. It also created several intriguing  possibilities for him and his new team.  </P> <P> Although he's left the National League, McGee conceivably could emerge as its  batting champion. Because statistics do not officially transfer from one league  to the other, he is "in the clubhouse" with a .335 average, which ranked second  in the National League to Lenny Dykstra's .340 average before Thursday night's  games. No player ever has won a batting title while competing in the other  league. Rick Honeycutt, however, did lead the American League in earned run  average in 1983 after pitching for the Dodgers the final six weeks.  </P> <P> Harry "The Hat" Walker led the National League in batting in 1947 with a .363  average, batting .200 in 10 games with the Cardinals before a May 3 trade, then  batting .371 in 130 games with the Phillies. Dale Alexander, playing with the  Red Sox and Tigers in 1932, led the American League in batting at .367. And Gus  Zernial led the AL in home runs and RBI in 1951 while splitting the season  between the White Sox and Athletics. But McGee has changed leagues, and  therefore, he can accomplish an unprecedented feat. All he needs to do is watch  Dykstra's average fall.  </P> <P> Dykstra, batting .418 through June 3, batted .293 in 294 subsequent at-bats  before Thursday night. More significant, perhaps, is that he had batted .308 in  182 at-bats since the All-Star break. If he were to continue to hit safely at  that rate in the Phillies' remaining 35 games and averaged 3.71 at-bats, as he  had through Wednesday, he would finish with 200 hits in 601 at-bats, a .333  average and runner-up status.  </P> <P> And that doesn't even take Dave Magadan into consideration. The Mets' first  baseman was batting .333 in 345 at-bats before Thursday night. If he won, he  would be the Mets' first batting champion.  </P> <P> Magadan, who entered the batting race as the No. 4 batter in the league Aug. 8  when his total plate appearances finally qualified, considers McGee and Dykstra  quite formidable competition, and not only because of their averages.  </P> <P> "Lenny and McGee play on (artificial) turf, and (Tony) Gwynn might as well  (because) the infield is so hard in San Diego," he said. "And they can get some  leg hits. I'm not going to get many of those.  </P> <P> "I think I can stay close as long as I don't get unlucky," Magadan said. "I've  already passed that period of being mentally tired. So if I stay away from bad  luck, I'm OK. With me, the hits have to be perfect because I'm not going to  beat out a ball in the hole. Some of the worst slumps -- if you want to call  them that -- I've ever had are the times when I've hit the ball hard."  </P> <P> If McGee wins the batting championship, it will be his second. He also won in  1985, the season he batted a career-high .353 and won the National League Most  Valuable Player Award.  </P> <P> No matter what happens in the race, McGee has assured himself of avoiding two  unwanted distinctions.  </P> <P> Until now, McGee and Norm Cash, the late Tigers slugger, were the only players  in major-league history to bat .350 or higher in a season of at least 450  at-bats without hitting higher than .300 in any other "full" season. Now Cash  stands alone.  </P> <P> Secondly, McGee's error total for the National League will remain at 16. He  almost certainly will lead National League outfielders in errors -- Lonnie  Smith of the Braves is second with 11 -- but McGee's total is far from the 20  "Indian Bob" Johnson committed with the Athletics in 1935. Whatever errors  McGee commits with the A's won't be added to the 16.  </P> <P> But think of the possibilities: McGee not only could be the National League  batting champion, playing for the American League champions in the World  Series, but he and Rickey Henderson could emerge as batting champions and  teammates. That would be a more immediate marriage than what developed last  winter when free-agent Mark Davis, the 1989 National League Cy Young Award  winner, signed with the Royals and joined his American League counterpart, Bret  Saberhagen.  </P> <P> Looked good at the time, but look at what has happened to the Royals since.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEWBORN LEFT OUTSIDE HOSPITAL WITH DIAPERS, MONEY AND NOTE  </P> <P> A newborn boy was found outside a community hospital in Mission Viejo this  morning with a bag full of diapers, a $20 bill and a note saying, "Hi, my name  is Brett. Please find me a good home."  </P> <P> Suma Nassef, a medical assistant at the Saddleback Urgent Care Center on Alicia  Parkway, discovered the baby about 7:15 a.m. when she arrived for work.  </P> <P> "The baby was wrapped in a towel and its face was covered," Nassef said. "I  think he heard my keys and started crying," she said. "That's when I noticed  it."  </P> <P> "I'm still in shock. I can't believe it," she said. "I thought this only  happened in the movies."  </P> <P> The baby's umbilical cord was still attached, so "it's probably just a couple  of days old," said Teresa Bibler, center director.  </P> <P> The infant was examined at the center and appeared to be in good health. The  9-pound child, described as white with brown hair and brown eyes, is being  cared for at Orangewood Children's Foundation in Orange.  </P></p>

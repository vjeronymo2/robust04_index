			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXCHANGING VOWELS;  </P> <P> SCRABBLE FANS FIND GAME A MARRIAGE OF CHALLENGE, DISCIPLINE, MENTAL STIMULATION  </P> <P> Under rows of harsh fluorescent lights, they sit at folding tables, hunched  over boards covered with small, square tiles.  </P> <P> The room is silent as 10 pairs of players sweat it out in a battle of wits,  probing their minds for obscure words and letter combinations.  </P> <P> They're playing Scrabble, but this is not exactly the game that many people  remember playing with their grandmothers over pound cake and iced tea on Sunday  afternoons.  </P> <P> These are hard-core Scrabble players, many of whom also play chess, who enjoy  the game for its challenge, discipline and mental stimulation.  </P> <P> And they take their games seriously, memorizing hundreds of obscure words and  mastering strategies and lingo.  </P> <P> The Eagle Rock Scrabble Club was started in July by George Heussenstamm, a  classical composer who teaches music composition and theory at Cal State Los  Angeles and Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 300 U.S. Clubs  </P> <P> The club, one of more than 300 in the United States, meets from 7 to 10 p.m.  the second and fourth Wednesday of the month in the Yosemite Senior Center.  </P> <P> Members pay $1 for admission, which covers Heussenstamm's mailings and the  cookies and coffee provided at the meetings.  </P> <P> When Heussenstamm, a veteran Scrabble aficionado, started the club, there were  only a handful of players.  </P> <P> Now the group averages 17, and he expects it to grow, following a national  trend of increasing interest in the game, he said.  </P> <P> "It's something of an obsession," Heussenstamm said. "It's the kind of thing  that once you start, it's hard to stop."  </P> <P> The club is an eclectic mix of people. At one table, a thin, dark man is  listening through earphones to a portable tape player, moving his head slightly  as his eyes flicker back and forth across his tiles.  </P> <P> His opponent is an unemployed Vietnam veteran who is also an avid chess player.  </P> <P> At another table, a 22-year-old physics major from Occidental College is  battling a heavyset woman who is an administrator with the Los Angeles school  district.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Highly Organized  </P> <P> Scrabble clubs are highly organized and strictly follow a set of Scrabble rules  promulgated by Scrabble Crossword Game Players Inc., a national organization.  </P> <P> Games are timed using chess clocks, and each player is allowed three minutes  per move. And the players are serious about their games and strategies.  </P> <P> Like chess, Scrabble entails strategic planning.  </P> <P> Players learn rack management, a method of keeping a balance of vowels and  consonants. Good players also have to know when to pass their turn, and how to  work toward bingos -- a move in which all seven letters are used in one turn.  But the most important strategy is building vocabulary.  </P> <P> True Scrabble aficionados fervently study their Official Scrabble Players  Dictionary.  </P> <P> They pore over lists of words, memorizing thousands of two- and three-letter  words and their possible prefixes and suffixes to help them in their  strategies.  </P> <P> Some of the word lists are so obscure that they almost look like random pages  from a beginning Latin handbook.  </P> <P> Scrabble players learn such oddities as "os," meaning orifice; "ta," an  expression of gratitude, and "ho," an exclamation of surprise.  </P> <P> "The key is in knowing your words," Heussenstamm said. "You have to build a big  vocabulary if you want to be good at this game. It involves more than just  slapping letters on a board."  </P> <P> Someone bellows "challenge" from the far corner of the room, and Heussenstamm  scurries away to settle the dispute.  </P> <P> Heussenstamm started the club in Eagle Rock because he wanted to be able to  play in a group close to his La Crescenta home.  </P> <P> But as director, he has duties to fulfill.  </P> <P> If an even number of players show up, Heussenstamm doesn't play, and he must  act as referee in the case of disputed words.  </P> <P> "It's been somewhat sacrificial for me," Heussenstamm said. "I don't get to  play much any more."  </P></p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Observer: German dog-fight A nasty case of sour grapes is ripening nicely in Bonn. Volker Ruhe, the ambitious minister of defence, is close to having his plan to scupper the European Fighter Aircraft shot down by his own side. Ruhe thinks EFA is hopelessly expensive for the post-cold war era. However, he's being dragged back into the project by a defence lobby which argues that any alternative would be more expensive, and less German. In October, it suddenly emerged that Ruhe had ordered the two civil servants most closely involved in the project - Hans-Jurgen Weiss, the under-secretary who sits on the EFA steering committee, and Siegfried Hofmann, his deputy, to be shunted elsewhere. It was suggested they had failed to brief Ruhe on how difficult it would be to break contracts. Now it appears that he's ordering their bosses into early retirement, for daring to oppose his wishes. Both Wolfgang Burr and Joachim Heyden, the two deputy secretaries who run the ministry's arms procurement division, are to go next month, according to reliable reports in the Bundestag. Bonn waits with bated breath. For it transpires that Burr is none other than the former head of Chancellor Kohl's personal office, and the chancellor is known as a man who shows and values personal loyalty.</p>

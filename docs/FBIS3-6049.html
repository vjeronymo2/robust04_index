			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the  United States will hold updated consultations on the North  Korean nuclear situation Saturday to discuss the results of the  latest inter-Korean contact on exchanging special envoys.  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and visiting U.S. Assistant  Secretary of State Robert Gallucci will meet for a luncheon  conference with their aides that is expected to last about three  hours.    Gallucci is said to have put off a scheduled press  conference  to later in the afternoon to allow for further consultations  with South Korean officials following the inter-Korean contact.  The inter-Korean contact Saturday is realistically the last  opportunity for the two sides to reach agreement on the envoy  exchange.    Washington earlier promised high-level talks with Pyongyang  on March 21 in Geneva, on condition that the envoys have come  and gone between the two Koreas before that date.    Han and Gallucci have two very different scenarios to  consider, depending on whether the envoy exchange takes place  and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections in  North Korea end successfully. Just in case, officials said they  will draw up contingency plans for a new date for the North  Korea-U.S. high-level meeting and the talks' agenda.    They will also plan for more stringent action if the IAEA  rules that the inspection of North Korean facilities was  unsatisfactory, including resumption of South Korea-U.S. war  games and referral of the problem to the U.N. Security Council.</p>

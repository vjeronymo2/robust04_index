			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Observer: Put on hold Feelers are being put out to find an occupant for one of the City's more accident-prone jobs - the chairmanship of financial services group Guinness Mahon Holdings. Ex-Schroders man Geoffrey Bell has been doing the job since November 1987 and is keen to return to his New York firm. The affable Bell is the latest in a long line of chairmen - ranging from the prickly Sir Alastair Morton and the politically astute Edmund Dell to the interfering Lord Kissin - who have found that the job is trickier than it looks. The group is now Japanese-owned, has been recapitalised yet again, and a reinvigorated management team is trying once more to prove that it has a worthwhile role. One intriguing suggestion is that British Nuclear Fuels' chairman, John Guinness, the former civil servant masterminding electricity privatisation, might be offerred the job. He is, after all, a descendant of the founding family. Another possibility would be Anthony Loehnis, 56, the former Bank of England director responsible for international matters. After a surprisingly short stint as a vice-chairman of merchant bankers SG Warburg, Loehnis has decamped to Jacob Rothschild's empire, where he has been given a directorship at J Rothschild International Assurance. Of the two, Loehnis would seem the more obvious choice. An ex-diplomat and former personal assistant to Gordon Richardson during his Schroder days, Loehnis helped smooth the entry of Japanese firms into the gilt-edged market during his time at the Bank. But chairing a subsidiary of the Bank of Yokohama is not quite the same as being the London figurehead of the Bank of Tokyo.</p>

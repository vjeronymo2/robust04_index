			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Leading Article: A vacuum in Asia IT IS NOT only in Europe that the end of the cold war has allowed simmering disputes to re-emerge. China's reassertion of its claim to the Spratly Islands, a group of remote atolls and rocks surrounded by a seabed that might yield oil, is a reminder of the fragile security balance in the world's fastest-growing region. Asia's patchwork of bilateral relationships may no longer be adequate to handle the potential confrontations. Acceptance of China's claim to the Spratlys would effectively concede to it control of the entire South China Sea, deeply alarming for Vietnam and the neighbouring south-east Asian nations, most of which claim all or part of the Spratlys for themselves. What the latest row exposes is the deep suspicion between Asian countries and their perception of a power vacuum following the closure of US bases in the Philippines. Asia lacks a forum in which positions can be sounded out, disputes aired and confidence built. Asia's security framework remains as it developed during the cold war: a central relationship between the US and Japan, bilateral ties between the US and other countries, and a strong US naval presence. As well as countering Soviet influence, this network helped to keep the regional peace. However, the underlying rationale for it has disappeared. The regional aims of all five leading powers - the US, Russia, China, Japan and India - are now unclear. There are strong fears in Asia of a lessening US commitment because of domestic pressure for defence cuts. South-east Asian countries are responding by spending heavily on arms, and vying to host American forces. Among potentially dangerous problems are the wobbly peace process in Cambodia and Korea. Washington has scaled down its military presence in South Korea, although it views the North's nuclear development as the region's most serious threat. The manner and timing of the unification of the two Koreas carries the potential for political uncertainty and economic instability. However, Seoul resists 'two plus four' talks along German lines because the four would include Japan. Mixed feelings about the role Japan should play are at the heart of uncertainty about regional security. As the pre-eminent economic power with large investments in other parts of Asia, it has a mutually dependent relationship with the rest of the region. It is also a substantial military power. However, the debate over its participation in peace-keeping forces revealed deep reservations in Japan and elsewhere. The next US president will need to reiterate explicitly Washington's commitment to a strong role in preserving Asian security. Asian countries should meanwhile make greater efforts to discuss security problems among themselves. Meetings of the Association of South-east Asian Nations are being used on an ad hoc basis, but it is doubtful whether Asean has the substance or scope to be a proper security forum. There is a good case for an Asian security framework along the lines of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, with all the regional powers including Japan playing key roles. Precisely because Asian nations find it so hard to discuss their potential differences, they should make the attempt to do so.</p>

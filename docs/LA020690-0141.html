			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOLDIERS HEAR BUSH DEFEND ARMS BUDGET  </P> <P> President Bush told Army troops at a desert training exercise today that  "uncertainties and dangers" in the world justify increased military spending  despite congressional criticism that his plans ignore the dismantling of the  Communist empire.  </P> <P> He praised Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's "proposals to expand steps  toward political pluralism in the Soviet Union," and he added, "It is  especially encouraging to see anything which might bring the day of true  democracy a bit closer for the Soviet people."  </P> <P> However, Bush said that even with the upheaval in the Soviet Bloc, "it is  important not to let these encouraging changes -- political or military -- lull  us into complacency. Nor can we let down our guard against a worldwide threat.  </P> <P> "The Soviet Union still maintains formidable forces. Military challenges to  democracy persist in every hemisphere. America must always be prepared to fight  for freedom and security."  </P> <P> As he began a three-day trip combining visits to defense installations with  Republican fund-raising, the President defended his plan to make cuts in select  areas -- such as military bases -- but to spend more on strategic weapons.  </P> <P> Bush made his case as he praised the U.S. Army as "the premier land force in  the world today."  </P> <P> In remarks at the war games, he said, "The realistic battles you wage here  forge tactical expertise, leadership and a fighting spirit. And that's what we  need."  </P> <P> Bush's talk was carried by radio to troops on both sides of the mock battle at  Ft. Irwin's National Training Center in the remote Mojave desert.  </P> <P> The President said his defense strategy is one of active forces that are  "smaller but more agile and flexible," such as the contingent sent to Panama in  the raid against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.  </P> <P> The President was expected to continue trumpeting his 1991 defense budget at a  $1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner in Los Angeles tonight for Sen. Pete Wilson.  </P> <P> In his remarks at the war games, Bush declared, "As we enter the 1990s, the  United States is shaping its military to meet a changing international  environment, one that may be potentially safer but one that will almost surely  have its share of uncertainties and dangers."  </P> <P> He praised the Dec. 20, 1989, invasion of Panama that toppled Noriega as an  example of the kind of role he envisions for the modern military.  </P> <P> "When I decide we must use military forces to protect American lives and  interests, I need to know -- as I did in Panama -- that you are ready and you  are ready now."  </P> <P> "Your work has never been more important," he told the troops, praising them  for making a "lasting contribution to the preservation of peace."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Bush will visit Northern California's Lawrence Livermore  Laboratory, the nerve center of Strategic Defense Initiative research.  </P> <P> He also plans to give a foreign policy speech at the Commonwealth Club in San  Francisco on Wednesday.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A recent YOMIURI SHIMBUN survey of Diet members  finds that Shinseito, Komeito, and the Japan Democratic  Socialist Party [DSP] hope to establish a "two-party system" by  unifying the current coalition parties into a new-new party,  while the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake  [Harbinger Party] want to establish a "moderate multiparty  system." The survey thus indicates that the intracoalition view  on regrouping the political parties is divided. Fifty percent  of the Diet members responding to the survey predict either the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] or the SDPJ -- which hold the key  to regrouping the political parties -- will split, indicating  they feel the second stage of the political realignment is  drawing near.  <H5>  Possible Structure of the Future Political World </H5>   Asked what is the most desirable structure for the future  political world, 17.6 percent of the respondents said they hope  the current coalition parties will be unified into a new-new  party, followed by 9.1 percent who hope to see the current  ruling coalition divided into two groups -- a  "Shinseito-Komeito" group and a "SDPJ-Japan New Party  [JNP]-Sakigake" group.    Most of the responding members belonging to Shinseito,  Komeito, and the DSP said they hope to establish a "two-party"  system -- the ruling parties versus the LDP. Particularly, this  view was supported by nearly 60 percent of Komeito and over 40  percent of DSP respondents. Meanwhile, most of the responding  members who belong to the SDPJ and Sakigake said they hope to  establish a new party composed of the SDPJ, Sakigake, and the  JNP, followed by establishment of a "moderate multiple-party  system." The survey thus shows that views on the regrouping of  the political parties are clearly divided. Such a division of  views is particularly seen among lower house members who belong  to the ruling parties.    The survey shows that responding members belonging to the  JNP  are also divided into advocates of a "two-party system" and  advocates of a "multiple-party system."    As far as the LDP is concerned, most of the responding  members said they hope to see the ruling parties split into  three groups -- the SDPJ, Shinseito-Komeito, and Sakigake-JNP.    As to how the actual structure of the political world should  be, the respondents' answers varied, differing with their  desired structure for the political world. Most of the  responding members belonging to Shinseito predict the LDP and  SDPJ would split and eventually link up with Shinseito and  Komeito respectively. A prevailing prediction within Komeito  responding members is that the ruling parties would break in two  -- the SDPJ and another group.    However, among all respondents the percentage of those who  "refused to answer" the question on the realignment of the  political parties totalled over 50 percent. In particular, the  percentage of SDPJ respondents who refused to answer totalled  69.9 percent, indicating they still do not have clear prospects  of the future political world because the possibility of passing  the political reform-related bills remains uncertain.  <H5>  Possible Split of the LDP and SDPJ </H5>   As regards the possible split of the LDP and SDPJ, which has  played a central role in politics since 1955, the percentage of  those who feel either or both of the parties will split totalled  about 50 percent. As far as upper house members who responded  to the survey are concerned, 40.8 percent said they predict the  split of the LDP or SDPJ. Such a percentage totalled 55.3  percent among lower house members, who will have to campaign  under the single-seat constituency system combined with  proportional representation if the political reform bills are  passed. Thus, the survey results indicate that possible reform  of the electoral system will have an impact on the Diet members'  prospects of the future political situation.    Among all respondents, 20.6 percent said both the LDP and  SDPJ would split, 5.9 percent said only the LDP would split, and  23.6 percent said only the SDPJ would split.    Particularly among responding members belonging to  Shinseito,  the JNP, and Sakigake, the percentage of those predicting that  either or both the LDP and SDPJ would split totalled about 70  percent. Among respondents belonging to Shinseito and the JNP,  the percentage of those predicting "both the LDP and SDPJ would  split" totalled over 40 percent, thus reflecting their hope to  expand their influence over the move to regroup the political  parties.    Among respondents belonging to the SDPJ -- whose serious  intraparty discord over its own position within the coalition  government was revealed at a recent party convention -- one out  of five respondents said a party split is inevitable. This  proves the party is in serious condition. Many respondents  belonging to other parties also predict the split of the SDPJ  rather than the LDP.</p>

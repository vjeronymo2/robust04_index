The agreement was closed by Enrique Correa Rios, minister  secretary general of government, during meetings with Malaysian  officials in that Asian country.    Such meetings complemented the memorandum of understanding  seeking to promote the two countries' cooperation in the area of  information broadcasting and dissemination that was signed  during Datuk Mohamed's visit to Chile in May 1993.

The minister said the commission will project Malaysia in  the  South American continent and promote Chile in Southeast Asia.    The agreement also will help the two nations' purpose of  turning Chile into a Malaysian access door to South America and  Malaysia into a Chilean access door to Southeast Asia.</p>

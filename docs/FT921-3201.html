			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Pensions group in row with banks CLEARING BANKS have clashed with the National Association of Pension Funds because of views the latter put forward on the need to protect pensioners in the wake of the Maxwell affair. The recommendations were contained in testimony to the parliamentary select committee on social security which has been considering reforms of the pension laws for the past three months. The NAPF, a trade organisation of pension fund managers, urged that companies which manage their own pension funds be required to appoint an independent custodian for safekeeping of assets. Lloyds Bank said it was unhappy about the representations made by the NAPF to the committee, and felt that the views of all the members had not been canvassed properly. The Lloyds group pension fund is the biggest single customer of Lloyds Investment Management, and the bank acts as custodian of the pension fund. Lloyds said it would 'carefully consider' its membership of the NAPF when it came up for renewal. Other clearing banks have also expressed concern about the NAPF's views on the issue. In the case of the Maxwell companies, Mr Maxwell was apparently able to gain access to pension fund assets because a company he controlled had physical possession of them. Since the Maxwell case arose, the fund management industry has been anxious to ward off calls for custodians of assets to be independent of those who decide where to invest the funds.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Realism slots on the screen - Commercial casts are changing Anyone judging US society by its television commercials over the past 50 years would probably assume that most Americans are white, young, attractive and vigorously healthy. Lately, however, an increasing number of slots are presenting casts in a more non-traditional light. Middle-aged women are seen touting fashion, youths with Down's Syndrome appear in slots for McDonald's and Dow Chemicals, and an all African-American cast sells Hallmark cards. Not only do the newly diversified casts present a more realistic view of American society, but they also sell products. 'Our slot featuring an employee with Down's Syndrome has been very effective,' says Jane Hulbert, a spokesperson for McDonald's. In part, the new diversity reflects a greater awareness by advertisers of their target audience. 'We just finished an all-black advertisement for the Atlanta market,' says Cheryl Berman, executive vice president in charge of creative services for the advertising agency Leo Burnett. 'Since Atlanta is a predominantly black city, that made a lot of sense.' Advertisers say mainstream Americans are also becoming more receptive to non-traditional casts in commercials. 'Americans have become much more sophisticated about accepting diversity in advertising,' says Gerard Saviola, head of casting services for Grey Advertising in New York. 'They see as positive what may once have turned them off.' Heightened pressure from acting unions has something to do with the changes. The Screen Actors Guild in New York, for instance, actively promotes the casting of women, minorities, the elderly and the disabled in positive roles. 'We've made a lot of progress, although certain things still remain largely taboo, like showing families in inter-racial marriages,' says Elaine Brodey, executive administrator of affirmative action for the Screen Actors Guild in New York. Advertising agencies say using non-traditional casts often makes for more interesting commercials. A slot for Hallmark greetings cards, for instance, features a surprise 100th birthday party for an African-American woman. The story provides a twist, though, when the woman tells the driver that although she already knows about the party, she will pretend to be surprised. Another spot for Dow Chemicals' Spray 'n Wash Stain Stick features a little girl with Down's Syndrome. 'We use Stain Stick,' says the mother in the commercial, 'because the last place we need another challenge is in the laundry room.' The use of non-traditional casts can also reflect positively on the companies trying to sell their products. 'A company which uses a disabled person, for instance, is often seen as more caring, more sensitive than other companies,' says Berman. Still, the use of non-traditional casts poses some problems - advertisers risk criticisms of stereotyping. 'A lot of commercials use senior citizens as protagonists, but too often it's in a negative light, showing them as hard of hearing, or not quite with it,' says Saviola. 'We not only need more diversity, but we have to present the diversity in a sophisticated way.' The use of disabled people in commercials is probably the most controversial. 'There's is always the danger of a backlash, or the danger that you'll be accused of exploitation,' says Berman. 'It's a fine line you have to tread.'</p>

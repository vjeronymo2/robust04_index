			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Banks are left impaled on the town hall railings: David Lascelles and Richard Evans on the government's decision not to act over local-authority swaps THE government faced a tricky decision over the local-authority swaps affair. Its intention, announced yesterday, to do nothing about it angered many more people than it pleased. Swaps enable two borrowers to improve their financial management by exchanging debt service payments. Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, could have introduced retroactive legislation to legalise billions of pounds' worth of swaps contracts entered into by local authorities but ruled by the House of Lords to be illegal. The advantage of doing so would have been to regularise numerous complex financial deals and save the banks involved from heavy losses. Mr Heseltine would have placated a powerful banking lobby and heeded the advice of the Bank of England, which is worried about the damage the affair is doing to the City of London's reputation. The arguments against that were also powerful. Governments do not like retrospective legislation, particularly to validate something the courts have declared illegal. Although new laws would legitimise many deals entered into in good faith by banks and authorities, it would do the same for councils such as Hammersmith and Fulham, which has been described in court as a gambler. It was also far from certain, as the government saw it, that the banks were quite the innocent victims of the affair that they claimed to be. There are doubts as to whether they heeded warnings from legal experts or checked that local authorities had empowered officials to sign swaps contracts. By acting to straighten out the matter, the government might also reinforce the impression that it stood behind local authorities - which it does not. The immediate losers from the decision are the 80 banks that arranged the swaps and must cancel them and bear losses estimated at Pounds 550m. One factor that weighed in Mr Heseltine's decision was the calculation that banks' actual losses will be as little as half of that. They will still be able to obtain via restitution proceedings up to Pounds 125m that they have paid over to the local authorities under the swaps contracts. Of the remaining Pounds 425m loss, more than a third will be set against their corporation tax bill. Most of the 130 local authorities involved may also lose by the decision because they now have the prospect of lengthy litigation with the banks - and the worry that relations in general with the financial community will continue to be soured. One exception is Hammersmith and Fulham, which welcomed the decision as 'a clear and definitive statement from the government that it will now be left to the parties to resolve the matter between themselves.' Mr Ian Ward, a finance expert at the Association of District Councils, said the decision was unhappy for local authorities as well as bankers because most deals would now have to go to court to be resolved. As every deal was slightly different, it was bound to be a lengthy process. Mr Ward said local authorities were also uncertain about whether they had the power to enter into a compromise agreement with the banks, and that had not been resolved in any way by the government. The asociation had been seeking not only validation of the deals that had been done, but permission for swaps to be entered into in a properly controlled treasury operation. Similarly, the attitude of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities was that there should be full validation of past deals. Mr Keith Beaumont of the AMA said it was now very likely that there would be extensive litigation and that might compromise the financial standing of local authorities. Only in the longer term will it become clear whether the affair has done lasting damage to the City, as has been claimed by Sir Jeremy Morse and Sir Martin Jacomb, the chairmen of the City's two biggest lobby groups, representing the clearing banks and the merchant banks. Their main worry was that many foreign banks faced losses and that the affair exposed possible weaknesses in the City's legal underpinnings. The government's view was that whatever damage had been done was very localised, and there is little evidence of business leaving London. Still unresolved is whether the government should legislate to enable local authorities to engage in swaps in future. Mr John Maples, the Economic Secretary at the Treasury, said there were no plans to do so, and it was not clear that that would be desirable. But the Treasury would listen to proposals.</p>

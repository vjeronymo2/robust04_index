			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Let's try to keep things moving - Patten Critics of Hong Kong's governor Mr Chris Patten have often said he would have to trade advances in Hong Kong's political development for Chinese concessions in economic matters. Yet yesterday, just hours after denouncing the vote in Hong Kong's Legislative Council that extended the franchise in the British colony, China initialled a treaty with Britain on the use of military land after sovereignty is returned to Beijing in 1997. 'I am just pleased that 'the-end-of-the-world-is-nigh' brigade will now have to hang up their clapper boards,' said the governor in an interview yesterday. The view in the colony now is that Beijing has separated the economic from the political. With the vote in LegCo early yesterday morning securing the political reforms he sought, Mr Patten is keen to move on and deal with practical issues of transferring sovereignty to China in 1997. Although the development of democracy in Hong Kong has been the most contentious issue dividing Britain and China in the past two years, the governor detects a willingness by Beijing to deal with the nitty gritty. With the military land deal on the way to being resolved, talks about airport finance may also be nearing completion. 'I think it is possible to co-operate across the board and we will be looking in the coming months for ways to build on the momentum,' Mr Patten said. In the early hours of Thursday morning Mr Patten scored a narrow victory in LegCo when lawmakers voted for his plans to extend the franchise in next year's elections. 'The decision has been taken by the people of Hong Kong, not imposed upon them,' he said. 'The process is almost as important as the institutions which (the) vote put in place. Hong Kong stood up for itself. 'But we've got to try to increase China's understanding and remove its mistrust about Hong Kong - a feeling that somehow Hong Kong's aspirations represent a threat. '(The) vote wholly involved the United Front (pro-Beijing) politicians in Hong Kong. Chinese officials played an active part in trying to influence the outcome of the vote. It was good that they were involved in that way.' Beijing's official position yesterday was that fresh elections will be held in Hong Kong after China regains sovereignty in 1997. Next on the agenda is resolving the long-running dispute with Beijing about funding Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar airport project. 'We are extremely close to an agreement,' said Mr Patten. Yesterday Mr Guo Fengmin, China's chief representative to the Joint Liaison Group, said that in drafting the agreement 'some problems emerged which need to be further clarified'. It is understood these relate to allowing the government corporations building the airport and connecting railway to approach bankers. Mr Guo said he hoped a draft agreement could be 'completed in the near future'. Mr Patten said there was much that Britain and China had to get done in the coming three years. This included the localisation and adaptation of Hong Kong's law and air service agreements with other countries. China's co-operation was also needed when it came to the government's social agenda. The government will soon be publishing a consultation paper on its plans for a state-funded old age pension. 'It is essential to carry China with us.' Mr Patten said a meeting with Mr Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong, would be a boost to relations. When Mr Lu visited the colony in early May he snubbed the governor. 'I would like to (meet him) whenever Mr Lu thought it possible, practicable and desirable. I happen to think it is desirable now and I think the Hong Kong people think it is desirable.' Mr Patten is under no illusion that the events of this week will mean plain sailing until 1997. 'This job is not going to get any easier. I don't seek to alarm or to forecast typhoons, but the job is going to be intensely difficult and intensely challenging right down to the wire.'</p>

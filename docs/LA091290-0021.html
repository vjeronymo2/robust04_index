			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOL RHETORIC BUT CAREFUL POLICY;  </P> <P> BUSH WORKS TO KEEP THE CONSENSUS  </P> <P> No matter how hard he tries, President George Bush will never go down in  history as the great communicator.  </P> <P> He just doesn't have it. He lacks that fire and brimstone, that poetic flair,  that determination to sink his rhetorical teeth into the emotions of his  audience and drag them this way and then that.  </P> <P> What a good thing, really.  </P> <P> For what one heard and saw in his address to a joint session of Congress  Tuesday night was that sensible and thoughtful George Bush who might manage  America and its allies out of the gulf crisis and into a world with one less  Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> The speech was addressed to the issue of the federal budget impasse as well as  the gulf crisis. And there will be some rancor over his budget comments.  </P> <P> But the characteristics that in his speech seemed so definitively George Bush  -- the reasonableness, the willingness to listen, the intelligence -- might  very well prove to be defining qualities of his mainly pragmatic foreign policy  that continue to attract friend and former foe alike.  </P> <P> For U.S. objectives in the gulf, Bush listed the obvious: Iraqi withdrawal from  Kuwait, the return of Kuwait's emir government to power, security and stability  in the gulf region and protection of American citizens abroad.  </P> <P> Not many Americans will quarrel with these goals, though some will want more  (the overthrow of Saddam Hussein) and others something different (the  substitution of supervised elections and a new democratic government for the  exiled emir). But in characteristic fashion, Bush splits the difference and  goes for the consensus.  </P> <P> Bush was obviously proud of the recently concluded instant summit in Helsinki  when, referring to the joint communique with President Gorbachev, he said:  "Clearly, no longer can a dictator count on East-West confrontation to stymie  concerted U.N. action against aggression."  </P> <P> The President added: "We stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The  crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity  to move forward toward an era of historic cooperation. Out of these troubled  times . . . a new world order can emerge . . . ."  </P> <P> In the past that sort of presidential rhetoric would have been regarded as  little more than mundane window dressing.  </P> <P> But in this post-Cold War epoch, anything is possible -- the good as well as  the bad. Optimism is no less realistic than pessimism.  </P> <P> The George Bush style -- on the slow side, on the cautious side, on the  consensus side, on the pragmatic side -- is probably what is needed to maintain  the international and domestic consensus on Iraq.  </P> <P> It can also help reinforce a nascent process of collective security that might  just possibly work to achieve the containment and resolution of the next big  crisis.  </P> <P> Give the President some due. The gulf crisis is far from over, and there is  danger at every turn. But the dimension of the consensus against Iraq is  attributable not only to Saddam Hussein's basic ferocity but also to George  Bush's basic intelligence.9/12/90  </P></p>

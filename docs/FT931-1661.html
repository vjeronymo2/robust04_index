			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CRA saves Pounds 90m on iron ore project MR JOHN Ralph, chief executive of CRA, Australia's second-largest mining group, said yesterday the company had 'very closely re-examined' its proposed Marandoo iron ore project in Western Australia and now estimated the capital cost would be ADollars 362m (Pounds 174m), one third less than the first estimate of ADollars 550m. Ironically, CRA had time to complete the reassessment because it took about 16 months for environmental approvals for the mine to be completed - about twice as long as usual. Mr Ralph said the huge savings came partly because of a change in the industrial relations atmosphere in Australia and the 'more mature' working relationships between CRA and its employees. This enabled changes to be made that saved money without compromising the engineering. For example, originally cranes were to be incorporated into every building because it was assumed it might not be possible to have a driver bring a mobile crane quickly to the right place. Once it was established that built-in cranes were not needed, building structures did not have to be so solid. Planned buffer stocks between processes had been eliminated and the stockpile area reduced to take 30,000 instead of 100,000 tonnes. Mr Ralph, at an Association of Mining Analysts meeting in London, said CRA's Century zinc-lead-silver project in Far North Queensland, originally put on a 'fast track' for development by 1995, would now not be operating before 1998 because of unexpectedly high levels of silica.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Books: Cadfael bones up - Crime writing under the pseudonym of Ellis Peters - initiated the chronicles of the 12th century monk Brother Cadfael and of his abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in Shrewsbury. If, in becoming a Benedictine, Cadfael thought he was withdrawing from the world and its turmoil, over the past 15 years Ellis Peters has thoroughly undeceived him, for the abbey conducts its busy life in a veritable whirlwind of disorder and crime. On the larger stage, there is the drawn-out conflict between King Stephen and the Empress Maud; closer to home, there are intramural jealousies, mistaken vocations, mysteries and murders. With Poirot-like insight into human frailties, and a fair dose of luck, Cadfael has proved capable of dispelling every shadow - at least until the next chronicle. The 19th of the series had just appeared, entitled The Holy Thief (Headline Pounds 14.99); and Peters' publishers have chosen to celebrate the occasion  -and the author's approaching 79th birthday - by reissuing, in hard cover, some of the earlier Cadfael stories and by announcing the recent conclusion of a deal for a Cadfael TV series. The holy theft that serves as focus for the new Cadfael chronicle involves a saint's bones, which are the pride of the abbey and the envy of other, less endowed coenobia. Actually, the remains have already been the object of some trickery, as recounted in an earlier Cadfael volume; but this time the holy theft is accompanied by a distinctly profane robbery and a puzzling murder. There are some of the usual Peters ingredients - a lissome, slightly effeminate youth, a lapsed novice, a natural calamity (a flood this time) - and a fair amount of mediaeval erudition, notably about troubadors and ancient instruments. While Cadfael addicts will find nothing to complain about, the more detached reader or one approaching the series for the first time may find this chronicle rather too discursive, even repetitious. The prose has an occasional slip, dropping from the usual, agreeable near-archaic into stark modern, with references to leaving 'the options open' and even a 'roll in the hay.' Anne Perry's murder stories set in late Victorian times and featuring Inspector Pitt and his intrepid wife Charlotte have by now won a loyal audience, which will welcome the latest in the series, Highgate Rise (Souvenir Pounds 14.99). The familiar world of hansoms and withdrawing rooms, with references to the Queen and Jack the Ripper, is carefully pictured. Some of the characters have a sub-Dickensian grotesque quality (and a pompous verbosity that we seem to associate with the final decades of the last century), and there is a great deal of reiterated information, but Perry sets a nice problem and keeps the story moving. When Charlotte Pitt, her pathetic maid Gracie, her sister Emily, and Emily's great-aunt-by-marriage all take a hand in the investigations, the narration assumes a prankish Nancy-Drew tone, and poor Inspector Pitt is reduced virtually to a walk-on role, but never mind, it's all in good fun. After a dozen novels featuring the sage Superintendant Tesuo Otani, of the Kobe Police, the author James Melville has re-cast himself as a gaijin Watson and allows Otani, now officially retired, to tell the story of The Body Wore Brocade (LittleBrown Pounds 13.99) in his own voice, which - after all - is hardly distinguishable from Melville's. Having quarrelled with his wife, the long-suffering Hanae, Otani visits a Noh performance, then is accidentally shot, and is soon deep in a murder investigation. As usual, Melville's (or Otani's) reader is unobtrusively taught a great deal about contemporary Japan, as exotic as Cadfael's Middle Ages or Pitt's Victorian London.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edmond Laci: "Oil Toward the War Zone"] </F>   [Text] Shkoder -- The embargo against Yugoslavia is still  being broken from Albanian territory. Even though the Albanian  authorities have recently greatly intensified their response,  fuel still makes its way toward the most bloody war zone in  Europe. However, in the most recent incidents involving this  illegal traffic, not only smugglers and various oil distribution  firms but employees and even officers of the Shkoder Border  Police have been proved to have been involved. In the meantime,  firms suspected of being directly involved in shipping fuel to  Montenegro are the focus of investigations by the general  Directorate of the Albanian Financial Police. In recent days,  the financial authorities have requested the suspension of the  contract of the Italian-Albanian AIP firm, because, they claim,  "80-90 percent of its fuel heads for Shkoder."    Immediately after the discovery of six tanker trucks  returning empty from the Yugoslav border, Fejzi Tahiri, officer  at the Murgian border post, was detained on suspicion of having  allowed these vehicles to cross illegally into Montenegro. The  drivers of the six oil-smuggling tankers were also sent to  prison. Official sources in Shkoder state that the detained  persons come from the towns of Elbasan, Vlore, and Patos. A few  days ago, when two other tanker trucks were observed to cross,  five soldiers and one officer of the border police post at Pulaj  were detained, all accused of "allowing vehicles involved in oil  smuggling to cross in collaboration with Albanian citizens."  Meanwhile, according to investigations by the general  Directorate of the Financial Police, it is suspected that the  six tankers sequestrated after returning from Yugoslav territory  were loaded in Durres by the Italian-Albanian firm AIP.  Following evidence from other incidents, the General  Directorate of the financial Police has asked for the joint  contract to be suspended, arguing that "a good part of AIP's  activity, in other words about 80-90 percent of its oil, is  directed toward Shkoder, with an ultimate destination beyond the  Albanian state border."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 20 KYODO -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Friday [20 May] North Korea has  already begun removing spent fuel rods from a 5-megawatt  experimental nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, 90 kilometers north of  Pyongyang.    The U.N. Nuclear Monitoring Agency said it has sent a letter  to North Korea warning that the continued removal of the rods  would be a violation of the nuclear safeguards agreement.    On Thursday, U.S. Government and diplomatic sources in  Washington reported the three-member IAEA inspection team had  determined that a small number of the estimated 8,000 fuel rods  had already been removed from the reactor.    The IAEA and the United States fear that plutonium extracted  from the rods may be diverted to a suspected nuclear arms  development program.    The IAEA has said the future removal of the fuel rods  without  the agency's supervision and without marking and separating them  would be in violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    This would force the watchdog agency to refer the problem to  the U.N. Security Council for possible sanctions.    Meanwhile, U.S. State Department sources said the IAEA  team's  checks of the monitoring cameras and seals at the radiochemical  laboratory at the complex in Yongbyon are progressing smoothly  and should be completed soon.    Another IAEA inspection team in March was denied access to  the laboratory by the North Koreans, raising suspicions that  Pyongyang is trying to build a nuclear bomb.</p>

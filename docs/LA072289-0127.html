			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECTED ARRESTED AFTER HOTEL GUESTS ARE ROBBED IN PARKING LOT  </P> <P> Buena Park police arrested a suspect Friday in a string of armed robberies in  which a man approached hotel guests in parking lots, brandished what looked  like a pistol and demanded money.  </P> <P> Michael David Hollif, 19, of Kansas was arrested early Friday after police saw  a man at the Embassy Suites Hotel, 7762 Beach Blvd., hold up a family in the  parking lot, said Tom Shearn, a Buena Park police training manager.  </P> <P> Hollif was charged with one count of armed robbery and is being held at Orange  County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail.  </P> <P> The family, Jeffrey and Pamela Hirsh and their two daughters, all of Garland,  Tex., were returning to the hotel at 1:37 a.m., Shearn said.  </P> <P> The suspect "creeped up behind them and yelled at them," he said. "He demanded  their money."  </P> <P> The Hirshes, who were not carrying wallets or purses, gave him an undetermined  amount of money from their shirt pockets.  </P> <P> Police then chased the suspect, who fled over a wall and into a strawberry  field just west of the hotel. An officer fired one shot but missed the suspect.  </P> <P> Hollif was arrested at 1:51 a.m. when officers, assisted by a Costa Mesa  helicopter and Anaheim police dogs, found him hiding in a shed in the 7700  block of Dahlia Circle. The suspect was carrying a piece of wood that resembled  a .45-caliber pistol.  </P> <P> Victims have reported several other similar armed robberies since July 13,  Shearn said, including one in which about $300 was taken at the Quality Inn,  7555 Beach Blvd. Victims reported two other armed robberies, both at the  Embassy Suites, on Monday and Wednesday, where a total of $1,000 in cash and  traveler's checks were stolen.  </P> <P> The suspect fits victims' descriptions of a man about 6 feet tall, and wearing  a hooded sweat shirt under a plaid shirt, Shearn said.  </P> <P> Police saw a man of that description Thursday morning at the Holiday Inn Buena  Park, 7000 Beach Blvd., but a hotel security guard apparently scared him away,  Shearn said.  </P></p>

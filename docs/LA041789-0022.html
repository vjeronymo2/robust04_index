			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 MEN WOUNDED IN DISPUTE OVER DRIVING  </P> <P> Three young men were shot and wounded while riding in a vehicle on a Northridge  street early Sunday after a shouting match in which the assailants accused them  of driving too slowly, police said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Lt. Don Kitchen said the three gunshot victims range in age  from 18 to 23 and live in the Devonshire area. A fourth victim was hit by  flying glass.  </P> <P> Kitchen said the victims were heading west on Lassen Street east of Balboa  Boulevard about 1:30 a.m. when a blue, late model Japanese-made car came up  from behind them. Five men in the second car began shouting and making hand  gestures at the victims, indicating they were driving too slowly.  </P> <P> A man in the second car leaned out a window and began shooting with a handgun,  he said.  </P> <P> Kitchen said the shooting did not appear to be gang-related. But he declined to  identify the victims for fear of their safety.  </P> <P> One of the victims was hit in the neck and shoulder and a second was hit in the  shoulder. They were taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, where  the more seriously injured man remained in stable condition Sunday. The other  man was treated and released.  </P> <P> The third man, who was hit in the right elbow, was treated at Northridge  Hospital Medical Center and then released.  </P></p>

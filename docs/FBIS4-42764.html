			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Export controls in sensitive areas  are to be intensified. This, according to the Federal Economics  Ministry, is the aim of the revised version of the export list,  which the federal cabinet approved today. The revised version  also brought with it both an easing of export regulations and a  simplification of procedures. The raising of the limits in the  computer and electronics sectors is worth particular emphasis.    This will noticeably reduce the number of export permits  required from the Federal Export Office. This will, in its  turn, take a considerable burden off the export sector. The  situation following the abolition of the common export controls  by the Western world for goods suitable for military purposes  (COCOM) was given consideration when the new version of the  export list was drawn up.</p>

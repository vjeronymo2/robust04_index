			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Guinness trial collapses: Judge urges radical solution to problems of serious fraud cases THE SECOND Guinness trial collapsed yesterday with calls for a radical solution to the problems of long fraud cases and widespread concern in the House of Commons about the cost to the taxpayer. Mr Justice Henry, the judge in all four trials arising out of the 1986 Guinness takeover of Distillers, discharged the jury because of serious concern over the mental and emotional health of Mr Roger Seelig, former merchant banker. He told the jury: 'Once again this case has thrown up the problems of long criminal trials and the appropriateness of our criminal justice system - whose rules were designed to cater for short trials and simple facts - to such long and complex trials. 'It seems to me inevitable that we must find a cheaper and quicker way to deal with serious fraud trials, and the likelihood is we shall need a radical solution rather than merely tinkering with procedures.' On Friday the Serious Fraud Office announced it had dropped charges against Mr Seelig and Mr David Mayhew, a partner in broker Cazenove, who were to have stood trial in the third Guinness case. The jury at Southwark Crown Court heard that the strain on Mr Seelig had reached a point where 'it is no longer possible for him to conduct his defence adequately'. The view of two psychiatrists was that continuation might lead to Mr Seelig 'doing something irrevocable'. In the circumstances it would not be right to continue the trial against Lord Spens, Mr Seelig's co-defendant, the judge said. He said the SFO could have a week in which to consider its position in relation to the case. It is almost inconceivable that Mr Seelig will be required to face another trial. The position of Lord Spens is more doubtful. Mr Justice Henry's call for changes in criminal trial procedures was echoed by Lord Roskill, the former Law Lord who chaired the 1986 inquiry into fraud trials. Lord Roskill said the government had been wrong to ignore his advice that complex and lengthy fraud cases were unsuitable for jury trial. He believed such cases should be tried instead by a special tribunal comprising a judge and two lay members with experience of business and finance. The Blue Arrow case, in which verdicts on the remaining five defendants are imminent, is likely to be subjected to a critical post mortem. News of the collapse of the second Guinness trial brought concern from both sides of the Commons about the costs of the case, and Labour calls for a review of the way serious fraud cases are handled. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City spokeswoman, said the trial represented 'an appalling waste of public money'. It was, she said, no good just blaming the SFO. There had to be 'a review of the law to include civil as well as criminal penalties in frauds of this size'. 'Guinness was a major financial scandal, and for this to be the outcome makes a mockery of dealing with fraud in the City of London,' she said, calling on Mr John Redwood, the corporate affairs minister, to make a statement. Mr Kenneth Warren, the Tory chairman of the all-party committee on trade and industry, described it as 'a ridiculously appalling waste of time and money'. 'I trust that now the lessons learnt from these cases and the experience of the regulatory organisations will provide security against such problems arising,' he said. The climax of prosecutions arising from three big City scandals of the 1980s have resulted in mixed fortunes for the SFO. The 10-year sentence imposed on Mr Peter Clowes in the Barlow Clowes trial is the one unambiguous feather in the SFO's cap. Mr Seelig, a former Morgan Grenfell corporate finance director, and Lord Spens, former corporate finance managing director at the Henry Ansbacher merchant bank, denied fraud and false accounting charges arising from a share support operation mounted by Guinness during its Pounds 2.7bn takeover of Distillers in 1986. Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chief who served 10 months in jail over the Guinness affair, said yesterday that in the light of what had happened in the second and third trials he would discuss with his lawyers 'what steps can be taken to help me establish my innocence'.

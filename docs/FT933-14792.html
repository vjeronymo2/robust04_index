			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Treasury unit to boost private investment drive THE TREASURY has formed a special unit to stimulate progress on the government's initiative to involve private-sector capital in public-sector projects. With scores of such proposed projects stuck at various stages in the approval process, there is mounting scepticism in the private sector and some spending departments about the level of the Treasury's commitment. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is understood to be enthusiastic about the initiative, although the need for him to master his new brief may have slowed its progress and frustrated those in spending ministries. Eight months after last year's Autumn Statement, when sweeping changes to the rules governing the use of private finance for public expenditure were announced, the government has yet to unveil a single significant new project which takes advantage of the changes. This has led to disenchantment among industrialists and financiers. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said: 'There is a danger that the whole government private finance initiative will be discredited unless real holes can be dug in the ground pretty soon.' Ministers in a number of spending departments are similarly despondent, with some questioning the Treasury's preparedness to relax its grip. Some ministers accuse the Treasury of continuing to insist on unrealistic conditions that prospective partners in the private sector could not accept. Some major projects, such as the Pounds 2bn CrossRail scheme for an east-west rail link across London, appear to have been delayed by the decision to seek private capital for part of the cost. Talks about involving private finance in building the Pounds 2.5bn Channel tunnel rail link are also taking longer than expected, dashing hopes that conclusions would be reached by early July. The Treasury insists it is keen for the initiative to be successful. The private finance unit has been created to monitor progress and make sure inventive ideas are circulated around spending departments. The chancellor is expected to make a speech about the initiative before the autumn party conference season. Its proponents hope this will give the idea fresh impetus. No takers, Page 15</p>

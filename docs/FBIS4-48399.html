			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with South African Ambassador in </F> Malawi, Llewellyn Crewe-Brown, by announcer John Bishop; date  not given, from the "Agenda" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Bishop] A short time ago we made telephonic contact  with South Africa's Ambassador to Malawi, Mr. Llewellyn  Crewe-Brown, and I first asked him how the day had been so far.    [Crewe-Brown] It has been a very busy day, but a very  interesting day in the history of Malawi.    [Bishop] More than ambassador today, I believe you are  assisting in some way with the election?    [Crewe-Brown] Today I'm also an international observer. The  Malawi Government asked for international observers to come to  Malawi, and with a number of countries present, some of the  embassy staff people are also acting as international observers,  and I'm one of them.    [Bishop] What has been your observation so far?    [Crewe-Brown] I've been out in the rural areas of Lilongwe  and it's been very clear that the elections are being held under  strict supervision of the local parties, and I could say really  so far, they have been free and fair. I've been very impressed  with the quality of the elections so far.    [Bishop] Violence free? No violence?    [Crewe-Brown] It's been exceptionally violence free, both  before the elections and on election day. We are very grateful  for that. I think the Malawian Government was worried about  this problem, but it certainly hasn't raised its head anywhere  here in Malawi.    [Bishop] Now analysts are saying that it looks as if it's  the  end of the Hastings Banda era. Would you stick your neck out  and comment?    [Crewe-Brown] Well, of course it's very difficult at this  stage to say, but I think anyone has a chance, but I think that  speculation here is that the United Democratic Front, under the  leadership of Mr. Bikili Maluzi, has a very good chance of  winning these elections. I personally think it's going to be  quite a close a race between the Malawi Congress Party and the  United Democratic Front, with the AFORD [Alliance for Democracy]  Party in the third place.    [Bishop] If you had to prepare a report for South African  Foreign Affairs, what are you likely to put in that report?    [Crewe-Brown] I would say that the very good relations that  have existed between South Africa and Malawi will continue in  the future because I think all the political parties in Malawi  realize the importance of South Africa. And I don't think that  any of the parties really wish to break off their relations with  our country. In fact, I think with a new government in South  Africa it will be easier for Malawi to maintain its relations  with South Africa.    [Bishop] Well, Malawians rather like South Africans have a  new constitution. How much difference will that make to the  Malawians in the future?    [Crewe-Brown] A new government to Malawi is going to make it  more acceptable in the international community. Last year they  had many problems with donor communities who didn't want to give  their aid any more because they felt that Malawi is neglecting  the democratic rights of so many people. But I think with this  whole process on the go now -- and the world will see that it  was free and fair -- they will be prepared to give them the  international aid that they require, and I think the relations  of Malawi will improve certainly with its neighboring countries  like Zambia and Tanzania.    [Bishop] Now, presuming that Dr. Banda loses the election,  can you see peace after that, do you think there might be  recriminations against his former regime?    [Crewe-Brown] I think we must remember that during the  referendum last year, when the people voted for multiparty  democracy, President Banda accepted it immediately without any  reserves and I don't think that even if he did happen to lose  this election, I'm sure he and his party will accept it; and I  don't accept to have violent repercussions from that. President  Banda has on numerous occasions stated that the people must  please be calm, and also to accept the results, whatever they  may be.    [Bishop] Finally, and I must ask this. Will there be any  problems with counting the votes in the Malawian election?    [Crewe-Brown] I don't think we'll have the problems that we  had in South Africa. The votes are counted in the presence of  the local monitors and where possible in the presence of  international monitors at each polling station. From there the  votes are then taken through to the district commissioner, and I  don't really think that we should have any serious problems  there, and I expect that the final results should be out by the  latest on Friday. But by tomorrow there should be an indication  already how things stand.    [Bishop] Mr. Crewe-Brown, thank you very much for giving up  your time.    [Crewe-Brown] Great pleasure.</p>

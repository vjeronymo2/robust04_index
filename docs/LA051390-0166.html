			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WE NEED BETTER CARS, NOT BETTER CAR ADS  </P> <P> It seems to me that it would be more pertinent for General Motors to spend $500  million on improving the quality of GM products than on advertising with NBC  ("GM, NBC Sign Big, Long-Term Advertising Pact," May 1). Doing so could  increase employment in the industry and increase their sales automatically.  </P> <P> We really don't need more advertising gimmicks but rather better U.S.-made  automobiles.  </P> <P> J.

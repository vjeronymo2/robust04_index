			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. A. Talako, Institute of Toxicology, Russian </F> Ministry of Health, St. Petersburg; UDC 577.352.4]    [Abstract] The work reported here is based on the  assumption of dynamic domain organization of receptor molecules  in biological membranes. According to that concept, the receptor  molecules are structural elements of the cyclic process of the  formation and decay of receptor domains, and they catalyze  biochemical cell transformations, transport substances across  membrane barriers, and generate cyclic electrical and  biochemical changes. Cyclomononucleotides and inositol  triphosphate operate as biochemical modulators of ion-channel  permeability by blocking Ca- binding centers of gate mechanisms  of receptor-domain ion channels, thereby mobilizing  Ca[.sup]2+[/] ions in the cell from intracellular calcium  depots and from the surrounding medium. Kinetic diagrams of the  operation of the gate mechanisms are provided for instances in  which ions or molecules capable of blocking just one Ca-binding  center are present along with the Ca[.sup]2+[/] ions.

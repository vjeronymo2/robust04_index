The proposed amendment would increase the licensed core thermal power from 3293 MWt to 3441 MWt, which represents an approximate increase of 4.5% over the current licensed power level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed action involves NRC issuance of a license amendment to uprate the authorized power level by changing the operating license, including Appendix A of the license (Technical Specifications). No change is needed to Appendix B of the license (Environmental Protection Plan_Nonradiological). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Need for the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action is needed to permit an increase in the licensed core thermal power from 3293 MWt to 3441 MWt and provide the licensee with the flexibility to increase the potential electrical output of Susquehanna, Unit 2, providing additional electrical power to service domestic and commercial areas of the Pennsylvania Power and Light (PP&amp;L) Company and Allegheny Electric Cooperative, Inc. grid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ``Final Environmental Statement (FES) related to operation of Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2'' was issued June 1981 (NUREG&hyph;0564). By letter of June 15, 1992, the licensee submitted ``Licensing Topical Report NE&hyph;092&hyph;001 for Power Uprate With Increased Core Flow'' for Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (SSES), Units 1 and 2. The report was submitted to support future proposed amendments to Units 1 and 2 licenses to permit up to a 4.5-percent increase in reactor thermal power and an 8-percent increase in core flow for each unit. The NRC approved the topical report by letter of November 30, 1993. The licensee submitted the proposed amendment to implement power uprate for Unit 2 by the letter of November 24, 1993, which is the subject of this environmental assessment. The licensee expects to submit a similar application for Unit 1 within the next year. Section 11.4 of the above Topical Report provided an environmental assessment of the proposed power uprate, including projected nonradiological environmental effects and radiological effects from postulated accidents. Sections 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 of the Topical Report discussed the potential effect of power uprate on the liquid, gaseous and solid radwaste systems. Sections 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6 discussed the potential effect of power uprate on radiation sources within the plant and radiation levels from normal and post-accident operation. Section 9.2 of the Topical Report presented the results of the calculated whole body and thyroid doses at uprated power vs. current authorized power conditions at the exclusion area boundary and the low population zone (LPZ) that might result from the postulated design basis radiological accidents [i.e., loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), main steam line break accident (MSLBA) outside containment, fuel handling accident (FHA) and control rod drop accident (CRDA)]. Other accidents (non-LOCA) that were previously analyzed in the licensee's Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) were also reassessed. All off-site radiological doses remain well below established regulatory limits for power uprate operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

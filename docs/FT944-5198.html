			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Electricity grid-lock After five years, talks on liberalising European electricity have made little progress. The European Commission is battling to win a compromise from governments which are determined to protect their energy industries. But it now risks surrendering its original goals. One of the main aims is to bring European electricity prices in line with costs. The present wide variations in prices between member countries are not well explained by differences in costs, and distort competition within energy-intensive industries. Liberalisation would combat those distortions. An integrated European grid would also use capacity more efficiently in servicing peak demand. Industrialists are right to argue that such changes would bring cheaper electricity to many countries. But the industry poses tough problems for competition policy, partly because of its economics, with high fixed costs and low short-run marginal costs - in the case of nuclear power, these being close to zero. Moreover, governments understandably worry about security of national supply. Talks have stalled over the Commission's proposal to allow power companies access to national transmission systems, so-called 'third-party access'. One concern has been 'cream-skimming'. Many national utilities cross-subsidise unprofitable customers, whom they are obliged to supply under public service obligations, with revenues from lucrative customers. Under third-party access, such public service costs would need to be identified and shared among network users. Another concern is that countries with excess capacity would 'dump' cheap electricity. Belgium and Luxembourg, in particular, worry that Electricite de France could undermine their energy industries by selling nuclear power at close to short-run marginal cost. They would be wrong to turn down cheap electricity simply to protect national industries. But they have a legitimate worry about predatory pricing: if their industries disappeared, prices of imports might rise to reflect the full costs of nuclear power. Such concerns are best answered by the provision of information about costs, and by a degree of regulation. Scepticism that countries would give a regulator the necessary information may be justified. Yet without regulation, access is unlikely to deliver the hoped for benefits, because this will not be a freely competitive market. One reason is the presence of so many public enterprises. A more specific one is the large nuclear component which markets, unassisted by governments, are loath to support. The current stalemate may not end, since access will produce both winners and losers in the short term, even if liberalisation is in every country's long-term interest. But the Commission should resist the recent French proposal for a 'single buyer' of electricity in each country. The scheme is unlikely to give even large customers a choice of supplier, or to offer national generators real competition. If talks do not progress, the Commission could take more governments to court for breaching the Treaty of Rome's provisions on free movement of goods. But this tool is, claims the Commission, limited in its effectiveness: it tackles only questions of imports and exports, not of distribution and transport. If that route were to fail, the Commission could press for an energy chapter in the 1996 inter-governmental review of the Maastricht treaty. No route is easy, but the Commission must at least hold to the principle of third-party access, which is essential to introducing competition.</p>

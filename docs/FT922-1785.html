			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: German strikes hit Caldwell Invs Caldwell Investments, the USM-quoted textile company, suffered a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 152,600 to Pounds 31,600 in the six months to April 30. Mr Stanley Wootliff, the chairman, said that strikes in Germany, where the company has a subsidiary, had an adverse effect on second quarter turnover and profits after what had been an encouraging start. However, the forward order position was good. Turnover declined to Pounds 1.96m (Pounds 2.47m) while expenses rose to Pounds 311,800 (Pounds 266,600) and interest charges to Pounds 31,900 (Pounds 10,100). Earnings per share fell from 1.4p to 0.3p. Mr Wootliff said that steady progress had been made in both establishing a Romanian manufacturing facility and developing trade there. Efforts to establish UK-based trading activities were continuing.</p>

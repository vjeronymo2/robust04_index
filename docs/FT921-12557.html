			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Arts: Relish a bit of role-reversal - Only a working artist can review an exhibition by three art critics. We asked Deanna Petherbridge what she thought of Giles Auty, William Feaver and William Packer IT SHOULD have been carnival-time in Kensington this week as the critics became artists and the artists critics. One could have expected all the festive abandon of sanctioned role-reversal, with the kings gleefully deposed and the motleys enthroned for a day. Alas, there is little celebration in Critics' Landscape at Cadogan Contemporary Art, where Giles Auty of The Spectator, William Feaver of the Observer and the Financial Times's own William Packer are currently in the vestments of artists. Rather, there is a slightly dreary and backward-looking exhibition, with a discernible and embarrassing visual autism on the part of Farmer Giles of the Spectator. Wiser fellow-critics of Feaver &amp; Co have formed a concerted chorus in their respective presses in support of this exhibition of madness: a 'brave' act, is the general opinion, which in no way reflects on the credibility of the three as critics. However, in spite of knowing that the kings are due to put the boot into the Lords of Misrule at cock-crow, it is not entirely possible to go along with this feeble consensus. As everyone in the art world knows, what ye exhibit is what ye shall be judged by. The relationship of artists to art critics is rather like that of intelligent lay people to the medical profession. In times of acute need (like an exhibition) the vulnerable artist suspends disbelief and seeks an 'expert' opinion from the critical practitioner. In healthier times, he or she happily ignores the pontifications of a profession adept at mystification and self-aggrandisement. But, oh dear, what does the artist/patient do when the doctor is dressing his own wounds in the consulting rooms, and showing such lamentable lack of skill in applying balm and bandages? Critics' reputations depend on their writings, and over the long years of their tenure in the press we all get to know the colour and composition of their critical 'humours'. What is revealing about this exhibition is the extent to which the critic's disposition finds its match in his practice: apoplectic, jaundiced and phlegmatic. Giles Auty is known for his deep, sometimes apoplectic conservatism, the heritage cant that implies loss of some golden and perfect past. His paintings, of a naive and meticulous realism, are of the sort found regularly in amateur art-club exhibitions; paintings untouched by the revolutions and inventions of the 20th century. Bill Feaver is believed by most artists to have a profoundly depressed and jaundiced view of art; it is not easy to predict his very infrequent flashes of approval, or to quite unravel the meaning of his purply passages. His small paintings reflect a profoundly depressed and jaundiced view of landscape. Customarily phlegmatic, Bill Packer regrets in a brief statement that he has been able to spend so little time being a practitioner because of his need to earn a living. This rather moving conflict is reflected in his drawings in a dialogue between gestural, smudged passages of charcoal and the down-to-earth observation of pencil outline. The drawings have a certain skill and dignity and are selling very well. Critics' Landscape continues until February 1; it is bound to attract more sycophantic coverage than any exhibition this year.</p>

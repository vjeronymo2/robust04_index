			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / The Lex Column: The case for sterling Amid the welter of snap judgments facing the UK markets tomorrow, it helps to keep sight of a few fundamentals. First, the key determinant is the behaviour of sterling. Second, devaluation - whatever the election outcome - is highly unlikely. Third, a fall in sterling big enough to force a rise in interest rates, while plainly a danger, is not very likely either. The argument runs as follows. The chief priority of a minority government, whether Labour or Tory, would be preparing for the next election. In a sterling crisis, it would have to calculate whether its chances would be more damaged by devaluation or higher interest rates. It would surely conclude that whereas a base rate rise might with luck be reversible before an election, the blowing of sterling's credibility within the ERM would be all too permanent. If, on the other hand, tomorrow's result was so close as to produce no government to speak of, the Bank of England would simply play by ERM rules. At the other extreme, a majority Labour government might be tempted to renege on its ERM commitment. But, as Labour must be aware, it cannot have it both ways. If it wants to spend, it must borrow. There is simply no evidence that Mr John Smith would be rash enough to raise the cost of attracting foreign money by destroying confidence in the currency. As for a rise in interest rates, it is striking that on the eve of the election three-month money is only 0.25 per cent above base rate. It must also be recalled that an attack on sterling would first be met by the combined firepower of the Bundesbank and the Bank of England. Even if that did not stop the speculators, they would only press on if they thought the government would crack and settle for devaluation after all. And if the market really believed that, sterling would scarcely have closed yesterday 6 pfennigs above its D-Mark floor.</p>

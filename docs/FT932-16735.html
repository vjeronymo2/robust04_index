			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Books: Muddled academics BEYOND THE CULTURE WARS by Gerald Graff W W Norton Pounds 13.95, 244 pages IN 1985 at Harvard I spent Wednesday mornings at the graduate symposium denying the existence of authors and texts and Wednesday afternoons teaching an undergraduate seminar on Melville and the books he wrote. Then, such schizophrenia could be assuaged by lunch at the Faculty Club. Now, since the late 1980s, a chasm between theory and practice has opened and become home to legions of academic settlers. One of them, Gerald Graff, has written a sane, readable and immensely stimulating book. Beyond The Culture Wars maps the difficulties which universities now have in deciding what is to be taught. Old-established values are challenged, but new ones threaten to fragment the syllabus into an unwieldy number of subjects. These disagreements about what should be taught in Humanities faculties oscillate between extremes. Traditionalists want a collective body of knowledge to constitute the subject, while radicals want minutely representative coverage of social and literary diversity, past and present. Graff's book is an elegant example of the academy outflanking dissent by making dissent a real subject. Graff calls it 'Teaching the conflicts.' Beyond The Culture Wars continues a growing tradition of academy watchers. First was Secretary of State William J. Bennett's 1984 paper 'To Reclaim a Legacy'; then Allan Bloom's 1987 hit The Closing of the American Mind; the New York Times and the Washington Post have carried the flame sputtering into the 1990s. Graff thinks it is time to mediate by meditating. He makes three observations, born of his experience at Northwestern and Chicago. First, the curricular malaise results from the communicative disorders within the academy and between academics and the rest of the world. Humanists find it risibly easy to see their worst imaginings realised, and hard enough to understand each other. The Proceedings of the Modern Language Association (October 1992) offers this: 'Women write from the breast, with their own fluids for ink . . . the female character puts the burgeoning male author into an impossible position: he cannot master what she represents unless he switches gender . . . female metamorphosis challenges androcentric Bildung.' Que? Second, Graff tackles the view that the academy is the victim of multiculturalism. This, George Will claimed (Newsweek, April 22, 1991) is assaulting 'the common culture that is the nation's social cement.' Why teach Hawthorne and not Garcia Marquez when 15 per cent of Americans are Hispanic? Because to cater to minorities meant Black, Korean, Chinese, Italian and Irish literature on the syllabus; the centre could not hold. In 1984 William Bennett called for 'a clear vision of what is worth knowing and what is important in our heritage that all educated persons should know.' Graff highlights the professional dilemma: 'The university is expected to preserve, transmit and honor our traditions, yet at the same time it is supposed to produce new knowledge, which means questioning received ideas and perpetually revising traditional ways of thinking.' Third, for Graff, nowhere is reading 'innocent'; and since college is not kindergarten, students should not be sheltered from debates about the curriculum, but should study them as part of the curriculum. Graff is right to see debate as a sign of health and longevity. There have been crises in the humanities before. JH Plumb edited an excellent 1964 essay collection on the same theme, five years after his colleague CP Snow's Two Cultures; the tradition goes back to AN Whitehead's The Aims of Education (1929) and the 1880s science-literature debate between Matthew Arnold and TH Huxley. In the 19th century, the decline of classics and in the 18th the rise of science have all altered the shape of the academy. The academic curriculum derives from political bargaining rather than commonly shared educational philosophy. Now, under the contraction of Higher Education funding, there is less, and therefore more, to fight over. Graff's views work in practice, since discussion benefits from a juxtaposition or interchange of agenda, and as a teacher it is greater fun to convene than hector. I evolved a solution to my Harvard dilemma while teaching at Columbia University in 1989. For a class on Keats' Odes and the usefulness of the arts I asked students to see Spike Lee's prescient film, Do The Right Thing, showing that Truth and Beauty are not the only game in town. It was a thinner solution than lunch at the Faculty Club.</p>

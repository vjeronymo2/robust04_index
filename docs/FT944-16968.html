			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Arts: Mahler and Mutter - Concerts As Michael Tilson Thomas's Mahler cycle at the Barbican approaches its midpoint, we begin to have a clear overview of this conductor's strengths and foibles. The former outweigh the latter by far, but Mahler shows everything up, since he was a master conductor-composer. On Sunday (and Monday) the London Symphony played the Fourth for him. It has a dewier, more innocent surface than Tilson Thomas could make plausible: TT never twinkles. The first movement, with its sleighbells, pranced and curvetted artfully, every moment of it calculated to the hilt. The same anxious care, applied to the great Poco adagio - here a Molto adagio - left it gluey. TT lacks the gift of his master, Leonard Bernstein for drawing 'natural' playing from his orchestra; they sounded thoroughly practised, hardly ever spontaneous. Yet the Scherzo was dazzling, kaleidoscopic. TT revelled in bringing out lines - a bassoon melody here, a string of pizzicati there - that nobody else uncovers; the score churned with excitement. For the finale he had the soprano Renee Fleming as soloist: lovely singing, but the voice is really too womanly-mature for the child's-eye Wunderhorn sentiments. Earlier, she had delivered Schubert's 'Shepherd on the Rock' with such fine grace as to make it seem almost a good piece, abetted by Nicholas Rodwell's elegant clarinet and TT at the piano. That was part of a strange mixed first half, comprising Morton Feldman's The Viola in my Life IV and a John Tavener premiere, The Myrrh-Bearer. Yuri Bashmet was the peerless viola soloist in each. The Tavener is much the usual mixture, with a semi-chorus whispering 'Kyrie Eleison' over and over again beneath repetitive shouts from the main chorus, while the viola goes floridly up and down a couple of scales for well over half an hour. Bashmet made that sound almost interesting. He did as much for Feldman's solo part, which plays almost continuously for 20 minutes while the orchestra does Feldman's customary thing: deliberately, polemically low-profile, apparently quite unstructured. Two nights earlier, Anne-Sophie Mutter's violin recital in the same hall had been remarkable chiefly for the height of her stiletto heels, surmounted by a slinky black number. Miss Mutter is of course a performer of the highest professional competence, and in the right repertoire - passionate virtuoso stuff - she wields a scathing authority. Here, however, she essayed Beethoven's last sonata, op. 96 in G, and Schumann's second-last, his op. 121 in D minor: the one mostly gentle and reflective, the other lean and dramatic but formally patterned. Her way with the Beethoven was to play it all sweetly, declining to read any particular character in it. A 'soft, oleaginous mutter' indeed, though with a very fast, sentimental vibrato applied to everything. Her svelte Schumann had plenty of energy - but a work so full of repetitions should not have them all repeated with such literal exactitude. A touch of waywardness is a bonus in this sonata. Aftersong, a workmanlike piece composed for Miss Mutter by the American Sebastian Currier, gave her - and her excellent pianist Lambert Orkis - bold things to do. Its heart remained in Samuel Barber territory, its nerves recalled Walton; Messiaen surfaced later on. There was more red-blooded music in the suite Stravinsky arranged from his Pulcinella, pastiche though it partly is. They played not the familiar arrangement for Dushkin, but an earlier, more virtuosic one Stravinsky made for Szymanowski's violinist Paul Kochanski: and they delivered it with engaging flair.

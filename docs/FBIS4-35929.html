			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hadi from Aden] </F>   [Text] Sanaa has denied that foreign parties or Iraqi  forces are fighting on the side of Sanaa's forces against the  southern forces.    Aden has officially announced the capture of a number of  Iraqis who fought with the northern forces in battles that raged  between the southern and northern forces.    'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, vice president of the Democratic  Republic of Yemen, has this to say:    [Begin al-Jifri recording] Brothers from Sudan and Iraq are  helping the brothers-enemies who are attacking us. There are  certainly Iraqi pilots. They fly the planes at very high  altitude so that their planes will not be brought down and be  captured. The planes used are Iraqi and north Yemeni ones.  There are so far five Iraqi prisoners and they are in Hadramaut  and I have just been told that there is one more. They are six  now. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with unidentified member of Moscow Radio </F> International delegation to PRC by unidentified correspondent;  place and date not given]    [Excerpts] A delegation from Moscow Radio International  visited China from 5 to 12 April. A protocol on cooperation  between Moscow Radio International and China Radio International  was signed in Beijing on 11 April. The document includes 10  articles, one of which provides that each side is to fund the  broadcasting of its programs via satellite communications to  ground receiver stations in the capital of its partner. Our  guests also traveled to Shanghai. During its stay in Beijing,  the delegation was interviewed by a correspondent from the  Russian section of China Radio International. Listen to this  interview.    [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] We know  that during your visit, our radio stations signed documents of  cooperation. How do you assess the prospects of our future  cooperation?    [Delegation member] We have been cooperating for four years  now, and we mutually extend the use of our transmitters. We  have signed an agreement on extended mutual cooperation. We  have also discussed still broader cooperation as well as  exchanges of specialists, programs, and groups of journalists of  various television and radio programs. The things outlined in  the protocol signed today are the next step, but we have not  stopped here. We have discussed meeting in Moscow this October  or November to sign an even broader protocol. We have already  determined the direction of our activity, and will sign [word  indistinct] in Moscow this year. We are very satisfied with the  rate in which our cooperation is growing from year to year.  This helps both Chinese and Russian journalists and engineers,  and constitutes mutual fertilization out of which new ideas and  advances emerge.    The cooperation between Moscow Radio International and China  Radio International in the technical field, and especially the  allowing of mutual use of both countries' transmitters for  broadcasting, is an important aspect of our work and [words  indistinct] cooperation. But I believe a different side of the  cooperation is no less important, and maybe even the most  substantial. I am referring to the exchange of specialists, of  groups of journalists, and of radio programs--in other words,  fields in which cooperation is obvious. Cooperation in the  technical field is important and essential; we simply could not  conduct radio programs without it. However, this cooperation is  invisible to many, and a limited number of Chinese and Russian  experts know about it.    [Correspondent] One does not hear about it.    [Delegation member] Yes, that is correct. But when people  visit a country themselves, Chinese journalists coming to Russia  or Russian journalists going to China, when they see these  changes with their own eyes and the way people relate to them,  the upshot is that the most interesting radio programs are then  broadcast. These programs introduce the life of a different  country and different people, which is precisely what  constitutes a bridge of mutual understanding between people who  begin to understand each other deeper and better. I would like  to focus your attention on this. Unfortunately, certain areas  and points of cooperation in the sphere of exchange of  specialists have not yet been included in the protocol signed  today. But we hope, and maybe are even certain--and this  certainty comes from both Russia and China being interested--  that we will certainly broaden and renew our connections as  regards the exchange of journalists.

The group said it had achieved the improvement to Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 916,000) through a reduction in operating costs and working capital. Operating profits improved to Pounds 1.63m (Pounds 1.25m) and margins rose to 5.49 per cent (4.23 per cent). The results were calculated in accordance with accounting standard FRS 3 with 1991 results restated. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.6p. Earnings per share rose 36 per cent to 2.37p (1.74p). Net borrowings fell to Pounds 2.25m (Pounds 5.07m) and gearing dropped to 9 per cent (22 per cent). The group said borrowings had fallen mainly because it had reduced the number of weeks it carries stocks, but also because of scrutiny of capital spending.

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Investment regulation criticised: Reports from OFT say commissions paid to sales agents could distort advice TWO INDEPENDENT reports published yesterday by the Office of Fair Trading contain the disquieting conclusions that investors know too little about the financial products they buy to make a sensible choice and that commissions paid to sales agents could distort investment advice. The reports' broader finding is that competition in the marketplace for financial services is not working in the interest of the consumer. The reports are fiercely critical of the regulation of retail investments. The OFT asked two consumer affairs consultants, Mr Jeremy Mitchell and Ms Helena Wiesner, for separate reports. Both found there were 'market failures' in financial services, resulting from public ignorance and the commissions paid to intermediaries. One report said: 'A commission-based remuneration system poses substantial conflicts of interest for intermediaries and can have a deleterious effect on the type of product a consumer is advised to buy, and for independent financial advisers, also on the company from which that product is bought.' It also criticised the scope of retail regulation, and the fact that building societies are not regulated under the Financial Services Act. If the OFT accepted the reports' conclusions Sir Gordon Borrie, the director-general of fair trading, would be brought into conflict with the Securities and Investments Board, which regulates most of the financial services industry. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, would then be called on to make a final decision. The OFT stressed, however, that the reports were aimed at 'stimulating discussion'. The reports had revealed much useful information. SIB announced last month it would not force independent financial advisers to reveal the commissions they received from investment companies in cash terms at point of sale. It also allowed life companies to quote illustrations for potential buyers on the assumption that their costs were in line with the industry average - even if their expenses were much higher. Both decisions are attacked in the OFT's reports, which said: 'Clear information about costs and other features of the product or service are essential. This is patently not the case as far as the provision of independent advice is concerned.' When Sir David Walker, out-going chairman of SIB, announced the results of his review, he admitted he disagreed with Sir Gordon on commission disclosure. He added: 'Ultimately, if he persists in his view, and I persist in mine, then we will have to leave ministers to decide.' The OFT will be unable to act until SIB's proposed rules have been fully drafted, which will probably not be until the end of next month. Mr Mitchell, a former director of the National Consumer Council and director of consumer affairs at the OFT, and Ms Wiesner, a director of the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Office (Lautro), agree on several points: Levels of commission may influence the advice of salesmen. That is illustrated by growth in the sale of endowment mortgages, which pay a commission not available for standard repayment mortgages. In 1970, endowments accounted for 6.7 per cent of mortgages and repayments for 88 per cent. In 1990, endowments took 75 per cent of mortgages and repayments only 20 per cent. The drive by life companies to secure sales outlets, particularly with building societies, has pushed up commission levels. 'Tied agency' deals, in which a building society sells only the products of one life office, have proved very popular. Only two large building societies, Bradford &amp; Bingley and Yorkshire, remain independent in that respect. According to Ms Wiesner's report, Halifax Building Society, which is tied to Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life insurer, received Pounds 162m in commission in 1990 - 16 per cent of income and 27 per cent of profits. Since 1989, the share taken by commission from a 10-year endowment policy has risen by 27 per cent for independents and 47 per cent for tied agents. According to Lautro's last commission survey, the highest commission paid on a Pounds 50-a-month, 25-year endowment policy with a tied agent was Pounds 642. High turnover of sales staff may have implications for their training and competence. On average, 38 per cent of new sales recruits to life insurance companies leave within a year and 54 per cent leave within two. One office, Provident Mutual, loses 90 per cent of recruits in two years.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            HOW FEES VARY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LUMP SUM INVESTMENTS                 COMMISSION OR FEE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Unit Trusts                          3 percent commission Investment trusts/other shares       1.65 percent stockbroker's fee                                      (plus stamp duty 0.5 percent) Unit-linked bonds                    5 per cent commission Personal Equity Plans                3 per cent commission National Savings, building society deposits, bank deposits              no commission or fee Guaranteed income bonds              0.5 percent to 2 percent commission Annuities                            2 percent commission DSS rebates for personal pension plans                        5 percent commission  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- REGULAR PREMIUM INVESTMENTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Endowment assurance* 10-year term                         around 40 percent of first year's                                      premiums; 2.5 percent a year after                                      initial period 25-year term                         80 percent or more of first year's                                      premiums; 2.5 percent a year after                                      initial period Individual pension* 10-year term                         around 30 percent of first year's                                      premiums; 2.5 percent a year after                                      initial period 25-year term                         around 60 percent of first year's                                      premiums; 2.5 percent a year after                                      initial period Unit trust saving schemes            3 percent commission on each                                      payment Investment trust savings schemes     variable - typical 1 percent charge                                      on transactions Tessas                               no commission or fee National Savings                     no commission or fee  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Commission is often paid on indemnity terms - ie all the commission covering the 'initial period' is paid up-front when the contract set up.

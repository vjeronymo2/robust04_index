			<p>Icosahedral   Boron   <F P=102> 43070061V Tokyo ISBB'93 in English Aug 93 p 101--FOR  OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 43070061V </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo ISBB'93 </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Hirohide Nakamatsu, </F> Institute of Chemical Research, Kyoto University; and Koun  Shirai, Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka]    [Text] There are two different and complementary approaches  to study electronic structure of solids, i.e., band theory and  the molecular orbital (MO) method. The MO cluster calculations  which treat a small fraction of a crystal can clarify the aspect  of chemical bond correlated with the electronic structures,  providing the description in the real space. The MO approach is  more desirable for understanding of boron and boron-rich  compound solids containing the icosahedron because of their  rather complicated crystal structure. Indeed, the concept of the  MO's in the icosahedral B[.sub]12[/] unit successfully  explains the properties of these materials: insulating property,  stability of the structure of _a_-rhombohedral B type, and  forming of the so-called three-center bond. This groundwork was  done by Longuet-Higgins and Roberts many years ago.[.sup]1[/]  Although their discussion on the electronic structure is  complete from the standpoint of symmetry properties, there  remains difficulty of numerical estimation yet.    Numerical calculations will reveal detailed electronic  structures of boron and bring us a quantitative account for the  trends in physical properties among the boron-rich compounds  (e.g., insulating or semiconducting characters). There is  another reason to perform such calculations. Many experiments  show that amorphous boron also belongs to semiconductor, even  though there has been so far reported no explicit evidence of  long periods of covalent-bond sequence in the amorphous phase.  This suggests importance of the short-range order for character  of these material. Therefore, it is interesting to examine  change in the electronic structure with various parameters, such  as bond length and local symmetry.    We perform cluster calculations for the electronic structure  of _a_-rhombohedral boron, using the discrete-variation (DV)  X_a_ method. To carry out this study, it is very important to  construct a proper model of the cluster. We adopt, as a first  step, the cluster of icosahedral B[.sub]12[/] with the  nearest neighbor atoms as shown in the figure. Six boron atoms  are attached to the rhombohedral vertices of the centered  icosahedron and twelve boron atoms are attached to the  equatorial sites. Boron atoms of the latter group form the  three-center bond in the x-y plane. Each boron atom of the  nearest neighbor of the icosahedron is terminated by two  hydrogen atoms, the geometry of which is determined by reference  to the diborane molecule.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-33A>      Figure 1.

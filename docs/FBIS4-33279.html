			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Niko Barkeviser, president of the Cuba Yes  Solidarity Foundation [Fundacion de Solidaridad Cuba Si] in The  Netherlands, told reporters in Havana that many Netherlanders  support peoples who are defending their integrity and future.  He said his organization hopes to increase its aid to the  Caribbean island.    The foundation began through a French initiative to send an  oil tanker to Cuba, and its purpose is to discuss the situation  on the island, especially the U.S. blockade, but not internal  issues which, Barkeviser said is a Cuban problem.    Barkeviser said his foundation is trying to increase  European  cooperation with Cuba. Over the past two years, the foundation  has sent approximately 30 tons of potato seeds and powdered milk  to Cuba and plans to help increase the 10,000 Netherlanders who  visit Cuba every year.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NURSE STOPS TO AID MAN, IS FATALLY SHOT  </P> <P> A 40-year-old private nurse who stopped her car in the Hollywood Hills,  apparently to help a man she saw lying in the street, was fatally shot  Wednesday when the man got up and pulled out a gun, Los Angeles police said.  </P> <P> No arrests were made in what police described as the ambush killing. The nurse,  Lucille Marie Warren, was shot at 6:45 a.m. in an exclusive section of Woodrow  Wilson Drive. She was on her way home to Inglewood after leaving a house where  she was working as a night nurse, police said.  </P> <P> Investigators said there were indications that the woman may have known her  killer. Detectives were investigating whether Warren, who was divorced and  lived with her two teen-age children, was involved in any personal disputes  that could have led to the shooting, Detective Mike Coffey said. "This doesn't  appear to be a random encounter," he said.  </P> <P> Police said the killer may have been lying in the street because he knew Warren  was approaching and would stop if she thought someone needed help.  </P></p>

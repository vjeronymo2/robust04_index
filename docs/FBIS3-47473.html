Upon unveiling the new Sunny model, Nissan President  Yoshifumi Tsuji said the switch was prompted by the appreciation  of the yen.    Nissan has already started to locally manufacture about 70  percent of Sunny cars sold in the U.S. market.    Just less than 120,000 vehicles of 165,000 Sunny cars sold  in  the U.S. last year were locally made, with the remainder  imported from Japan.    Tsuji said its new manufacturing plant in Tennessee will be  in charge of production of all Sunnys from late this year. The  cars produced there will be put on the U.S. market starting  1995.    Nissan's Zama plant in Kanagawa Prefecture will continue  making Sunnys for the domestic market, but its production will  be phased out, as the operation is gradually moved to the Kanda  plant in Kyushu as part of the company's restructuring program.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Unionists increase pressure over coal vote NORTHERN Ireland's Unionist MPs are heightening the government's dilemma over Britain's coal industry by hinting strongly that their reaction to ministers' proposals will depend on whether special help is given to the province, Ralph Atkins writes. The votes of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs and three Democratic Unionist MPs could be crucial to win Commons approval for the proposals to be set out by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The two unionist parties made clear yesterday that they are anxious to help Northern Ireland's electricity users. MPs from the parties have already met Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister. 'We will be looking at the impact of the government's energy review on the whole of the UK,' said one Ulster Unionist MP. Northern Ireland MPs complain that large electricity users in the province face charges up to 25 per cent higher than on the mainland. When MPs voted on the proposed pit closures in October, the DUP voted with Labour and the Ulster Unionist abstained - but only after a government assurance that its energy review would include Northern Ireland. The MPs could demand financial support for the proposed electricity inter-connector with Scotland, although the government is already backing an application for a European Community subsidy for the project. Unionists also want to boost the local lignite industry, perhaps by being awarded contracts for electricity generation.</p>

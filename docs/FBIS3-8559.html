The charge informed ministry officials that on February  27th at about 2300 [2200 GMT] hours during a normal check of a  car with Yugoslav plates in the village of Zelenovice of Ulqin  district, police arrested Zeqo and Beqiri because they had no  visas for Yugoslavia. They apparently had entered Yugoslavia  illegally by crossing Lake of Shkoder by boat.    On March 4, the Albanian Government demanded that the  Yugoslav authorities describe the conditions of the detainees  and say what measures have been taken against them, but Yugoslav  Embassy had no further information. The Albanians have lodged a  protest demanding that visas be issued for three persons who are  supposed to be in touch with the arrested men. At the same time  the Albanian Embassy in Belgrade was informed, and the charge  d'affaires was sent to Montenegro immediately.    Several demands have been sent to the Yugoslav Embassy in  Tirana, but so far no news has been received about the arrested  men and no visas have been issued to those who like to visit  them.</p>

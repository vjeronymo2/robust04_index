			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Idyllic fortress ready to lower drawbridge: Tiny Alderney is a victim of its own success Alderney in the Channel Islands has run out of money, which is no mean feat for an island where Lloyd's Names make up nearly 2 per cent of the population and almost half the residents are independently wealthy. For decades the island has thrived as the fulfilment of an idyll. Alderney has its own parliament, civil service, airport, hospital, golf course, sailing club, newspaper and banks - and fewer than 2,400 residents. All the inhabitants and institutions are squeezed into an island just 3 1/2 miles long by 1 1/2 miles wide without damaging the rhythm of rural life. But the island's very success in selling itself as a haven from the 20th century has been its undoing. Residents who have chosen to live in Alderney because of its peace and seclusion have fought to preserve it from change, just as others have sought to increase their prosperity and comfort through further development. This conflict of interest came to a head five years ago when conservationists united against a local entrepreneur's proposal to reopen a granite quarry. The dispute was bitter for an island renowned for its friendliness and goodwill, spilling over into demonstrations and boycotts. But the campaign was successful and the quarry scheme was cancelled. This success boosted the preservation lobby and was rapidly followed by measures to slow the property market, which had continued to flourish as that of the UK declined. The island's States, or parliament, introduced a 100 per cent property tax on profits made by selling a house within five years of its purchase. Investors stopped buying houses on Alderney, and so did many people looking for second homes or towards a future retirement on the island. In just two years, the revenue from the local property transaction tax, known as conge, was halved. More measures followed. Legislation was adopted to prevent the sale of new houses to settlers. And the more outspoken conservationists started pushing to turn the island's village centre, St Anne, into a conservation area. The effect of pulling up the drawbridge against future settlers and of limiting change and development on the island was to tie Alderney's fortunes inextricably to those of its existing settlers. Last year the combined effect of the Lloyd's syndicates' losses and falling interest rates saw Alderney's income-tax revenue fall 18 per cent. The deficit ate much of the island's capital reserve account, built up from past surpluses. This year's projected deficit seems set to finish the job, forcing Alderney to turn to Guernsey to make up the shortfall. Since 1948 Guernsey has provided Alderney's core services under a deal designed to help the islanders on their return to an island devastated during the second world war. Alderney levies its taxes at Guernsey rates and passes the revenue to Guernsey, which charges for the services it provides before allowing Alderney to manage the surplus. Alderney, like the other Channel Islands, is not constitutionally part of the UK. It is part of the bailiwick of Guernsey, which is itself a Crown possession. The governor of Guernsey is also governor of Alderney, but Alderney's parliament petitions directly to the Privy Council. Alderney and Guernsey also levy the same taxes, and Alderney passes its tax revenue to Guernsey in return for the provision of core services. Because of this agreement, two members of the States of Alderney represent the island in the Guernsey States of Deliberation, or parliament. Alderney's external affairs and treaties come under the jurisdiction of the British parliament and are handled by the UK's Foreign Office. Alderney is bound by EU external trade arrangements and agricultural policies. But it is not affected by EU taxation, employment or any other policy area. A clause in the 1948 deal between Alderney and Guernsey, all but forgotten until this year's financial crisis, obliges Guernsey to cover a deficit from its own funds when Alderney cannot meet its expenses. Nevertheless, Alderney cannot rely on Guernsey to go on subsidising it. As Mr George Baron, Alderney's president, points out, no agreement is binding for ever, and there is every chance that Guernsey and Alderney would be forced to consider an alternative arrangement if the deficit continued. Meanwhile, Alderney cannot raise its income tax rate from Guernsey's 20 per cent, and if it cuts its services it may deter the present and future settlers on whom it depends for its revenue. In 1992 income tax accounted for more than two-thirds of Alderney's revenue. With preservation so recently the order of the day, Alderney has been left with only one choice, and that is to develop the island to increase its income. Mr Baron said: 'Either we accept change, or we lose our autonomy.' And Alderney has started to accept change. Six months ago the elections for the presidency and four seats on the 12-member States swept away the conservationist majority. The property tax law was promptly overturned, and recent months have seen a flurry of development schemes. The island has long been deadlocked over whether it should build a marina which would provide protection from the north and north-easterly winds that the natural harbour lacks. A consensus is forming in favour of this. The States has launched a competitive tender for the Pounds 8m redevelopment of one of the Victorian forts that ring the island - and it is no longer confining its possible uses to activities as low-key as, perhaps, a study centre. It might be a hotel. It might even house a casino. And the mood is for more houses that can be sold to settlers or islanders, on an island which is changing and developing in an effort to balance its need for conservation against its need for revenue.</p>

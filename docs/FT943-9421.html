			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: GKN drives forward The market had a long hard look at GKN's shiny new figures and could find hardly a blemish. Even the huge writedown of Westland's assets raised barely a murmur. Not merely was the 62 per cent bounce in profits well above expectations; virtually all areas of the business are moving strongly in the right direction. Even UES is back in the black. Moreover, the improvement accelerated in the second quarter with volume growth returning to the automotive components business and the resulting surge in profit showing the value of tough cost-cutting in Europe. GKN also increased its share of its main automotive markets and is optimistic that the trend will continue. As pressure on the major manufacturers lifts, they may find it easier to follow Fiat's example and outsource to GKN all their constant velocity driveshafts. True, GKN has had some luck, not least with Westland which following the AOI settlement must rate as a real bargain. But maybe after the years of hard graft, the company and its shareholders deserve the odd break. The shares have risen nearly 150 per cent since December 1991 and the former high-yield stock is now paying out just 3.9 per cent. Those who argue the shares are still cheap point to forecasts that GKN's earnings could reach up to 100p over the next few years. At the very least, though, that would require all its markets to peak at the same time. With the US car market already showing signs of slowing, that appears unlikely. But investors are now being forced to take a long-term view - a rating of about 15 times next year's likely earnings is pretty demanding even for a company in GKN's commanding position.</p>

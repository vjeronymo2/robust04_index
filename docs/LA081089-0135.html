			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> CHP CHIEF'S OPPOSITE NUMBER IN MEXICO VISITS  </P> <P> Alejandro Romero, commander of the Mexican highway patrol in the northern state  of Sonora, is in Santa Ana this week trying to learn what makes the California  Highway Patrol tick.  </P> <P> Romero is one of five Mexican officers in Southern California for the first  stage of an exchange program between the CHP and its Mexican counterpart.  </P> <P> In June, Mexican and CHP officials met in San Diego and sealed the plan to send  five officers for a week to work with CHP officers. The exchange is an  extension of a 20-year agreement under which six CHP officers are stationed  full time in Mexico, said CHP Capt. Charles Lynd, head of the Santa Ana CHP  office.  </P> <P> Besides giving Mexican officials a look at the modern computers, radio systems  and new cars they lack at home, the exchange is aimed at providing CHP officers  with a deeper understanding of the area's Latino community, Lynd said.  </P> <P> The five Mexican commanders began work Monday morning at CHP headquarters in  San Diego, Oceanside, El Centro and Banning.  </P> <P> Romero, 42, said he most wanted to study CHP hiring practices and personnel  evaluation. Later in the week, he hopes to ride with county CHP officers.  </P> <P> "There is less roadway in Orange County but many more cars than in Mexico,"  Romero said. "And the roads are a lot wider."  </P> <P> Lynd said that if the visit works out, he will visit Romero in Sonora later  this year, and lower-ranking officers will also visit Mexico.  </P> <P> Lynd said understanding Latino culture has become a major CHP aim.  </P></p>

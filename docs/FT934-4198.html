			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Motoring: Why the Mondeo triumphed - Car of the Year / In a tight finish, Ford just managed to snatch the laurels from Citroen In a fighting finish, Ford's Mondeo pipped the Citroen Xantia at the post to become Car of the Year 1994. It was far from being a two-horse race - there were 15 runners - but Mondeo or Xantia simply had to win. Two months ago, I forecast the Xantia would win narrowly. I thought it would gain the crucial extra votes because its self-levelling suspension gave it even better ride and handling than the Ford, and rear seat passengers had more room. Also, its urbane turbo-diesel version had appeared in mid-summer while the Mondeo TD still waited in the wings. Had I driven the Mondeo turbo-diesel when I made my forecast, I might have put it a whisker ahead of the Xantia. It really is that good, as I discovered when I drove one last month. Why did the Mondeo win, with 290 votes from the jury of 58 European motoring writers against the Xantia's 264? Mainly because 19 of the jury made it their first choice compared with nine for the Xantia. I believe there were two other reasons for this. One is that the Mondeo comes with crash-protecting airbags, which the Xantia does not get until next year. The second is that a complete range of Mondeo saloons, hatchbacks and estate cars is on offer whereas the Xantia comes only as a hatchback for now. The fact that a PSA (Citroen-Peugeot) product had been chosen Car of the Year five times in the past 24 years, while Ford had won only twice, could also have had some influence, but Citroen will be disappointed. Three years ago, its class-leading ZX small/medium car was passed over in favour of the VW Golf MkIII and Vauxhall (Opel) Astra. At the time, it was said part of the reason was that the French had been winning too often to suit some of the jury. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class, successor to the 190, was a good third this year with 192 votes while the Opel (Vauxhall) Corsa ran the C-Class close, coming fourth with 183. I had thought the Renault Twingo could have been third behind the Mondeo and Xantia but, in the event, it finished fifth (174), well ahead of the Peugeot 306 (108). Sadly, Renault seems to have decided against ever making the Twingo in right-hand drive. Perhaps one of the many British who admire small, cheap and practical French cars will haul Renault before the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The C-Class is everything one expects from a Mercedes-Benz and has established itself already as the benchmark car in the compact executive class. It is marginally larger, considerably roomier and more sophisticated mechanically than the 190; even the diesels score a world first with four valves a cylinder. In Britain, it is priced little higher than the 190 equivalents. Fleet management companies forecast low rates of depreciation that will make it cheaper to run over three or four years than rival cars that cost less to buy. Saab's 900 (seventh with 87 votes) did not make as strong a mid-field challenge as I had expected; I thought it would have been closer behind the C-Class. But the Seat Ibiza, as I forecast, was the best of the also-rans, attracting 64 votes. This was almost double the Rover 600's score (33) and practically three times that of the Honda Accord (28), with which the Rover shares mechanicals. After that, a single European car (Lancia Delta) and a bedraggled bunch of Far Eastern products limped over the finish, by which time the winners were already in the unsaddling enclosure. What does the award mean to a deservedly jubilant Ford? It will be worth millions of pounds in free advertising and set the seal of success on the best new product it has launched in years. Winning Car of the Year has only a short-term effect on sales of a poor car - and some duds have picked up the award in the past. But when a winner is as good as Mondeo, sales graphs will keep climbing long after the celebration is over.  ----------------------- CAR OF THE YEAR  ----------------------- How the jury voted  1 Ford Mondeo       290  2 Citroen Xantia    264  3 Mercedes-Benz    C-Class           192  4 Vauxhall (Opel)    Corsa             183  5 Renault Twingo    174  6 Peugeot 306       108  7 Saab 900           87  8 Seat Ibiza         64  9 Rover 600          33 10 Honda Accord       28 11 Lancia Delta and    Mitsubishi Galant  11 13 Hyundai Impreza     2 14 Daihatsu Charade    1 15 Nissan Serena       0  -----------------------</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Tokyo police hold foreign workers TOKYO police and immigration officials yesterday mounted an unprecedented raid on foreign workers as they gathered in a park in the Japanese capital. They were allegedly breaking immigration laws. The authorities took 102 foreigners into custody in the highest profile action yet to stop mainly Iranian workers from gathering in Yoyogi Park on the outskirts of central Tokyo. Every Sunday over the past two years the park has been a meeting place for several thousand mainly Iranian men. The entrance to the park where the men gather takes on the air of a middle eastern bazaar with stalls selling Iranian food, music cassettes and haircuts, as well as forged telephone cards. The authorities also allege there is extensive drug dealing. Immigration officials and police officers used several vans to take away 68 Iranians, 11 Malaysians as well as Nepalese and Pakistani workers. On April 28 the authorities signalled their intention to crack down on the gatherings when the Tokyo metropolitan government started planting about 3,000 azalea bushes in areas of the park where the men gather. They then cordoned off the area with high fences, ostensibly to protect the plants. Immigration officials said all the men taken away had overstayed their visas in Japan and were working illegally in factories and on construction sites. They said the men would be repatriated soon. The illegal foreign workers are in part victims of the sharp economic downturn. They were mainly attracted to Japan during the high growth of the late 1980s when it became commonplace for young Japanese to refuse to do dirty, dangerous or difficult manual jobs.</p>

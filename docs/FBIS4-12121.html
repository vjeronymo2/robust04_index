			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says he would prefer  to advance the negotiations with Jordan at this point, but  regretfully, that side has recently evinced hesitancy. When  asked which country was our first priority, Syria or Jordan,  Minister Peres replied: A great deal depends on them; we will  be serious with whoever is serious.    Interviewed by our correspondent Karmit Gay this morning,  Minister Peres called on Knesset Member [MK] Hayim Ramon not to  quit Labor both for his and the party's sake. Shim'on Peres  revealed that he had met twice with Hayim Ramon last week to try  to talk him out of his plan. Peres said Ramon belongs in the  government, and his stepping down had been a blunder.    The foreign minister rejected Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi  Beilin's accusations, saying no one was pushing MK Ramon out of  the party.    Minister 'Uzi Bar'am has also said that Ramon should remain  in Labor. He criticized Labor Secretary General Zvili's  remarks, made in Washington this morning, against Hayim Ramon.</p>

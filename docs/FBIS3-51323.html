			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 14 Jan, CANA -- A conference of  the Caribbean Group for Co-operation in Economic Development  (CGCED) to be held here January 27-28 is being billed as a major  opportunity for Guyana to secure commitments of funding.    Government officials say they are "cautiously optimistic"  that the World Bank forum can produce pledges of new funding to  plug a US40 million to US50 million dollar projected financing  gap in 1994.    The World Bank said nearly 50 countries and international  organisations are expected to be represented at the meeting  which will focus on Guyana's economic recovery effort.    Together with Guyana's major creditor nations and several  newly industrialised countries, attendance at the meeting will  include the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the  Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the International Finance  Corporation, the Internationsl Fund for Agricultural  Development, the Kuwait Fund, and the International Moetary Fund.    CGCED, meeting here for the first time, is a World Bank  forum  which helps coordinate external aid to Caribbean states.    Guyana's president, Dr. cheddi Jagan, is scheduled to  address  the delegates January 27, and a financing plan and the donors'  programme for Guyana will be examined on January 28. On Jan.  28, also, the Guyana Government will host a discussion on its  development programme.    Former US President Jimmy Carter, who spearheaded  international participation in Guyana's October 1992 elections,  widely heralded as marking the country's return to democracy, is  also to participate in the forum. Carter, representing the  Altanta-based Carter centre of Emory University, is expected in  Guyana January 25 for the conference.    Dr Uma Lele, an official of centre [as received] visiting  here this week, said the former President's role at the coming  meeting will be to understand the constraints faced by nations  like Guyana and the demands that donors make, and to identify  how he could help.</p>

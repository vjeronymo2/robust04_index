			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / People: Splitting the roles at Westbury In the same week as launching the ProShare campaign for wider share ownership, Geoffrey Maddrell has accepted an invitation to become non-executive chairman of Westbury. The Cheltenham-based housebuilder is also bringing in John Bennett, previously finance director of CHB Group, as finance director in advance of the retirement of Barrie Hall. Richard Fraser had combined the roles of chairman and chief executive for the past three years, although Westbury, a 1985 management buy-out company, had had a non-executive chairman for a spell after its stock market flotation in 1986. Fraser had, however, indicated in May that he wished to bring in an outside chairman - partly a reflection of shareholders' general preference for splitting the roles, partly because market conditions demanded more of his time. Maddrell, 56, ex-Tootal boss, and now chief executive of ProShare, has recently been appointed a civil service commissioner, and is a director of the Transport Development Group. Stressing that he will make sure most of his time is spent on the ProShare endeavour, he adds that 'it is important for me to keep up with what is going on in industry'. As for the choice of Westbury, he thinks he can have a useful strategic input. 'I know from the textiles business you can be very successful in tough markets if you stick to your knitting.' Bennett, 44, who had also been on the main board of Beazer, left in July. He had been preparing the flotation of CHB last autumn when Hanson snapped up Beazer. Hall, 57, says he has known Bennett for several years, though was unaware he was looking for another job until Bennett replied to a newspaper advert describing the opening. Bennett takes up his position in November - but Hall stays on until the end of the financial year next February in his other roles of company secretary and IT director. Hall has been with Westbury for some 13 years - and says the MBO was his brainchild. He had intended to take early retirement at 55, but at that stage the housing market had 'just started on the downhill slope. Now I can put my hand on my heart and say I am leaving a firm that has a very strong balance sheet and is operating profitably.'</p>

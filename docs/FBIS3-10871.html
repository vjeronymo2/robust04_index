			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Betzy Villarreal and Juan de Dio Garcia Davish] </F>   [Text] Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno has  acknowledged a climate of tension prevails in this state and  denied his government had any involvement in the murder of  Mariano Perez Diaz, leader of the Emiliano Zapata Peasant  Organization (OCEZ). He has also announced a special  prosecutor's office was created to investigate the murder,  reiterating "our hands our clean."    In San Cristobal de las Casas, residents of the  municipality's poorest areas created a Unity Civic Front [Frente  Civico de Unidad] in support of Father Samuel Ruiz Garcia, the  diocese's bishop and mediator in the armed conflict. In Tuxtla  Gutierrez, more than 5,000 people participated in a rally  organized by PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] municipal  leaders and Municipal Council President Julio Cesar Garcia to  demand peace in Chiapas.    Meanwhile, the Zapatista National Liberation Army [EZLN]  began consultations with its grass roots regarding the  agreements reached with Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for  peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, during the so-called  meetings for peace. Since 9 March representatives of different  Altos de Chiapas communities have been going to the towns of La  Garrucha and Pantehuitz, Ocosingo Municipality, to participate  in the consultation to accept or reject the commitments the  federal government has made in San Cristobal Cathedral.    Antonio Hernandez, a member of the State Council of Indian  and Peasant Organizations (CEOIC), has said the group will ask  for the abolition of the state government and the promotion of a  provisional pact with the federal government to propose the  overhauling of the state's territorial and political structure.  Hernandez, who is also a state leader of the CIOAC [Independent  Federation of Agricultural Workers and Peasants], has said:  "They tell us we are crazy for making this proposal, but there  is no other alternative due to the current Chiapas government's  incapacity and lack of political commitment, something that was  borne out during our march of 6 March when the governor refused  to meet with us and sent us the police."    The state governor praised publicly Mariano Perez Diaz, who  was an OCEZ leader in Chiapas' northern zone, and he denied the  existence of a "witch hunt" or that a prize has been put on the  head of anyone. "The masterminds and perpetrators of this crime  will be punished in accordance to the law. This is an act of  provocation," he has affirmed. In a ceremony held at the  auditorium of the Government Palace in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Lopez  Moreno has urged state residents "against affixing lightly blame  beforehand or being prejudiced. Nobody will succeed in  separating the state government from local Indian organizations."    In Simojovel, where Perez Diaz was buried, the governor has  announced the creation of a special prosecutor's office, which  the CEOIC will name. The governor has said the murder was  regrettable, because Perez Diaz was an outstanding social  activist. With Margarita Ruiz de Perez, widow of the peasant  leader, present, Lopez Moreno has said his administration is  opening its doors, because there is nothing to hide. There has  been no complicity or illicit interests.    Relatives of the deceased peasant leader have said Simojovel  Council President Francisco Meneses Bassoul paid gunmen to kill  Perez Diaz. They have also said there will be a march to demand  justice and punishment for the masterminds and perpetrators of  the crime. Mrs. Perez has said her husband had received death  threats from Peasant Torch Oraganization and people from the  village of Concepcion de los Cacaos, Simojovel Municipality,  headed by his compadre, Sosimo Vasquez, with whom he had  differences regarding land.    In San Cristobal de las Casas, a pro-Bishop Samuel Ruiz  Garcia Unity Civic Front was created. The group has decided to  remain united to oppose those who want the clergyman to leave.  They have said the bishop has helped them more than any coleto  (San Cristobal de las Casas native) and felt it was unfair to  accuse him of being responsible for the problems that began on 1  January.    PRI supporters from different low-income areas of the city  have also held a demonstration in Tuxtla Gutierrez to protest  what they regard as the "stamping on of the constitution" of the  state. More than 5,000 people came out in favor of restoring  peace in Chiapas.    CIOAC leader Hernandez has said the CEOIC will seek to meet  with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to ask him to keep the  commitments he made with the 280 groups that comprise that  organization. He recalled later on 13 and 14 March the National  Meeting of Indian and Peasant Organizations will meet in San  Cristobal de las Casas to draft "a coordinated plan to demand  the dissolution of the Chiapas government to establish a supreme  government of Indians and non-Indians."    Domingo Lopez Angel, leader of the Community of People  Expelled from Chiapas [Comunidad de Expulsados de Chiapas], has  said his group will abstain from taking over additional state  buildings as a gesture of goodwill to contribute to peace.    Meanwhile, peasant groups still control the municipal  president's offices in Bella Vista and Sultepec in Chiapas  Sierra Madre. The offices of the mayor of Tuzantan and Mazatan  on the coast remain occupied. In those four cases, the  protesters are demanding the dissolution of the local  governments, because the mayors used public funds and did not  carry out any projects.</p>

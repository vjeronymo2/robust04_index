About 40,000  of the Antelope Valley's more than 200,000 residents work in the Los Angeles  Basin, officials said. Rush-hour traffic snarls along the mountain route of the  Antelope Valley Freeway and four-hour round-trips have become commonplace.  </P> <P> The initial bus service will offer two runs from Palmdale to the downtown Los  Angeles business district, said Greg Kelley, transit manager for the county  Public Works Department. It will cost $5 one way, with a monthly pass costing  $145, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Bucking the Trend: Lack of frills keeps curtain maker on track - How a move upmarket and a new sales director helped transform Curtina OUTSIDE the plain grey office door of Mr Len Bichard, chairman of curtain-maker Curtina, staff work quickly, cutting, sewing and folding material. They need to work quickly. Sales have doubled since 1990 and turnover for the current year should pass Pounds 18m. Exports have taken off over the same period and account for 10 per cent of sales. Mr Bichard's salary last year was Pounds 106,688, up from Pounds 41,234 the year before. It has been a long haul. He started the company in 1967 after working for textiles group Courtaulds. For 20 years he made a steady living selling velvet curtains from Rainham, a decaying town in Essex. Then two decisions transformed the company: a move into printed fabrics and the recruitment of a new sales director. 'We looked at the price of grey (raw) cloth and the price of printing and found the others were charging four times cost. We thought we could charge double,' says Mr Bichard. That strategy has been maintained with the help of cost control. Only 15 per cent of sales are through freelance agents. The rest is sold by just three people, including Mr Bichard and his sales director. There are no secretaries. 'We make our own phone calls and write one letter a week.' There is no design studio. Patterns are bought from freelance designers. Specialist equipment for handling materials, such as cloth cutters, are built by a freelance engineer. Offices are plain to the point of shabbiness. The chairman's office is lit by three ceiling striplights. The chairs are a tatty lime green. Corporate entertaining is out. 'We are not interested in fancy lunches. Even the PR is on the cheap.' The choice of curtain prints has helped growth. 'The taste of the curtain-buyer has always been seen as lower middle class,' says Mr Bichard. 'We gave them better taste and they bought it.' With top management making up the sales team, financial policies are designed to save time. Equipment is bought outright, there is no rented property and no discounting of invoices. Not everything is going well, however. Managing growth is unfamiliar ground and the value of stocks has been allowed to rise to Pounds 3.25m. 'We are addressing the problem,' says Mr Bichard. The rise of exports means the tiny sales team is out of its depth. 'We have not geared up to the standards we need to maximise overseas sales. Since the pound fell we have had many more enquiries but our growth rate is stretching us and limiting our selling drive.' Those limits have brought their own benefits, Mr Bichard argues. The company has been able to choose its customers to minimise the risk of bad debts. 'If someone doesn't pay on time we simply don't deal. If they fall down on the first payment we go in and take the goods back.' Growth has also brought buying power. Curtina's factories in Rainham and Leyland, Lancashire, consume about 100,000 metres of grey cloth a week. Sales agents are knocking on the company's doors to offer cut-price deals. Mr Bichard blames the 'silly' boom of the 1980s for rivals losing ground or failing in the recession. 'Manufacturers recruited irresponsibly and buyers were able to buy badly. 'Then things turned and management put the pressure on buyers. Money got dear and retailers had to address stock levels. A 10-week lead time was normal but our lead time is one week. We don't send a confirmation letter of an order, the goods would arrive first.' The result is a growing list of customers, including John Lewis Partnership, Debenhams and Allied Carpets. Overseas customers include mail-order group Quelle Grossversandhaus, Germany's second-largest fashion retailer. At 61, Mr Bichard is an informal boss. He laughs easily and sometimes seems awed by the pace of change. 'We don't have a five-year plan,' he says sheepishly. 'We've not yet got used to the idea we are becoming a reasonably sized business.'</p>

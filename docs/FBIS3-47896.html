Gombojab has held a press conference for Mongolian and  foreign newsmen. He said that the Mongolian Parliament has  approved 19 new laws and made changes and amendments to the 12  laws and issued 40 resolutions during the autumn session.    He admits that the Parliament has not succeeded to discuss  all the laws scheduled to be considered at first which was  connected with a lack of a conception of legislative initiative  on the part of the Great State Hural and the insufficient  quality of the draft laws themselves. A number of most  significant laws of civil code including those on land and  securities are being worked out in order to submit them to the  Parliament during its autumn session.</p>

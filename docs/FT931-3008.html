			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Attempt to tackle deficit in fund - National Insurance This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. CHANGES in National Insurance contribution rates were announced in an attempt to tackel the deficit in the National Insurance Fund. The changes are aimed at raising Pounds 1.8bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 2.2bn in 1995-96. From April 6, 1994, Class 1 contribution rates for employees are to rise by 1 percentage point to 10 per cent, and Class 4 rate for the self-employed - paid on profits between the Lower Profits Limit and the Upper Profits Limit (LPL) - is to rise by the same amount to 7.3 per cent. The position of employees earning below the Lower Earnings Limit and the self-employed with profits below the Lower Profits Limit will be unchanged. The initial 2 per cent Class 1 payment and the rates of employers' contribution would be unaffected. The government expects there still to be a need for a Treasury grant over the next few years because the revenue raised is unlikely to be sufficient to eliminate the National Insurance Fund's in-year deficit.</p>

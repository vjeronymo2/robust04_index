Diplomatic sources said that while Pyongyang had yet to  respond to the invitation, the Kim visit would help boost  China's power as a major arbiter in regional affairs.    Two major heads of government in East Asia, Japanese Prime  Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, and South Korean President, Kim  Young- sam, are scheduled to call in on Beijing next month.    The visit by President Kim (Il-sung) would help cement  Beijing's role as a mediator among the major players in East  Asia.    The sources said while Pyongyang had been angered by the  growing ties between Beijing and Seoul there was little doubt  that Mr Kim would accept the invitation.    However, the sources added, if Mr Kim's health was failing  or  if he was too preoccupied with the increasingly ferocious power  struggle that had broken out within the "Kim Dynasty", North  Korean Prime Minister, Kang Song-san, would pay the visit on his  behalf.    It is understood that Mr Kim II-sung was anxious to see  Chinese supreme leader Deng Xiaoping in case the patriarch's  health failed.    Despite Beijing's recent "tilt" towards Seoul, President Kim  Il-sung and his advisers have not given up hope that  "first-generation revolutionaries" like Mr Deng still have a  sentimental attachment to the old "lips-and-teeth" relationship  between the two communist neighbours.    According to Chinese sources, however, Beijing's major goal  in having President Kim Il-sung arrive after the visits of the  leaders of Japan and South Korea was to demonstrate its  influence in East Asia.    Japan and Western governments, particularly the United  States, have urged Beijing to persuade Pyongyang to put a freeze  on, if not dismantle, its nuclear weapon programme.    Chinese diplomats have also indicated their willingness to  help promote the peaceful unification of North and South Korea.    Diplomatic analysts said, however, that Beijing's ability to  influence Pyongyang's policy had been diminished.    They said President Kim Il-sung would visit Beijing after  the  end of March and Kim Chong-il, probably before the summer.    Aside from economic aid and co-operation, President Kim  Il-sung will probably seek Beijing's support for his son and  anointed successor Kim Chong-il.    Sources said despite his avowed desire not to meet any more  foreign leaders, Mr Deng would probably agree to see President  Kim Il-sung in private.    Meanwhile, President Kim met a Chinese Communist Party  official in Pyongyang yesterday.    Mr Kim received Li Shuzheng, head of the international  liaison dapartment of the Chinese Communist Party, and her  entourage and held talks in a "cordial and friendly atmosphere"  the Korean Central News Agency said.</p>

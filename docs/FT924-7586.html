			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / London's lead in forex deals grows: Bank oF England Quarterly Bulletin LONDON HAS extended its lead as the world's biggest centre for currency dealing, the Bank of England says. It adds that the change has come amid a big increase in activity in the global foreign exchange market. The Bank attributes London's dominance not only to higher turnover but also to more diversified dealing. Operators in London deal in a very broad range of currencies, while 74 per cent of dealing in New York is between the dollar and the D-Mark, the yen, sterling and the Swiss franc. The report, released ahead of publication in the Bank's Quarterly Bulletin this week, lists big changes in the nature of foreign currency dealing since the previous survey in 1989. Among the changes are a rise in non-dollar transactions, especially those involving the D-Mark, a fall in the proportion of dealing done through brokers, and a sharp increase in the market share of the top 10 interbank dealers in London. The Bank survey was part of a project conducted in April this year in which 26 central banks analysed foreign exchange turnover in their countries. The Bank says turnover increased in every leading centre, with net daily turnover in London rising by 60 per cent since 1989 to Dollars 300bn this year. The second centre on the league table was the US, where the daily total rose from Dollars 129bn to Dollars 192bn. Japan was third with a rise from Dollars 115bn to Dollars 128bn and Singapore fourth with a rise to Dollars 74bn from less than Dollars 60bn. Switzerland, Hong Kong and Germany were fifth, sixth and seventh. The Bank says there has been a big increase in the volume of foreign exchange activity over the past three years and the rise has almost certainly been bigger than that for world trade. 'Part of the increase in foreign exchange turnover must have been generated by the rise in cross-border capital flows which have been stimulated by the deregulation of financial markets,' it says. The rise in turnover has been accompanied by 'a significant shift' in the balance between spot and forward business over the past six years. In London, the proportion of spot business (immediate transactions) fell from 64 per cent in 1989 to 50 per cent this year. By contrast, the share of forward transactions (in which dealers lock into a specific rate for a determined point in the future) has risen by 120 per cent. In London, the Bank reports, the 10 most active principals have increased their market share, with a combined 43 per cent this year against 35 per cent in 1989.</p>

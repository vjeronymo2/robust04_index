Following the meeting Eliasson described the talks he had  with Armenian, Karabakh and Azerbaijan leaders as "interesting  and constructive." He expressed the hope that the peace process  could be stepped up by the Minsk Group.    Eliasson told journalists that an agreement would soon be  made on sending international observers into the war zone. He  admitted that the issues of a truce, troop withdrawal and  security guarantees for the population had not been resolved and  said that they would be discussed jointly with Russia.    Speaking of Moscow's mediation, in particular of Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's efforts, Eliasson said that all  parties should act in unison so as to obtain the best possible  results.    He told Interfax that the warring parties appreciated the  urgent need to resolve the Karabakh problem politically and this  was a major achievement. For this reason, he believed, the  CSCE, notably its Minsk Group, activity should not be regarded  as unproductive.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Hata places unity high on his agenda Mr Tsutomu Hata, due to be elected Japan's prime minister in a parliamentary vote today, has called for a 'grand union' of the country's political parties. 'I doubt whether it is desirable to have many political parties involved, when urgent action is required,' said Mr Hata, who will head a seven party coalition government. He was referring to the need for unity on the main issues facing his new government, including tax reform, Japan's response to the nuclear threat from North Korea, a solution to the trade row with the US, and economic deregulation. Mr Hata wants to form a 'unified force' strong enough to compete against the opposition Liberal Democratic party. He plans to discuss his ideas with potential allies; this would include co-operation in election campaigns. However, he thought it would be 'hasty' to call a general election as soon as new electoral boundaries were drawn, possibly by autumn. The current coalition embraces parties from the extreme left to the religious right. But policy rows paralysed government before the resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa over allegations of financial impropriety. A record 11 parties are now represented in the lower house of parliament, following the formation of three new parties last week. Mr Hata indicated in a television interview that he would seek a consensus between members of government. He rejected suggestions that Mr Ichiro Ozawa, backroom strategist of the previous government and deputy leader of his own Japan Renewal party, would control policy. The test of Mr Hata's will to strike a consensus between coalition members will come when he chooses a cabinet. JRP officials said he was looking for 'moderate' changes from the existing line-up to reflect a broader agenda than that of the previous administration, whose main task was to win agreement on four political reform bills. Separately, Mr Hata indicated he planned to relaunch the long-running argument over Japan's role in international affairs, by calling for a national debate on the country's pacifist constitution.</p>

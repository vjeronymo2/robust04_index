Engelgardt of the Russian Academy  of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 577.323]    [Abstract] Specially synthesized oligonucleotides were used  to detect and study SLS polynucleotide chain folding, the  theoretical model of which was constructed to explain the  unusual sensitivity of short tandem base repetition under  superhelical stress to single-strand specific nuclease. A  19-unit oligonucleotide capable of forming a pseudogene was  chemically modified under conditions that preserved the  secondary structure in order to clarify the state of the timines  and adenines. The modification sites were then split in hot  piperidine. To confirm the physical existence of SLS, a special  55-unit oligonucleotide was designed and synthesized. The  results of chemical modification at the single nucleotide  resolution level together with localization of the cleavage  sites with S1 nuclease revealed that one and the same base pairs  exhibited markedly different levels of sensitivity to the  modifier depending on their sequence location, and that those  base pairs that were strongly modified were already known to be  in a single-strand state or at the end of the helix. Those found  in the helical backbone or in the hypothesized interloop  mini-helix, were weakly modified, if at all. These data strongly  support the model of a highly symmetrical slipped-loop structure  with a stabilized interloop helix. To be even more sure, the  cleavage representation of the same oligonucleotide with the S1  nuclease was studied. Three compact regions of intensive  cleavage were clearly visible: the nucleotides of the end loop  and the unpaired nucleotides of both of the loops forming the  mini-helix. A GenBank search of nucleotide sequences turned up a  low estimate of 518 sites capable of SLS generation. Figures 10;  references 15: 2 Russian, 13 Western.</p>

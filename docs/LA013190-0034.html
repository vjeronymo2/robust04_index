			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The difficulty of solving crowding in Southeast San Diego schools continued to  vex city schools trustees Tuesday as they wrestled with a number of proposed  temporary solutions, beginning with the fall term.  </P> <P> In the first of several planned sessions on the issue, the board met into the  evening on ways to juggle 32 existing portable classrooms, to build 20 more and  to open an unused school in Clairemont so the district can bus sixth-grade  students from Sherman, Balboa and Brooklyn elementaries in Southeast to the  site.  </P> <P> The board indicated that it no longer considers expansion of multitrack,  year-round schools its major solution to crowding, responding to complaints by  angry residents of the predominantly Latino and black Southeast area that their  students have borne the brunt of the complex year-round schedules and have  suffered academically.  </P> <P> Trustees will take up the issue again next week. Potential long-term solutions  for new schools could cost up to $50 million and will also be discussed over  the next several weeks.  </P> <P> The district now has no funds to carry attempt permanent solutions beyond  construction of more portable classrooms and busing children to under-used  schools in other neighborhoods.  </P></p>

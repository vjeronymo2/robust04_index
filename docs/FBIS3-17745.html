Main  Contenders for Presidential Post Have Become Deputies"]    [Text] Kiev -- Ukraine has made its choice. The elections  were invalid in only three electoral districts out of 450.  There was a record result -- a 92-percent turnout -- in  Ivano-Frankovsk Oblast, and there was a 70-percent turnout in  the western oblasts in general. Over 60 percent of voters  turned up at the polling places in Donetsk, Kharkov, Zaporozhye,  and Odessa Oblasts.    From what Peter Emery, head of a CSCE delegation, who had  been on duty at one of Kiev's polling places, said, "the  elections were sufficiently honest and democratic."    As for the second round -- and, according to predictions, no  more than 70 candidates will get into parliament at the first  attempt -- Ivan Plyushch, head of the current Supreme Council,  promised that this will be held no later than 10 April, and that  the Central Electoral Commission may possibly schedule a repeat  vote for next Sunday.    Incidentally, according to an INTERFAX report, Plyushch  himself has already become a deputy, having collected over 60  percent of the votes in his district. Rukh leader Vyacheslav  Chornovil had the same lead. Among the candidates [former  Ukrainian Premier] Leonid Kuchma obtained the greatest number of  votes -- over 91 percent of those who voted (there was a  96-percent turnout in Novgorod-Severskiy district). I.  Yukhnovskiy, V. Pinzenik, S. Khmara, L. Tanyuk, and V. Lanovoy  became deputies at the first attempt. For their part, Acting  Prime Minister Yu. Zvyahilskyy, Supreme Council Deputy Chairman  V. Durdinets, and Socialist Party Head A. Moroz will continue  their fight in the second round.    According to Chornovil, none of the political forces will  win  the current elections -- the nonparty nomenklatura will make its  presence felt. "I am beginning to believe in the existence of  Kravchuk's legendary list," the Rukh leader said. "In  practically every district there are representatives of the  party in power: All the vice prime ministers, many ministers,  presidential representatives, and heads of local administrations  have been running in the elections, and even the democrats  `affiliated to power' are fighting the opposition democrats in  the districts."</p>

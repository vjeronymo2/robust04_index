With respect to the African economic integration, an  encouraging sign is that the number of the countries has  increased to 34 that have ratified the treaty on the  establishment of the African Economic Community, which was  signed by the African leaders in Abuja, new capital of Nigeria,  in June 1991. With the ratification by one more country, the  treaty will come into force.    Besides, progress has also been made in regional economic  integration in 1993 in the western, eastern and southern parts  of the continent. Treaties on the establishment of regional  common markets have been signed to facilitate the inter-regional  trade and economic development.    In order to promote the intra-Africa trade, the African  Development Bank (ADB) took the initiative in establishing the  "African Export-Import Bank" in Cairo, while the U.N.  secretary-general has proposed the establishment of a commodity  diversification fund for Africa.    Those efforts have obviously demonstrated the eagerness and  determination of Africans to overcome the economic crisis and  step up the economic development on the continent.    As regards the economic situation of Africa in 1993, many  countries have appeared to set on course to harvest the benefits  of peace. The U.N. Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)  estimated that the economic growth in Ethiopia might reach 9.3  percent, 5.3 percent in Mozambique and 7.1 percent in Uganda due  to the relative peace and stability in the countries.    However, the economic situation in Africa as a whole was  still marked by a meagre growth in 1993. According to an ECA  preliminary estimation, African economy grew by only 1.4 percent  in the year, representing an improvement over the 0.7 percent  growth of 1992. This is barely half of the regional population  growth rate.    Analysts pointed out, in addition to the deep-seated  problems  including lack of domestic resources, poor infrastructure and  domestic political deficiencies, there are three major factors  that are hindering the African economic growth.    First of all, it is the continuing civil conflicts and  political crises in several countries that restrained the  economic growth. For example, the economic growth in Zaire is  estimated to have dropped by 4 percent in 1993 following a more  severe decline of 12 percent in the previous year because of the  political unrest resulting from disputes over democratization  process in the country. Nigeria's economy may have only grown by  about 3.7 percent in 1993, far below the annual average of 6.2  percent in the 1988-1992 period due to political upheaval.    The natural disasters, especially the drought that struck  eastern and southern Africa in the year, are another factor that  has suppressed the economic growth. Due to the worst drought,  Zimbabwe's economy is estimated to grow by 1.4 percent in 1993  as compared with the 8.5 percent growth in 1992. Parts of  Ethiopia and Eritrea have also experienced crop failures because  of the drought.    The third factor is the unfavorable international economic  environment. The weak growth in major industrial countries led  to a sluggish demand for main African products. And the weak  demand in turn led to the continuing fall in prices of fuel and  non-fuel commodities. As result, Africa's export earnings are  estimated to have shrunk by about 2.7 percent to 72 billion U.S.  dollars in 1993, following a drop of 1.1 percent in 1992.    Besides, external debt has further deteriorated in 1993.  According to the ECA, the share of multi-lateral debt of Africa  in aggregated debt stock has risen to 24.2 percent in 1993  compared to 20.5 percent in 1992 and 19.5 percent in 1991. This  shows that Africa's external debt will be above 275.15 billion  U.S. dollars in 1993.    Meanwhile, external resources flowing to Africa are  declining. According to the latest estimation of the World Bank,  sub-Saharan Africa's share of total official development  assistance of the bank has fallen from 37.1 percent in 1990 to  36.3 percent in 1992. Net lending commitments by the World Bank  to sub-Saharan Africa fell a dramatic 30 percent or 1.2 billion  U.S. dollars in its last financial year. Non-project lending to  sub-Saharan Africa virtually halved in 1993 to 455 million U.S.  dollars from 895 million U.S. dollars the previous year.    IMF also reported a downturn in lending to Africa in its  latest financial year. The disbursements totalled some 525  million U.S. dollars in the year ending April 30, 1993 compared  with some one billion U.S. dollars for the previous year, a fall  of nearly 50 percent.    All those factors have added more difficulties to the lack  of  resources of African countries that need capital to develop  their economies.    With respect to the prospects for African economy in the new  year, it does not allow much optimism because all the factors  that have hindered the African economic performance in 1993 will  remain a constraint to the growth. Besides, with the loss of  some preferences conceded to Africa after the GATT Uruguay Round  agreement was signed and with the reduction of aid and resources  flowing to Africa from World Bank and other international  institutes, Africa will face more crises. In face of the  challenge, Africans have uttered stronger voice for  self-reliance and intra- Africa cooperation in developing the  continent's economy.</p>

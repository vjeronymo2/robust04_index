			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>   [Text] Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating is on his  way to Jakarta this afternoon with his eyes firmly set on what  he calls one of Australia's most important international  relationships. The focus on the interests the two countries  share in the Asia-Pacific means that the Indonesian media  crackdown is well down on the Keating agenda. Mr. Keating is  under pressure from some Australian lobby groups to take  Indonesia to task after Jakarta last week closed the country's  three leading weekly news magazines -- TEMPO, EDITOR, and DETIK.  But the prime minister says he'll be using his informal talk  with President Suharto tomorrow to discuss the APEC [Asia  Pacific Economic Cooperation] Asia-Pacific leaders' summit in  Jakarta in November. Mr. Keating told Graeme Dobell that the  Suharto government's closure of its three leading news magazines  was a backward step during a period of rapid change:    [Begin recording] [Keating] Indonesia is like many countries  in the region; it's in a state of constant change where there  are many imperatives starting to impact on the country: the  growth imperative and all that brings with it for change, and  diversity and plurality of opinion. I don't doubt that these  are pressures which haven't been as evident in bygone days as  they are now. For our part, Gareth Evans as foreign minister  has made clear Australia's disappointment about the fact that  these [word indistinct] have been changed. But again, from our  point of view, I mean there are the same, similar things --  there is press control in China and we're still doing trade with  China, there is a fairly tight control of the press in Malaysia  and we are still doing trade with Malaysia. I think, you know,  this relationship now has many links to it and it does give us  the opportunity, I think, to, you know, maintain a working  relationship despite some of these things which are  disappointments to us.    [Dobell] Does it symbolize [words indistinct] to put on the  brakes? Is it a step back from the policy of openness that  President Suharto has been talking about?    [Keating] Well, I think it may be that we will witness in  many countries similar to Indonesia -- such as Indonesia,  similar to Indonesia -- that there'll be, you know, (?full) four  steps forward and one back and four forward and one back and  then I think we'll see a bit of this. But, there's also strong  public opinion -- reactions -- about this, where there is any  crimp on information, wherever it occurs in most places, and I  understand this to be the case in Indonesia as well.    [Dobell] One of the comments from Jakarta has been from the  head of Indonesia's largest Muslim organization, Abdulraham  Wahid, who said that he thought you, as a friend, should speak  to the president on this. Do you have a duty perhaps as a  friend to speak to Suharto on this?    [Keating] Australia is not the international news and media  plurality policeman. Now, there is a sort of view around that  because we have a very free press we ought to be arguing for a  press similar to ours wherever we go. Well, we are an open and  plural country and that's part of our strength, and we're also  very forthright. But, you know, I mean I could make my next  visit to China. The first item on the agenda I'll put press  freedom and plurality. We [words indistinct] first agenda item  no one should choose. [End recording]</p>

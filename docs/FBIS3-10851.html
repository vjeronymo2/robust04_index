During a news conference, Kim  Pok-sin said the DPRK is an independent country and as such he  sees no obstacle in establishing ties with other independent  countries.    The DPRK delegation is scheduled to meet with political  party  leaders and the vice president. The delegation also plans to  meet with President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. Government sources  questioned have stated, however, that this meeting is "uncalled  for" because Paraguay and DPRK have no diplomatic ties.    This is the first DPRK delegation to visit Paraguay. It is  an unofficial visit. The delegation is visiting in response to  an invitation extended by the Febrerista Revolutionary Party  (PRF).    During a news conference at the international airport, Kim  Pon-sin said this visit follows his country's wish to strengthen  ties with Paraguay.    Asked if the ideological and territorial differences with  South Korea will obstruct an eventual establishment of  diplomatic ties, Kim Pok-sin said: "We are an independent  country and we are aware of the patriotism of Paraguayans. We  also know that Paraguay is an independent country. I do not  believe there will be many problems."    PRF President Victor Hugo Sanchez stated that the visit of  the DPRK vice premier "may be the start of auspicious bilateral  ties."    Kim Pok-sin is scheduled to meet Vice President Angel  Roberto  Seifart tomorrow at 1000. At night the PRF board will host a  reception in honor of the DPRK delegation at the party  headquarters.    On 12 March, the delegation will visit the Itaipu dam which,  Kim Pok-sin said is of particular interest to them because the  DPRK builds hydroelectric dams. It has been reported that the  delegation is scheduled to meet party presidents next week.</p>

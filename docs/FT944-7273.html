			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television The weekend starts here. Children in Need occupies BBC1 from after the nine o'clock news until tomorrow morning, combining a good cause with entertainment - well, Lulu, Gary Glitter and Lily Savage. Or turn to that station one corner of which is forever America. Channel 4, you remember, was founded as the egghead's station (and to prove it The Word is back tonight, folks). Friday's ration of sitcom starts with Blossom (6pm) and includes Ellen, Cheers and Roseanne (10pm). Roseanne is a cult figure mainly, one suspects, because viewers can read anything they like into that immobile face, monotone voice and inexpressive body. The Trial, BBC 2's fly-on-the-courtroom-wall series (9pm) comes up with more light entertainment, which sums up both the strengths and failings of the idea. As an unsuccessful barrister, WS Gilbert was assaulted by an irate client who hurled her wooden leg across the court at him. Nothing tonight quite reaches that level, but it makes unexpectedly funny television.</p>

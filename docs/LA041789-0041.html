			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MOZART CAMERATA COMPLETES SEASON AT SANTA ANA HIGH  </P> <P> Music lovers who search for ensembles possessing a string sound of warmth and  clarity and demonstrating admirable nuance ought to put the Mozart Camerata on  a list of favorite groups.  </P> <P> At least this is the conclusion of one listener, after the chamber orchestra's  Saturday performance.  </P> <P> Opening the program with the Sinfonia in G, Opus 3, No. 6, by J. C. Bach,  conductor Ami Porat revealed why the Santa Ana High School Auditorium is his  venue of choice: The hall's bright, resonant-yet-warm acoustics are perfectly  matched to the group's full-blooded sound.  </P> <P> No thin, wiry string ensemble this, but the maker of a sound that dispels the  notion of a chamber orchestra as merely a small orchestra without enough  players.  </P> <P> Cellist Nathaniel Rosen would appear to be a soloist suited to this orchestra  like hand in glove, capable of seemingly endless nuances of phrasing and  bowing. His collaboration in Francois Couperin's "Pieces en Concert" proved a  minor revelation. So temperamentally matched were leader and soloist that Porat  not so much accompanied Rosen as simply welcomed him to the gathering.  </P> <P> The opening movement of Luigi Boccherini's cello concerto in B-flat  demonstrated that some human elements were in play, after all. Using the  19th-Century edition of Friedrich Grutzmacher (including that editor's  cadenza), allowed Rosen to adopt a Romantic approach perfectly suited to his  strengths, but at odds with Porat's Classical bent. At the beginning, Rosen  consistently forged a hair ahead, at the ends of runs particularly. Porat  maintained a cool head and firm hand, however. The prayer-like slow movement  and vivacious finale had the principals back in concert, literally.  </P> <P> Mozart's Symphony No. 33 gave Porat ample opportunity to demonstrate his  special gifts for the podium. He is a conductor who knows how to escape the  tyranny of beat patterns for the only justifiable reason: to give the music its  own voice.  </P> <P> Porat's encore arrangement of the Intermezzo from Pietro Mascagni's "Cavalleria  Rusticana" showed that he and his group are no strangers to the late Romantic  style, though one wished for stronger bass-playing.  </P></p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Arts (Openings): Amsterdam A major retrospective of the late 19th century French painter Odilon Redon opens at the Van Gogh Museum on Friday. It brings together 180 works, including some important pieces which have only recently come to light. The aim is to explore Redon's development, sources and influence, and to demonstrate how the dreamlike nature and Symbolist aspects of his work provided a link between 19th century Romanticism and 20th century Surrealism. The exhibition comes from Chicago and moves to the Royal Academy in London in February.</p>

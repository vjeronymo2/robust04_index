Although the primary cause of the plane  crash is not definitely clear yet and the state authorities are  waiting for the investigation results from the dispatched group,  agency reports and statements by local authorities indicate that  it is likely that the plane crashed after being hit by a rocket.    According to a Central News Unit report, official Azeri  authorities say that the Iranian C-130 was downed by Armenian  anti-aircraft artillery positioned in the Khankendi area, which  is a disputed area in Karabakh. Nevertheless, those reports  have been rejected by Armenian authorities.    Our correspondent has been informed by an aviation expert  that the Iranian captain had established contact with the  Yerevan airport, but the contact was unsuccessful. The captain  had also made contact with a Russian aircraft flying in the  vicinity in order to coordinate with the airport with his  assistance. The aviation experts believe it is unlikely that  the C-130 plane crashed as a result of a technical fault.</p>

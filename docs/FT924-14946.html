			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / MMI to resume payment of claims MUNICIPAL MUTUAL Insurance, which that ceased underwriting new business last week, is to resume payment of claims, the group announced yesterday. The insurance company imposed a seven-day moratorium on claims when it closed for new business last Wednesday. Mr Brian Wright, chief executive, said the decision had allowed MMI to 'take stock of the situation' after the breakdown of efforts to sell the group to the Paris-based La Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires. MMI, which insures nine out of 10 local authorities, has been hit by rising claims on its liability business. It recorded losses of more than Pounds 250m last year and has been seeking to transfer its council, personal, health, life and pensions business to another company since May. Mr Wright said: 'It is now clear that a number of parties are interested in purchasing various parts of the group.' MMI is also in discussions with councils and the Department of Trade and Industry, which regulates the UK insurance industry. 'What MMI now needs is a settled period in which we can take these discussions forward,' Mr Wright said. 'We will make further announcements when appropriate.' General Accident, the Perth-based insurer, agreed in principle last week to acquire a block of 216,000 MMI insurance policies - about a fifth of MMI's total portfolio of individual policies. These were sold by the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society to its mortgage lenders. Local authority associations yesterday cautiously welcomed the MMI announcement.</p>

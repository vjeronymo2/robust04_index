			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: KIO sells stake in Midland THE KUWAIT Investment Office (KIO) successfully unloaded the bulk of its 10.5 per cent stake in Midland Bank on Thursday, making 355p per share. Marketmakers said securities house Hoare Govett had been trying to place the 60m shares at 362p since Tuesday, after Hongkong and Shanghai Bank launched its agreed bid for Midland, but eventually placed them with a wide range of institutions at 356p. It is believed that the majority of the deals had been pre-booked by Wednesday night. It is also believed that because of the risk involved in placing such a large amount of stock the shares were not taken on as part of a 'bought deal' where prices are pre-arranged. Dealers said they were put through the market on a 'best offer' basis with Hoare guaranteeing to get the best possible price. Midland shares eased 2 to 362p, compared with the HSBC offer of around 385p per share. Analyst said that although the market was not too enthusiastic about the bid it could see no obvious alternative apart from Midland remaining independent. Lloyds Bank slipped 9 to 393p, suggesting it may continue to hanker after Midland, as analysts tended to play down press speculation that Lloyds could be looking at another bid for Standard Chartered. The price of Standard - down 5 to 468p - did not point towards a bid, but Abbey National, also mentioned as a possible Lloyds target rose 5 to 311p. Reuters development Information group Reuters rose after it announced that the second phase of its Dealing 2000 share dealing system would start on April 29. As part of the development, traders from around 20 banks in London and New York are expected to be allowed to trade leading currency contracts - with Reuters reportedly taking a Dollars 25-a-trade commission. Dealing 2000-2 is also said to be weighing in around a year ahead of its nearest rivals - by which time it plans to expand, first to Europe and then to the Far East. However, while most analysts agree that the development will help the stock outperform in the long-term, some are more cautious short-term. Ms Lisa Gordon at County NatWest said: 'Reuters was seen as a good hedge in the volatile period before the election and was run up a little on that. At this price, while we like the stock, we are on a short-term hold.' The shares added 28 to 1160p. Glaxo suffers US switching from defensive stocks into shares which are expected to benefit from a cyclical recovery hit Glaxo, whose shares are 27 per cent owned by US investors in the form of American Depositary Receipts. Dealers said the switching started on Wednesday with sellers concentrating on Merck, the US drugs giant. Glaxo, whose performance in the US tends to mirror Merck's, also weakened. In London, on Thursday, the shares slipped 24 to 788p with a brisk 4m traded. Tate &amp; Lyle gained 16 to 421p as the shares caught up after underperforming the market by about 12 per cent over the last three months. Mr Carl Short, food manufacturing analyst at Nomura, said the company is likely to show a downturn in earnings for the year ending in September, but is expected to bounce back. A sober trading assessment for BP by chairman Robert Horton revealed little new for analysts to chew over at the group's agm on Thursday. Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull said that he believed the 'realistic' summation pointed to the group preparing the ground for a dividend cut later this year. BP shares rose 2 to 259p. While residents may be in short supply, investors were visiting the hotel sector in great numbers following Forte's results on Wednesday. Some analysts believe the stock to be overpriced, Mr Paul Slattery at Kleinworts said: 'It will take the company at least two years to get back to the level of earnings of last year. Investors should reduce their exposure.' But Forte remains popular with institutions, with 8m shares traded and the price unmoved at 254p. Queens Moat Houses also attracted attention, the shares slipping 2 to 79p in hefty volume of 4.9m. Theme park operator Euro Disney's fall from grace continued, the shares sliding 28 to 1335p as the site's lacklustre opening reflected badly. Granada Group added 7 to 277p. The group has been seeing analysts prior to moving into its closed period and has been making bullish noises. While some UK institutions continued to bail out of Vodafone - Thursday's 15m share turnover followed the previous session's 22m - US investors were happy to pick up the stock. The price was unchanged at 356p. Drugs group Fisons rose 15 to 384p in good volume of 4.7m. One analyst said that the rise was largely attributable to continued bid speculation and also anticipation of a favourable visit to the group's Holmes Chapel facility next week by the US Food and Drug Administration. Profit taking in Rolls-Royce left the shares a penny easier at 168p, on turnover of 8m shares. It was suggested that BZW were the day's main sellers. Profit-taking in GKN was also responsible for reversing an earlier rise in the shares which ended 10 down at 380p. Overseas buying of British Steel left the shares 5 up at 75p. Bid talk was again heard around Dowty Group, where the shares gained to 6 to 229p. A maintained dividend, despite a fall in full-year profits, helped Hunting rise 8 to 176p. News of a Pounds 15m contract from the German Ministry of Defence helped Howden Group firm 2 to 61p. Bid Talk combined with a squeeze sent Glynwed International climbing another 10 to 273p. Bargain hunters helped Eurotunnel reverse recent falls to end 6 up at 376p. Building materials group Redland continued to shine, basking in the aftermath of its Steetley deal and benefiting from its international exposure, the prognosis for the UK building industry still uncertain. The shares added 10 to 548p in turnover of 3.3m. RMC also attracted attention, the shares rising 15 to 645p. Surprising strength in Tarmac after its poor results on Wednesday saw the shares put on 7 to 146p in very heavy volume of 12m. Traders said that renewed bid rumours were underpinning the turnover, although no new names had entered the frame. Discount food retailer Kwik Save continued to benefit from bid rumours involving Hong Kong-based Dairy Farm, which holds 25 per cent of the equity, rising 15 to 588p and gaining 32p on the week. Guinness fell 4 1/2 to 571 1/2 p on concern about lower cognac sales in the Far East and an approaching conversion of debenture and loan stock into ordinary shares. Rumours that Hanson is about to sell its 2.8 per cent stake in ICI, thus strengthening its war chest for its long-awaited bid, was not taken seriously in the market. ICI's fall of 2 to 1345p was attributed more to general weakness in the market. Hanson eased a halfpenny to 235p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (303).

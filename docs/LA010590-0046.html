			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: WIFE TIRED OF PLAYING ROLE  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I have what might seem to be a happy marriage, but I'm on  the verge of going on strike against constantly having to make all the  decisions about where to dine, when or where to go on holiday or do anything.  My husband refuses to take any responsibility. He does go to work, but so do I.  Therefore, why can't it be more equal? I'm tired and I'm angry. I don't like  the role of constant caretaker. -- S.I.H.  </P> <P> DEAR S.I.H.: When one spouse changes, so will the other; it follows as night  the day. You sound as if you're stuck in a frustrating pattern, but it doesn't  have to go on that way and you don't have to get a divorce to find peace. In  fact, that would probably make you both unhappy.  </P> <P> Spouses who find themselves stuck in the role of caretaker have a lot of power  and may have ambivalent feelings about losing this control. Usually, it's the  woman who's the caretaker because women have been taught from childhood about  her so-called nurturing role in life. She gets used to meeting the emotional  needs of others and she frequently puts her husband's needs above her own.  </P> <P> Then eventually, of course, the day comes when she rebels as you are doing now.  I'm sure you feel cheated because of your demanding role and would like to have  some nurturing yourself. You feel emotionally deprived. Explain all this to  your spouse, then stop making all the decisions and stop doing all the tasks.  Make a list of what you'll do and what he must do. Place it in a prominent  place. And then wait and see what happens.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I have two old and cherished friendships with women and I'm  wondering what's going to happen to these when I get married. My bride-to-be  doesn't seem the jealous type, but my buddies tell me disastrous tales of  what's happened in their marriages when they attempted to hold on to  friendships like mine. Must I give up these old friends just because I'm  married? -- J.F.  </P> <P> DEAR J.F.: This is the perfect time to question this, because you have an  opportunity to explore your fiancee's views on this before you walk down the  aisle. Marriages are based on mutual trust, and in a good marriage, both  spouses should be able to maintain friendships with members of the opposite  sex. It isn't always easy, however, and much depends upon whether or not the  husband or wife has a jealous nature.  </P> <P> Many spouses and lovers feel threatened by their loved one's friendships with  the opposite sex. The best way to prevent problems is to be as honest as  possible about these old friendships and to try to include the spouse once in a  while. If you can include your mate in activities with old friends, she'll feel  less excluded and she'll be better able to understand that this is a deep  friendship and nothing more.  </P></p>

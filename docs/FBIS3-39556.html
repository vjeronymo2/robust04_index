			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Feb 16 (AFP) -- European Community steel  industry grouping Eurofer said Wednesday afternoon [16 February]  that it might appeal to the European Court of Justice against  the EC Commission's decision to fine steel companies for cartel  activity.    It said the companies involved were studying the decision,  and would indicate their reaction.    Eurofer did not officially react to a statement by Van Miert  that the organization had set up a working group to coordinate  the activities of the alleged cartel.    In London, British steel, which was hit with the biggest  fine  among the 16 EC steelmakers fined a total of ECU104 million (115  million dollars) by the Commission, said it would probably  appeal to the European Court of Justice, but was waiting to  receive official notification.    Keith Brookman, general secretary of the Iron and Steel  Trades Confederation, the main British union in the sector, said  he was "shocked and horrified" by the decision. The union  totally supports British Steel on the matter and wants the  government to intervene to protect British interests, he said.    The British company was fined ECU32 million (35.2 million  dollars).    In Duesseldorf, Germany, the German Steel Federation said  Wednesday afternoon that its members that were fined would  probably appeal against the decision to the European Court of  Justice.    Federation president Ruprecht Vondran said "The German steel  firms aren't going to accept these decisions without responding."    Separately, German industrial group Preussag AG in Hannover  said it would oppose the EC decision "by all available means."    It said in a press communique that "We cannot understand"  why  the fine was slapped on Preussag, "since Preussag has not taken  part in a pricing or quantities cartel. As far as we know,  there has never been such a cartel" in the EC steel industry.</p>

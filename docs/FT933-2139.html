			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / US may end backing foranti-drug drive in Peru THE US administration has warned the Peruvian government that it may have to end support for anti-narcotics efforts in Peru's main coca-growing zone, US officials said in Washington yesterday. However, contrary to indications from Lima last week, agents of the US Drugs Enforcement Administration remain conducting coca eradication at the Santa Luca base in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, the officials said. Uncertainty over US anti-narcotics efforts in Latin America has been intensified by a Dollars 47m (Pounds 30.5m) cut by the US Senate appropriations committee in the Dollars 147m budget of the State Department unit running drugs interdiction in Latin America. The cut will take effect with the start of the new fiscal year next month, if it is confirmed by a joint committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The US also supports air operations in Bolivia, Guatemala, Colombia and Belize from this budget, as well as a sizeable number of other programmes. The reduction comes as the the US administration is reviewing its anti-narcotics policy after serious questions as to the benefits of the US drugs effort abroad. US government officials said the review, which should be completed by the end of this month, has led to sharp divisions between US government departments connected with the efforts. A classified National Security Council document, which forms part of the review, concluded, according to the Washington Post, that the Pentagon's Dollars 1.1bn drugs interdiction budget - much of it spent in central America and the Caribbean - has proved largely ineffective in stopping cocaine reaching consumers in the US. Peru is the largest cultivator of coca in the world, producing two-thirds of this leaf which is raw material for cocaine. The State Department estimates that some 129,100 hectares are under cultivation, over half of these being in the Huallaga Valley north-east of Lima. Official Peruvian policy is aimed at containing the growth of coca production and increasingly emphasises alternative development for farmers, which includes crop substitution. However, the remoteness of the coca-growing areas and the lack of roads militate against such solutions.</p>

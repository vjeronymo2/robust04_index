			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WATCH : PRODUCER HOGS ADS, INVESTORS NIP AT HEELS; INTERIM LOTS LIGHTEN  LATC PARKING WOES  </P> <P> At the top of the ad for "The Living Room," which continues at the Wilshire  Ebell through Sunday, is a large picture of Shelly Garrett. Then the copy  begins: "Shelly Garrett's Living Room. It's . . . Shelly Garrett's new  comedy-drama stage play. If you saw Shelly Garrett's 'Beauty Shop,' hey! Wait .  . . wait until you step into his living room!"  </P> <P> Would you assume from this that Garrett wrote "The Living Room" -- or that he's  in it, or even that it's about him?  </P> <P> Wrong on all counts. Charles Michael Moore wrote the play that is now called  "The Living Room." It was initially produced with the title "Love's Light in  Flight," in Chicago and two smaller cities. Another producer brought the play  to Los Angeles last year and changed the title -- with Moore's permission. Only  after the Los Angeles production was underway did Garrett take over as  producer, said Moore, talking by telephone from Chicago.  </P> <P> "I'm not crazy about the fact that my bio is not in the program," said Moore.  But he said he had a good business deal with Garrett, and "as long as the  business end is taken care of, I don't have an ego problem (with the  downplaying of his own credit)." Moore added that he has been paid for working  as assistant director on the show, and he expects to receive an author's  percentage (he wouldn't reveal the size of his cut), "but I won't see any real  money until it starts recouping its investment."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, investors in another Garrett production, the touring "Beauty Shop,"  have replaced Garrett as general partner in the enterprise, according to an  attorney representing the limited partners.  </P> <P> The limited partners contend they have not received an accounting of their  investment -- and most of them maintain they have not received any return from  it. Last year five of them filed a suit against Garrett in Los Angeles Superior  Court, and seven others have since joined the lawsuit.  </P> <P> According to attorney Gene Harter, 31 of the 40 limited partners met Monday and  voted to replace Garrett with Sylvia White (who performed in "Beauty Shop" in  1987-88 and became a limited partner in 1988) as general partner. Harter said  the vote was unanimous, except for abstentions from Garrett's parents. The  re-organized partnership will now attempt to gain access to the production's  bank accounts.  </P> <P> Neither Garrett nor his attorney could be reached for comment. But White said  the limited partners had received letters from Garrett last month, announcing  that he was dissolving the partnership.  </P> <P> LATC PARKING: Parking at Los Angeles Theatre Center last weekend was an ordeal.  Two weeks ago, the lot in back of the theater was closed, as construction began  on a new parking garage that won't open until next fall. The loss became quite  apparent over the weekend, as all four theaters in the complex were lit up for  the first time since the lot was closed. Cars backed up in front of the theater  even more than usual, and curtain times were delayed.  </P> <P> But "the problem will resolve itself this weekend," said LATC'S Bill Bushnell,  as two additional lots on the east side of Spring St. between 4th and 5th, one  block north of the theater, open for LATC business. A security guard who  formerly was posted at the back of the theater will now be stationed at 5th and  Spring to assist pedestrians walking from the new lots. Bushnell also pointed  out that a little-known lot is also open across Spring St. from the theater, at  the Alexandria Hotel.  </P> <P> On another LATC matter, Bushnell and managing director Robert Lear said they  welcome the city council's requirement that the Community Redevelopment Agency  reports within 90 days on plans for the next five years of LATC-related  spending. The proviso was added as an amendment to the council's approval on  Friday of $350,000 in CRA money for LATC. Bushnell and Lear said the five-year  plan is something that they would have to do anyway.  </P> <P> SCR PLAYWRIGHTS: Mark Lee of Los Angeles is the winner of South Coast  Repertory's second California Playwrights Competition. His winning entry:  "Pirates," a fantasy drama about two women -- a repressed academician and a  feminist graduate student -- who draw inspiration from swashbuckling female  pirates in their clash with male faculty. Lee, whose "Rebel Armies Deep Into  Chad" opens at the Old Globe in San Diego March 3, won $5000.  </P> <P> Runners up -- receiving $2500 apiece -- are Shem Bitterman for "The Ramp" and  Robert Daseler for "An Office Romance." All three plays will be presented as  either productions or readings at the California Play Festival in May. About  300 plays were submitted to the competition.  </P> <P> AT PCPA: A translation of Ibsen's "Ghosts" by Jerry Turner, artistic director  of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Ore., is the most noteworthy  item in the repertory of the upcoming Theatrefest at Pacific Conservatory of  the Performing Arts, in Santa Maria and Solvang.  </P> <P> Turner's translation was introduced at Ashland in 1988. Also on the PCPA  season: "Little Shop of Horrors," "A Chorus Line," "Much Ado About Nothing,"  "Guys and Dolls" and "The Importance of Being Earnest."  </P> <P> The season begins previews on June 14 and extends until Sept. 23.  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO REP: A new Amiri Baraka play, "The Life and Life of Bumpy Johnson,"  is the highlight of the San Diego Repertory Theatre's recently announced fifth  season. Featuring an original score by Max Roach, "Bumpy Johnson" is the tale  of a gangster who helped fund the Harlem Renaissance. It will open in December.  </P> <P> Also coming up at the Rep, beginning in June: Latins Anonymous, Ariel Dorfman's  "Widows" (which will first be seen at the Mark Taper Forum, opening May 31),  Lanford Wilson's "Burn This," Joe Orton's "Loot," Tennessee Williams' "A Lovely  Sunday in Creve Coeur," Shakespeare's "Cymbeline" and "A Christmas Carol."  </P></p>

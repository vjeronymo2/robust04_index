Liu Huaqui is on an official visit  to Caracas and will travel to Santiago de Chile tomorrow.    Our country advocates an independent peace policy as a basis  for its foreign policy, the ranking diplomat of the People's  Republic of China stated, reiterating that these objectives will  be strengthened in its ties with Venezuela.    Relations between Beijing and Caracas will be boosted soon  with "high-level visits" and increased bilateral economic  cooperation.    After meeting with Roy Chaderton, his Venezuelan  counterpart,  and establishing the political Chinese-Venezuelan consultation  mechanisms, Liu plans to meet with President Rafael Caldera and  Foreign Minister Miguel Burelli Rivas. He will also preside  over the installation of a binational trade commission.    Trade between the two countries was close to $100 million in  1993; the main products traded were iron, chemicals, textiles,  and home electrical appliances, according to figures from the  Chinese Embassy in Caracas. According to the same source,  China increased its imports from Venezuela by 200 percent last  year.</p>

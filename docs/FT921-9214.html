			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Scitex shrugs off difficulties with 31% improvement SCITEX, the Israeli maker of electronic pre-press systems, yesterday reported a 31 per cent increase in net profits in 1991 to Dollars 100.6m, dodging both the worst effects of recession in the US and Europe, its main markets, and the collapse of the Robert Maxwell empire with which it was associated. The profit rise was much less spectacular than the more than 100 per cent increase of the two previous years, but Scitex executives were far from disappointed, given the circumstances. Mr Maxwell was chairman and controlled 15 per cent of Scitex until little more than a month before his death when he sold out. It subsequently emerged the shares were owned by Maxwell pension funds, not the private Robert Maxwell Group as previously thought, but proceeds from the sale worth Pounds 107m (Dollars 192.6m) had gone to the Robert Maxwell Group instead of the pension funds. 'He never had much impact on the running of our business, even as chairman,' Mr Giora Bitan, Scitex's chief financial officer, said yesterday. 'But to have had a substantial portion of our shares in the hands of the Maxwell receivers is not something we would have liked.' Mr Bitan said the quick productive returns Scitex equipment offered printers and publishers had bolstered demand, despite the recession. Sales and service revenue rose 22 per cent from Dollars 351.5m in 1990 to Dollars 430.2m in 1991. He said the outlook for 1992 was 'not easy, and said the company was increasingly targetting the growing 'mid-range' market where small print houses were switching from black and white to colour reproduction. Mr Bitan said this sector was aimed to grow from about 5 per cent of sales last year to 15 per cent in 1993. Scitex costs moved up last year to Dollars 165m from Dollars 135m in 1990. Net R&amp;D expenses were Dollars 26.9m, compared with Dollars 22m. Earning per share were Dollars 2.70 with a total dividend for the year of Dollars 0.40 per share.</p>

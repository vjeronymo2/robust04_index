			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Efforts to speed bill payment 'hindered' MINISTERS' attempts to persuade public-sector organisations to set an example to industry by paying their bills on time are being undermined by some government departments, according to an industry group. A survey of 129 companies supplying heating, ventilation and air-conditioning equipment published yesterday shows that public-sector bodies remain among the slowest payers. The building management and construction arms of the publicly owned Property Services Agency (PSA) had the worst record for payments, according to the survey by the Heating and Ventilating Contractors' Association. The PSA construction division has since been sold to Tarmac, the large construction and building materials group, while the building management arm is still up for sale. Companies were asked at the start of this year how long on average it took for organisations, such as the PSA, to pay bills after the contractors had submitted claims. PSA management took on average 93 days while PSA projects, the construction division, took 91 days on average. Other government organisations also performed poorly, the study says. On average government bodies took 27 days between receiving a claim and making payment. The association said that its members working on private-sector contracts would normally expect to be paid within 24 days of submitting a claim. The survey showed that local authorities on average took 65 days to settle their bills, while privatised utilities such as British Gas and the water companies were among the best payers, settling after an average of 26 days.</p>

Considering that the  Togolese opposition has always been the first to cry thief and  assassin as soon as it has done something condemnable, the RPT  would like to make the following clarification:    1. We have concrete proof which confirms 24 constituencies  for the second round of the legislative elections were put at  the disposal of the CAR militiamen.    2. The traditional chiefs of the southern region of the  country, concerned with the need to make peace and harmony  prevail among ethnic groups in their territories and surprised  to see these militiamen propagating tribal hatred, drew the  government's attention to the situation.    3. The RPT leaders were informed about the situation by  their  activists and the people with great precision.    4. In order to avoid frigtening the people and inciting the  anger of the grassroots activists, the RPT leaders preferred to  manage this situation by ensuring government authorities in  charge of the security of men and goods would secure the  implementation of the laws in force.    The RPT considers the CAR communique a serious accusation  and  a provocation based on misinformation. The RPT would like to  warn the CAR leaders that fraud, cheating, intimidation,  threats, violence, and sabotage with which they hindered the  presidential elections and the first round of the legislative  elections will not go unnoticed.    7. [as heard] The RPT, attached to the ideals of peace,  serenity, brotherhood, solidarity, and harmonious cohabitation  among all ethnic groups, will do all in its power for  brotherhood, national unity, territorial integrity, and improved  condition of citizens to prevail.    Finally, the RPT would like to reassure the people concerned  by the 20 February legislative elections that no one can prevent  them from enjoying their civic rights without facing the full  rigors of the laws in force.    For the RPT, the national chairman of the campaign  committee,    Signed, Ayite Gachin Mivedor.</p>

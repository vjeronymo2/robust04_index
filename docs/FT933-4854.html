			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / People: Radcliffe promoted at Hogg Robinson David Radcliffe yesterday joined the board of Hogg Robinson, the business travel, financial services and transport group. Radcliffe, 40, has worked his way up through the group; he joined in 1978 and now also becomes managing director of Hogg Robinson Business International. Radcliffe, who was born in Hackney, east London, began his travel management career with the Automobile Association at the age of 23; his first job was to set up an AA travel agency in Norwich. Brian Perry, the chairman, says Radcliffe's appointment underlines the importance the group attaches to business travel; having sold its retail travel chain to Airtours last June, Radcliffe says he is looking for possible acquisition targets both inside and outside the UK.</p>

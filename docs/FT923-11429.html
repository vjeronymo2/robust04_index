			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Mr Greenspan explains it all THE FEDERAL Reserve chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, got a sulky hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday; the senators want to make political capital out of a sluggish US economy, and although they would like to pin the main blame on the administration, the Fed can expect no applause. It deserves some, all the same. Mr Greenspan's painstaking explanations of the problems of excessive debt are not new, but they do help to explain the obstinacy of the recession. The British government, for one, might be in much less trouble now if it had heard a similar early warning; but by the time the nature of the problem was understood here, the more obvious solutions had been complicated by entry to the ERM. In the US, the Fed has been able to respond to the debt crisis with 23 easing actions, which helped to restore banks' profitability as well as offering large relief to mortgage debtors. 'The discount rate has been cut to 3 per cent - a 29-year low,' as Mr Greenspan pointed out. Despite these actions - cautiously progressive, but large in their total impact - the recovery remains shaky, and employment is especially weak. This has led some analysts close to despair; the Fed response is more measured, a matter of disappointment without much surprise, and quite optimistic about the outlook. The Fed still forecasts US economic growth next year at up to 2 1/2 per cent, well ahead of gloomy Wall Street revisionism. The chairman put the core problem in one familiar phrase: 'Banks still have significant reluctance to lend.' This prudential squeeze, which the Fed identified as a major problem right from the start of the recession, bears almost entirely on the small company sector, since all but the shakiest large corporations can profitably bypass the banks and fund themselves in the markets. For some years now, US employment growth has depended entirely on small companies; indeed, large corporations, in the US as in the UK, are still actively planning to shed more labour. Sluggish lending to small companies thus undermines employment, and with it consumer confidence. It also stifles personal income growth: in the context of long-stagnant US real wages, income growth depends entirely on rising employment. The picture of fast-falling employment in the adjusted June figures was almost certainly a statistical oddity, but the other available evidence suggests a sideways drift at best, and possibly something a little worse. Is there a quick fix? Senators agitate for still more interest rate cuts; so does an understandably worried Mr Bush. But such cuts, inevitably seen as transient, would hardly restore banking confidence. The Fed advocates patience - a debt work-out takes time. It also advocates experiments with further bank reliefs, but admits puzzlement: 'We are looking at a phenomenon that we have not seen in half a century.' From London, such clear-eyed humility looks enviable.</p>

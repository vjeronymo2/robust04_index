			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Japan's Eximbank in Greek loan THE state-owned Export-Import bank of Japan has guaranteed a Y8bn (Pounds 49m) private sector loan to modernise Greece's railways, in the latest part of a drive to calm strains over Japan's trade surplus, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. This is a fresh development in Japan's six-year-old strategy of recycling part of its capital surplus in development and aid. It is the first time the Export-Import bank has guaranteed a loan by private institutions, under the so-called 'funds for development' scheme, and the first time an EC state has benefited.</p>

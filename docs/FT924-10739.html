			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Technology: The clones march on - The latest round in the PC price battle The rapid rise of 'no-name' personal computer manufacturers, with neither reputation nor track record, has crystallised for most established manufacturers the chaotic nature of the computer business today. No-name manufacturers, mostly based in the Far East, make IBM PC clones. Their systems are based on powerful components easily available from a broad range of suppliers, but they are produced, in some cases, in garages and bedrooms. The products are basic but the prices are rock bottom in a market that is driven by price alone. Already no-name manufacturers have more than 40 per cent of the market, forcing larger and better-established makers to take defensive action. The critical question is how to identify a viable market segment and position both company and product to exploit it. Pentium, the latest chip from Intel, America's leading microprocessor maker, will make its debut next year, signalling yet another round in these debilitating PC price wars. Intel has given its new microprocessor a name rather than a number (it would be '586' if it followed strict sequence) to prevent competing makers passing off ersatz copies of its chip as the real thing. In the PC business, however, the important numbers are concerned with Intel's pricing policy. The slump in PC prices over the past 12 months is in large part due to the way Intel has cut the cost of the microprocessor at the heart of IBM-compatible PC systems. A year ago a 33 megahertz 386DX chip cost Dollars 202 in quantities of 1,000; today, the same chip costs Dollars 118 in the same volume. Last year a leading-edge 33 megahertz 486DX chip cost Dollars 445 in 1,000 part lots; today the price is Dollars 328. For some, the heat has already proved too great. Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel producer, last month decided to pull out of the notebook computer business in a reversal which underlines the savagery of the PC price war now raging across Europe. Seeking opportunities outside its traditional business, the Japanese company last year announced controversial plans to market notebooks under the name 'Librex' in Europe and the US. It was a move which illustrated how low barriers to the PC business have become. Nippon focused on notebooks because it was the fastest-growing market sector, and concentrated on the US and Europe because of the dominance of NEC in the Japanese PC business. Sales, however, have been poor - only 10,000 systems in just over a year. Announcing a 'phased withdrawal' timed to end early next year, Nippon blamed the depression, the downturn in the Japanese economy and the collapse in PC prices for unsustainable losses. Takashi Iwamoto, Nippon president, said the company had designed features into its systems for which the market was not prepared to pay: 'The sector of the market we wanted to enter disappeared,' he complained. Some companies are putting their faith in customer services not available from the clone manufacturers. Opus Technology, a privately owned UK company which turned over Pounds 31m in 1991, builds IBM compatible computers - but only to order. Its own research shows that of those customers who experienced problems with their suppliers, almost 80 per cent complained of a shortfall in service. Adam Harris, managing director, says Opus's strategy is aimed at guaranteeing customer satisfaction. He says the delay between receipt of an order and delivery of a machine has been cut from four weeks to 10 days. The company has a five-year licensing agreement with IBM giving Opus the legal right to build and ship computers using IBM patented technology. At the other end of the size spectrum, IBM is taking a blanket approach to the market. It is offering four ranges under its own name and a fourth, in Europe alone, under the trade name of Ambra. There is lively discussion among dealers and distributors over whether IBM has confused or enlightened the market through this strategy. At the top end it offers its PS/2 premium range as the system of choice for companies downsizing from mainframes to distributed and client server systems. Next there is the PS/Valuepoint range, designed to be competitive with lower-priced Compaq, Dell and Olivetti machines. At about the same price is the PS/1 range, aimed at the home and home office user. Priced at least 10 per cent lower than any of these systems is the Ambra range, marketed by a wholly-owned IBM subsidiary, Individual Computer Products International; sourced from a variety of locations worldwide, these machines compete directly with clones. Giuseppe Giuliani, Ambra's managing director, says the company has already shipped about 12,000 units since June to resellers in France and the UK and should ship 50,000 units to resellers by the end of the year. Giuliani is a realist, however, and accepts that nobody can predict how further price reductions will affect the market over the next few months. The important question is whether there are multiple segments in the European market or only a premium level and the rest. 'If IBM and Compaq come down to the third-tier price level in six months then we will disappear,' Giuliani says.  ------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN COMPUTER MARKET BREAKDOWN BY PRICE  ------------------------------------------------------- Docking stations Portables Desktops Client servers  ------------------------------------------------------- Tier 1  ------------------------------------------------------- HP NCR SNI Compaq Apple IBM  ------------------------------------------------------- Typical price Dollars 2,800  ------------------------------------------------------- Portables Desktops Client servers  ------------------------------------------------------- Tier 2  ------------------------------------------------------- Olivetti Dec Compaq AST Dell IBM  ------------------------------------------------------- Typical price Dollars 1,550  ------------------------------------------------------- Portables Desktops  ------------------------------------------------------- Home/individual  ------------------------------------------------------- Apple Classic Commodore Packard Bell IBM Acorn  ------------------------------------------------------- Typical price Dollars 1,450  ------------------------------------------------------- Tier 3  ------------------------------------------------------- Portables Desktops Client servers  ------------------------------------------------------- Packard Bell Olidata Vobis Ambra Amstrad  ------------------------------------------------------- Typical price Dollars 999  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

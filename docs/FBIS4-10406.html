			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Araya] </F>   [Text] San Jose, 7 Apr (AFP) -- According to several  government officials, following the signing of a free trade  agreement with Mexico in Mexico City on Tuesday, 5 April, Costa  Rica's priority is to become part of NAFTA before the rest of  Central America.    Officials in both governments said that after three years of  negotiations, Mexico and Costa Rica signed the "most advanced"  commercial treaty in Latin America. The treaty will go into  effect on 1 January, after it is ratified by both legislatures.    Costa Rican President-elect Jose Maria Figueres, a social  democrat who will assume office on 8 May, noted that trade  negotiations will be a priority for his administration in an  effort to put his country on the political map of nations  advancing toward regional integration.    The future president stressed the need to train experienced  negotiators so they can make the best of the difficult trade  negotiations ahead, particularly with a view to joining NAFTA,  formed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada on 1 January.    Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas, who has been  responsible for trade negotiations so far, said that the  agreement with Mexico puts Costa Rica in a "privileged" position  for its integration into NAFTA.    "We would have liked to have signed a similar agreement with  the rest of Central America, but that has been more difficult,"  the minister told a group of reporters. He added that before  such an agreement can be signed, "the right internal, economic,  and institutional conditions must exist, and Costa Rica found  them" in the negotiations with Mexico.    According to Rojas, it would take approximately 10 years to  join NAFTA if the negotiations were carried out in concert with  the other Central American nations, and he predicted that it  will take two years for Costa Rica to sign a free trade  agreement with the rest of Central America.    The treaty with Mexico gives Costa Rica access to a market  30  times larger than the Costa Rican market. Business associations  and government officials expect a significant boost in foreign  investment and commercial trade, which currently represents a  deficit for Costa Rica.    In 1993, Costa Rica exported approximately $60 million and  imported $150 million, mostly in oil purchases, from Mexico.    Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani said on Wednesday  that  it was "excellent" that Costa Rica had signed the agreement  because it can serve as an example for the other countries in  the region, which are currently in preliminary negotiations with  Mexico.    Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua form the  Central America 4 (CA-4) group, which must set a date in the  next few weeks for the next summit of heads of state to discuss  the continuation of trade talks with Mexico.    These countries agreed on the joint negotiation of a free  trade agreement with Mexico. Efforts in this direction have  also been made in Nicaragua, where authorities have expressed  their desire to sign the agreement this year.    The subject was included on President Violeta Chamorro's  agenda during her official visit to Mexico, which concluded on  Wednesday. Nicaragua maintains modest trade with Mexico and owes  that nation nearly $1 billion, half of which is for oil imports.</p>

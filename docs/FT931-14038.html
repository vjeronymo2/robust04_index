			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / The Clinton Inauguration: The new president and his team Bill Clinton promised to form a cabinet 'more like America' in its diversity: except for the preponderance of lawyers, he has probably succeeded. It contains many, like Mr Clinton himself, with minimal Washington experience, interspersed with capital veterans. Mr Clinton has set up the cabinet so that he runs it 'top down,' relying on the quality of ideas sent to him, but making many of the final decisions himself. He rejects the traditional notion that the secretaries of state, defence, treasury and justice outrank all others, and his cabinet is not designed to foster independent baronies. However, the Aspin-Woolsey security combination looks distinctive: so does the Vice-President Gore-Babbitt-Browner alliance on the environment, Panetta-Alice Rivlin on the budget and Lake-Sandy Berger at the National Security Council. Many important sub-cabinet level appointments have yet to be announced. The overriding first order of business is to come up with a domestic economy blueprint, to be wrapped into a State of the Union message by mid-March at the latest and include investment incentives, deficit reduction and healthcare reform. Even before then, a series of foreign policy exigencies will require attention. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 67: promised in his confirmation hearings to travel less than James Baker and to be in charge of the 'American desk' at the State Department, connecting domestic and foreign policy. Considered the quintessential lawyer-negotiator, without pronounced ideology. Believes US embassies should offer more help to US commercial interests. Strong on human rights. Thinks failure of Russian reforms could be catastrophic for democracy. Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen, 71: smooth as old bourbon but with some of its bite. Skilled legislator, especially on tax policy, his principal role will be to get Clinton's economic proposals through Congress. Thinks the greatest US problems are the budget deficit and under-savings. Does not rule out higher petrol taxes. Wants the Group of Seven industralised countries to get back to its roots and focus on economic growth policies, initially through frequent informal meetings. Attorney General Zoe Baird, 40: first-ever woman attorney general, one of the youngest and, at the outset, one of the least political. Corporate lawyer with no trial experience but rated one of the brightest of her generation. Inherits a troubled department with lots of outstanding controversial business (BNL, BCCI, Inslaw, Iraqgate, residues of the Iran-Contra affair). May have to excuse herself from involvement in some healthcare decisions because of business connections. Secretary of Defence Les Aspin, 54: dove-turned-semihawk and pungent defence expert. More interventionist than most recent defence secretaries, which could put him at odds with military top brass like General Colin Powell. Faces tough job in cutting defence budget by dollars 60bn while maintaining US technological edge. Has said US might have to intervene in Bosnia. Likely to form strong partnership with Jim Woolsey at the CIA. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, 54: an intellectual wild card in the pack, the former governor of Arizona only conforms to interior secretary type by coming from the west. With Vice-President Al Gore and Carol Browner at the Environmental Protection Agency, will be the chief 'green' in the cabinet and expected to reverse policies considered too friendly to natural-resource industries. Could pull surprises, however, as his career has often been politically unorthodox. White House Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty, 46: an Arkansas businessman who is an unknown commodity as White House chief of staff. His 40-year relationship with his president and his new role as gatekeeper make him a power. Unlikely to maintain a high Washington public profile. Said to be gracious and polite. Conflicting reports about his organisational skills. Will have to learn fast on the job.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The other main posts  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Secretary of Agriculture - Mike Espy Secretary of Commerce - Ron Brown Secretary of Education - Richard Riley Secretary of Energy - Hazel O'Leary Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency - Carol Browner Secretary of Health and Human Services - Donna Shalala Secretary of Housing and Urban Development - Henry Cisneros Secretary of Labour - Robert Reich Secretary of Transportation - Federico Pena Ambassador to the United Nations - Madeline Albright Secretary of Veterans Affairs - Jesse Brown Director of the Office of Management and Budget - Leon Panetta Director of the Central Intelligence Agency - James Woolsey National Security Advisor - Anthony Lake Trade Representative - Mickey Kantor  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

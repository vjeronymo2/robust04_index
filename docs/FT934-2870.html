			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Trade gap prompts fears of import surge A sharp rise in Britain's trade gap with the rest of the world has revived worries that imports might increase markedly as the domestic economy recovers. The difference between imports and exports of merchandise goods and oil  - the visible trade gap - came to Pounds 1.003bn in September, compared with Pounds 347m in August. Even though the low August deficit is regarded as a statistical 'blip', the relatively large gap in September suggests the recent narrowing this year in the difference between imports and exports could reverse. Imports were valued at Pounds 11.3bn in September, up 4 per cent on August, while exports came to Pounds 10.3bn, down 2 per cent on the previous month. According to the seasonally adjusted numbers from the Central Statistical Office, the trade gap for the first nine months of the year was Pounds 8.522bn, compared with Pounds 13.406bn for the whole of 1992. In last week's Budget statement the Treasury predicted a trade deficit of Pounds 11.5bn for the whole of this year, narrowing slightly to Pounds 11bn next year. The CSO said that taking into account the 'oddball' August deficit figure and other trends, the visible trade deficit 'continues to narrow slightly' compared with last year. In the third quarter the deficit was Pounds 2.390bn, after Pounds 3.056bn in the previous three months, and was the lowest quarterly number since early 1991. Excluding oil and erratic items such as aircraft, ships and gems, the gap between imports and exports for the third quarter was Pounds 3.583bn, after Pounds 4.311bn in the second quarter. In September, the deficit measured in this manner was Pounds 1.298bn, up from Pounds 761m in August. In the third quarter the trade gap for manufactured goods was Pounds 1,174bn, compared with Pounds 1,678bn in the second quarter. Although all trade figures this year have been affected by teething problems with a new European Union system of measuring imports and exports, the CSO said it was 'confident' the third quarter numbers were sound. On a volume basis, which adjusts for price movements, exports excluding oil and erratics, rose 2 per cent in the third quarter compared with the previous three months, while the same measure of import volumes was flat. In the year to the third quarter of this year, exports on a corresponding basis expanded 3.5 per cent, while import growth was just 0.5 per cent. The figures indicate that Britain's trade with other EU countries has been better than with nations in the rest of the world. In the third quarter exports to the rest of the EU were slightly higher than imports to the tune of Pounds 3m, while with countries outside the region, imports exceeded exports by Pounds 2.393bn. In the third quarter export volumes to the rest of the EU, excluding oil and erratics, rose 2.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter, while imports declined 1.5 per cent.</p>

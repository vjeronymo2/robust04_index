			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters asked for clarification of the meaning of ``multidisciplinary'' and ``professionals,'' and one suggested we use the word ``interdisciplinary'' instead of ``multidisciplinary.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, one commenter said that surveyors should be sent to the same facilities year after year so that they become more familiar with the facility and its staff. This would, the commenter suggested, enable the team to do a better job. Another commenter said that surveyors should be rotated among facilities to maintain their objectivity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are deleting the modifier, ``health,'' and clarifying the term, ``professionals,'' in &sect;488.314(a)(1) by setting forth examples. Examples of professionals include physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, physical, speech, or occupational therapists, physical or occupational therapy assistants, registered professional nurses, dieticians, licensed practical nurses, sanitarians, engineers, and social workers, but are not completely inclusive; the State, subject to HCFA's approval, determines what constitutes a ``professional.'' We are deleting the word ``health'' because it may be appropriate in some cases to include other types of professionals on a survey team. For example, if the facility has or may have structural problems or other physical plant facilities, an engineer may be needed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have chosen to continue to use the term ``multidisciplinary,'' rather than change it to ``interdisciplinary.'' Dictionary definitions of the prefixes ``multi-'' and ``inter-'' are very broad, with the former generally meaning ``more than one,'' and the latter generally meaning ``between or among.'' Therefore, we believe that ``multidisciplinary'' is the more appropriate choice. Furthermore, ``multidisciplinary'' is the term used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Different States have different licensure requirements and different staffing patterns. Also, it is difficult to recruit qualified professionals in certain areas of the country. Therefore, other than requiring that there at least be a registered nurse on the team, we do not believe dictating to the States in Federal regulations the precise composition of survey teams is necessary at this time. (The registered nurse member of the team is necessary because SNFs and NFs are primarily engaged in providing skilled nursing care and/or related services.) The most important considerations are that the surveys be conducted by professionals and that the survey guidelines be followed. All surveyors must pass HCFA's ``Surveyor Minimum Qualifications Test'' (SMQT), which is in itself, a test of several disciplines directly related to the survey of health care facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cogent cases can be made both for and against surveyor rotation, as is evidenced by the comments themselves. For this reason, we are considering this an administrative matter and leaving it to the discretion of the States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter thought that &sect;488.314(a)(2)(i) should be expanded to include surveyors who serve, or within the previous 2 years, have served as a member of the staff or as a consultant to the chain of which the facility is a part (if applicable). Another commenter said that we should also disqualify surveyors who work or who have worked in the previous 2 years as agency staff. The commenter said that, in many States, nurses who work for agencies and are sent to nursing homes for discrete periods of time are not always considered to be ``staff.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other suggestions were to revise &sect;488.314(a)(2)(ii) to disqualify surveyors who_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Own a part of any nursing home in the State; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Own a part of any nursing home in the United States; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Have a financial interest or any direct or indirect ownership interest in the facility to be surveyed, or in any related facility, company, or chain; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Fuller attacks duty increase Record operating profits at Fuller Smith &amp; Turner, the west London-based brewer, have not diminished the chairman's anger over Thursday's increase in beer duty. 'I am amazed that the Chancellor, having detailed at length in his original budget speech his awareness of the effects that personal imports are having on the British drinks industry, has nonetheless increased duty rates to satisfy political expediency,' said Mr Anthony Fuller yesterday. Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 1 increased from Pounds 3.76m to Pounds 4.15m. Sales grew from Pounds 41m to Pounds 42.8m, although volume beer sales were down 5 per cent. Operating profits improved from Pounds 4.37m to Pounds 4.55m. The latest figure was struck after a one-off redundancy charge of Pounds 162,000 following the reorganisation of the distribution fleet, and a Pounds 138,000 loss on Classic Ales, the beer wholesaler. Fuller sold its 75 per cent interest in Classic to Greenalls last week, and will realise an exceptional Pounds 500,000 profit in the current half. The increase at operating level was driven by the 94 managed houses, which increased profits by 18 per cent. Hotel and Country Table profits were 24 per cent higher, helped by a 10 per cent rise in occupancy. However, the 108 tenanted houses 'suffered badly' from the negative effect of imported beers and wines from Calais, Mr Fuller said. Volumes in the traditional free trade dropped 8 per cent, reflecting the dominance of national brewers in a tough market. Earnings per share increased from 10.62p to 11.66p, and the interim dividend is raised from 2.52p to 2.65p.</p>

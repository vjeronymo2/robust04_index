			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Revamped Wills back in the black THE HEAVILY reconstructed Wills Group, where CT Group, a distributor of high specification engineering equipment, is the core business, returned to the black in the six months to December 31. Taxable profits emerged at Pounds 154,000, struck on turnover of Pounds 7.27m, but because of the overhaul of the company's direction and financial position, last time's figures which showed losses of Pounds 568,000 on turnover of Pounds 8.37m are not strictly comparable. Since summer 1991, Wills has: been released from bank guarantees relating to the Hawkes trade finance businesses in Australasia and sold the group to its local managers; raised Pounds 1.7m net from a rights issue and issued up to 11.2m warrants to subscribe for one new share at 5p between January 1 1992 and February 1 1994; repaid loans with Pounds 1.5m of the rights proceeds to its bankers, who then capitalised the balance of their loans - Pounds 4.56m - into 2.4m new preference shares; changed its year-end from December 31 to June 30. Consequently, Mr David Massie, chairman, said that the current results contained only two months where Wills operated free of the constraints of the last few years. Basic earnings came to 0.51p (losses 3.31p) per share. A return to the dividend list will be considered in the light of the full year results.</p>

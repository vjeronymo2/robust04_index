			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Kohl tries to rouse party faithful Chancellor Helmut Kohl today faces one of the greatest challenges of his long career in German politics: to persuade his own Christian Democratic Union to shake off a mood of deep pessimism and believe that it can win the general election in October. The odds are against him when some 1,000 delegates assemble in Hamburg for the three-day party conference to launch an eight-month marathon election campaign. The CDU is trailing behind the rival Social Democratic party (SPD) in the opinion polls, and Mr Kohl's own popularity stands even lower. The latest poll by the Allensbach institute put the CDU and the Christian Social Union (CSU), its Bavarian sister party, on a combined 35.1 per cent in both halves of the country, against 40.9 per cent for the SPD. As for the chancellor's personal rating, it stood at 26 per cent last week, against 35 per cent for Mr Rudolf Scharping, the youthful challenger leading the SPD. A large majority of electors now expects a change of government in October, and even in the ruling parties there is no majority in favour of maintaining the current coalition between CDU, CSU and the liberal Free Democratic party (FDP). Reports from local party organisers around the country suggest gloom about Mr Kohl's prospects, not only for re-election as chancellor in eight months, but also for the CDU to stage a comeback in a string of local and state polls over the intervening months. Yet Mr Kohl is clearly intending to rely on his own irrepressible self-confidence, and an attitude of extraordinary calm and composure, to shrug off all fears of defeat. In two interviews last week, he showed a refusal to pay attention to the polls, or to national pessimism about the economic recession and rising unemployment. The Allensbach opinion poll also showed one other key trend in Mr Kohl's favour: voters are starting to drift back to the main parties - both SPD and CDU - from the protest parties. The extreme right-wing Republicans showed a drop in support of almost half, from 4.6 per cent to 2.7 per cent, and the Greens showed a fall from 10.2 per cent to 9 per cent. The SPD was up four percentage points on the previous poll in December, and the CDU by two points. In spite of a large grumbling minority within the CDU about Mr Kohl's lack of direction in his leadership, and his own unpopularity, no one expects any serious attempt at a coup against him at the party conference. The official aim is to endorse a new basic political programme for the party, its first new draft since 1978, and in particular, the first for a unified Germany.</p>

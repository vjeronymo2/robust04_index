			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Inquiry called for on Tory funding THE LEADER of the Labour opposition on Westminster City Council said yesterday that he was seeking an Inland Revenue investigation into a registered charity, the Foundation for Business Responsibilities, to discover if it has breached laws concerning tax relief for charities. The FBR has been criticised by the Charity Commission in a letter to Westminster Labour leader Mr Andrew Dismore for making unauthorised payments to a public-relations company, Marketforce Communications. The company was employed by Westminster council's Conservatives to promote the party before the May 1990 local elections. The commission's rules bar charities from engaging in political activities. The FBR was established in 1972 as an educational trust. The 1990 elections saw the Tories increase their majority over Labour - the Conservatives now hold 45 seats and Labour 15, out of the total 60 on Westminster council. Mr Dismore complained to the Charity Commission about FBR funding the Tory election campaign, and the commission has now backed that complaint. Its letter to Mr Dismore said the charity paid more than Pounds 98,000 to Marketforce. The commission found that the payment infringed charity rules. The money has been repaid to the charity by its trustees, although yesterday it was still not clear where the refund came from. Dame Shirley Porter, the Conservative leader of the council at the time, who has just ended her term of office as Lord Mayor of London, has been sent a letter from Mr Dismore, asking for clarification of her involvement with the use of the charity's funds for politically motivated public relations work for her party. A representative of Dame Shirley yesterday denied that she had any connection with the FBR. Mr Michael Ivens, director of the FBR, who also runs the free-market pressure group Aims of Industry, yesterday also declined to comment on the matter. Mr Dismore said that, after the commission's criticism of the FBR, the exact relationship between it, Marketforce and the Conservative party at Westminster council should be clarified. He added that Dame Shirley 'should come clean and tell us what she was up to'.</p>

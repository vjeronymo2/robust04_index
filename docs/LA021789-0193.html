			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YANKEE GREAT LEFTY GOMEZ, HALL OF FAME PITCHER, DIES  </P> <P> Hall of Fame pitcher Vernon (Lefty) Gomez, who starred with the great New York  Yankee teams of the 1930s, died today.  </P> <P> Gomez, 80, died at Marin General Hospital of congestive heart failure.  </P> <P> Born Vernon Louis Gomez in the small town of Rodeo, about 30 miles northeast of  San Francisco, he was signed for $35,000 by the Yankees but went only 2-5 in  1930, his first season in the major leagues.  </P> <P> However, he quickly justified New York's confidence, going 21-9 in 1931 and  24-7 in 1932, two of the four seasons in which he won more than 20 games.  </P> <P> His overall record, including an 0-1 record with Washington in 1943, his final  year in the major leagues, was 189-102. He had a 6-0 record in seven starts in  five World Series.  </P> <P> Gomez won four of the five All-Star Games he started, including the first one  ever played, in 1933.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drove in First Run  </P> <P> Although that team included such legends as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Al Simmons  and Joe Cronin, it was Gomez who drove in he first run.  </P> <P> "Nothing I did in baseball game me more satisfaction that getting that base  hit," Gomez said a few years ago.  </P> <P> After his career ended, Gomez spent some time managing in the minors, in  Binghamton, N.Y.  </P> <P> Gomez is survived by his wife, June, daughters Gery, Vernona and Sharon and  seven granchildren.  </P></p>

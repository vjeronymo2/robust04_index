			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Yeltsin gives information post to former deputy PM PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin has appointed the man he was supposed to have sacrificed to conservative deputies to an even more important job - telling the Russian people what to think about market reforms in Russia. Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, sacked as first deputy prime minister, is to head a new Federal Information Service which will seek to redress the effects of seven decades of Communist propaganda. The agency's role will be to 'secure through print and the mass media, the distribution of timely and wide information about the progress of reforms in Russia and to clarify government policy.' Nobody in or out of office disagrees that a lack of explanation and education about market economics was one of the most serious shortcomings of the reforms begun in January this year. But it is not yet clear whether Mr Poltoranin, who achieved few practical results in this area when he was minister for information and media, can actually deliver what is expected of him in his new position. His main strength, it would seem, is Mr Yeltsin's trust in him. Meanwhile his deputy, Mr Mikhail Fedotov, who takes over as minister, is now supposed to concentrate solely on registering and licensing new media, together with the vaguer mission of promoting freedom of speech. The job's more interesting functions have gone over to Mr Poltoranin, who will also be directly responsible for state-owned TV and newspapers. Another notable victim of Mr Yeltsin's government reshuffle has already landed on his feet. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the prime minister whom Mr Yeltsin finally abandoned to the Congress rage, has already received a number of invitations to return to politics from small political parties looking for a leader. Mr Gaidar, who displayed considerable political talents in his year in office, says he would consider a larger grouping of various pro-reform parties. In the meantime he has a direct line to President Yeltsin from his office as director of one of Russia's many economic research institutes.</p>

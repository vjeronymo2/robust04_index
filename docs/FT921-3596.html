			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dealers try to justify the continent's gloomy mood DEALERS looked for reasons to explain the feeling of gloom on the Continent yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS revived sheep-like characteristics not seen for several months, and followed London and Wall Street lower. Dealers were surprised that the CAC-40 index found no support at 1,950 and blamed it on profit-taking in a thin market. The CAC-40 index closed 26.27 or 1.3 per cent lower at 1,941.75 in turnover of FFr2.4bn. Elf fell to FFr358, below the FFr360 issue price for the government's sale of 2.3 per cent of the company before closing 10 centimes down at FFr360.20. LVMH lost another FFr106 to FFr4,564. Lyonnaise-Dumez dropped FFr19 or 3.7 per cent to FFr492 on rumours that a big US contract to build an offshore platform had been cancelled. Chargeurs dropped FFr34 to FFr1,196 on disappointment with its 1991 results. Hachette fell FFr9.50 to FFr175 after the Italian media magnate, Mr Silvio Berlusconi,said that his bid to take over Hachette's bankrupt TV affiliate, La Cinq, had met tough resistance in Paris. FRANKFURT kept a low profile, with turnover remaining flat at DM5.3bn. The FAZ index fell by 4.40 to 707.83 at midsession, and the DAX by 15.92 to 1,727.50 at the close. Declines in the big three chemicals reflected their results this week, BASF (the worst) falling DM3.50 to DM245.10, Hoechst by DM3.10 to DM252.40 and Bayer, the only one to hold its dividend, by just DM1.30 to DM292.70. Engineers and steels showed above-average declines after outperforming the market in January and February. Mr Adrian Hopkinson of County NatWest said that sellers might be looking for fundamental reasons to back a more general feeling of gloom. For what it was worth, Thyssen may have been affected by a 14 per cent drop in German steel orders, in volume terms, in January; and Mannesmann, apart from that, by cellular telephone projections, published on Wednesday, which disappointed some observers. MADRID concluded that hopes of an interest rate cut had to be shelved after year-on-year inflation rose from 5.9 per cent in January to 6.8 per cent in February. The general index closed 3.47 lower at 239.76. Banesto, Bilbao Viscaya and Santander, which had recovered well in January and February, fell by Pta145 to Pta2,955, Pta70 to Pta2,850 and Pta90 to Pta4,780 respectively. But defensive stocks like utilities held up well. Construction stocks were supported by news that the government planned to spend more on roadbuilding. MILAN fell on uncertainty ahead of the April general election and signs that the San Paolo share offering was going badly. Around 95 per cent of monthly call options were abandoned yesterday. Some dealers said that, paradoxically, this was a good sign, since operators with whom the call options had been taken out had not wanted to sell the underlying stock at current low levels. The Comit index fell 3.35 to 511.35 in turnover estimated at near Wednesday's L90.5bn. Fiat fell L45 to L4,850 but recovered to L4,890 after hours. Mediobanca, which has said it is ready to support San Paolo shares in London, fell L195 to L14,190. Trading in San Paolo shares is due to start in mid- The cement company Calcestruzzi initially fell L900 or 5.5 per cent to L15,550 as the market decided it had paid too much for a majority stake in the Greek cement group Heracles. But it then recovered to L16,400 thanks to a large buy order of 800,000 shares. ZURICH remained depressed by high interest rates, as benchmark three-month Eurofranc rates rose by  5/16 to 8 5/16 per cent. The SPI index fell 9.2 to 1,118.6. BRUSSELS saw a few blue chips buck the market's easier trend. The Bel-20 Index fell 2.21 to 1,204.85, but Solvay rebounded after recent falls to end BFr75 higher at BFr12,400 francs. There was heavy trading in Gechem which fell BFr24 to BFr387. AMSTERDAM ended lower as a late rebound failed. The CBS Tendency index fell 1.4 to 125.5. The market was disappointed by 1991 results from ABN Amro and KNP. ABN Amro fell to Fl 46.20 before closing Fl 1.30 down at Fl 46.50. KNP lost Fl 2.00 to Fl 45.60 after the company forecast lower first half net and voiced concern about the overcapacity in the paper industry. STOCKHOLM was unmoved by a 2.5 per cent year-on-year inflation for February, the lowest in 23 years, or by Procordia's 21 per cent rise in 1991 profits. The food and pharmaceuticals group saw its B shares close down SKr4 at SKr203 as the Affarsvarlden General index fell 8.5 to 977.5 in turnover of SKr377m.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAR 12  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Hourly changes   Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1152.30  1150.47  1150.62  1150.92  1148.82  1150.03  1151.34  1149.99  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Day's High  1152.30           Day's Low  1148.59  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        Mar 11       Mar 10       Mar 9       Mar 6       Mar 5       1161.88      1169.22      1165.45     1162.10     1169.56  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

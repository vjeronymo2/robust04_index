			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Honda's Indy will be used in UK built cars Indy Honda: Honda's announcement in Detroit this week that it is to develop and supply engines for Indy cars, North America's equivalent of grand prix, means that they will almost certainly be used in cars built in the UK. Honda's grand prix successes - it withdrew a few weeks ago having lost this year's championship to Williams-Renault - were won in conjunction with McLaren, another leading UK constructor. All but one of the 33 cars on the starting grid of the Indianapolis 500 last year were built in the UK, by a specialist motor sport industry which is widely acknowledged to lead the world. Huntingdon-based Lola Cars produced 27 of the cars, while Penske of Dorset and Galmer of Oxfordshire were the other manufacturers. Weekend, Page XIII</p>

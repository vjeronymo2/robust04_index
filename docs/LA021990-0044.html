Kennedy in his first year, Time said. The public rating was a result of what  the magazine called "Peace, Prosperity and Panama."  </P> <P> However, only 35% praised his work on the environment and 28% approved of his  actions related to the budget deficit, the poll said.  </P> <P> The Time/CNN poll of 500 adult Americans was conducted last week and has a  sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFEAT OF BIG GREEN  </P> <P> The oil, chemical and agriculture industries spent millions to defeat Prop.  128. Also, The Times advocated a vote against Big Green.  </P> <P> Critics said it was too complex. They are right. It is a complex issue. Critics  said the wording was flawed. They were right. But what can we expect when we  are forced to legislate via the initiative process because strong lobbies with  conflicting interests immobilize our elected officials?  </P> <P> Critics also said it would be very costly. They were right. However, it has  become so costly because we have ignored environmental issues for so long. What  the critics neglected to say is the cost of not cleansing the environment of  cancer-causing chemicals and pesticides.  </P> <P> Hopefully, Prop. 128 has alerted us to the danger of chemicals and will help  educate us about their proper use. We must tell our elected representatives and  our newly elected governor that now is the time for action.  </P> <P> PETER H. BACH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Wills Group's shares rise prompts takeover statement A sharp rise in the volume of shares traded in Wills Group resulted in an announcement that it is considering the possibility of recommending a takeover offer. The distributor and manufacturer of fluid handling parts said yesterday that it was 'considering a range of strategic alternatives' but declined to give details. Despite reporting record annual profits, the company's share price has declined from a high of 30p in mid-February to a low for the year of 13 1/2 p last Wednesday. However, heavy trading pushed the price to 15p by Friday's close and yesterday it rose further to 17 3/4 p. Mr David Massie, chairman and the largest shareholder with a 15 per cent stake, declined to say whether or not the company had received any specific approaches. But he complained that 'the market value is out of kilter with the steady progress the company has made'. Analysts said possible bidders might come from one of the company's US partners who want a distribution base in Europe, or from another UK distributor looking to expand. Wills has made a series of acquisitions over the past year to extend the range of its activities, including a move into manufacturing. It has holdings in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. Pre-tax profits for the year to July 2 almost doubled from Pounds 1.56m to Pounds 2.96m on turnover of Pounds 31.5m (Pounds 19.3m). Turnover for the present year is forecast to be in excess of Pounds 50m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Bombay, December 5--The father of India's missile  programme and scientific adviser to the defence minister, Dr  A.P.J. Kalam, today emphasised the need for integrating the  country's technological strength for the success of any  scientific project.    Dr Kalam was delivering the keynote address at the silver  jubilee function of the aerospace engineering department of the  Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. Prof J.  Chandrashekar, head of the aero-engineering department, welcomed  the gathering.    Citing an example of the successful integration of  technological strength, he said that 30 key institutions in the  country participated in the "Prithvi" surface-to-surface missile  programme of which six were academic.    Dr Kalam said that the last of the technology demonstrations  flights of the "Prithvi" was carried out a week ago at Balasore  and it was a tremendous success. "Watching it enter target zone  correctly, I realised the importance and value of integrating  technological strength," he said.    The chief architect of India's space programme said that for  the supersonic combustion programme four groups were jointly  working. These were ITT, Madras, the national aerospace  laboratory, the Indian Institute of Science and the defence  Research and Development Laboratory.    According to Dr Kalam, India needed supersonic combustion  for  hypersonic flight and the initial test results in this area were  satisfactory.    Talking about power plants for aerospace systems, he said,  that "Kaveri" engine was being developed for the prestigious  Light Combat Aircraft (LCA). He said that the engine was  expected to go into production in 1997 while the tests were  expected to start next year--1994.    Emphasising the importance of cryogenic engines for India's  programme, Dr Kalam, said that in such critical areas "we should  develop it indigenously."    However, since some foreign nations had a lead time of 10 to  15 years, ISRO did not want to lag behind in its programme and  decided to acquire it.    Dr Kalam said that the third stage of the Geo-synchorous  Launch Vehicle (GSLV) would have a cryogenic engine.    "Our missile programme will never use cryogenic engines. If  people abroad say that we would be using it, it is absurd," he  said.    At yesterday's lecture, he said that in the whole of Asia,  India had the largest number of aerospace development programmes.    According to him for many aircraft and related projects  international participation would become a reality.    At present in India about 50 public sector and private  sector  companies, 200 industries, 20 academic institutions and 30  research and development laboratories were participating in  aeronautical projects.    "A confidence has been built up in the aeronautics community  not only can it build military aircraft, but it can also enter  into development and production of civil aircraft with  international collaboration," he said.</p>

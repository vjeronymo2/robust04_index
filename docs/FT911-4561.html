			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Economic Viewpoint: Now forward to the 1960s The Oxford and Cambridge university unions had a neat way of circumventing the ban on discussing contemporary issues imposed during the period of repression which followed the Napoleonic wars. They would take some earlier historical controversy and discuss it in contemporary terms. For instance, they would pretend to discuss Cromwell's commercial policies to debate the corn laws of the early 19th century. I had a feeling something similar was afoot when I took part last weekend in a conference in Glasgow University to mark the 80th birthday of its chancellor, that perennially youthful British economist, Sir Alec Cairncross. The occasion was a great success, thanks in large part to the chairmanship of Lord Callaghan and the efforts of Sir Alec's daughter Frances, who is an example of that extremely rare breed - an economic journalist with organisational ability. The topic chosen was: did the mistakes of the 1960s contribute to the problems of the 1970s? To his credit, Sir Alec himself voted in favour, although he was economic adviser to the Treasury for most of the 1960s - the 'growthmanship' of the period was undertaken despite rather than because of his advice. Occasionally I was reminded of Wordsworth's lines from The Solitary Reaper: Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow For old, unhappy, far-off things, And battles long ago. Time had not diminished, for instance, the strongly opposing views on the realism of the growth targets of the 1960s. An example of 'growthmanship' continuing long afterwards was the Bonn summit of 1978, at which the German government was chivvied into raising its budget deficit under the slogan of 'increasing growth by 1 per cent'. Any illusion that anything is learned from history was dissipated when I arrived back from Glasgow to find the US Treasury Secretary, Nicholas Brady, berating the Germans for pushing up real interest rates - as if such magnitudes were under official control. * * * Just how difficult it is to step out of the historical rut is shown by Labour's 'Better way for the 1990s'. It is mainly a rehash of earlier policy statements and has had a very soft reception. But although some of the more alarming ideas the 1970s and 80s are jettisoned, it still serves to remind us how little Labour has moved from the soft collectivism of the 1960s. The collapse of hard collectivism in central and eastern Europe, and the determination of electorates there to have no truck with a third way between communism and capitalism, are not even mentioned. The new Labour buzz word is 'partnership'. But there is no real change. The Conservatives are condemned for their refusal to 'accept the case for an industrial policy'. The authors tie themselves into knots saying that they will not try to pick winners and only succeed in convincing me that they will pick losers. (Conservative govenments are no slouches at picking losers either, as we know from Concorde and the atomic energy programme.) We still come across the assertion, particularly associated with Labour's overrated industrial spokesman, Gordon Brown, that manufacturing has an intrinsic importance of the economy, such as services. This singling out of one type of activity is offensive to those of us who might sympathise with some of Labour's ideas on constitutional (and even budgetary) reform, who would like more redistribution in favour of the poor, but who will not be bullied into accepting sheer superstition. Nor is it a recommendation that some industrialists, who vote against Labour for pocket-book reasons, share the same fixations. From here it is a natural step to a Manufacturing Investment Programme and tax incentives for companies to invest in science and technology parks. We are truly in the land of the expensive business cliche - expensive because financed by the taxpayer. There is of course to be a National Investment Board to bridge the 'long - term investment gap'; and no doubt to retrace the history of the National Enterprise Board. Takeovers will be judged 'not only by their impact on competition, but also on their impact on research and development, regional location, employment, export strategies and the environment'. In other words, official committees are to second-guess economic decisions. After that it is a foregone conclusion that British Telecom will not be sold off or that the Post Office is to remain forever a state fief. I normally suppress all iconoclasm on the sacred subjects of education and training. But what do you make of the following? 'Although the National Council of Vocational qualifications and Scotvec has done much good work, Britain is still far from a system of high-quality NVQs common across industry.' It makes me sympathise with John Major's distrust of paper qualifications. Can you imagine Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who was responsible for the best railway architecture in the UK, bothering to acquire an NVQ? Would he have passed if he had tried? By comparison with the industrial section, Labour's treatment of Treasury matters is almost benign. The National Economic Assessment will no doubt provide relief for commentators, as well as economists and statisticians. Beware, however, of the top marginal personal tax rate supposedly of 50 per cent. If we allow for the abolition of the ceiling on employees' National Insurance contributions (in itself desirable) the marginal rate rises to 59 per cent. And if we take into account employers' contributions and consumer taxes, the effective top marginal rate could be well over 70 per cent. (It is 50-60 per cent even today, a point Conservative chancellors do not like my making). But it is the so-called social side that makes me most cross. For this is just where Labour is at its most stick-in-the mud and in my experience does not even welcome outside discussion, taking the attitude: 'Please talk to us about European monetary union, but stay out of our own backyard when it comes to policy on poverty.' No such territorial claim is going to convince me that an indiscriminate across-the-board increase in pensions of Pounds 5-Pounds 8 per week, followed by upgrading in line with earnings is a cost-effective way of helping the worst off. And Labour's attachment to the National Insurance system and lack of interest in using the tax system to pay out benefits where they are most needed is worthy of Mrs Thatcher at her most reactionary. As for the national minimum wage, starting at a half of men's median earnings, but eventually rising to two-thirds: this is an inbuilt engine for destroying jobs. The case for it is not strengthened by references to its prevalence in other Community countries where unemployment is high by both international and historical standards. To deny the connection between pay and jobs is like denying that water runs downhill. There are libraries full of empirical research which spells this out in detail. Unfortunately it is thus still not possible for market economists to support Labour with a straight face. This is something about which I used to worry even at university when I was an active member of the Labour Club. I supposed this explained the tendency of Labour-sympathising economists to retreat into macroeconomics, which I myself occasionally still do in such circles for the sake of a quiet life. A market economist might vote Labour for non-economic reasons or out of democratic belief in an alternation of parties. But nonsense remains nonsense, however progressive or unTory one wishes to be.</p>

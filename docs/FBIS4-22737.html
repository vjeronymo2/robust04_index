			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Kh. Khalykov, chief of the Turkmen State </F> Railroad, by V. Veys, GUDOK correspondent: "The Site of the  Meeting Is Ashkhabad"; Ashkhabad, date not given]    [Text] As we know, the next, 11th meeting of the  Council for Railroad Transport of the Commonwealth Member-States  is to be held in Ashkhabad. In connection with this, Kh.  Khalykov, chief of the Turkmen State Railroad, answers our  correspondent's questions.    [Veys] What caused this decision and what is the state of  readiness for the coming meeting?    [Khalykov] At the previous meeting in Voronezh, our  railroad's proposal was accepted. It was supported by the  government of Turkmenistan. We are preparing to receive and  house the delegations, and wish to create for our guests the  optimal conditions for work and leisure. The necessary  accommodations have already been selected, and by the beginning  of May everything will be ready to receive the delegations from  the Commonwealth countries.    [Veys] What are the main problems for the participants in  the  meeting to discuss?    [Khalykov] We already have some preliminary outlines of the  coming agenda, and they are the logical outcome of the decisions  made at previous meetings. Most important, probably, will be the  problem of applying a new procedure for making out transport  documents and exacting carriage charges to transport freight in  interstate and international service.    Today each administration, each road must wait for someone,  in order for them in turn to pay their debts. But how to do this  in a civilized manner is the problem. The well-being of more  than just the roads -- of the commonwealth and of the countries  themselves to whom these roads belong -- depends on the correct  solution to it. In Voronezh, incidentally, it was decided to  convert to making settlements in Swiss Francs and, obviously,  the first results of the clearing operations will provide a  great deal of practical material for those participating in the  meeting.    The experts on the Council consider it quite important to  include in the coming agenda for the meeting, questions of  official-claim work, the application of unified norms for  transporting freight in interstate service and the introduction  of new locking-sealing devices.    [Veys] What is the position of the Turkmen government on  setting up relations with the railroads of the Commonwealth?    [Khalykov] All the Council's decisions are interpreted  positively. Right now Turkmenistan is actively developing its  transport system. In fact, until the declaration of  independence, our country had only spur railroad lines in the  south and west. It is fully realistic and expedient to extend  them in this direction, which will make it possible for  Turkmenistan to have rail links with Iran and Turkey, and across  them -- to other countries. Today our railroad is a member of  the International Union of Railroads. The country's government  has been of great service in this.    [Veys] Is the Turkmen state railroad under any special  conditions, as compared with other Commonwealth roads?    [Khalykov] We have quite a few problems. It is particularly  important today to develop a reliable base for rolling stock  repair. We are seeking the possibility of manufacturing the  basic elements of track installation and communication and  signalization systems that are new in principle. We are also  seeking to electrify the mainlines and acquire new diesel  locomotives and railcars. This has been achieved to quite an  extent through setting up warm relations with the railroads of  the CIS countries, and with Russian and Ukrainian enterprises.  Railroad specialists from European and Asian countries come to  us more and more often.    As the previous meetings of the Council showed, concern for  our railroad is inseparable from the problems of other  Commonwealth mainlines. It would appear that, for their more  successful solution on a collective basis, it is important to  improve the Council's work in the future, as well. Until the  meeting in Ashkhabad!</p>

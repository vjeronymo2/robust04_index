			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Home office telecoms staff opt to strike on Monday Home Office staff employed in its telecommunications installation and maintenance division have voted to strike for one day next Monday and to withdraw 24 hour on-call cover indefinitely from 18 January. The staff - members of the NUCPS civil service union - voted by 83 per cent to 17 per cent to back industrial disruption in a postal ballot with a 65 per cent turnout. The staff are concerned at the government's refusal to provide redundancy and severance protection when the service is privatised. The union's general secretary, Mr John Sheldon, said: 'I find it incredible the Treasury is willing to jeopardise such a key service. All we are asking for is fair treatment. The government have given guarantees to staff in other privatised departments - why are we different?' The Home Office said the government was still discussing terms and conditions for staff in the proposed privatisation. Any new owner would have to meet legal obligations to existing staff. The union said staff feared a repetition of a situation last year where the Astra company, which acquired Skillcentres, collapsed into receivership with hundreds of staff being made redundant on minimum terms rather than those covering the civil service.</p>

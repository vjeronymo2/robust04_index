			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (5): Support for coalition - The views of the deputy ERDAL Inonu, a distinguished physicist and son of Turkey's second president, is deputy prime minister and leader of the Social Democratic People's Party (SHP). He gave these views to the FT: On the government: For us it is important that the coalition continues, independently of the role of the president. It has a good majority behind it in parliament. If the prime minister becomes president it will be a big change, but the parties have a sound basis in the country and do not depend on personalities. On the economy and privatisation: 'Etatism' is now understood by our party as defining the social character of the state, not in the sense of the 1930s when the state was the primary means of industrialisation and accumulation of capital. We are not against privatisation, but it is not easy to privatise so many important concerns. What is important is not the ownership but the efficient use of the means of production, and a good distribution. On the Kurds: We are encouraged by the fact that the terrorist groups say they will not engage in terrorism any more. We are not afraid of a separatist Kurdish party, because we believe it would not gain sufficient votes to achieve its ends. But it does require a change in the constitution, and the present government has not yet said it will support such a change. Turkish is the official language, and must be used by the organs of the state. But we have signed the Paris Charter, and are fully committed to giving cultural rights to all citizens. Parliament is in the process of legalising private radio and television stations. Once that is done, we can't stop them using Kurdish. On human rights: Terrorist activity accelerated for a while after we came to power. The security forces also increased their activity, making it look as if there were more violations of human rights. But the law on judicial practices has brought American standards to bear on our criminal procedures, and is now used in a great part of the country, except for terrorist cases. With the disappearance of terrorism we won't have any more complaints from Amnesty International.</p>

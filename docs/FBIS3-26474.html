			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "Rolled Steel Needs Hit 100m Tons"] </F>   [Text] Total demand for rolled steel is expected to reach  98 to 100 million tons this year, predicted a senior official  with the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry.    The Ministry plans to produce 81 million tons of rolled  steel  this year to help meet the rising demand. Another 9 million  tons will be supplied by stockpiles.    The remaining shortage, about 10 million tons, will be met  by  imports, said vice-minister Wu Xichun.    The import figure is down considerably from last year's  level, 30.26 million tons, according to latest statistics from  the General Administration of Customs.    In December alone, 4.46 million tons of rolled steel were  imported.    "This is abnormal because at the time the steel price was  plummeting, the stockpile was growing sharply," Wu said.    In recent years, the annual consumption of rolled steel  increased sharply.    Total usage of rolled steel in 1991 was 10 million tons more  than in 1990, rising by 15 million tons in 1992.    Last year, it hit an estimated 93 million tons, an increase  of 17 million tons over the previous year, Wu said.    Domestic iron and steel makers produced 75 million tons of  rolled steel last year and exported about 2 million tons.    Because of the 30.26 million tons of imports, stockpiles  climbed by about 10 million tons, a record high, and pulled down  prices, Wu said.    He attributed the sharp increase of rolled steel consumption  to the rapid growth of investment in fixed assets in recent  years.    In 1993 total investment in fixed assets amounted to 1.15  trillion yuan ($132 billion), up 46 per cent over the previous  year.    This year the government intends to strengthen macro-control  of the economy and curb fixed assets investment.    If the target is achieved, the rapid growth of rolled steel  usage in the country will be slowed down this year, experts said.    And the prices, which experienced dramatic ups and downs  last  year, will be steady, they predicted.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TURNOVER in stock index futures fell as traders contemplated the poor economic outlook, and uncertainty over the prospect of a fall in the UK interest rates remained. The cautious opening of the March contract briefly gave way to buying, mainly by US houses, leaving independent traders short and sending the contract advancing to 2,556. That momentum was not sustained and Wall Street's sensitive opening sent March down once again, although a brief rally was noted towards the market close as Wall Street steadied. Turnover had reached only 4,687 contracts by the close as March closed at 2,539, down 11 on the previous session and just ahead of its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 10. In traded options, turnover, though poor at 22,487 contracts, was ahead of Tuesday's 17,173. The FT-SE 100 Index option had 7,256 lots dealt. BT was the busiest stock option with 2,419 lots. The May 330 calls and May 330 puts were the busiest series, with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said to have done a cross in the stock options. This was followed by Barclays, which traded 1,250 contracts, with a call spread said to have been part of the day's trades.</p>

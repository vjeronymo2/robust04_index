			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Arts: Stretching the possible - London Concerts It has taken a decade for London to be given a second performance of Robin Holloway's Second Concerto for Orchestra, Op. 40 - the first, which itself came three long years after the Glasgow premiere in 1979, was at the 1982 Proms. There are no doubt hard practical reasons why our orchestras have from the first steered clear of this huge (40-minute-long), simply astonishing piece of sustained compositional virtuosity - for a start because it is hair-raisingly difficult to put together, play and rehearse. But they provide no real excuse: the work needs to have seeped into orchestral consciousness, extending players' and listeners' range of the possible, stretching their and our sense of 20th-century musical fantasy as, given half a chance, it undoubtedly would. Never mind: Monday's performance at the Royal Festival Hall by the BBC Symphony under Oliver Knussen - dedicatee of the Second Concerto - was on all counts a triumphant revival, solving difficulty after technical difficulty with exactly the combination of formidable exactitude and insouciant wit the music requires. The main point about this concerto for orchestra was proved beyond argument: that it is at once a three-movement showpiece in the honourable Bartok tradition, concerned to make a brilliant showing of every orchestral department, and a kind of 'music-drama for orchestra' boldly exploring little-charted expressive territories - among them, a film-like lapping of wave upon wave of musical imagery on the shore of a structure itself only gradually revealed. Influences abound (Wagner, Strauss, Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky etc); madcap snatches of the Chopin Barcarolle and 'Arrivederci Roma' continually flit across the musical screen; a 'continuo' group of north African-style percussion disciplines the content with its special fierce glitter. Eventually, a transition built up of freely notated solo cadenzas arrives to provide a Dawn Chorus to all the earlier dream-outpourings; this gives way to a finale firmly pulled together to show that Holloway's allusive, kaleidoscopic style, far from being promiscuously unleashed or loose in purpose, has from the first been unified, and capable of exhilarating resolution. In addition to dazzling every ear with Holloway, Knussen and the BBC had already put us permanently in their debt with the London premiere of Aaron Copland's 1922 ballet Grohg, an early score long lost and only recently rediscovered, packed with wonderful inventions to be mined in all the more famous Copland achievements - and a badly-needed re-examination of the toughly trenchant Inscape (1967), his last significant piece.

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Sears Sears' sale of its stake in Asprey and moves to start closing Ter Meulen Post are useful bits of corporate housekeeping. In particular the cutting of ties with Asprey underlines that Sears' chief executive, Mr Liam Strong, has the authority to unwind decisions originally taken by Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, the chairman. Still, the habit of tidiness is not enough when it comes to squeezing an adequate return from Sears' slumbering assets. The poor experience in the newly acquired Dutch mail order business also suggests that accidents continue to happen. Part of the problem faced by Mr Strong at Sears is knowing where to start. So far his efforts have been focused on British Shoe, to some effect. Changing such organisations requires tremendous management momentum. Replacement of key personnel, a clearly defined and vigorous strategy from the board and action across a wide front are all needed if the initiative is not to be smothered with bureaucratic inertia. Witness the very different but determined approaches of Mr John Hoerner at Burton and Mr Archie Norman at Asda, who have certainly generated the impression of activity. Mr Strong has been slower in that regard. While such things are partly a matter of marketing, that is after all, Mr Strong's speciality. As yet it is too early to say that the Sears experiment has failed. Unless results are forthcoming, however, the time may not be far off when the question will be asked.</p>

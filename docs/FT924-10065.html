			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Rising dollar and political woes unite to sink sterling A SHARP rise in the US dollar and growing political uncertainty in Britain yesterday pushed sterling to its lowest ever level on its trade weighted index. The index, which measures the value of sterling against the currencies of Britain's main trading partners, touched 77.7 before closing at 77.9 amid fears that Mr John Major may be defeated in tomorrow's Maastricht vote in the House of Commons. Sterling also fell sharply against the US dollar which rose on the strength of the latest polls pointing to a victory for Mr Bill Clinton in today's US presidential election. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 35.93 at 3,262.21, buoyed by good news on the economy. The UK stock market ignored the pound's fall, believing that interest rate cuts are still likely before the end of the year. The FT-SE 100 Index of leading shares rose 29.5 points, to finish at 2,687.8. The US currency's strong performance was aided by poor industrial production figures in Germany, which increased speculation that the Bundesbank will ease official short-term interest rates, reducing the premium received by investors holding D-Marks. But the dollar has mainly attracted investors who expect a Clinton victory to bring more US government spending and higher interest rates that will help push the dollar upwards. Against the D-Mark, the dollar closed yesterday in London nearly three pfennigs higher at DM1.568, a level last seen on June 22 this year. In New York it fell back slightly to close at DM1.5645. The pound closed more than 3 cents down on the day in London at Dollars 1.53, a level last seen in October 1989. The pound in effect has been devalued by 24 per cent against the US currency since it fetched Dollars 2.00 two months ago. In New York it closed at Dollars 1.5345. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said recently that increasing attention would be paid to the index in the formulation of monetary policy. Dealers believe there could be heavy selling of the pound if the government loses tomorrow's Maastricht vote. One UK-based fund manager suggested yesterday that sterling could fall to Dollars 1.40 and DM2.20 in the near-term if the government was defeated. Long-dated gilts fell sharply yesterday, ending a percentage point down on the day. Currencies, Page 31 France cuts key interest rates, Page 20</p>

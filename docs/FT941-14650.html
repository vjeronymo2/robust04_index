			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Volvo prepares to elect new management team An era will be launched at Volvo today. Shareholders will elect a chairman and board to pick up the pieces left when Sweden's leading manufacturer tore up a plan to merge with France's Renault, prompting the resignation of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, chairman. There is little trace of the trauma caused by the anti-merger revolt, at least among Volvo's shareholders. Volvo's share price has vaulted upwards since the deal was scrapped as Swedish investors see a resurgence of profits and wager that the company can carve out an independent future in the motor industry. Yesterday, Volvo's most-traded B shares closed at SKr665, up from SKr539 at the turn of the year. This is a far cry from the lows below SKr400 in the turbulent weeks before the merger broke down on December 2. The extraordinary meeting in Gothenberg will confirm Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, to succeed Mr Gyllenhammar, who led the company for more than two decades. He and six others are being proposed for the board by a group of Swedish institutional shareholders which control more than 40 per cent of Volvo's voting capital. The group includes the chief instigators of the revolt against Mr Gyllenhammar and the Renault deal. The six include Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive who led a last-minute management revolt against the merger, and Mr Louis Schweitzer, the chairman and chief executive of Renault. The French group remains a 10 per cent shareholder in Volvo and partner in a three-year alliance that the merger was intended to succeed. The remaining new members are all heavyweights of Sweden's industrial and financial establishment: Mr Bjorn Svedberg, president of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and chairman of Ericsson, Mr Per-Olof Ericsson, head of the engineering group Sandvik, Mr Tom Hedelius, chairman of Handelsbanken, and Mr Hakan Frisinger, a former Volvo executive and merger critic. Shareholders will be anxious to hear from Mr Svanholm and Mr Gyll about Volvo's strategy although Volvo played down expectations of important announcements. The alliance with Renault must be clarified. Mr Gyll has said the two companies should work together. But he says the most ambitious projects, such as plans to develop jointly new models, are unlikely to go ahead. The question is whether Volvo and Renault can dismantle their complex cross-shareholdings, and if they do, where Volvo will turn for a long-term vehicle co-operation deal that it admits it will need. Mr Gyll said Volvo would concentrate more closely on its core car and truck operations, a shift in emphasis away from the diversified portfolio built up by Mr Gyllenhammar. The speculation in Sweden is that Volvo will move first to sell non-core assets, such as its investment companies, to raise capital to finance vehicle developments, rather than opting for a share issue. Volvo seems to have a breathing space in which the new board can work through these issues. The fruits of three years of cost-cutting, a steep fall in the value of the Swedish krona, rising sales of its cars in the US and signs of a turnround in the home market, have led analysts to predict 1993 profits of around SKr2bn (Dollars 247m), with big profits growth in both 1994 and 1995.

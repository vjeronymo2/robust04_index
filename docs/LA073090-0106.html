			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH: MEEK BROADCASTERS HELP FCC OVERSTEP ITS BOUNDS  </P> <P> The FCC's passing of a 24-hour indecency ban on radio, giving the commission  the right to interpret what is decent or indecent material without regard to  the differences in mores from city to city ("FCC Upholds 24-Hour-a-Day Ban on  'Indecent' Broadcasts," July 13), is the latest in a series of setbacks for a  country admired around the world for our history of allowing creative and  artistic freedom to flourish. As new freedoms are embraced in Eastern Europe  and the U.S.S.R., a chill wind is sweeping across the U.S.A.  </P> <P> Americans take our freedoms, the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press  in particular, for granted, which is why this latest setback has occurred. The  latest ruling by the FCC to ban "indecency" on radio 24 hours a day can be  directly attributed to the meek response by broadcasters and the ineffective  lobbying efforts of their representative organization, the National Assn. of  Broadcasters, to last year's fining of 12 radio stations by the commission.  Encouraged by their submissive reaction, the FCC has now taken a further step  in its bid to become national interpreters of what is acceptable on American  airwaves -- even as the case is still pending in the courts.  </P> <P> Today's electronic press is under siege, confronted by a commission that is  once again overstepping its bounds in trying to act as parents for millions of  America's children. This attempt to dictate acceptable public entertainment,  never an FCC brief, is interfering in an area that is strictly a community and  family affair.  </P> <P> Children simply cannot be protected from the potentially harmful external  influences facing them every day at home, in schools, from their friends or on  radio and TV unless the parents have established the kind of relationship with  their children that allows them to teach the difference between right and  wrong.  </P> <P> Additionally, the FCC ruling is symptomatic of a government that increasingly  accedes more to the wishes of the vocal minority than to the silent majority.  If millions of people listen and enjoy controversial radio personalities, a few  hundred letters should not constitute grounds for the FCC to scrutinize and  fine radio stations.  </P> <P> In recent months, civil libertarians everywhere have decried the incoherent and  vague indecency fines leveled by the FCC, but the talk has been cheap. Standing  on the sidelines hoping this hysterical McCarthyism will go away plays into the  hands of the headline-grabbing groups and elected officials who assume that an  attack unchallenged is an attack agreed to. So, if we believe that the FCC  fining some "dirty" deejays and "indecent" stations isn't a part of the grander  scheme to control and edit what music, art, film and other entertainment is  made available to Americans, we haven't been paying attention.  </P> <P> Radio stations should not pay fines, but instead should challenge the FCC in  court to prove that they have aired "indecent" content. Any officials and  businesses that attempt to censor or muzzle creativity and the inherent right  of Americans to the freedom of expression should be singled out and held  accountable.  </P> <P> America is a country based on diversity, not conformity. If you don't like it,  don't listen to it or watch it. But don't restrict anyone else from choosing  for themselves.  </P> <P> See letters to Counterpunch, F6.  </P></p>

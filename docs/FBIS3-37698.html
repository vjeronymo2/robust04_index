			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 17 February Baku Radio and later other mass media  disseminated a statement by the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry  that accused the Armenian leadership of trying to talk to  Azerbaijan from a position of strength and for continuing the  occupation of Azerbaijani territories. This propagandistic  argument was based on the fact that the Armenian Foreign  Ministry has rejected to participate in a scheduled meeting of  Armenian and Azerbaijani experts in the Norwegian capital of  Oslo.    As is known, the international non-governmental public  organization International Alert is sponsoring this meeting.    The Armenian Foreign Ministry press and public relations  service is authorized to state the following: The Armenian  authorities are convinced that any mediation mission aimed at  settling the Karabakh conflict can be productive only if the  plenipotentiary representatives of the legally elected  authorities of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic are included in the  negotiating processes.    Attempts to resolve the Karabakh problem through talks  between the representatives of Armenia and Azerbaijan show that,  despite the developments over recent years, certain  international circles have failed to grasp the essence of the  problem.    Despite periodically disseminated disinformation, the  Armenian authorities have defended and continue to defend all  peacemaking efforts for the establishment of peace in the  region, including those of the CSCE and Russia. This is  revealed by the existing initiatives, the constructive stance  shown, and positive responses by Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.    Armenia is convinced that there is no alternative to a  peaceful resolution of the Karabakh conflict. All strong-arm  methods to resolve the conflict are doomed to fail.</p>

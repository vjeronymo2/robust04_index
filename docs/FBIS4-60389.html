			<p>BFN     [Text] Irbil, 21 May (INA)--Reports from Irbil have said  that clashes between the cliques of Talabani and Barzani resumed  today in the district of Shaqlawah, the summer resort of Salah  al-Din, and some neighborhoods in the city of Irbil. These  clashes claimed the lives of dozens of innocent citizens. Many  people from both sides were also killed or wounded.    In the past two days, the Talabani group attempted to attack  the elements and centers of the clique of the so-called Islamic  Movement in Halabjah and nearby areas. The group, however,  achieved nothing. It recently cut the power supply of this area,  which is fed by power generators from the city of  al-Sulaymaniyah.    The Talabani group said that Hasan Kuwistani [name as  received], Political Bureau member of Talabani's party, and  seven other party members were killed in the Hajj 'Umran sector,  and that the killers mutilated his body and used a car to pull  it before people in Hajj 'Umran.</p>

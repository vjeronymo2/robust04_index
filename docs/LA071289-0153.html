			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IT'S ACES AND EAGLE FOR TEEN  </P> <P> It was a round Derek Nannen of Geneva won't forget, with two aces and an eagle  in a six-hole span in the first round of the Nebraska State Junior  Championships at York Country Club on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Nannen, 16, shot his first hole-in-one on the 153-yard No. 11, a par 3. On the  next hole, a 497-yard par 5, Nannen carded an eagle 3 when he holed his third  shot at a distance he said was about 80 yards.  </P> <P> "Somehow I just knew I was going to make that shot," he said.  </P> <P> Nannen recorded his second ace on the par 3, 135-yard No. 16.  </P> <P> The Geneva golfer used his two aces to record an even-par 70 for the first 18  holes of the tournament. He was seventh in Class A at the end of the two rounds  Tuesday, posting a 70-79 -- 149.  </P> <P> "It was too bad I couldn't keep it up on the second 18," Nannen said. "I didn't  hit my irons on the second 18 nearly as well as I was on the front 18."  </P></p>

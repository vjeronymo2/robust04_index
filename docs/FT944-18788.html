			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Better deal on insurance Soon after buying a new car recently, I discovered my insurance broker had not offered me a very good deal; other firms offered better motor policies for around Pounds 50 less. I asked him if I could cancel my existing policy, get a pro-rata refund and change to a better company. I was told I would get a refund equivalent only to my paying about Pounds 50 for just one month's insurance. I asked for confirmation and was told the company would not quote an exact figure until I had committed myself to cancelling the policy. Is the company wrong by refusing to say what the refund would be until I have committed myself? It appears you are paying the penalty of trying to cancel a policy very soon after its initiation. The company incurred administration costs in setting up the policy for your new car, and it would be difficult for it to quote an exact refund figure until you had given it a specific date and confirmation. We feel sure, however, that if you apply to the company, you will be able to get an accurate estimate of the costs involved.

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH  </P> <P> Regarding "My Aching Back," by Michael S. Wilkes MD and Miriam Schuchman MD  (Nov. 11): A point missed by the doctors was the mention of physical therapy  for treatment of back injuries. Granted, there are good therapists and  not-so-good therapists; however, care and education offered by physical  therapists can be invaluable to the individual suffering back pain. With the  use of ice, heat, ultrasound, electrical stimulation, stretching and  strengthening exercises and general conditioning, back problems can be  successfully rehabilitated and reinjury prevented.  </P> <P> VICTORIA G.

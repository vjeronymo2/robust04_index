The author of the article says:    The traitor Kim Yong-sam and his "civilian" regime are  destined to meet a miserable doom. The puppet Kim Young-sam had  been a target of hatred among the people before he took the  "presidential" seat as a thorough-paced traitor and turncoat.  When the traitor chose to live under the same roof with  military blackguards, openly kissing them with the patronage and  backing of the United States, his master, people of all walks of  life lifted up voices of condemnation, branding him as a  power-thirsty shyster, betrayer and political prostitute. At  the time of "presidential elections" people who account for  nearly 20 percent of the total number of electors boycotted  voting to express their opposition to Kim Yong-sam. This  virtually means that more than two thirds of the population  voted against him. Thus, the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime had a  gloomy future from the first step as it came into being amidst  opposition and rejection by an overwhelming majority of the  people.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique also took upon itself a  timebomb by getting into the same boat with the preceding  military dictators. For the traitor Kim Yong-sam to join hands  with the military dictatorial forces denounced by the people was  an act of turning his back on the people, and for him to promise  those forces to "protect" them after his assumption of office  was an unpardonable criminal act.    After putting up the "civilian" signboard the Kim Yong-sam  puppet clique honored its commitment to the preceding military  dictatorial forces, while breaking all his "promises" to the  people. That is why the South Korean people view "in the same  light" Chun Doo hwan- No Tae-u clique, a target of purge and  punishment, and the traitor Kim Yong-sam who is zealously  defending them.    The traitor's much-touted, fine-sounding "civilian politics"  has punctured. It is as clear as noonday what fate will befall  him.</p>

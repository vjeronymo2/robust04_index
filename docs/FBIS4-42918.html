			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Institutional Reform Minister Francesco </F> Speroni by Mario De Scalzi; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [De Scalzi] You have been minister for a month now.  Is it too early to give us a balance sheet?    [Speroni] No, I would like to say that at the next Council  of  Ministers I will present a bill aimed at revising the  constitution and which would allow the regions to establish  their own electoral laws.    [De Scalzi] What other powers have you promised to the local  authorities?    [Speroni] I have promised the regional authorities that  there  will be a revision of the Constitution in order to make it more  federal. We are already in the process of setting up a  committee to look at this. Afterwards, with the procedures laid  out under Article 138 of the Constitution, we will go toward a  revision which, on the basis of federalism, will hand more to  the local authorities.    [De Scalzi] Are there any administrative measures in the  bill?    [Speroni] Administrative measures are not the responsibility  of the Ministry for Institutional Reform but are the  responsibility of the Civil Service Ministry</p>

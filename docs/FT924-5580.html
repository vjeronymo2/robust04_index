			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Lloyd's elects Rowland to council MEMBERS of Lloyd's of London yesterday voted Mr David Rowland to the insurance market's governing council, clearing the way for his expected election by 20 fellow council members to the post of chairman next week. The council votes on Wednesday, although Mr Rowland will not be confirmed as chairman in succession to Mr David Coleridge until the new year. Mr Rowland, 59, has spent most of his working life at Lloyd's. He announced his resignation as chairman of Sedgwick Group, the insurance broker, earlier this year. Mr Rowland topped the poll of working Names - those who have jobs with brokers and agencies in the market - winning 2,818 votes. Mr Robert Hiscox, managing director of the Roberts &amp; Hiscox agency, came second with 2,283 votes. Also elected were Mr Stephen Merrett and Mr Richard Keeling, both prominent underwriters, with 1,513 and 1,214 votes respectively. Mr Hiscox and Mr Merrett were members of a 14-strong market task force chaired by Mr Rowland that proposed wide-ranging reforms at Lloyd's in January. Mr David James, a 'company doctor' who is chairman of Lep Group, Eagle Trust and Davies &amp; Newman, was also elected to the council. Mr James topped the poll of outside Names with 4,230 votes. His closest challenger was Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Names Action group, with 3,598 votes. He failed to gain election to the council. The Association of Lloyd's Members (ALM), the biggest Names organisation, which represents 9,000 of Lloyd's 22,400 Names, backed Mr James's candidacy. Its chairman, Mr Neil Shaw, welcomed the result: 'David Rowland's election means that Lloyd's top team is now in place. The ALM looks forward to working with them to build a successful Lloyd's and to handle the problem of damaged Names in the most sympathetic way possible without being unfair to the majority.'</p>

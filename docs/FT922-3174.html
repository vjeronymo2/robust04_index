			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Israelis face fewer investment curbs ISRAEL yesterday eased restrictions on citizens holding foreign exchange accounts and investing in futures and foreign securities, the latest move in a gradual relaxation of exchange and capital market controls designed to generate growth and investment. The announcement by the Bank of Israel came two days after the US ambassador in Israel issued a strong appeal to Israeli leaders contesting the June 23 election to formulate urgent reforms of the government-dominated economy to jolt it out of stagnation. The Bank of Israel itself has been urging more rapid liberalisation. But the ruling Likud party and opposition Labour leaders have offered few policy proposals despite evidence that the economy is stalling under the burden of mass immigration from the former Soviet Union. Unemployment last month reached a record 11.5 per cent.

Individuals and companies could invest in futures.</p>

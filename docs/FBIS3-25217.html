			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] After nearly three weeks of ethnic violence in  northeastern Ghana between Komkombas and Dagombas, which spread  across the region affecting the main town of Tamale and sending  thousands of refugees into neighboring Togo, people in the  region are beginning to take stock of the human cost of the  conflict. On Thursday [10 February], the Ghanaian Government  declared a three- month state of emergency in northeastern Ghana  and now security personnel have taken advantage of this to begin  searching for the bodies of those who were killed in the  fighting in order to bury them so as to avoid any outbreak of  epidemics. From Tamale, Eliasu Adamu telexed this report:    So far 168 bodies have been buried mainly by the roadside,  but there are many more in the bush. Briefing President Jerry  Rawlings, who was at the war zone to assess the situation, the  northern sector brigade commander, Brigadier Joseph Smith, said  101 corpses have been buried in the Nanumba District and 67 in  Yendi District. He told the president that three soldiers were  also killed last Wednesday [9 February] by the Komkombas when  they were lured into a trap. He said the Komkombas had invited  the soldiers for a dialogue on cease-fire but were ambushed on  the way and murdered. They were stripped of their uniforms and  their arms and their ammunition was taken away. The military  vehicle they were using was also burnt.    Over 50 villages have been completely burnt, including  almost  all villages along the Salaga-Bimbila-Yendi road. The few  villages that have not been burnt have been deserted. Between  Bakpaba and Adibo, a distance of about 10 miles from the  Yendi-Bimbila road, I counted 40 decomposing corpses, including  women and toddlers littering the road. The babies, who were  apparently taken off the backs of their slain mothers, still had  arrows in them. I also saw a lot of foodstuffs, especially yams  and maize completely burnt. This will definitely affect the  food situation in the country because the war zone is the main  source of the country's yams.    President Rawlings, who flew over the area, was emotionally  moved by the extent of the destruction and said it was wrong for  any ethnic group to use violence to achieve its objectives. He  said the government will ensure that no single ethnic group  could hold the whole region to ransom. But just as we were told  that the situation was calm, the Komkombas attacked and were  burning Bimpielega, four miles from Yendi. They fired at our  convoy and our escort had to return fire to scare them.</p>

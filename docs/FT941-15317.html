			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Alcan cuts add fuel to metals rally Alcan of Canada restoked the boiler of a general London Metal Exchange rally that was showing signs of running out steam when it announced late on Thursday that it was making immediate cuts amounting to 156,000 tonnes in a full year in its aluminium production. The news came at an opportune moment, just a few days before the commencement of a second round of multilateral talks on curing the international aluminium market's growing oversupply problem. At these talks, beginning in Brussels on Tuesday, representatives from Australia, Canada, the European Union Norway, the US and Russia - widely blamed for the present glut - are expected to agree terms for output cuts of up to 2m tonnes a year. With the LME already closed, the initial reaction to the Alcan news in inter-office trading was somewhat muted. But yesterday saw a sharp rally that took the LME three months price to a five-month high of Dollars 1,208 a tonne at one point. At the close it stood at Dollars 1,205.75 a tonne, up Dollars 38 on the day and Dollars 56.25 on the week. Other LME base metals contracts joined in the fun. Three months copper, which had already been showing a Dollars 33.25 rise on the week, added another Dollars 46 to close at Dollars 1,826.50 a tonne, while three months nickel extended its weekly gain from Dollars 410 to Dollars 470 at Dollars 5,757.50 a tonne. The lead lead price closed at Dollars 508.50 a tonne, up Dollars 12 on the day and Dollars 35 on the week, and zinc added Dollars 23 to its earlier Dollars 21.50 rise. Tin closed at Dollars 5,022.50 a tonne, up Dollars 265 on the week, after gaining Dollars 162.50 yesterday. 'After a few days of consolidation the markets look to have firmly established uptrends and are attracting technical buying from (investors following) charts and (investment) funds,' one dealer told the Reuter news agency. The earlier gains had brought a dubious response from some analysts, who said speculators were ignoring the poor fundamental outlook for base metals. Mr Wiktor Bielski of Bain &amp; Company, part of the Deutsche Bank group, pointed out that nickel had been the 'star performer' with a 50 per cent rise from its October low, although the metal's prospects had been deteriorating. 'Metals are cheap compared with the stock and bond market,' he pointed out, 'and a little money can move prices quite a long way.' At the London Commodity Exchange the cocoa market began by continuing last week's fall, which had been influenced by growing expectations of a big devaluation of the CFA franc, the currency of former French African colonies including the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa producer. But, as is so often the case, the actual event, which came on Wednesday, brought a reversal in the price trend. Having dipped to Pounds 885 a tonne on that day the LCE's May futures position rallied to end the week Pounds 23 up on balance at Pounds 929 a tonne. In the absence of fresh fundamental news dealers attributed the rally, which peaked yesterday at Pounds 948 a tonne, to a 'positive' technical picture. And the uptrend had been fuelled by covering against earlier 'short' sales prompted, they told Reuter, by the appearance of one or two large buyers in the market. Analysts said yesterday's announcement by the Ivory Coast of an increase in prices paid to farmers following the devaluation was unlikely to lead to substantially higher shipments in the near future.  ------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium             -500     to     2,501,625 Aluminium alloy        -20     to        48,320 Copper              +3,875     to       617,800 Lead                +3,550     to       305,750 Nickel              +1,248     to       127,116 Zinc               +17,825     to       951,075 Tin                   -130     to        20,655  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

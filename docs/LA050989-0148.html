			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'FRONTLINE' CONSIDERS THE FUTURE OF 'YELLOWSTONE'  </P> <P> Despite the title's suggestion, "Yellowstone Under Fire," the latest report  from "Frontline" (at 9 tonight on Channels 28 and 15, 10 on Channel 50), is not  about the wildfires that erupted in the national park last summer.  </P> <P> It is about the longer-term crisis in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (as it  is known) caused by the exploitation of the fragile wilderness for oil and  geothermal energy, minerals and timber harvesting.  </P> <P> Most profoundly, producers Jan Falstad and Greg Pratt depict a battle over  fundamental values. On one side is the mind-set of former Interior Secretary  James Watt and the appointees who have succeeded him in the Reagan and Bush  administrations. Their practice of full-scale leasing of public lands to  private development is based on a rock-ribbed belief in the primacy of private  property and of American military strategic interests -- the Yellowstone area,  for instance, has the only U.S. deposits of platinum and palladium, minerals  essential for weaponry.  </P> <P> The report does cite this, but the Cold War strategies behind what Watt himself  calls the "assault" on Yellowstone are understressed. Rather, the values of  preservation are emphasized and given eloquent voice by, among others, former  National Park Service director George Hartzog, former U.S. Sen. Gaylord Nelson  and Montana surveyor Jack Rate.  </P> <P> Curiously, in a report that's unusually fact-filled and sensitive to the  champions of ecology, the enormous stresses put on the wilderness by tourism  itself are ignored. Much of this stress has stemmed, as the report notes, from  the National Forest Service policy of the "multiple-use" of forest for  recreation and development. And with two-thirds of the Forest Service budget  slated for the unprofitable leasing of land for timber clear-cutting, the fate  of Yellowstone hangs precariously in the balance as the '90s begin.

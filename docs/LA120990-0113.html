			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SMALL'S FEAT HELPS TITANS BEAT PEPPERDINE;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: SHOOTING GUARD ENDS HIS SLUMP WITH 27 POINTS TO HELP FULLERTON WIN  ON ROAD AGAIN.  </P> <P> When Pepperdine wiped out Cal State Fullerton's 14-point lead and went ahead in  the second half, Joe Small stepped up and swished a three-point basket, and  then another.  </P> <P> When Pepperdine rallied again to force overtime, Small made a jumper, then two  free throws.  </P> <P> With 27 points, Small made sure Fullerton didn't let Saturday night's game in  front of 1,729 slip away at Firestone Fieldhouse. His 17-point second half led  the Titans to a 69-66 overtime victory over Pepperdine.  </P> <P> "One of us was going to have to step up," Small said. "Why not me?"  </P> <P> Going into the game, Small was mired in a shooting slump. He had made only  40.8% of his shots from the field, not a pleasing percentage for a shooting  guard.  </P> <P> But he kept firing Saturday, making 11 of 20, including three of seven from  three-point range.  </P> <P> Small said his confidence swelled after making his first few jump shots.  </P> <P> "I knew it was going to be a good shooting night," he said. "I just got in a  zone."  </P> <P> It was the first time since the 1988-89 season, John Sneed's first as coach,  that the Titans won two straight road games.  </P> <P> For a while, it appeared the Titans (3-2) were headed for the second  consecutive easy road victory. They routed the University of San Francisco,  84-60, Wednesday in San Francisco.  </P> <P> With Small leading the way, Fullerton built a 48-34 lead with 15:56 left in the  game. But suddenly Pepperdine, which had clanged all sorts of shots off the  backboard and rim until then, got hot.  </P> <P> Geoff Lear dunked, Dana Jones made a layup off an underhand flip from Lear and  Steve Guild made a three-pointer.  </P> <P> Suddenly it was 48-41, Fullerton.  </P> <P> After a timeout, Damin Lopez made a three-pointer for Pepperdine, Lear and  Jones scored and it was 48-48. Lopez made one of two free throws, then Jones  scored.  </P> <P> And Fullerton was fading fast.  </P> <P> "That one spell hurt us," Sneed said. "We were tentative against their zone  press. We attacked the press and were fine after that. I was proud the guys  didn't fold."  </P> <P> Small's back-to-back three-pointers were crucial in keeping the Titans afloat.  </P> <P> His first came with 8:26 left, breaking a 17-0 Pepperdine run. The second, a  moment later, put Fullerton back into the lead, 54-51.  </P> <P> Later, with a chance to win in regulation, Fullerton's Wayne Williams, had the  ball stolen by Rick Welch with three seconds left. Welch's half-court throw was  wide right at the buzzer and the teams went to overtime tied, 61-61.  </P> <P> Doug Christie made two free throws to give Pepperdine the lead. At the other  end, Small and made a 17-footer at the baseline.  </P> <P> Williams made two free throws a moment later, Small added two, and Williams two  more as Fullerton hung on for the victory.  </P> <P> So what does this mean for the Titans?  </P> <P> Well, Pepperdine (4-2) had already beaten two other Big West Conference teams  -- blitzing Fresno State, 84-64, in Fresno and knocking off UC Santa Barbara,  72-60.  </P> <P> "We're starting to come around," Sneed said. "We beat a pretty good team  tonight."  </P> <P> Said Small: "We feel real confident right now. We're on a high."  </P> <P> Aaron Wilhite, who made six of seven shots from the field before fouling out,  was the only other Titan in double figures. He had 14 points.  </P> <P> Lear led Pepperdine with 18 points. Guild, a former standout at Marina High  School, had 13, and Christie, playing with a sprained ankle, had 11.  </P> <P> Pepperdine shot just 34.4% from the field to Fullerton's 44.3.  </P></p>

Scientists, politicians and  representatives from British industry discussed at a technical  meeting this spring in London the options already available  today for effectively countering the continuing increase of  carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere. The experts agreed  that one country alone cannot solve this problem [which affects]  the entire earth.    Almost unnoticed by the German public, England is actively  involved in environmental protection. The country orients itself  very closely around the guidelines of the Rio de Janeiro Agenda  21. Government and industry have recognized that there is also  money to be made in environmental protection, whether with  ecologically compatible, economically manufactured products or  with the application of the science of management to gain  control over environmental problems [facing] Britain and Europe.    In England, federal institutions and authorities perform  more  of a monitoring and advisory function, while industry itself --  without comparably strict laws or regulations as in Germany --  takes action on its own initiative.    As Sir John Mason from the Manchester Institute of Science  and Technology explained at the meeting, the signs are  increasing that the feared severe climatic changes brought about  by the constant increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide will not  lead to such rapid changes in average temperatures as had so far  been predicted by computer simulations. Mason, who has been  involved with the questions of global climate for nearly 20  years, is one of Britain's top meteorologists.    Mason bases his statements on improved computer simulations.  The great depths of the earth's oceans had until now not been  taken into consideration in the calculations, because we had no  knowledge of how great the bonding power of carbon dioxide at  various water depths really is.    It has meanwhile become known that there are powerful deep  currents between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans which could  bring about a comparatively fast distribution of the carbon  dioxide picked up from the atmosphere. Rough calculations  suggest that contrary to earlier assumptions the oceans can  absorb almost twice as much industrially released carbon dioxide.    In the end, this observation is in fact not comforting, but  it does push the time period for global warming far into the  next century. Thus, more time remains for the industrialized  nations to substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions.    Great Britain sees Germany's packaging regulations in  particular as a warning example. They have led to increased  waste export and not to actual waste reduction. In the United  Kingdom, they are pursuing another way to encourage and support  industry in developing and offering environmentally friendlier  products and services.    Funds are being made available for this purpose in the 1994  British budget. Clive Brewer, the British government's Director  for Environmental Protection, refers to the growing world market  for environmental protection technologies which for 1992 is  estimated at about $210 billion. In 1992, Great Britain exported  about $800 million worth of products in this market alone.  Brewer expects that this share will show high growth rates in  the coming years. In the meantime, British industry has already  started to switch over to products and production processes to  minimize carbon dioxide emissions and other environmental  pollution within Great Britain, [something] which is also  occurring in the other countries in the European Community.  London emphasized, however, that this is happening first and  foremost on a voluntary basis and that the government itself  hardly needs to reach for specific laws or regulations.    Dr. Arun Watts, Technical Director of the ICI [Imperial  Chemical Industries] Plastics Division, offers as an example the  production of plastic foam from polyurethanes using newer  methods of production. A non-volatile isocyanate is used as well  as new catalysts which undergo polymerization at low  temperatures.    Analyses of the environmental influences in production,  manufacturing and reprocessing were done before coming up with  an ecologically defensible product. This led to a reduction in  all environmental pollution of about 30 percent. It is hoped  that a reduction of around 50 percent can be reached by 1995. It  was taken into consideration that plastic foam can be  reprocessed by means of a chemical conversion.    A high quality polyalcohol is recovered which can be used  for  the production of a plastic foam with hard plasticity. This  plastic foam can then be used for thermal insulation in  buildings or in refrigerators or freezers. Since the energy  content of the new polyurethane corresponds approximately to  that of coal, ICI thinks it makes more sense to burn the  material when it is no longer of use than to dispose of it [as  waste in a landfill]. According to studies by Dr. Norman Grant,  Director of Earth Observation and Science at British Aerospace,  Space Division, the measurement data necessary for active  environmental protection can be obtained using modern methods of  spectroscopy combined with radar and other millimeter wavelength  frequency ranges. British Aerospace could make its extensive  experience in this area available and thereby substantially ease  the accumulation of precise measurement data.    This is also true for moisture measurements and the  determination of various gases, which are necessary before  industrial methods of production can be changed over to more  ecological methods. This can extend to being able to make an  immediate determination of the precise moisture and water  content of foods: no determination process with this level of  precision and operating in real time has been available until  now, as Grant said.    For example, radiometric microwave analyses can be made  without touching or destroying [the object of measurement] in  the range between 100 to 200 ppm in the frequency range between  140 to 250 gigahertz and up to 30 ppb in the frequencies between  22 and 140 gigahertz. This space flight technology of  measurement is tested and, according to Grant, ready to be put  into use in industry at a feasible cost.    Additional know-how comes from the English atomic industry:  within the framework of privatization and restructuring of the  AEA (Atomic Energy Authority), a (semi-private) National  Environmental Technology Center in Cullham was established and a  group of experts particularly experienced in planning work and  monitoring technology was gathered.    In addition to clients from industry, the center primarily  advises the EU Commission on environmental protection with  regard to the RDT (research, technology, development) activities  which are a part of the Maastricht Treaty. Part of these  managerial functions are thus paid for by Brussels out of the  comprehensive 12 billion ECU budget for 1994 to 1998.    Computerized monitoring systems recording [data for] all of  England come from military observations which are prepared and  offered for environmental work by Hunting Engineering in  Reddingswood/Bedford. The firm supposedly has at its disposal an  extremely precise set of maps. It was put together after 1984  together with meteorological data and stations for measuring  radiation.    It is organized in such a manner that government offices and  the public can be kept continually informed about all changes in  radioactive readings, Kevan F. Daykin, Director of Information  Systems, emphasized. Unfortunately, there is at this time no  possibility of connecting the German government's monitoring  network.    Waste Management International Services, Ltd., works with  the  broad range of methods and techniques for environmental  protection and with the clean-up of the soil and the waters. The  company helps businesses and governmental operations to choose  what is most suitable from all that is available in various  environmental techniques.    [Waste Management] has a great deal of experience in  cleaning  up contaminated soil and advised Exxon, among others, in the  removal of the destructive oil [spillage] after the Exxon Valdez  accident in Alaska. [Waste Management] is one example that  practical environmental protection can also be a profitable  business of international proportions.</p>

Dealing with the effects on Gansu of  the implementation of the tax-sharing system, Zhang Wule  believed that there are both advantages and disadvantages in  implementing the tax-sharing system stipulated by the central  authorities. There are, however, more advantages than  disadvantages. On the issue of the widening gap between eastern  and western China, Zhang Wule said that it is an existing fact;  however, through reform and opening up and by giving play to our  own advantages, we gradually may narrow the gap between  ourselves and the economically developed areas. Gansu is full  of confidence on that point. When Zhang Wule talked about the  relationships among reform, development, and stability, he said  that Gansu presently enjoys sound momentum in economic  development, nationality solidarity, political stability, social  progress, and reform and opening up, and that the situation is  favorable to the province.</p>

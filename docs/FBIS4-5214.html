			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 8 (YONHAP) -- Russia has asked North  Korea to allow its loggers in Siberia to carry passports and  move freely through the logging yards, a lawmaker said Wednesday.    Rep. Kang Sin-cho, chairman of a fact-finding subcommittee  of  the National Assembly's Committee on Foreign Affairs and  Reunification, made the remark after attending a closed-door  meeting with government officials.    He said Moscow is demanding that Pyongyang improve the human  rights of North Koreans working at logging yards in Siberia.    "On-the-spot examination by the fact-finding subcommittee of  the Siberian logging yards is a delicate matter related to  diplomatic relations between South Korea and Russia as well as  inter-Korean relations. Therefore, we plan to decide on when to  go to Siberia after fully consulting with the government," he  said.    Pyongyang is negotiating with Moscow to renew their forestry  agreement which expired at the end of last year, but Russia is  demanding that a new provision securing the human rights of  North Korean loggers be added to the new pact.    Some 16,000 to 20,000 North Koreans are working in  Pyongyang-run logging yards in Siberia, with hundreds having  escaped to roam throughout Russia or seeking asylum in South  Korea.</p>

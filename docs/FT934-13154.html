			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: DM lower on German rate cut FINANCIAL markets shifted gear yesterday as foreign exchange dealers were taken aback by a surprise rate cut by the German Bundesbank, writes Peter John. The decision to reduce the lower level discount rate to 5.75 per cent from 6.25 per cent, the upper level Lombard rate to 6.75 per cent from 7.25 per cent and the 14-day securities repurchase rate to 6.4 per cent from 6.67 per cent led to a sharp fall for the D-Mark against leading currencies. It also prompted a rash of rate cuts throughout continental Europe, with expectations of more to come. Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Italy and the Netherlands all followed Germany's lead. The Bundesbank announced a press conference yesterday but few economists anticipated any shift in key rates after Wednesday's variable repo was only reduced by three basis points to 6.67 per cent. When the rate news broke there was a wave of heavy short-term speculative selling of the D-Mark to buy dollars which sent the US currency up by a pfennig. That strength was followed through and dealers said the previous ceiling for the dollar of around DM1.6550 had now become the new floor. It closed nearly two pfennigs up at DM1.6635, and went on to end in New York at DM1.6671. The D-Mark's loss was the pound's gain in spite of growing conviction that the UK chancellor will cut base rates soon, possibly by as much as one percentage point, and therefore reduce the returns for holders of sterling. The pound ended 2.25 pfennigs higher at DM2.4725. The fact that sterling's rise reflected the German currency's weakness was underlined by its close against the dollar, down at Dollars 1.4870 from Dollars 1.49. By contrast, the Belgian franc, which has been the focus of speculative attacks over the past fortnight, failed to recover spectacularly. An early rally was undermined by news that unions had pulled out of negotiations on the social pact to hold down wages and reduce jobs. It was not until the National Bank of Belgium reduced its central rate to 9.4 per cent from 9.65 per cent and its discount rate by  1/2 percentage point to 6 per cent that the currency showed some signs of life. It had rallied by the close to BFr21.67 to the D-Mark, up from a previous BFr21.86. The French franc gained two centimes against the D-Mark to FFr3.5120. Mr Brian Hilliard of SGST, the French owned securities house, said: 'The fact that the franc appreciated will give the Bank of France heart that if it cuts rates the franc will hold steady.' The Dutch central bank cut official key rates by  1/4 percentage point and lowered its short-term special advances money market rate to 6.1 per cent from 6.4 per cent. The Danish krone recovered on anticipation that the central bank would cut its central rate from the current 8.5 per cent. The krone rose to DKr4.0255 to the D-Mark from DKr4.0592.</p>

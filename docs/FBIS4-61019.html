			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, 2 May, BNS -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on  Saturday [30 April] welcomed the signing of an agreement on  Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia.    The withdrawal package was signed by Presidents Guntis  Ulmanis of Latvia and Boris Yeltsin of Russia in Moscow on  Saturday.    Clinton in his foreign policy radio address the same day  called the Latvian-Russian agreement historic, adding that  "these and other promising developments were made possible, in  part, by American support and resolve."    The United States had an important role in helping to  overcome a deadlock during the talks on the issue of the Russian  early-warning radar station at Skrunda, Latvia.    The U.S. President at his visit to Moscow in January  received  Russia's proposal, according to which the facility remains under  Russian control for the next four years, plus for a 1.5-year  term necessary for its dismantling.    This proposal, later accepted by Latvia, was turned over in  Washington to Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis during his late  January-early February visit.</p>

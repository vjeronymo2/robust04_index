			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROTEST AGAINST COMEDIAN IS LOUD BUT ORDERLY  </P> <P> Demonstrators from Orange County gay and feminist groups protesting  controversial comedian Andrew Dice Clay's performance traded remarks with  concert-goers Saturday night, but the demonstration was otherwise peaceful.  </P> <P> About 30 protesters held signs and shouted slogans outside the Pacific  Amphitheatre to decry what they called Clay's hostile humor against gays, women  and minorities. The loud but orderly protest was staged by members of the  county chapter of ACT UP (AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power) and the South Coast  and Bayside chapters of the National Organization for Women.  </P> <P> The demonstration was the first one ever at the concert venue. Costa Mesa  police said they beefed up security with 12 additional officers, but the  demonstration proved calm, and there were no arrests.  </P> <P> Dave Barton, 30, one of the protest organizers and a member of ACT UP, said the  issue of Clay's humor goes beyond "gay bashing."  </P> <P> "His act promotes violence against women and minorities," Barton said. "I don't  believe in censorship, but I believe we have to alert the people to what he is  saying."  </P> <P> As demonstrators held signs reading "Jokes Kill" and "Words Kill," profane  insults were hurled at them by passing motorists and people arriving for the  concert.  </P> <P> "It doesn't make me feel too good to see the hatred of the people who are going  to this event," said Georgia Reed of the South Coast chapter of NOW. "But we  have to make a stand and show everyone that not everybody from Orange County  supports hate and violence against women."  </P> <P> Clay's style of humor has earned the scorn of gay and women's groups, who  contend that the comedian denigrates people. Clay, however, has said that he  has dropped his material about gays and that he sees nothing wrong with his  current act.  </P> <P> Although the protesters managed to turn a few heads, the majority of the  concert-goers seemed nonchalant about the demonstration and concerned only  about getting to their seats for the sold-out performance.  </P> <P> "I think this whole thing is overblown," said concert-goer Richard Pirics, 35,  of Huntington Beach, who has seen Clay once before. "He's just a comic. And I  really don't know what these people have against him."  </P> <P> Ritchie Black, 32, of Torrance was seeing Clay for the first time.  </P> <P> "It seems these people are far too sensitive," Black said. "I know lots of  Catholics who roar at a good Catholic joke. It's just comedy."  </P></p>

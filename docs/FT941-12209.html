			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Kantor in Tokyo to draw up 'framework' deal Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, yesterday flew to Tokyo at the head of a mission whose purpose is to conclude a 'framework' trade agreement with Japan before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa visits Washington on February 10-12. Talks in Washington last week by senior officials from both countries failed to produce any breakthrough on US demands that Japan accept sector-by-sector targets for greater access to Japan by US goods and services. It was agreed, however, that follow-up talks at ministerial level in Tokyo would be necessary. The US continues to insist officially that Japan improve market access and stimulate its economy. However, the political confusion that has gripped Japan over Mr Hosokawa's attempts to bring about political reform - resolved in a compromise bill only last weekend - has hampered US attempts to settle the framework issue. President Bill Clinton is seen as unwilling to undermine a prime minister whose reformist policies he has supported.</p>

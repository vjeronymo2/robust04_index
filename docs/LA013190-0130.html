			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FLENER HELPS TITANS WIN BASEBALL OPENER  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton and pitcher Huck Flener opened the baseball season  impressively, leading the Titans to a 6-1 victory over Cal Poly Pomona in a  nonconference game Tuesday at Titan Field.  </P> <P> Flener, a junior left-hander, allowed two hits and an unearned run in six  innings.  </P> <P> Bill Fitzgerald, Rich Faulks and Doug Ketchen each pitched an inning of relief.  </P> <P> Flener, who had four strikeouts, retired the final five batters he faced.  </P> <P> Flener gave credit for his strong outing to his improved changeup.  </P> <P> "It's a lot better than last year," he said. "(Last year) I threw it, but I  didn't have as much control. Now I can throw it when I'm behind in the count."  </P> <P> Fullerton scored four runs in the second inning. David Ayala and Mate Borgogno  each had two-run singles. Borgogno added an RBI single in the fourth, giving  Fullerton a 5-0 lead.  </P> <P> The Titans' final run came on Domingo Mota's home run over the left-field  fence.  </P> <P> Fullerton finished with 10 hits, including two each by Borgogno and Ayala.  </P> <P> "We played very well for the first time out," Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell  said.

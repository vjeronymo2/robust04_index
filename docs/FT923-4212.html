			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Consumer spending Exports and capital investment have never been leading candidates to drag the UK out of recession: this year's dreadful net trading performance and the size of the country's spare manufacturing capacity make them ever less plausible spurs to revival. Yesterday's credit figures for July, on the other hand, showing net lending of Pounds 78m after net repayments in June of Pounds 55m, provide just a glimmer of hope that consumers may yet do the trick. Admittedly one month's figure in this notoriously erratic series should not be overstated, and the three month trend has barely changed. On top of anecdotal evidence from retailers that non-food sales in August were not the disaster some were predicting, however, the credit numbers suggest that the bears may be unwise to pile on the gloom. It could be, of course, that the housing market rush to beat the August deadline for withdrawal of stamp duty relief inspired an exceptional burst of fridge and washing machine sales. But experience suggests this would come after people had moved into their houses rather than before. With houses in the south-east of England losing Pounds 1.14 of their value per hour (judging by the latest Halifax index) the recovery in any case may not come first from discretionary consumer durable purchases financed by credit cards and finance house loans. Small ticket items are probably the ones to watch.</p>

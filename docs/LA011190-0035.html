			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: AFFAIRS ONLY CREATE STRESS  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I'm a married man with two children, ages 9 and 14. Although  I still love my wife and certainly don't want to destroy my marriage and  family, I'm very attracted to a young woman I met. I'm contemplating having an  affair with her, but I'm not sure that I could stand the stress of constantly  having to lie to my wife and children. -- G.F.  </P> <P> DEAR G.F.: Extramarital affairs bring enormous stress on every member of the  family, even if by some miracle the facts are never brought out into the open.  Studies show that children of all ages suffer and that there is a profound  impact. Children are quick to sense that a parent is expending emotional energy  outside the family. They're apt to feel left out and rejected even though they  don't know what's wrong.  </P> <P> Researchers say girls who become aware of fathers' affairs seem to grow up  angry at men and unsure of relations with them, while boys, even though they're  extremely hurt and angry at the time, may eventually grow up to repeat the  pattern of infidelity.  </P> <P> It isn't unusual to be attracted to someone other than our spouses, but this  doesn't mean that we act out that attraction. The difference between sexual and  emotional maturity and immaturity is reflected in how we respond to such  feelings.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: One of my 12-year-old daughter's closest friends is in real  trouble at home. Her mother is deeply into drugs and I suspect she's supporting  her habit by prostitution. I think both my daughter and her friend are aware of  this, although they haven't mentioned it directly. What should I do, if  anything? -- W.T.  </P> <P> DEAR W.T.: Try to initiate a discussion by asking your daughter if her friend  is having difficulties at home. If you are sympathetic and understanding, your  daughter may open up and tell you what she knows. Make sure you emphasize to  her that what this child's mother does is not a reflection on the girl herself,  and that if you really like and trust a friend you stand by them.  </P> <P> If you admire this young girl, why not suggest that she'd be welcome to spend  some nights at your house if she wanted to and if her mother has no objections?  You can do this without embarrassing the girl and without directly discussing  her mother's problem, if you see that the youngster doesn't want to share this.  Eventually, she may be confident enough of your support to be honest with you  and even ask for your help.  </P> <P> If your suspicions are correct, this child may have to be in some kind of  foster care. She may even need legal help. Above all, don't desert her, and  reassure your daughter that trouble is a time for friends.  </P></p>

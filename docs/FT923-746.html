			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Hopes rise as South African leaders meet: An encounter that cannot be allowed to end in failure AFTER four fractious months of political bickering and daily deaths, the South African Government and the African National Congress (ANC) have agreed that their leaders, Mr FW de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, should meet - and that the meeting, to be held later today in Johannesburg, cannot be allowed to fail. White and black South Africans, fed up with the months of stalemate, will be relieved to see Mr de Klerk, the South African president, and Mr Mandela, the ANC President, shaking hands for the cameras for the first time since last May. There is always a chance that they will also see their leaders hurling insults at one another - as the two men did during the first session of constitutional negotiations earlier this year - but that seems unlikely. For senior officials from both sides have spent almost every waking moment for the past 10 days clearing away the political obstacles which could have tripped up the two presidents: issues such as preventing violence launched from single-sex township hostels, banning the carrying of dangerous weapons in public, and releasing political prisoners. They were under pressure throughout from western diplomats and from the United Nations to abandon the habit of intransigence and get back to substantive talks on a new constitution. Then, late on Thursday night, Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk were in contact to seal the final deal: three of the ANC's most celebrated guerrilla fighters are to be freed on Monday, with 150 less notorious prisoners to be released within 48 hours (124 were released yesterday). The two sides have also reached outline agreement on security measures for township hostels most often involved in violence, and for banning dangerous weapons in public. These agreements (especially the release of the three ANC guerrillas, all of whom staged terrorist attacks which claimed white victims), represent a substantial concession from the government, which insisted until the 11th hour that their immediate release was impossible. In the end, Pretoria's legal objections were overcome when it was agreed that they would leave jail on parole. Pretoria has placed other contentious issues on the summit agenda, including its demand for a general amnesty for state officials accused of political crimes as well as a demand that the ANC curtail its campaign of mass protest actions. The government argues that mass action provokes violence, and wants the ANC to abandon plans for further homeland protests. Mr Mandela is unlikely to commit himself publicly to halt mass action. But he has already put the campaign on hold in the hopes of success at the negotiating table: a planned march on Bophuthatswana has been delayed, and the ANC has pointedly refused to set a date for a march on Ulundi, the KwaZulu capital, the seat of Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who has issued veiled threats of bloodshed if the march proceeds. So the chances are that tomorrow's summit will succeed, and that Mr Mandela will afterwards declare the resumption of bilateral talks on a new constitution (informal talks have been going on despite the official suspension). But those negotiations - over an interim government and a constituent assembly - are likely to prove as difficult as ever. And even if the two sides reach agreement, they face the unenviable task of persuading the irascible Chief Buthelezi to accept a subordinate position in the new South Africa. So long as he refuses to do so, low-grade civil war will no doubt continue between his supporters and the ANC - and the fragile talks could again founder, as so often before, on the unsolved problem of violence.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Hanix forced to apply for protection of court HANIX Industry, a Japanese construction machinery manufacturer listed on the country's over-the-counter stock market, has been forced to file for court protection. The move reflects Japan's difficult business conditions and banks' cautious approach to lending to small compan-ies. Hanix announced it had filed with the Tokyo district court for protection under the corporate rehabilitation law. According to Teikoku Data Bank, a private credit research company, the group's liabilities totalled Y170bn (Dollars 1.54bn). It is the largest group to file for the protection of the courts this year. Mr Sakae Hirokawa, president of Hanix, blamed 'malicious credit reports' and allegations of tax evasion for prompting financial institutions and banks to stop loans and financial assistance. Teikoku Data Bank said Hanix's financial balance was eroded by a sharp drop in sales due to the slump in construction market.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Manchester supertram starts next week BRITAIN'S first supertram has been given approval by the government's railway inspectorate to start operating in Greater Manchester next Monday, after five postponements of the launch. Metrolink, the Pounds 135m light rail system, will run on normal railway lines to the city centre, where it will take to the streets. It still needs to obtain approval for street running from early May. The launch has been held up by a series of construction and operating difficulties, the final one of which was a need for more training for drivers. After several months of discussion about working practices, equipment and safety requirements, the railway inspectorate refused approval only four days before the system was due to start last week. Although less than two miles of track has been laid in the city centre, the supertram's economic significance is that it will link commuter services feeding into Manchester's termini. The project's financing, which has attracted much international interest, is in the form of a privatisation in which local councils have a stake. Metrolink has been developed on an innovatory 'design, build, operate and maintain' principle by a consortium of engineering and construction companies and local authorities. Private-sector participants have paid Pounds 5m to join the consortium, but the local transport authorities - and hence local councils - will get a share of the profits after certain thresholds are crossed.</p>

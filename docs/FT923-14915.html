			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: Laying the ghosts of the past - Video YES, IT is American Independence Day. But will America ever be independent of its past? In an intriguing new book by Dr Gertrude B. Atavus called America And Its Ghosts (Princeton Press), the author suggests that the closer America comes to the millennium's end - only 7 1/2 years to go - the further back American culture will continue to reach in order to lay the ghosts of the country's historical past. It is fascinating, in this light, to browse through July's movies on video. Robert Benton's Billy Bathgate performs exorcism rites over the golden age of gangsterdom with Dustin Hoffman as a barking mad Dutch Schultz in this intermittently stylish adaptation of EL Doctorow's novel. Mike Figgis's moody thriller Liebestraum is about a haunted small-town department store and the spooks of a long-ago sexual scandal and murder. In For The Boys Bette Midler and James Caan are a song-and-dance team trouping through US history from the Second World War to the present day. And Sean Penn's film-making debut The Indian Runner is the powerful tale of a good and a bad brother (David Morse, Viggo Mortensen) haunted by a past that ranges from ancestral Indian memories to Vietnam. Penn's film, the best of the bunch, should silence those who regard him merely as an ex-Madonna appendage with a talent for delinquency. The Indian Runner has its share of mumbled dialogue and crumbly structure. But it is also vividly believable. This is a back-of-beyond town sighing with recessionary despair and prairie winds: a place where the oldies (Sandy Dennis and Charles Bronson as the boys' parents) deal out wisdom they do not believe, while the youngsters seek the point where the new America started to grow away from the old. No art has more facility than cinema in dealing with the past. It combines the expositional fluidity of literature with the emotional immediacy of music. It presents dream, memory and reality alike as a tactile continuous present. If you were to devote your viewing month to one film only, it should be to Andrei Tarkovsky's Nostalgia (Artificial Eye). The writer hero (Oleg Jankovsky) is a Russian self-exiled in Italy, as Tarkovsky himself was at the time. Through landscapes brittle with ruin, he wanders, remembers, dreams; he yearns for his family and homeland; and he performs surreal acts of faith as in the extraordinary sequence of his walking across an abandoned hotel spa pool with a guttering candle that must stay alight. This is a candidate for my favourite scene in modern cinema. You can detect the actor's own nervousness as Tarkovsky, unseen and unheard, demands that he enact the impossible. As the minutes tick on, the flickering candle grows from a single, potentially glib emblem of human faith into a hypnotic dramatic and symbolic epicentre. In a Hollywood-dominated age, serious world cinema has too long played Cinderella to the seven ugly sisters (Columbia, Paramount, 20th Century Fox and Co). How good, then, to hear that the British Film Institute in collaboration with Piper-Heidsieck Champagne is about to launch on video a Classic Film Collection. The aim, they announce, is 'to increase access to the best of world cinema by creating new prints in pristine condition, available for authorised screenings.' Two hundred films are planned for release over four years and the first three 'seasons' will consist of British Hitchcock, Early Kurosawa and The Freed Unit (alias the vintage MGM musicals made under music chief Arthur Freed). The good news here is not just that these classics will be available - some are already - but that they will be restored and springcleaned. As all devout home viewers know, we are prone to the suspicion each time we take out a video that we are seeing the worst run-off of the worst copy of the worst print in history. Often this is true, and it is no way to respect the cinema's past. As Dr Gertrude B. Atavus says in her book, 'The past is not a mere prefix to the present, dusty and disposable, but a living part of its syntax, significance and sensory system.'</p>

Recently, a manager in charge of Shanghai's industrial  administrative department was interviewed by this reporter, and  he disclosed that Shanghai's plans will focus on the need to  change the management mechanisms to set up a modern enterprise  system. In deepening enterprise reform, different types of  enterprises will adopt different measures, so that big  enterprises are strengthened, the small ones become more  versatile, the good ones are organized, and the bad ones are  eliminated.    This reform measure of providing different guidance will be  implemented in conjunction with the continued implementation of  the "Provision" in enterprises and as they change their  management mechanisms. Upon organizing and perfecting some  enterprise groups, mainstay industries and key trades and  industries and large enterprises that have attained economies of  scale to some extent and whose products have already captured  fairly large market shares will be the first to be empowered to  manage state-owned assets; the holding company pilot projects  will be expanded. The management format of smaller state-owned  enterprises that are not large in scale but have a good future  will become even more versatile. Some can be reorganized into  shareholding cooperative enterprises; some can adopt the method  of leasing and become state-owned, civilian-operated  enterprises; some may try transferring their property rights to  the collectives or individuals in a step-by-step process.  Emphasis will be put on state-owned enterprises that are  relatively profitable and have had clear success in changing  their mechanisms; they will be turned into corporations. A set  of scientific and standardized organizational system and  management system pertaining to decisionmaking, implementation,  and supervision will be set up so that enterprises truly have  property rights in assets as legal persons. Enterprises that are  inefficient, that are poorly managed, that have no hopes of  turning around, and cannot be turned into corporations, should  be merged, drastic restructured, auctioned off, or declare  bankruptcy, or be leased out or reorganized in order to optimize  the composition of the stock of state-owned assets and preserve  and propagate their value.    Reportedly, thorough reform of Shanghai's industrial  enterprises produced new results last year. Various pilot reform  projects, with a heavy emphasis on yang (imitations  of the three kinds of wholly and partially foreign-owned  enterprises), gu (the shareholding system), and  bao (the contract system), were installed in the  state-owned industrial enterprises. Almost all enterprises have  begun reforming their labor, personnel, and allocation systems.  Enterprise management autonomy as stipulated in the "Provisions"  has been handed down in most cases. However development is  uneven, and good enterprises are covering up for the bad ones  and good businesses are covering up for bad businesses. For this  reason, Shanghai's industrial management department has taken  initial steps to set new goals to put more force on reform this  year. Municipality-wide, around 600 state-owned enterprises will  basically change their management mechanisms and begin to take  inventory to determine fund sources. Ten enterprise groups will  be selected to serve as experimental points and will be  empowered to manage state-owned properties. Ten will pilot the  modern enterprise system, and another ten will pilot the  directional capital-raising shareholding system. In addition, 10  larger-scale enterprises with sound foundations will be  nominated to be among the 100 national enterprises to pilot the  modern enterprise system.    To realize this year's new enterprise reform goal, the pilot  enterprises will comply with the needs of standardization and  implement a series of reform with respect to the organizational  system, management system, and labor, personnel, and  distribution systems, so that gradually property rights are  clearly delineated, government and enterprises are separated,  and enterprises will have management autonomy, be able to take  care of their own profits and losses, initiate their own  development, and discipline their own behavior. Other  enterprises will also actively create conditions to accelerate  the change in mechanisms, set up a modern enterprise system that  meets the demands of the market economy, and strive for new  breakthroughs in the enterprise system. Reportedly, many  enterprises have contacted the relevant departments to volunteer  their services.</p>

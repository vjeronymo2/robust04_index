			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Players line up for Adidas action / Examining a crucial week for Bernard Tapie's group WHEN Mr Bernard Tapie, the flamboyant French entrepreneur and politician, announced two years ago that he was buying Adidas, one of the world's leading sporting goods groups, it looked like the biggest coup of his business career. Today, the Adidas acquisition looks more like nemesis for Mr Tapie, who was last month forced to resign from the French cabinet because of an alleged fraud case. His business reputation has suffered as Bernard Tapie Finances (BTF), his holding company, desperately struggles to make disposals to meet the deadlines on its Adidas debt. Adidas itself is clouded by rumours of bids, counter-bids, redundancies and resignations while Mr Tapie decides whether he can afford to hold on to it. This week will be critical. Yesterday, there was a stormy meeting of BTF's shareholders who asked why the company had fallen from net profits of FFr47.97m in 1990 to a net loss of FFr294.9m (Dollars 56.9m) in 1991, how disposals plans were progressing, and whether it would be able to meet its debt schedule. Today, there will be another shareholders' meeting, this time at Adidas. Its investors will want to know why the company's profits fell - from DM90m to DM44m - last year and about the mysterious DM1bn management buy-out bid unveiled by Mr Rene Jaggi, Adidas' chief executive, on Friday. Most of all, they will want to know whether Mr Tapie plans to hold on to his controlling 55 per cent stake or if he will be forced to sell it to pay off the debt incurred to buy Adidas in the first place. Before the Adidas deal, Mr Tapie was seen as one of France's most successful entrepreneurs. By 1989 He had created a company with net profits of FFr27.7m, sales of FFr1bn, and estimated debt of FFr300m. Adidas was much bigger, with sales of DM4.6bn in 1989. It was also in the red with estimated losses of DM120m. Mr Tapie had to borrow at least FFr2.2bn to buy it. He trumpeted his acquisition with the proud promises that he would keep Adidas, and his investment, intact. Less than a year later he was negotiating not only to sell some of its subsidiaries but also 40 per cent of Adidas to a consortium of investors, notably Pentland, the UK consumer products group, which emerged with a 20 per cent holding and pre-emptive rights over the remaining Tapie stake. Meanwhile, the original BTF was disappearing as Mr Tapie sold off its businesses to pay off his short-term debt on Adidas. By the end of 1991 BTF, which had lost FFr295m during the year, had net debt of FFr3.64bn and shareholders' funds of FFr1.72bn. But Mr Tapie had managed to make his short-term repayments. Earlier this month, when BTF's results were published, Mr Tapie sought to lighten the gloom of its losses by announcing that he would make the final FFr615m repayment a month ahead of the scheduled date of August 6. BTF has already raised FFr365m through a series of disposals and plans to raise the remaining FFr250m by selling its Testut-Teraillon weighing machine business and Scaime, a small industrial concern. BTF claims that it can still make the FFr615m payment ahead of schedule. Even so, it will still be left with substantial net debt and with Adidas as its only remaining business. This raises doubts about Mr Tapie's ability to hold on to Adidas. Last month Mr Tapie confirmed that he might consider selling Adidas. Pentland immediately presented itself as a prospective purchaser 'at the right price'. Devanlay, the French textile group, has since expressed interest in Adidas' clothing interests. But on Friday Mr Tapie announced he had received a management buy-out offer. Mr Jaggi confirmed that he had tabled a DM1bn bid with a deadline of today. Adidas, the company for which Mr Tapie risked - and may have lost - everything, is waiting to hear its fate. Mr Tapie himself is keeping an uncharacteristically low profile. He did not attend yesterday's BTF meeting, and at the weekend was quoted in a French newspaper as saying that he was tempted to go to his yacht and sail away. BTF, Mr Bernard Tapie's holding company, yesterday confirmed it was considering selling its controlling stake in Adidas. Mr Elie Fellous, who took over as chairman of BTF in April told shareholders that the board was considering three offers for Adidas. Mr Fellous did not comment on the identity of the prospective purchasers, except to confirm that BTF had received a DM1bn bid for its stake in Adidas from the management team led by Mr Jaggi.  Mr Fellous said that the news of the Jaggi bid had 'elicited two other offers' for the company. Pentland Holdings said it had not tabled 'a viable offer'.  Mr Frank Farrant, finance director, said that Pentland 'had not seen any of the three offers'. BTF's shares were suspended at FFr130 on Friday.  The company said they would remain suspended until it had reached a decision about the future of Adidas.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In its third working day today, 28 May, the  National Assembly held a plenary session at the Conference Hall  to continue debate on the remainder of the draft labor code,  from Chapter VI onward. The session directed by National  Assembly Vice Chairman Phung Van Tuu.    The views expressed by National Assembly deputies focused on  accepting workers returning from military service, on the  question of female workers, and on several other issues.    Deputies Pham Van Tra of Haiphong and Truong Thi Khue of  Quang Tri proposed that the labor code specify that all relevant  firms accept workers returning from fulfilling military  obligations to encourage youths to comply with the military  service law.    Deputy Chu The Quynh of Hanoi said: Article 126 in Chapter  XI, which deals with artistic workers, is not specific enough.  We must clearly point out that we do not set the years of  service needed for artistic workers to retire, but we will only  fix the period of their social security contributions.    On behalf of the Vietnam Women's Union Central Committee,  Deputy Vo Thi thang of Long An presented the views of the  Women's Union on the question of female workers. She earnestly  asked the National Assembly to pass the chapter on female  workers in the labor code.    Deputy H' Nghia of Gia Lai proposed that the labor code have  stipulations on providing vocational training for ethnic  minority workers.    Deputy Dang Khoi of Nam Ha proposed that the labor code  clearly stipulate that firms have the responsibility of making  contributions to the unemployment allowance fund. This will  provide prompt assistance for workers and help the government  specify the amount of contributions to be made by each type of  firm.    Deputy Phung Van Toan of Vinh Phu suggested that the tenth  day of the third lunar month -- the death anniversary of our  ancestral Hung kings -- be declared an official holiday so  workers can get full pay on that day.    Deputy Hoang Duc Hy of Tuyen Quang proposed that the  following clause be added to Article 174 on labor strikes: If a  labor strike is regarded as illegal, both the organizer and the  strikers concerned must compensate their relevant employers for  losses, and so forth.</p>

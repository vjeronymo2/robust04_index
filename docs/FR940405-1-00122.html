			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (g) proposes to require employers to provide special training for workers involved in maintenance activities and those involved in HVAC system operations, and to provide certain pertinent information to all employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (g)(1) proposes to require that maintenance and HVAC operations personnel be trained in the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) required to be worn; training on how to maintain adequate ventilation of exhaust fumes during building cleaning and maintenance; and training of maintenance personnel on how to minimize adverse effects on indoor air quality during the use and disposal of chemicals and other agents [Exs. 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;41, 3&hyph;347, 3&hyph;415, 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;440, 3&hyph;444B, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;502].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (g)(2) proposes to require that all employees shall be informed of the contents of the standard and its appendices, signs and symptoms associated with building-related illness, and the requirement under proposed subparagraphs (d)(12) and (d)(13) which directs the employer to evaluate the effectiveness of the building systems, if necessary, upon receipt of complaints from employees of building-related illness [Exs. 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;347, 3&hyph;412, 3&hyph;415, 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;444B, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;529]. The information proposed to be provided under this subparagraph need not be conveyed to employees through formal training sessions or courses. Informing employees can be accomplished, for example, through written means such as fact sheets, memos, or posted bulletins. OSHA will provide in a non-mandatory appendix to the final rule an example illustrating what information is to be provided to employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (g)(3) proposes to require that the employer make training materials developed under these provisions, including the standard and its appendices, available for inspection and copying by employees, designated employee representatives, the Director, and the Assistant Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Training and information requirements are routine components of OSHA health standards. The inclusion of training and information requirements reflects the Agency's conviction, as noted above, that informed employees are essential to the operation of any effective health program. OSHA believes that informing and training employees about the hazards to which they are exposed will contribute substantially to reducing the incidence of diseases caused by workplace conditions. Further, as noted earlier, it has been OSHA's experience that unacceptable indoor air quality is often the result of deficiencies in implementing effective HVAC system operation and maintenance programs. The Agency believes that specialized training of workers performing those activities is, therefore, necessary to ensure successful performance of their jobs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Recordkeeping: Paragraph (h)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (h) proposes to require that employers maintain records of: All written information regarding the IAQ compliance program required to be established under paragraph (c); inspection and maintenance records required to be established under paragraph (d) [Ex. 3&hyph;26], which must include the specific remedial or maintenance actions taken, the name and affiliation of the individual performing the work, and the date of the inspection or maintenance activity; and records of employee complaints of building-related illness required to be established under paragraph (c)(5) of this section [Ex. 3&hyph;502].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h) also proposes to require the employer to retain these for at least the previous three years [Ex. 3&hyph;502], except that operation, maintenance, inspection, and compliance program records need not be retained for three years if rendered obsolete by the establishment and replacement of more recent records, or rendered irrelevant due to HVAC system replacement or redesign. The records required to be maintained by the employer are to be made available to employees and their designated representative and the Assistant Secretary for examination and copying.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, paragraph (h)(6) proposes to require that whenever the employer ceases to do business records that are required to be maintained by the employer are to be provided to and retained by the successor employer [Ex. 3&hyph;440B].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 8 (c) of the Act authorizes OSHA to require employers to make, keep, and preserve, and make available to the Secretary or the Director records regarding their activities as prescribed by regulation as appropriate and necessary for the enforcement of the Act or for developing information regarding the causes and prevention of occupational illnesses. As noted earlier, the Agency believes that development of written compliance plans are essential to implementation of a successful IAQ program. The written compliance program, inspection and maintenance records, and operator and maintenance schedules which are required to be established under the proposal, are required to be retained under this paragraph. This information essentially documents the desired performance levels of HVAC systems, and the measures necessary to maintain those levels of performance, as well as other measures which should be followed to ensure acceptable indoor air quality. Such data must be available for use by designated persons, current employers, successor employers, and employees as a blueprint for program implementation. Without such data, air quality problems would likely arise due to ignorance of such elements as design occupant densities, equipment schedules, maintenance requirements and frequencies, etc. Records required to be established in response to employee complaints of building-related illness are also required to be retained under this paragraph. Such complaints require the employer to evaluate the need for, and to take if necessary, remedial action to correct observed problems [Ex. 3&hyph;1, 3&hyph;444B]. Information regarding employee illness is essential in identifying causal factors and trends in adverse health effects. Retention of this health data will aid in the recognition, evaluation and correction of indoor air quality deficiencies which lead to building-related illnesses. Records of building-related illness are proposed to be required to be retained for at least the previous 3 years. OSHA believes that requiring record retention for 3 years of building-related illnesses which occur in nonindustrial environments is reasonable. Such illnesses are not viewed in the same context as industrial illnesses which may be associated with long latency periods, and thus necessitate very long retention periods for health records. Establishment and maintenance of building-related illness records is primarily for the purpose of documenting indoor air quality degradation, so that corrective action can be taken. Requiring records to be retained to preserve a 3 year history of building-related illness, is proposed as being reasonable to aid in the tracking of air quality trends and past experiences [Ex. 3&hyph;502].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other records are also required to be retained for at least the previous 3 years, except to the extent they become obsolete. OSHA does not believe that records such as maintenance and operating schedules which become irrelevant due to HVAC system modification or replacement need be retained further. The records required to be retained under this paragraph must be transferred to successor employers. Since these records contain information specific to the building or facility, as opposed to specific employers, such records should be maintained within affected buildings for future use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Dates: Paragraph (i)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (i) proposes to establish an effective date for this standard of sixty (60) days from publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . A start-up date one year from the effective date is proposed as an adequate period of time for employers to achieve full compliance with all provisions under the rule. The Agency believes that affected employers can develop and implement compliance programs, establish designated smoking areas if smoking is not prohibited, and train employees as proposed under the standard within a one year period from the effective date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Appendices: Paragraph (j)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

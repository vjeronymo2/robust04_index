			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment 7 also contains a definition of overfishing for white shrimp; procedures for revising the overfishing indices for brown, white, and pink shrimp, as required by 50 CFR part 602.11(c); and specific actions to be taken if overfishing for brown, white, pink, or royal red shrimp occurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These additional measures in Amendment 7 do not require implementing regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional background and rationale for the measures discussed above are contained in Amendment 7, the availability of which was announced in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 4, 1994 (59 FR 39724).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Measures Proposed by NMFS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS proposes the following changes to the existing regulations implementing the FMP that would clarify and conform them to current usage and enhance enforcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In &sect;658.1, the purpose and scope of the regulations would be restated. In &sect;658.2, unused definitions would be removed, the geographical extent of the Gulf of Mexico EEZ would be clarified, titles and addresses in the definitions for ``Regional Director'' and ``Science and Research Director'' would be corrected, the definition for ``shrimp'' would be clarified, and the scientific name for royal red shrimp would be changed to conform to current standards of the American Fisheries Society. In &sect;658.3, relation to other laws would be revised. In &sect;658.4, explanation that a permit is not required to fish for shrimp would be restated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In &sect;658.5, the requirements for reporting by vessel owners and operators and by dealers and processors would clarify that the specified information must be provided when requested. The current practice, whereby fishery reporting specialists, as designees of the Science and Research Director, collect information by interviewing owners/operators and dealers/processors would not be changed. Since these specialists are able to ascertain and record areas fished with the required specificity, the requirement that fishing areas be reported to these specialists in terms of statistical area would be removed and the definition of statistical area, including the depiction of the areas in Figure 5, would be removed. Other changes in &sect;658.5(b) are proposed for clarity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;658.6, the requirements for vessel identification would be restated and such identification would be required on vessels fishing for rock, royal red, and seabob shrimp. In &sect;658.7, the prohibitions would be restated and prohibitions would be added: (1) Regarding placing material in the water or using fishing gear in a manner to obstruct fishing or damage vessels and gear and (2) on making a false statement to an authorized officer. In subpart B_Management Measures, all sections would be reordered and restated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The closure provisions for the royal red shrimp fishery, currently at &sect;658.21(c), would be revised to clarify that a closure of the fishery would be effective on the date specified in the closure notice. While the effective date of a closure is usually later than the date the notice is filed with the Office of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , such closure may be effective as early as that date. NMFS also proposes to clarify the provisions that apply after a closure and add a prohibition regarding illegal activities after a closure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Two names and two positions of aids to navigation used as points to designate the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary, currently at &sect;658.22, would be corrected to reflect the names and positions for such aids to navigation in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Closures of the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary, the area off the southwestern coast of Florida, the shrimp/stone trap separation zones off the western coast of Florida, and off the Texas coast, currently at &sect;&sect;658.22, 658.23, and 658.25, are stated in terms of ``trawl fishing,'' ``trawl gear,'' ``fish(ing) for shrimp,'' and ``trawl fishing,'' respectively. For uniformity and clarity, NMFS proposes to restate the closures, in each case prohibiting ``trawling.'' For the closures of the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary, the area off the southwestern coast of Florida, and off the Texas coast, the change in terminology is not substantive. For the closures of the shrimp/stone crab separation zones, the change would ease a restriction, in that fishing for shrimp by traps would not be prohibited in the zones/times in which fishing for shrimp is currently prohibited. In terms of gear separation, which is the purpose of the shrimp/stone crab separation zones, fixed gear and trawling would continue to be separated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Recession and recovery INFLATION IS yesterday's problem. This is the new conventional view in Anglo-Saxon economies, but not only in these economies, since it is also held by many in Japan and continental Europe as well. Now, it is argued, the priority must be growth. This may be the new conventional wisdom. But it is not universally shared, something that residents of inflation-prone countries should remember. Some of those who do not give the idea allegiance also possess the power to thwart its application. Most important among them are Mr Helmut Schlesinger and his colleagues at the Bundesbank. The need to shift attention from the control of inflation to the promotion of economic growth had long been urgently argued by the outgoing Bush administration. Mr Clinton's new administration is likely to be still more enthusiastic, though its zeal for action may be blunted by the continuing run of good economic data. As for Mr Major, just a month - together with the collapse of his ERM policy - was enough to shift him from his target of 'zero inflation' to his new 'strategy for growth'. Countries like Germany, which have avoided U-turns as shameless as Britain's, have also avoided the stop-go cycles that tend to be their consequence. The Bundesbank is determined to prevent the mistakes associated with unification from ruining its historic achievement. It will not respond to the evidence of recession by slashing interest rates in the British manner. Evidence of recession is more likely to make the Bundesbank feel grim satisfaction, since it believes that consumer price inflation remains about double the tolerable level. The figures for German gross domestic product in the third quarter show that the country is in recession, defined in the classic manner as two successive quarters of negative economic growth. But the Bundesbank does not believe that the recession will be a deep one. This complacency is not universally shared. The respected Ifo institute has argued this week that manufacturing output will fall 1 1/2 per cent this year and then fall by up to 3 per cent between this year and next. Dark clouds For the Bundesbank, even such a black cloud would have a silver lining. Wage settlements should fall quite swiftly and have, indeed, started to do so. IG Metall, the country's most powerful union, has accepted a deal in the steel industry of between 3 and 4 per cent over 18 months. This followed a still more encouraging 12-month, 4.2 per cent agreement in the less internationally exposed insurance industry. The question is how swiftly the Bundesbank will now ease. Remember that it was established to protect the German people from the vagaries of German politicians and is convinced that those politicians have been more than usually irresponsible in their handling of unification. It will be inclined towards a tight policy as long as there is any inflationary danger, pretty well regardless of the domestic and international consequences. Investors aware of the longer term prospects for German interest rates have let the D-Mark lose about eleven per cent of its value against the dollar since late September. Even the pound sterling has found what seems to be a secure floor at DM2.40 and closed yesterday little short of DM2.50. Domestic inflation For currencies within the ERM, the external weakening of the D-Mark, though helpful in terms of overall competitiveness, does little to relax the current squeeze. D-Mark interest rates continue to set the floor for almost all of them. The hope of Germany's partners must be that the recession will be as deep as some Germans now fear. Only a deep recession is likely to bring German inflation and so the Bundesbank's interest rates down quickly enough to ensure the survival of the current parities. Mr Schlesinger's remarks this week strongly suggest that foreign exchange intervention will not secure this outcome. It must be strange for the French government to find itself praying for a German recession. But these are strange times in Europe. What it sees across the channel must further convince the British government of the good side of sterling's eviction from the ERM. There are even signs of green shoots: car sales are up; monetary growth is up; the equity market is up; even the pound is up. Unhappily, unemployment is also up, with 17,500 job losses announced on Thursday alone. But that is bound to continue for a long time. For all the better news in the UK, the traditional wisdom of the Bundesbank should not be forgotten. Higher inflation will not bring an enduring improvement in economic performance, as the British of all people must know. What is more, British inflation is no better than the German even now. If this is to be an enduring recovery, not just another flash in the pan, underlying inflation must continue to fall. Many hope it will; but many fear it will not. Much depends on wages. The government hopes for rapid recovery now. But it should also remember how past dashes for growth have ended.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Five on trial in Singapore secrets case THE EDITOR of Singapore's leading financial newspaper, one of his journalists and three prominent economists went on trial yesterday, charged under the Official Secrets Act with illegally disclosing Singapore's economic growth figure. The case is seen as an indicator of the present level of press freedom in Singapore. In a rare appearance in a district court, Attorney-General Chan Sek Keong charged Business Times (BT) editor Patrick Daniel with breaching the act by receiving the data and 'communicating' the information to readers. Mr Chan said a top government economist illegally revealed a preliminary projection of a quarterly economic growth figure, known as a 'flash estimate,' to a private economist who then passed it on to a BT journalist. Part of the reason he was personally prosecuting the case was to maintain and establish 'an important principle. 'It is that persons who have been entrusted with classified information of whatever nature in their official duties must keep them secret.' Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, director of the economic department of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the de facto central bank, is accused of communicating the figure to Mr Manu Bhaskaran, an economist at the regional brokerage Crosby Securities. The other defendants are Mr Daniel, BT journalist Mr Kenneth James, and another Crosby economist, Mr Raymond Foo. The five pleaded not guilty. The charges stem from an investigation by Singapore's Internal Security Department (ISD) into a June 29 BT article which accurately forecast second-quarter economic growth of 4.6 per cent. An official announcement was made only in August. Mr Bhaskaran and Mr Foo are charged with three counts of possessing and communicating the data. Mr Daniel and Mr James, a Malaysian, face two charges each of possessing, disseminating and publishing the data on June 29. A conviction for each charge carries a maximum penalty of two years in jail and a SDollars 2,000 (Pounds 836) fine. Singapore has other controls on the press. An act gives the government control over the board of directors of any locally-published newspaper and lets it revoke a paper's licence to operate. The government has curbed circulation of several foreign publications involved in disputes with it. Invoking the Official Secrets Act has reinforced a widespread belief that, in spite of Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's protestations that he is trying to create a kinder Singapore, anything which smacks of insubordination is liable to be pounced on. Mr Lee Kwan Yew, former premier, has suggested reporters would not have had the temerity to publish government figures ahead of schedule when he was prime minister. He said journalists were testing Mr Goh.</p>

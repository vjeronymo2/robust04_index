			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Kenya opens to foreign investors Kenya said yesterday it would allow foreign investment on its stock exchange, a key demand by donors which underwrite annual aid of Dollars 800m (Pounds 488m). The move, from January 1, was announced by President Daniel arap Moi at a rally to mark 31 years of independence from British rule. It came two days before a meeting in Paris of western donors which will examine Kenya's economic performance in the last year and, if satisfied, pledge aid for the next year. The president said such investment would not exceed 20 per cent of total company share capital. Mr Moi said he had also directed his minister of finance to allow private foreign exchange bureaux from January 1995. This follow a series of economic reforms by the government, including floating the currency and removal of import and export trade barriers.</p>

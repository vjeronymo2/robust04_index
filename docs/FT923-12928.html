			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bundesbank casts shadow over continental equities TODAY's Bundesbank meeting is to be followed by a press conference, which implies there is something to discuss in Frankfurt. This kept bourses muted yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT slowed to a crawl; a Bundesbank board member repeated the official exhortation that M3 growth was too high, and the DAX index retreated to close 0.52 higher at 1,734.62, after a 0.81 rise to 687.13 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover fell from DM4.2bn to DM3.9bn. Retailers improved after a first half increase of 8.7 per cent in sales from Karstadt, which also said that it saw the first signs of improving consumer sentiment in June. Karstadt rose DM10.50 to DM645.50, Kaufhof by DM5.50 to DM515.50 and Douglas by DM25 to DM570. Mr Adrian Hopkinson at County NatWest said that investors were looking at higher German consumer spending power in the second half of this year; aware that the fall in the dollar emphasises this point; and more comfortable with domestically oriented stocks as the cyclicals, which make up the great bulk of the German market, come into question. Among special situations, the tyremaker, Continental, dropped DM8 or 3 per cent to DM255.80 after a German court of appeals effectively upheld Conti's 5 per cent limit on shareholder voting rights. PARIS resumed trading after a four-day weekend and followed the bond market lower in dull trading. The CAC 40 index fell 6.18 to 1,853.26 in turnover of FFr1.5bn. Hachette, the debt-laden French media group which plans to merge with the defence group, Matra, was one of the day's more prominent losers, dropping FFr8 or 6.8 per cent to FFr109. Dealers attributed the sharp fall to mounting speculation that the stock will be removed from the CAC 40 index by the end of the year. Euro Disney fell FFr2.80 to FFr103 on rumours of disappointing hotel occupancy. MILAN recovered some of its opening losses but closed the July trading account lower as industrials came under selling pressure after Tuesday's gains. The Comit index fell 2.58 to 445.42 in turnover estimated at more than Tuesday's L95.4bn. Fiat dipped L49 to L5,211 and fell to L5,160 after hours. Stocks controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti were also weaker, with Olivetti dropping L55 to L3,010. Among telecoms. Stet fell L17 to L1,620 but Italcable remained firm after the company's upbeat presentation on Monday, adding L50 to L4,660. ZURICH softened its opinions and hardened its share prices. The SMI index rose 9.3 to 1,844.4 as expectations receded that the Bundesbank would tighten its credit policy; and bearers in the temporary employment group, Adia, under strong pressure recently on a poor view of 1992, topped the active list as it recovered SFr14 to SFr230. Dealers said that speculators appeared to be playing the share, making it very volatile. MADRID tumbled, driven sharply lower by concern over the Spanish economy, including yesterday's 40.4 per cent increase in the January to June budget deficit. The general index fell 3.47 to 231.07. There were continued heavy falls, some of 10 per cent or more in the construction sector, an obvious victim of budget cuts, but dealers noted that the losses hit banking, and the traditional safe haven of utilities, as well. AMSTERDAM was quietly firmer as the CBS Tendency index added 0.5 to 122. BRUSSELS ended mostly higher in light trading as investors awaited signals on European interest rates from the Bundesbank. The Bel-20 index rose 6.67 to 1,171.86 in slim turnover of BFr478m. More than a quarter of turnover was accounted for by Petrofina, which rose BFr25 to BFr11,000. OSLO jumped 2 per cent from a 1992 low, buoyed by foreign buying of Norsk Hydro and Hafslund Nycomed. The all-share rose 7.69 to 391.99 in turnover of NKr235m. HELSINKI hit its second consecutive 1992 low, the Hex index falling 6.0 to 729.4. VIENNA fell to new 1992 lows ahead of today's Bundesbank council meeting. The ATX index fell 3.75 to its second consecutive record closing low of 860.11. TEL AVIV rose sharply for the second consecutive day in very high turnover. Declarations that Israel would get US loan guarantees, and the reaction to a mild 0.1 per cent consumer price index rise in June left the blue chip index 2.61, or 1.7 per cent higher at in turnover of Shk163.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUL 15                              Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open     10.30am   11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1124.73  1124.86  1124.20  1123.66  1123.72  1123.58  1123.95  1122.53                 Day's High  1124.97    Day's Low  1121.98       Jul 14        Jul 13       Jul 10        Jul 9         Jul 8      1124.22        1121.63      1129.14       1128.17      1121.53  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

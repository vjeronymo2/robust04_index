			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 11 May (NA) -- Economy Minister Domingo  Cavallo said today that Chile had not received a formal proposal  to join Mercosur [Common Market of the South], although the need  to make concrete progress in the creation of a free trade zone  between the countries was discussed.    Cavallo thus minimized the impact of the remarks he made on  9  May [as received], in which he emphasized that Chile "has all  the conditions for joining" Mercosur.    Cavallo's proposal thus admits free trade zone negotiations  by Mercosur, on one hand, and Chile on the other.    The finance minister admitted that it would be difficult for  Chile "to join Mercosur, as it would probably introduce  uncertainty into the tariff issue, an area in which Chile has  been very successful with its own policies."    Cavallo said that during the meeting with his Chilean  counterpart Eduardo Aninat he discussed "the real progress in  trade and in all other kinds of relations between Argentina and  the other member countries of Mercosur."    Cavallo said that free trade negotiations might be the most  suitable path, but the two countries are also working on others,  including "our geographical integration through the Andean  passes, feasibility studies for transport projects, energy  integration projects, and improvement in our countries'  investment climates."    Regarding the latter, Cavallo said that an agreement might  be  reached with the signing of a mutual investment protection  treaty which would eliminate current obstacles.    During a news conference with Chilean journalists, Cavallo  ardently defended the scheme of a fixed foreign exchange rate, a  mechanism that was dropped by Chile because of the poor results  obtained.    He stressed that "Argentina does not have a single currency  requirement" but a free choice system, adding that this assures  us that governments "will not devaluate" the peso.    Cavallo also reiterated that in 1994 the country will have  an  inflation rate of "3 percent or less," and forecast that  Argentina will close the year with a significant economic growth  rate.    Asked whether some social groups are paying the price for  the  adjustment, Cavallo said that social explosions such as the one  in Santiago de Estero were made "against corruption and bad  provincial administrations, and not against the convertibility  plan."    "People have not reacted against the economic plan because  they realize the benefits of stability and growth," the minister  added.    Cavallo said that the proof that Argentina offers favorable  conditions is the fact that "more than 200,000 foreigners" had  emigrated to the country in the past few years.    The minister added that public support was evident in the  1991, 1993, and 10 April 1994 elections.    Cavallo concluded by saying that the Justicialist Party will  again win the presidential election in 1995.</p>

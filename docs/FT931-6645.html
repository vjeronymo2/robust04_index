			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Salvation Army 'ignored investment advice' SENIOR EMPLOYEES of the Salvation Army believe the financial transactions which led to an alleged Pounds 6.2m fraud were in breach of Charity Commission guidelines drawn up after the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal. This view, held by bankers who have worked closely with the Salvation Army, is shared by top charity lawyers in the City and the organisation's own financial advisers. The charity's lay investment specialists from top City institutions held meetings with the organisation this week at which they repeated their disapproval that their advice on how to invest the missing funds had been ignored. The concerns about a breach of the guidelines come after a week in which it has become apparent that several of the individuals and organisations named in a writ by the charity were already under investigation by police and regulatory authorities in the UK and the US. Detectives of the Metropolitan Police and City of London police Company Fraud Squad will next week present the Crown Prosecution Service with a preliminary report on the alleged fraud. This would be the first step towards prosecutions. The Serious Fraud Office is also believed to be taking an interest in the case. Under the guidelines drawn up with the advice of the Bank of England and the Building Societies Commission a charity should: Draw up a list of recognised financial institutions which have a first-class reputation . . . only institutions with the highest short-term ratings should be considered. Use professional money managers for substantial cash resources. Recognise that, even if professional managers are appointed, the trustees bear the responsibility for decision-making and should carefully and objectively assess the advice they are being given. The opinion was backed yesterday by Mr Andrew Crawford of City law firm Cameron Markby Hewitt, which advises a number of charities on their investment powers. Mr Crawford said last night: 'This (case) demonstrates the importance of observing the Charity Commission guidelines on investing cash, which includes the need to seek proper professional advice.' It also emerged last night that three top City investment specialists who had advised the charity against the transaction raised the matter with the Salvation Army again last October. They were disappointed to be told that the deal had gone ahead without their knowledge. The three advisers are Dr Kevin Carter, group investments director of Providence Capital; Mr John Padovan, former deputy chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd; and Mr John Renshaw, former deputy chairman of John Laing. The Charity Commission said last night that it was monitoring the progress of the internal investigation being carried out by the trustees of the Salvation Army, but would 'keep under review' whether there was a need to intervene more directly. Detectives plan to interview Salvation Army officers including Colonel Grenville Burn, an officer in charge of fundraising, and Colonel Ivor Rich, the secretary in charge of business administration at the army's London headquarters. Col Burn was yesterday officially 'on sick leave' and was not available for comment. Col Rich, who was working at his desk, said: 'I would be the first one to clear this up if I could, but I'm gagged from a legal standpoint.' Asked whether he was being made responsible for the financial transactions, Col Rich said: 'I don't have the authority to act on my own. No officer does.' In the UK territorial headquarters Col Byrne was in charge of fundraising at the lower end of a chain of command which led upwards through Col Rich to the chief secretary, Commissioner Ian Cutmore, and the territorial commander, Commissioner John Larsson. At least two of those accused of fraud in the army's writ - Mr Gamil Naguib and Mr Stuart Ford - have disappeared. Mr Naguib is a director of two British companies: Guardian Guarantee and Shellsouth. Both share a registered office, now abandoned, in Shepherd Street, central London. It has emerged that Mr Naguib, who is listed as a Canadian national, has been under investigation by the Fraud Squad since last year in relation to fraudulent financial transactions associated with the Islamic Pan American Bank, also named in the writ. The Central Bank of Argentina said that the Islamic Pan American Bank, based in Buenos Aires, was never on its register. It has emerged that the US Internal Revenue Service took papers from the Dallas office associated with the bank last year. Both Mr Naguib's companies describe their purpose as financial services. But neither company is on the Securities and Investments Board's central register, which lists all approved investment advisory firms. Shellsouth was created in spring 1991, but is being pursued by Companies House because it has never filed accounts. Guardian Guarantee's latest accounts, for the year to December 31 1991, show a retained loss of Pounds 98,000. The company's auditor was a north London firm called Babs Sobanjo, which cannot now be traced. It no longer holds a practising certificate with the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. Mr Stuart Ford, named in the writ in association with Tilen Securities, traded some years ago in a different firm involved in property development and operating from the address given for Tilen. Tilen is located in a row of shops in the Birmingham suburb of Acocks Green and was shut down early last week according to the owners of neighbouring properties. Yesterday a padlocked screen covered the front of the premises. The owner of one shop said Tilen had been trading at that address for at least three years. Mr Jasbir S. Mudhar, who trades as JPR Accountants &amp; Financial Services, was also named in the writ. He is not accused of fraud, but the charity is seeking a declaration that any monies he holds on its behalf should be returned. He said yesterday that early last year he had handled a business transaction for Mr Ford, but that he was unaware that it concerned the Salvation Army. He said he had not had any further dealings with Mr Ford since then. 'I did not know whose money it was,' Mr Mudhar said. 'We had no idea what it was. We just followed instructions. Everything we have done is proper. We simply handled something on instructions and I have no idea what transpired after that. 'Everything is above board and within the law. We are a professional practice and we would run away faster than Daley Thompson from anything that was not. We would not be associated with anything like that, and we have nothing to fear.'</p>

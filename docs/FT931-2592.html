			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER fell back from its highs during late LME trading as selling bore down on the market. Resistance emerged around Dollars 2,210 a tonne for three-month metal, which represents the ceiling of the current Dollars 40 trading range, and the market eased back to end at Dollars 2,198, still up Dollars 20. The market's strength reflected widespread buying interest, linked to supply-side concerns. Zaire's political situation is deteriorating, there are labour problems at Chile's Chuquicamata and recent falls in Comex stocks suggest output losses in Arizona early this year might be larger than initially thought. GOLD edged back above Dollars 330 a troy ounce on the London bullion market, but appears stuck in its current range between Dollars 326 and Dollars 333. 'There has been some short-covering, but it was capped by producer selling,' one dealer said. In New York raw SUGAR prices were on the rise by midday on renewed technical buying and continued sentiment that world supply is tightening. Compiled from Reuters</p>

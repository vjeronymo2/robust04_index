			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITTIER COMES BACK  </P> <P> Your article printed June 17 entitled "Visitors begin to Return to Alaska After  Spill" was saddening to read. Many tourists who have not ever been to Whittier,  Alaska, will only have your opinion to rely on.  </P> <P> How sad!  </P> <P> My perception of Whittier is a quiet city full of majestic wonders not created  by man but by God. Our roads are not overcrowded with bumper-to-bumper traffic  nor do our eyes sting from smog-filled skies. We do not have to deal with drug-  and gang-related wars in our town. We have the freedom to walk the streets day  or night without looking over our shoulder.  </P> <P> How can you say the train never leaves on time? Also, the state ferry doesn't  leave whenever it is ready to leave. Are your freeways so sophisticated you  always leave on time and arrive at your destination on time?  </P> <P> RONDA GAUL  </P> <P> City Clerk  </P> <P> Whittier, Alaska  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Japan on Tuesday [29  March] unveiled a new package of measures to further open its  markets to foreign products, in a bid to cut huge trade  surpluses and deflect criticism from trading partners,  especially the United States.    The package, approved by the cabinet Tuesday morning,  centers  on tax cuts and other macroeconomic steps to spur domestic  demand, market-opening measures in four sectors and voluntary  overtures in three priority areas of the stalemated trade talks  with the U.S.    Noting the need to overhaul Japan's economic structure,  Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said in a statement that the new  package clearly shows his administration's resolve to achieve  such reform and bring the nation's economy into harmony with the  international community.    Earlier Tuesday morning, Hosokawa telephoned to U.S.  President Bill Clinton to explain the package in advance and  seek U.S. understanding of Japan's efforts to increase foreign  access to its markets.    Thanking Hosokawa for the call, Clinton said he looks  forward  to scrutinizing the package, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura told a news conference.    Clinton reportedly said he still believes Japan and the U.S.  can reach an agreement in the so-called "framework" trade  negotiations that collapsed at the bilateral summit in  Washington on February 11.    Clinton was also quoted as telling Hosokawa that the two  countries can gauge progress in the openness of Japanese markets  by "objective criteria" while addressing Japan's concern that  setting numerical targets would lead to managed trade.    The package has no fresh proposals on macroeconomic measures  but promises to draw up concrete plans by the end of June for  comprehensive tax reform, including permanent tax cuts and  boosting the amount of the current 10-year, 430 trillion yen  public works spending program that began in fiscal 1991.    With no new fiscal measures, the package features four  market-opening items -- deregulation, promotion of imports and  investment, enhancing competition, and boosting government  procurement.    Deregulatory steps involve abolition of regulations that  directly block foreign access, international coordination of  licensing and inspections systems, and simpler application  procedures.    The measures center on four areas -- housing and land,  information and communications, distribution, and financial  services and insurance.    Under these basic guidelines, the package pledges to devise  concrete measures to either abolish or ease government  regulations by the end of June.    Concerning measures to enhance competition, the package  calls  for stricter enforcement of the antimonopoly law, issuance of  guidelines to bar bid-rigging, and the carrying out of surveys  on business practices and price gaps between Japan and other  countries.    Import and investment measures include the holding of  seminars, trade fairs and other information-exchanging  opportunities, action programs for fiscal 1994 to offer tax,  financial and other incentives, and better use of the office of  trade and investment ombudsman.    The package also includes Tokyo's voluntary actions to  enhance foreign access in three priority areas identified in the  framework talks with Washington -- automobile and auto parts,  insurance, and government procurement of telecommunications and  medical equipment.    Japan believes the announcement of its new package will lead  to the resumption of the deadlocked trade negotiations sometime  in the next three months in hope of reaching an accord at the  annual summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized  nations in Naples in July, Takemura said.    Tokyo is scheduled to issue a follow-up package before the  G-7 summit that will offer more concrete plans for macroeconomic  measures.    The package offers no specific targets for either cutting  the  trade surplus or for market access. But it spells out that a  government economic forecast indicates the ratio of current  account surplus to gross domestic product (GDP) will dwindle  from 3.4 percent in fiscal 1992 to 3.1 percent in fiscal 1993  ending Thursday, and to 2.8 percent in fiscal 1994.    Asked if this will be taken by the U.S. as a promise by  Japan  to whittle down its trade surplus to that level, Takemura  replied, "we don't regard this as our international pledge."    The package also introduces and welcomes plans announced  recently by the automobile industry and major automakers to  increase purchases of U.S.-made parts to specific amounts.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergiy Trashutin, from Kharkiv: "The Election in </F> Kharkiv Marked the Victory of Kuchma's Capital over `Das  Kapital' by Marx"]    [Text] The defeat of the National Democrats in the  Kharkiv region was even more likely than that of the Reds. Even  though the main struggle in Kharkiv took place between the Left  and the coalition of the "money bags" gathered around the  Kuchma-Grynyov bloc, the former were fatally short of money.  Since businessmen made use of their unlimited financial  resources and cornered all the mass media, the Left, lacking  funds as well as brilliant personalities, fell back on unabashed  populism. In the first round, this move was successful: the  slogan "there was enough food and drink under the Communists"  worked and allowed them to put through their candidates in 10 of  the 14 local districts. Adding to this two representatives of  the Ukraine Citizens' Congress, we have the complete list of  opponents of the Kuchma-Grynyov clan, which in the first round  had a 100 percent success rate in the region.    The runoff election was preceded by several noisy scandals.  For instance, People's Deputy Filenko sued the trade union  newspaper SOLIDARNIST for publishing calumnious information  which allegedly influenced the outcome of the first round of  voting. It was to no avail: he lost the runoff to First  Secretary of the CPU obkom Kashlyakov. People's Deputy  Meshcheryakov withdrew his candidacy in protest against what he  called dirty methods of conducting the election campaign by his  fellow-Reform Bloc member Grynyov. His detractors maintain that  in reality Meshcheryakov did not have the means to fight a  financial battle against the respected Volodymyr Borysovych on  an equal footing.    Speaking of funds: Socialist Party candidate Milyukha  declared on television that the money which the Inter-Regional  Reform Bloc spent on the election campaign would have been  sufficient to feed the population of Kharkiv for a period of one  year. He also added that with that kind of money he would  undertake to put his cat in parliament. As no one gave him that  money, neither his cat nor Comrade Milyukha himself won a seat  in parliament. The Kuchma-Grynyov people wound up their campaign  by holding a rock party at the central square of the city,  complete with fireworks and local and foreign stars, in order to  attract young people. (Garik Sukachev was brought over from  Moscow.) It did not work: young people looked at the spectacle  but did not bother to vote.    The runoff election in Kharkiv marked the victory of the  material (funds) over the ideal (even though it was the world's  most progressive ideology). The Kuchma-Grynyov group won 5  seats, the Communists 2 seats and the Socialists and  Meshcheryakov followers 1 seat each. One more seat went to an  independent candidate.    On the countryside, the political landscape was slightly  different. There, the contest between the Left and the ruling  party ended with the score of 8-5 in favor of the latter. One  seat was won by an independent candidate. Among those who were  elected from the ruling party we find People's Deputies Bandurko  and Karasyk, the advisor to Prime Minister Suslov. There were no  particular surprises here, except for the Chuguivskyy district  No. 385 which elected a Communist, Raykovskyy, surprising even  the local nomenklatura.    The runoff also produced a scandal, perhaps the loudest of  all. Running and apparently winning in the Sovetskyy election  district No. 376 was a noted democrat, liberal, etc., etc.,  etc., Volodymyr Grynyov. Let us not talk about the astronomical  sums spent on his campaign: they could not be added up by the  KRU, the CIA and the Central Bank of Ukraine working together.  There were many other violations, the main of which was the fact  that without the permission of the Central Election Commission  the polls were kept open beyond 8 p.m. Thanks to this, a needed  number was achieved to declare the election valid. But since  this did not escaped the notice of the perturbed public, we  should expect a flood of letters and complaints to the Central  Election Commission. God alone knows how it will end, but it  offers a good opportunity to investigate whether indeed our  elections were truly democratic and not falsified.    Nonetheless, the most important outcome of the election was  that there is no Red Dawn in Kharkiv. Neither the Left nor the  ruling party passed in the city. Their base remains on the  countryside, in villages where even today the collective farm  chairman and the head of the village council lord over the  population. But this is their legacy: only time will free the  countryside from this plague.</p>

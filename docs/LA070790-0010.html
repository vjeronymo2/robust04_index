			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWNDALE OUSTS 2ND CITY MANAGER IN 2 YEARS  </P> <P> Lawndale City Manager James Arnold, who faces criminal misdemeanor charges in  the demolition of three city buildings that contained asbestos, was ousted this  week by a three-member majority of the City Council.  </P> <P> Arnold is the second city manager to be fired by the council within two years.  </P> <P> He described the agreement as amicable and said he has no hard feelings about  the council's decision. "The city's been good to me," he said.  </P> <P> Said Councilman William Johnson: "We just feel the city of Lawndale has been  through a lot of problems and turmoil in the past, and we feel a change is  needed." Council members who supported the ouster said the asbestos case was a  factor but problems with the city's budget were a larger concern.  </P></p>

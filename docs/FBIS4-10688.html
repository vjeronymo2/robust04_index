			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 14 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Prioritized sectors of  the economy and social services of Cuba could be affected  beginning today by sporadic power outages, local radio and an  official spokesmen confirmed today.    "The situation remains tense as Basic Industries Minister  Marcos Portal has explained," a spokesman for state-owned Union  Electrica Company has told NOTIMEX. "In the next few hours  there could be a little more electricity if four or five  generators that were out of order begin operations," the  official added.    On Tuesday and Wednesday there was an average of five hours  of electric power in this capital of over 2 million people,  where extensive areas have remained in the dark for over three  weeks. Official sources stated two thirds of the electric power  generating capacity of Cuba is out of service due to failure and  lack of maintenance.    "Today will also be a very tense day and even prioritized  sectors such as the sugar harvest, industrial production, and  the population in general will be affected," the spokesman for  state-owned Union Electrica Company asserted. According to the  spokesman, the daily power outages do not include hospitals and  laboratories, selected production centers, state-owned  organizations, military command centers, and the group of  tourism installations. "Above everything are the water lines,  hospitals, and bread making," the spokesman stated.    Spokespersons for the Ministry of Basic Industries said a  repair plan will enter into operations this month, but the  recovery of some 60 percent of the electric power production  capacity will only be achieved at the end of the present year.    Other sources NOTIMEX consulted explained there are delays  in  maintenance due to lack of resources and, although some  resources have been received, the recovery process in this  regard will take two to three years. The failure of the system  was added to the lack of fuel for thermal energy production,  originated by the shortage of crude oil in the country, despite  the efforts made by state-owned Cuba Petroleo (Cupet).    Cupet representatives reported that 2.135 million barrels of  crude oil were extracted during the first quarter of this year,  representing 112 percent compliance with the oil program. The  national production plan for crude oil, whose high content of  sulfur is damaging the boilers of the thermoelectric centrals,  so far this year totals [number indistinct] million barrels,  that is 700,000 barrels over what was extracted in 1993.    Cuba reduced its oil supplies from 91 million annual barrels  to less than half that amount, following the disappearance of  the Soviet Union, its former essential supplier.    According to Cupet data, the production of 821 megawatts (26  percent of the total) is hampered by faults and that of 570  megawatts (18 percent) due to lack of maintenance. Resources  equivalent to 372 megawatts (11 percent) have different  limitations and the equipment generates lower-than-capacity  amounts, according to the energy utility company.</p>

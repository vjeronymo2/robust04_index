			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 3 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman said today that the actions of the United  States to link China's most favored nation (MFN) status with the  human rights issue have done nothing but present obstacles to  the promotion of human rights.    The spokesman, Shen Guofang, made the remarks at a weekly  press conference held here this afternoon when commenting on a  report that the United States recently asserted that if China  would make major progress in its human rights, it would consider  adopting the approach of reviewing China's MFN status once in  several years.    Shen said that the Chinese Government has repeatedly stated  most clearly that the mutual offer of MFN status between China  and the United States is a reciprocal and mutually beneficial  trade arrangement, and that the MFN ought not to be linked with  issues irrelevant to it.    Recently, Shen said, President Clinton and the U.S.  Government both indicated the intention to put behind the annual  debate on China's MFN status, in order to settle this issue  permanently and have the Sino-U.S. relations built on a more  solid foundation.    "We believe this is a positive and sensible notion," said  Shen, "But it is yet to be translated into action on the part of  the U.S. side."    The spokesman said that the U.S. practice of linking the MFN  status with the human rights issue also constitutes a violation  of the principle of respect for state sovereignty enshrined in  the U.N. Charter.    "This linking sounds as if it is for promoting human rights,  but as a matter of fact, it is an act of violating human rights  and infringing upon the rights to development elaborated in the  declaration on the right to development and the Vienna  Declaration and program of action adopted by the World  Conference on Human Rights last year," said Shen.    "These actions of the U.S. have done nothing but present  obstacles to the promotion of human rights," the spokesman  stressed.</p>

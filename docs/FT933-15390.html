			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Chipmakers hit by factory explosion MANUFACTURERS of semiconductors are scrambling to find alternative sources of supply for materials used in packaging microchips, after an explosion at a Sumitomo Chemical factory, the world's largest source of high-grade epoxy resins. The explosion, which occurred on Sunday, at the factory in Niihama, about 680km south-west of Tokyo, severely damaged the epoxy plant. According to Sumitomo, the plant produces 60 per cent of the world's supply of high-grade epoxy resins. The resins are essential to the production of plastic packages for computer chips. 'This is a very serious situation,' said a spokesman for Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International, an international trade group, 'but we believe that there are other facilities that can make up for the production capacity that has been shut down.' SEMI has begun a world-wide industry survey to find alternative sources of epoxy resin for the semiconductor industry. It is likely to be three to six months before the factory is back in production, according to Dan Rose, of Rose Associates, a semiconductor consulting group specialising in materials supplies. The incident has demonstrated the vulnerability of the Dollars 80bn (Pounds 53.3bn) semiconductor industry, which supplies the 'building blocks' used to make all types of electronic equipment; a Dollars 600bn industry. Semiconductor manufacturers in the US said they did not expect any immediate impact, but were concerned about the longer term implications. 'We have inventories that will carry us through the current quarter,' said Texas Instruments, one of the largest US chipmakers. 'We are currently reviewing the potential impact in the fourth quarter and may seek alternative suppliers.' 'Any shortage of supply will likely occur toward the end of the year,' Mr Rose said. Smaller semiconductor producers, who have less influence with suppliers, were more likely to be affected by any shortages, a semi conductor industry official said. In Japan, semiconductor manufacturers expressed concern, but said they expected to be able to maintain production using packaging material from other sources. Prices of epoxy resin and plastic semiconductor packages are expected to rise in the wake of the Sumitomo explosion, industry analysts said. Alternative suppliers of epoxy resin should be able to ramp up production quickly, Mr Rose said, because they have been operating below capacity. The cause of the explosion at the factory is under investigation in Japan.</p>

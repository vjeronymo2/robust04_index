			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK housing Wimpey's results confirmed that the housebuilding sector remains a kaleidoscope of blue language, red ink and green shoots. On balance, Mr Norman Lamont's Budget seems likely to encourage the incipient revival in the housing market even if it does not immediately help corporate profitability. Many housebuilders have recently reported a strong rise in demand in response to lower interest rates. Wimpey was typical in announcing a 33 per cent increase in house sales since the start of the year. The slight caution that spread ahead of the Budget will probably now evaporate. For first-time buyers, at least, the increase in the threshold for stamp duty is likely to be a more significant incentive than the reduction in mortgage interest relief proves a deterrent. But a rise in the volume of housing transactions will not necessarily provide an instant stimulus to prices. Housebuilders have had to provide carrots to attract buyers. Negative equity will continue to depress the general market. The new threshold for stamp duty will make it hard for prices to rise above Pounds 60,000 for those houses aimed at first-time buyers. This may not prove too great a problem: last year about two-thirds of new houses were sold below that price. Nevertheless, housebuilders will continue to face margin pressure. Price increases for a range of building materials will squeeze profits. Land prices now seem set to rise faster than house prices - favouring those companies which can boast long land banks.</p>

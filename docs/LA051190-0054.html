			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REBATES COST FORD $4 BILLION ANNUALLY  </P> <P> Rebates are costing Ford Motor Co. about $4 billion a year, eroding the auto  maker's profit as it fights to hold its U.S. market share, executives said at  the company's annual meeting Thursday.  </P> <P> Ford President Philip Benton said after the shareholders' meeting that the  average of about $1,000 in incentive costs for every car and light truck Ford  sells is about double last year's rate.  </P> <P> Ford, GM and Chrysler all reported last week that incentive costs helped push  their first quarter profits sharply lower from a year ago.  </P> <P> Ford, the nation's second-largest auto maker behind GM, earned $506.2 million  during the first three months of the year, down 69% from last year's company  record first-quarter earnings. GM's quarterly earnings fell 54%, and Chrysler's  dropped 80%.  </P> <P> "We believe the increased marketing and product expenditures will continue to  affect profits throughout the year," Ford Chairman Harold Poling told  shareholders. Poling succeeded Donald Petersen as Ford's chairman March 1.  </P> <P> If incentives work, they boost a company's sales pace but cut directly into  profit. Ford's share of the U.S. market for domestically built cars stood at  28.6% at the end of April, compared to GM's 46% and Chrysler's 11%.  </P> <P> In a news conference after the two-hour meeting, Poling said he hoped that with  the new products Ford is offering this year, including a new Escort subcompact  and Explorer sport-utility vehicle, the company will be able to reduce its  rebate costs.  </P> <P> Typically, auto makers hesitate to put incentives on new vehicles, thinking  that their freshness makes them popular without the enticements.  </P> <P> GM President Robert Stempel said Wednesday that the new vehicles his company  introduces this year should cut GM's incentive costs.  </P></p>

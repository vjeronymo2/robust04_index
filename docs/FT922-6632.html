			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Murdoch gave TV soccer deal full support MR RUPERT MURDOCH, chief executive of News Corporation, promised English football's new Premier League the backing of 'the whole company' in the battle over TV rights. Apart from owning 50 per cent of British Sky Broadcasting - the satellite television consortium which on Monday won rights to broadcast 300 live Premier League matches over five years - Mr Murdoch also owns five national newspapers. The combined BSkyB-BBC offer was worth a total of Pounds 304m compared with a final ITV offer of Pounds 262m. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake in BSkyB. According to one of those at Monday's league meeting - Mr Rick Parry, Premier League chief executive - those present had been guaranteed the backing of News International, News Corp's UK subsidiary, and 'the personal commitment of Mr Murdoch'. Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, said that, if true, the Murdoch promise was not 'the level playing field or the new spirit of competition envisaged by the Broadcasting Act'. Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of ITV Sport, said he had written to Sir John Quinton, chairman of the Premier League, asking for Monday's decision to be set aside. Mr Parry, however, said the decision was 'irrevocable.' Yesterday, Mr Alan Sugar - chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, a Premier League club, and of Amstrad, which sells satellite dishes - conceded he had spoken to BSkyB on the day of the meeting but that the company had already been informed of the new ITV offer. Mr Sugar said nothing unfair had happened on Monday. 'There was never an official tender offer date. Mr Parry always made it clear to both parties the latest offer status. Both companies had up to the last minute to make their final offer and they did,' Mr Sugar said. 'ITV had been soliciting each chairman with an envelope including their final offer at the doors of the meeting.' At the meeting, Mr David Dein of Arsenal had asked that Mr Sugar abstain from voting because he was a manufacturer of satellite equipment. Mr Sugar offered to do so but the club chairmen and chief executives present decided by 20-1 to allow him to vote. Mr Dyke said ITV Sport felt it had been misled. 'We are told that when the meeting started at 10am the bids were very close. 'However, by one means or another, BSkyB learned of the size of our bid and was allowed to increase their bid.' Mr Sam Chisholm, chief executive of BSkyB, yesterday expressed surprise that ITV wanted the bidding re-opened.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAVOR WINS 1,500, LOOKS TO THE GOODWILL GAMES  </P> <P> Young boys in baseball caps stood tippy-toed, hoping they would be one of the  lucky ones to claim her autograph. Athletes gathered to congratulate her,  shaking their heads in amazement.  </P> <P> It remains to be seen whether Suzy Favor will dominate the U.S. middle-distance  corps in the future, but Saturday night at the USA/Mobil National Track and  Field Championships at Cerritos College, the 21-year-old University of  Wisconsin senior made it clear that she is as talented in the 1,500-meter race  as any U.S. woman to come along in several years.  </P> <P> Favor, a nine-time NCAA champion and the American junior record-holder at 1,500  meters, topped an impressive field Saturday night to win in 4 minutes 13.47  seconds.  </P> <P> It was Favor's first title at The Athletics Congress championships.  </P> <P> Claudette Groenendall led the race through 700 meters, then Favor took the  lead, taking the pack through a 2:23.5 800-meter split. Favor, who won the NCAA  800 title earlier this month in 1:59.11 and who is known for having a furious  kick, said the slow pace helped.  </P> <P> "The pace was slow in the beginning," said Favor. "I'm not complaining. That  makes it better for me."  </P> <P> With about 500 meters to go, Favor, followed closely by PattiSue Plumer,  unleashed an impressive surge, holding it around the backstretch to where only  she and Plumer were left to contend.  </P> <P> Plumer, who was outkicked by Favor last summer in a mile race at UCLA, did all  she could, putting on her usual frantic kick, but Favor was too quick. As  Plumer chased her through the homestretch, Favor added an extra burst to hold  her off.  </P> <P> Plumer, who was second in 4:13.68, said: "I don't like to get beat by this  much, but my coach (Brooks Johnson) told me I ran the last 400 in 56 (actually  59 seconds). That's my personal record. I think Suzy's as good as they come  right now."  </P> <P> Although Plumer was disappointed with second place, she made up for it just  over an hour later as she won the 5,000 meters in 15:45.67 -- a performance far  from her American record of 14:59.99, but impressive in that she held off  longtime rival Sabrina Dornhoefer in the final 50 meters.  </P> <P> "PattiSue's crazy," Favor said with a laugh. "She can do that (double) though."  </P> <P> Still, Favor was the real star Saturday night.  </P> <P> "I'm really happy with this," Favor said. "This is so exciting. The future . .  . the Goodwill Games . . ."  </P> <P> Favor, who ran a personal best of 4:08.26 in winning the NCAA title this month,  was asked if she believes she can become the first American other than Mary  Slaney to break 4 minutes in the 1,500 meters.  </P> <P> "I hope to. It's a goal of mine," she said. "I think I can -- not this year,  maybe. But I still have many years ahead of me."  </P> <P> Slaney, who ran the slowest qualifying time (4:18.40) in Friday night's  preliminaries, did not compete in the final. Because she ran at least one race  at the USA/Mobil meet, however, she will still have a chance to make the U.S.  Goodwill Games team as an at-large entry.  </P> <P> Favor said competing at the Goodwill Games next month at Seattle has been a  longtime goal for her.  </P> <P> "I'm excited about it," she said. "It's a dream of mine. . . . It's a step  toward the Olympic team and that's a goal of mine."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "Hz": "Alleged `La Belle' Attacker Detained"] </F>   [Text] Berlin -- The protracted criminal proceedings  against the suspects of the bombing attack on the Berlin "La  Belle" discotheque could now come to life again. On Tuesday [4  January], Berlin's judicial authorities reported that the  Federal Government has been trying since August 1993 to obtain  the extradition of a stateless Palestinian arrested in Lebanon,  who is suspected of having been involved in organizing the  attack. They said the name of the man is Yusef C. In 1986 he  was a diplomat at the Libyan mission in East Berlin, the  so-called People's Bureau. In the course of 1992, he was  detained in Lebanon pending extradition, a fact the German  authorities did not know until November 1992.    But the German authorities still do not know whether the  suspect was arrested following an arrest warrant issued by the  Berlin court in 1990 for accessory to murder. The Foreign  Ministry in Bonn, via whom the extradition request was addressed  to the Lebanese authorities, has not yet received an answer to  this question. There is no extradition agreement between  Germany and Lebanon.    Two American men and one Turkish woman were killed and 230  people injured in the bomb attack on the La Belle discotheque on  7 April 1986. The discotheque, in Berlin's Schoeneberg  district, was mainly frequented by American soldiers. United  States fighter aircraft bombed the Libyan capital Tripoli and  the port of Bengazi in retaliation.    The extradition request is not directly linked with the  suspension of criminal proceedings at the end of April 1993  against a Palestinian called Imad Mahmud, suspected of having  been involved in the attack. He was accused of having been  involved in the planning of the attack, at least at the  beginning, but not in the organization or even the actual  carrying out, as Yusef C. allegedly was. The person who planted  the bomb has still not been found. This part of the proceedings  could be resumed shortly, since the main prosecution witness,  Muhammad A., who has meanwhile moved to Norway, was heard by a  court there. He is said to have confirmed all the main points  of the statement he had previously made to the Berlin Public  Prosecutor.    According to the findings of the Public Prosecutor -- which  are contained in the indictment -- in March 1986, during the  severe political tensions between the United States and Libya  over the closing of the Gulf of Sirte in the Mediterranean, two  members of the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin and the accused  talked about carrying out an attack on American soldiers in  which as many people as possible should be killed, without  specifically planning the attack.</p>

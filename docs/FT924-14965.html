			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Equity Issues: Large issues go ahead despite market gloom LARGE international share issues expected to be priced over the next week are said to be attracting interest in spite of acute uneasiness in stock markets and recent cancellations. In general, offerings have been hit by the swings in currencies and falls in the European markets. Consequently, hybrid offerings which offer more security, such as convertible bonds, are attracting more interest and many straight equity issues are being put off until the new year. The flotations of Procordia, the Swedish state food and pharmaceutical group, and the Australian Woolworths subsidiary, have been postponed because of poor market conditions over the past fortnight. However, a Dollars 690m issue by debt-laden News Corporation and a Dollars 525m issue by General Motors remain on schedule, according to the New York securities house Merrill Lynch, which is heading both projects. Meanwhile, a Dollars 550m secondary issue of Union Texas Petroleum stock has been filed with the US Securities Exchange Commission. The News Corp offer of 40m new shares, including 18m to be sold in the US and Canada, is the most international of the three, but potentially the most difficult. The Australian market is expected to attract about 13m of the shares but has been dogged by the failure of a ADollars 1.2bn rights issue by Westpac and the postponing by Industrial Equity (IEL) of the ADollars 2bn flotation of its Woolworths retailing subsidiary. Nevertheless, analysts feel that publisher Mr Rupert Murdoch's credibility has improved strongly over the past year. The other two issues are essentially US offerings with an international element. General Motors is to offer 25m 'H' shares, which will track the performance of the subsidiary Hughes Electronics. Some 20 per cent of the shares are allocated outside the US, although it is felt that as much as 95 per cent of the shares could go to US investors. Goldman Sachs's expected offer of 30m shares in Union Texas is principally targeted at the US with 20 per cent reserved for the rest of the world. The shares represent the 39 per cent stake held by Allied Signals.</p>

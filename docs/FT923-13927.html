			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER came in for hefty profit taking on the LME after hitting new 18-month highs. Firmness on Comex provided some impetus, and the three-month price rose to around Dollars 2,519 a tonne before technical traders elected to take profits. Both New York and London remain underpinned by developments in Poland, where KGHM miners are unhappy with the government's 17 per cent pay offer and intend to strike on July 20. SILVER remained steady on the London bullion market as fears faded of further heavy Middle East sales after news that Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, former chief operating officer of the Jeddah-based National Commercial Bank, had been fined Dollars 170m by the US Federal Reserve Board for violations of US banking law. Dealers estimated NCB silver sales at more than 40m troy ounces, worth Dollars 160m, which as one dealer commented 'fits the fine.' London COCOA prices closed mixed, while robusta COFFEE rose up to Dollars 26 a tonne on short covering and option-related buying. Traders said cocoa could still extend its recent rally as the Ivory Coast appears reluctant to make large sales while ICCO pact talks are in progress in Geneva.</p>

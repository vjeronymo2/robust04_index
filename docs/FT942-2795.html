			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Diverging views on utilities' identities: Andrew Adonis finds challenges to the bundling together of differing stocks This has been a dismal week for utilities. British Gas's warning that it would not raise its dividend this year - because of a new price cap imposed by the industry regulator - had a knock-on effect on electricity companies as they too await a pricing review. Such reverberations through the sector reflect the traditional view of utility stocks as interchangeable bond surrogates. A vigorous debate is under way among analysts and brokers as to the relevance of bundling together electricity, gas, telecommunications and water companies in one utility sector. The protagonists divide into two camps: the 'divergers' and the 'convergers'. The former believe the utilities are going their separate ways. Their regulatory climates vary widely and their financial returns are diverging. Corporate activity and entry into unregulated sectors will reinforce these trends, as will the growth of competition in all the industries except water. On this view, gas and telecommunications are prime candidates to lose their utility badges. British Gas and British Telecommunications remain dominant in their domestic markets, but they face stiff competition. Both companies are exploiting overseas opportunities with relish. BT, for instance, will this year invest more in MCI, a US phone company, than in its UK network. With Mercury, cable companies and other new entrants taking market share in all telecoms sectors, BT chiefs speculate that the present regulatory price cap - due to expire in 1997 - will be the last. Mr Robert Morris, analyst at Goldman Sachs, sees manifold opportunities for BT if it expands its home market and becomes an international leader in new services. Yet fears that competition is a one-way street have dragged down BT's share price, exacerbated by a slow-down in nominal dividend growth. Real dividend growth is expected to be between 3 and 4 per cent over the next few years, less than for electricity or water. Mr Nigel Hawkins, of Hoare Govett, believes the decision to privatise gas and telecoms as single entities, but to split up water and electricity distribution, has created a regulatory divide between the two groups of utilities. 'In practice where there is more than one operator, the regulator tends to be more generous to the sector as a whole, as we are likely to see with water and electricity in the reviews of their price caps, making a significant difference to expectations.' Hence, in part, the better performance of water and electricity shares of late, although the latter has suffered in recent days. However, Mr Hawkins paints a sharp difference even between water and electricity. With regulatory reviews ongoing in both industries, their regimes are diverging. While the water companies are set to have a price cap of, effectively, RPI+1.7 per cent, the Recs are likely to have to make a one-off cut of between 12 and 15 per cent with a price cap thereafter of around RPI-2.5 per cent. Furthermore, the lifting next year of the ban on the Recs being taken over will open up entrepreneurial options. For water, he expects real dividend growth of around 4 per cent, while for electricity distribution it will be close to 6 per cent. In short, the water companies will become 'akin to bonds', while Recs will be less sensitive to bond movements. Not all diversifiers go that far. Mr John Wilson at UBS points to underlying growth in electricity demand of less than 1.5 per cent: 'It is inconceivable that a company can grow its earnings and dividends greater than its growth of business in the long term.' He sees gas and electricity, where limited competition is emerging, as natural bedfellows, with water as a monopoly and telecoms as a fully competitive business. The 'convergers' do not claim that the utilities will perform similarly in the short or medium term. They see the post-privatisation history of all four industries as a continuum and minimise the significance of competition and diversification. Mr Bill Dale, utilities analyst at SG Warburg, says: 'British Gas and BT are, in effect, more mature utilities than electricity and water, leading to an inevitable slow-down in their financial returns which will affect the others in due course. 'The privatised companies find it far easier to grow profits in their early years, when the cost-cutting - particularly redundancies - is easy and initial regulation is lighter.' As for competition and diversification, 'The track record of utilities diversifying is dreadful, and any institutional investor will initially take a negative view of it.' In the convergers' view, then, in the long-term all four utilities might be expected to perform at a fixed discount to bonds, as in the US. Fleming Securities stresses the 'increasingly close' relationship between the gilt/equity ratio and the dividend yield of the utilities index relative to the FT-A All-Share. 'As competition and regulation reduce the scope for unexpectedly large rates of dividend growth, UK utilities will take on even more of the characteristic bond-like behaviour of their US counterparts.' Whether they will become bond substitutes remains problematic. While they serve as reasonably effective inflation hedges, their capacity to hedge against interest rates is more limited because in the UK price caps - and the permitted rates of returns underlying them - are fixed for several years at a time. For all that, 'divergers' and 'convergers' agree that no self-respecting institution would want to do without the four utilities in their portfolio, given their size. It is all a question of balance.</p>

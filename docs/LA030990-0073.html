			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ICE STORM SEALS MIDWEST UNDER GLASSY BLANKET  </P> <P> A storm that staggered the Rockies with snow sealed parts of the Midwest inside  a thick layer of ice Thursday, pulling down power lines that serve more than  90,000 customers in Des Moines, Iowa, and turning roads into skating rinks.  </P> <P> Some major Wyoming highways remained closed for a third day by deep snow,  idling travelers in motels, restaurants, truck stops and shelters, although  temperatures rose above freezing.  </P> <P> Hundreds of schools were closed because ice or snow made travel hazardous, or  because of lack of electricity, officials said.  </P> <P> South of the snow and ice belt, up to 7 inches of rain fell overnight and  flooded parts of Arkansas, forcing the evacuation of some homes in Little Rock.  A school bus was swept off a flooded road and into a ditch, but the young  passengers were evacuated safely by boat, officials said.  </P> <P> Freezing rain during the night brought down tree branches and power lines  across wide sections of Nebraska, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin.  </P> <P> Des Moines was hardest hit, with nearly 60% of the customers in the  metropolitan area blacked out. Police said nearly every street in the city was  closed or partially closed at some point by downed lines or fallen limbs.  </P></p>

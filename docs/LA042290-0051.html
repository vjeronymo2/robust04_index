			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CD PACKAGING AND PLANET EARTH  </P> <P> With all the hoopla over CD packaging ("Are CDs Destroying Our Planet?," the  April 15 Pop Eye column), I can't believe no one is raising a voice against  those annoying plastic CD storage cases. They're heavy, expensive, bulky, hard  to open, easy to break and certainly not biodegradable.  </P> <P> By switching to cardboard sleeves like those used for vinyl records, retailers  (and consumers) could store three times as many CDs in the same space. And, due  to reduced weight, stores would save a bundle on shipping.  </P> <P> But even a cardboard sleeve is unnecessary. Because CDs are relatively hard to  damage, they could be simply tucked into their own liner notes, and 150 would  fit in a shoebox!  </P> <P> When someone starts buying CD cases for reuse or recycling, I'll be the first  in line.  </P> <P> BRETT T.

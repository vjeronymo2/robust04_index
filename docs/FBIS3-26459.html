The move is aimed at simplifying and standardizing the  taxation system.    The five cancelled taxes are those previously levied on  trade  fairs, livestock trading, bonuses and salary adjustments, and  oil burning.    Meanwhile, the power to levy two other taxes -- on animal  slaughter and banquets -- will be turned over to provincial,  autonomous regional and municipal governments.</p>

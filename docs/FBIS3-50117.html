			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] It was dramatic on the Zepce front this Sunday.  [passage omitted]    Over 1,000 highly destructive shells were fired today from  tanks, 105-mm and 122-mm howitzers, and mortars deep into the  [Croat-held] territory and on HVO [Croatian Defense Council]  positions, and hundreds of explosive devices were also launched.  [passage omitted]    Reliable reports say that 30 jihad warriors [as heard] were  killed and seven were captured. Three members of the 111th  Brigade and professional Andrija Tadic Brigade [both HVO] were  killed and 12 were seriously and lightly wounded. Four  civilians died and five were seriously wounded in the  treacherous bombardment [as heard].    Due to the heavy fighting and influx of the wounded the  situation is dramatic in Zepce hospital. People are dying in  the corridors and on stretchers, because Zepce has not had  surgeons, oxygen, and other necessary resources for months.</p>

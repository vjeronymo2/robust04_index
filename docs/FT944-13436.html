			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Packaging, construction results boost Tenneco Tenneco, the diversified US industrial group, had its best third quarter in 11 years as its packaging and construction and farm equipment divisions outperformed expectations. Mr Dana Mead, Tenneco's chairman, said the strong quarter demonstrated the effectiveness of the company's restructuring. Net income amounted to Dollars 151m, or 82 cents a share, compared with Dollars 111m, or 64 cents, for the same period last year. Sales rose to Dollars 3.3bn, from Dollars 3.1bn a year ago. Operating income rose to Dollars 363m, from Dollars 273m. As expected, Tenneco yesterday also said it had agreed to purchase German automotive components maker Heinrich Gillet for Dollars 113m in a deal that will close by the year-end. The company's Packaging Corporation of America, boosted by rising prices for its containerboard output, saw operating income jump 24 per cent, to Dollars 63m, from Dollars 51m last year. Sales improved to Dollars 562m, from Dollars 513m. For the first nine months of the year, Tenneco had net income of Dollars 376m, or Dollars 2.04 a share, on sales of Dollars 10bn, compared with Dollars 256m, or Dollars 1.55, on sales of Dollars 9.8bn last year. Tenneco's JI Case farm and construction equipment subsidiary saw third-quarter operating income jump to Dollars 73m, from last year's Dollars 5m. Tenneco sold 29 per cent of its stake in Case in a public offering in June. Case, which reported earnings separately yesterday, said its third-quarter net income was Dollars 29m, or 39 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 1bn. Pro-forma comparative figures for the same 1993 quarter were Dollars 28m, or 38 cents, on sales of Dollars 841m. For the first nine months of the year, Case had net income of Dollars 119m, or Dollars 1.23 a share, on sales of Dollars 3.2bn, up sharply from last year's Dollars 18m, or 19 cents, on sales of Dollars 2.9bn.</p>

Caritas Sources say that  the aid comes at an opportune time and the goods will  immediately be distributed to the needy population in the  Luanda, Malanje, Menongue, Huambo, Uige, M'banza Congo and Sumbe  areas. Meanwhile, Caritas is one of the few humanitarian  organizations which distributes donations to all Angolans  without political or ethnical discrimination. Other  organizations, which claim to be impartial, have been showing  that their sole aim is to supply areas controlled by the Luanda  regime.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / World Trade News: US links better EC access to Gatt deal THE US requires better market access for its agricultural exports to the EC in order to conclude a Uruguay Round deal, Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, said yesterday. Following meetings in Brussels with Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner, and Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, Mr Espy said the issue of market access was left 'largely unresolved' by last November's EC-US breakthrough in Washington on farm trade. He said the administration had no wish to reopen the Washington agreement, which staved off a transatlantic trade war. But in order to conclude an agreement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 'we need better market access.' He would not be drawn on whether the US was seeking a managed trade solution, guaranteeing it market share, and merely said officials from both sides would be looking at the issue of access. He also said it was 'time-urgent' for the EC to implement the Washington agreement on oilseeds, hinting that otherwise the powerful US soya industry would press for the Dollars 1bn sanctions withdrawn last November to be reinstated. Mr Steichen emphasised that 'their interpretation is different from ours' on market access. 'The US wants fixed markets now,' he added, pointing out that the Uruguay Round final act mentioned only market 'opportunities'. France yesterday confirmed its desire to obtain some modifications of the EC negotiating position in the Gatt world trade negotiations and to reopen at least some points of the agricultural chapter. Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, said France would shortly send a memorandum to Britain and Germany setting out its position.</p>

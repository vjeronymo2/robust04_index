			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Financing the welfare state THE DEBATE over UK welfare spending is taking place in a time-honoured muddle of secret bilateral negotiation, leak and panic. A more reasoned examination is needed to determine what the state should be doing for its citizens in the 21st century, and how this can be financed. Although prompted by the enfeebled condition of the public finances, this is a debate that would be needed even if the fiscal position were healthy. Demographic pressures mean that current spending commitments are unsustainable in the medium term; meanwhile changing lifestyles and individual tastes and aspirations make a separate case for a more varied pattern of provision. The starting point should be to revisit the principles behind the welfare state, originally set up to protect those who, through poverty, illness, unemployment or old age, could not help themselves. To achieve these aims, it provided a cradle-to-grave social security system, a national health service, low-rent housing and free state education. The universal provision of health and social security reflected the circumstances of British post-war society in which all but the wealthiest needed such support. The solidarity of wartime experience also gave resonance to the idea of a welfare state into which all contributed and out of which all drew. That principle of social solidarity remains important. Any welfare system must command the support of those who contribute to it as well as those who most need its help. But economic growth has reduced the overlap between these two groups. An increasing proportion of people can provide pensions, health care, housing and education for themselves. There remains a large minority who depend on the safety net of the welfare state. Yet paradoxically, it is often the middle classes who get most out of the welfare state, leaving too little for those who lack alternative means. Today, universality is both unaffordable and undesirable. Right balance The question which must be asked in every decade is whether the balance between collective and individual provision is right. A London School of Economics study estimates that over 60 per cent of the taxes paid by the average person is returned in various benefits (the rest goes in redistribution). The welfare state acts as a savings bank, with people paying in when times are good and drawing out in times of need. More of this savings bank function could easily, with appropriate regulation, be undertaken by the individual through private provision. For some welfare services, however, efficiency may be best served by maintaining a role for the state. In health, for example, international experience suggests that some sort of state role is essential to bear down on the overall bill and ensure cost-sharing between different groups. But even in the health service it is clear that many people want and would be prepared to pay for premium levels of service; this does not mean they wish to see the NHS destroyed. User charges User charges also have a greater role to play in paying for public expenditure which confers economic advantage on the recipients. The planned expansion in higher education will need a greater contribution from students, with fees being repaid through a graduate tax. Investment in roads might be financed by higher petrol taxes paid by those using them. And London First, the business consortium, has suggested that improvements in London's transport infrastructure could be partly financed by a levy on businesses in the capital. Such moves involve a degree of hypothecation - of earmarking revenues for particular purposes. A pamphlet published today by Demos, a new think-tank, suggests much greater use of hypothecation to 'reconnect taxation', so that voters can see where their taxes are going. It also advocates referendums to allow voters to choose appropriate tax levels locally to pay for services such as health or public transport. There are dangers in such an approach, such as the loss of necessary flexibility to switch funds between programmes and the tonic it might give to special interest groups. Badly structured local referendums could also encourage the wealthy to migrate to the low-tax suburbs, as in the US, leaving a weakened tax base incapable of dealing with the problems of the inner cities. But the Demos pamphlet provokes exactly the sort of longer-term thinking which is missing from the current political debate. Decisions made and unmade amid fiscal crises suggest to voters that the entire issue of reforming the welfare state is itself a crisis. It is not. An orderly modernisation of the welfare state is desirable as well as necessary if people are to plan their lives around reasonable expectations of what they must provide for themselves.</p>

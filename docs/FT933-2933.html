			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Talks on the rocks: Chris Patten's confrontation with China could leave him isolated Mr Chris Patten has returned from his summer holiday to face the most testing time of his short governorship of Hong Kong. Talks that started in April between Britain and China about the colony's political development are going badly. After nearly 100 hours of negotiations about arrangements for local elections in 1994 and 1995 - the last before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 - the two sides appear no closer to resolving their differences. The whispers of British diplomats and Hong Kong government officials suggest that, unless there is some movement, the talks could collapse within months of their resumption next week. The result of failure would be to create uncertainty that would damage investors' confidence and exacerbate public fears about the transition to Chinese rule. A collapse of the talks would mean the UK 'going it alone' on Hong Kong's political development and trying to enact measures in the face of vigorous opposition from China. China would probably block strategic infrastructure projects - such as the colony's planned HKDollars 165bn Chek Lap Kok airport. Deadlock has arisen in spite of compromises offered by the British team on two of Mr Patten's most controversial reform proposals. First, for the selection in 1995 of nine new elected members of the 60-strong Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's lawmaking body, Mr Patten initially wanted to give votes to nine groups of employees in different sectors of the economy, amounting to 2.7m people. But in negotiations, Britain offered to cut the number to just 1.3m. Beijing, however, envisages giving votes to only a few thousand. Second, Mr Patten has moved on the composition of an 'electoral college' to select a further 10 LegCo members. At first, he wanted it to consist of about 360 of the local government officials elected next year, but he has now agreed with Beijing that the college should comprise four broad-based groups, of which politicians would be just one. The sticking point is that Britain wants college members to be elected; Beijing wants agreed government appointees. Britain and China have always had conflicting objectives. Mr Patten wants the UK to leave behind an open society where values such as fair elections, the rule of law, and free speech have a chance to flourish. Beijing wants to ensure the 1995 elections will not create a political structure it cannot control. Early optimism in the colony about the talks resulted from a feeling that Beijing wanted a direct influence on events in Hong Kong before the British left. But since last month optimism has evaporated - mainly, it appears, because Hong Kong has become hostage to Beijing's internal politics. British diplomats suggest that the increasing frailty of Deng Xiaoping, 89, China's pre-eminent leader who has guided Hong Kong policy for more than a decade, has increased political uncertainty and so produced an impasse. Adding to Mr Patten's worries are signs that the pull of China on the colony is getting stronger. Anecdotal evidence that the Hong Kong Chinese are identifying themselves increasingly with the civilisation, if not the government, of China has come from several directions: Growing numbers of middle-class Chinese, though probably still a minority, who hold foreign passports now say they would be prepared to swap them, if necessary, for Chinese nationality. When Mr Martin Lee, a former president of the Hong Kong Bar, tried earlier this summer to bring a libel action against a Beijing adviser, he was rebuffed by 11 of the colony's leading firms of solicitors, who feared offending China. The honour of the legal profession had to be salvaged by the president of the Law Society, who agreed to represent him. Mr Simon Murray last month stepped down from the management of Hutchison Whampoa, a diversified conglomerate, partly because the company's controlling shareholder, tycoon Mr Li Ka-shing, had banned him from speaking publicly in support of Mr Patten. Mr Murray's support for the governor was not good for business, Mr Li had calculated. Mr Rupert Murdoch's sale of the South China Morning Post - Hong Kong's oldest English-language newspaper - to Chinese investors has cost Mr Patten a friend in the colony and may reverse the Post's support for the governor. Opinion polls still show high approval ratings for Mr Patten in the colony - nearly 60 per cent - but expectations of the UK and China reaching agreement are at a record low. The latest poll showed just 37 per cent believing the two countries could do a deal, compared with 63 per cent in April. If the talks do collapse, the price for both sides will be high. For Beijing, a smooth transfer from British to Chinese rule is at risk. Its international reputation would be tarnished if, after 1997, it rebuffed a democratically elected LegCo. For Mr Patten, to try to go ahead with his proposals without Chinese consent could backfire. British power is on the wane in Hong Kong and he may find that, when forced to choose between China and an engaging British politician, the people of Hong Kong will choose China.</p>

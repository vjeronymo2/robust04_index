			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / The Markets: Moment of truth for coffee - Commodities Coffee traders will have a better idea whether the price explosion in the coffee market over the past month is justified after tomorrow. The Brazilian government will then issue the first official assessment of the damage done to its coffee crop by the frosts of two and four weeks ago. Unofficial estimates have put the prospective 1995-96 crop (the first one that will be affected) at between 10m and 15m bags (60kg each), compared with the 25m forecast before the frosts. But most traders believe the lower figure exaggerates the extent of the damage. The September futures price on the London Commodity Exchange rose from Dollars 2,255 to Dollars 4,085 a tonne as the frosts sparked off bouts of near panic buying. It has since fallen back by Dollars 450 but traders have been reluctant to push it any lower because further frosts will remain a possibility until early September. Nevertheless, a forecast above 15m bags tomorrow would be likely to push the price down further. Mr Claus de Freitas, the Brazilian National Coffee Department's director, has given little away ahead of the report. Talking to the Reuter news agency last Wednesday he played down comments by Mr Elcio Alvares, the industry and commerce minister, that initial damage reports were exaggerated. 'There were some reports that were exaggerated, not from the government, which is very cautious, but from the minister's own sources,' Mr Freitas said. 'The minister was saying that some people were saying that the whole country was stricken. That did not happen.' Refusing to comment further, he told reporters: 'The government cannot put out a number that isn't right.' Other events this week include an international rubber forum in Jakarta and the Mining in Africa conference in Johannesburg, both on Wednesday, and the publication of the International Wheat Council's latest grain crop estimates on Thursday.</p>

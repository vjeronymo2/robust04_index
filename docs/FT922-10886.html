			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Appointments: Bigger board for RBS ROYAL BANK of SCOTLAND has promoted three of its top executives to the board as directors, bringing the total number to 25, the maximum allowed by the Edinburgh-based institution's articles of association. This means it has a bigger board than any of the big four clearing banks, which range from NatWest with 23 directors to Midland with 16. Royal Bank points out that unlike these institutions it has no regional boards with their own directors. One of the three new executive directors is Peter Wood (above), the 44-year-old managing director of Royal Bank's financial services division who founded Direct Line, the bank's telephone-based insurance subsidiary. He sold his 25 per cent stake in Direct Line to Royal Bank in 1988 and entered a service agreement with the bank. In the year to September 30 1991 he earned Pounds 1.84m, most of it in the form of a bonus on top of his Pounds 275,000 basic salary, helped by Direct Line's good performance last year. He became head of financial services in late 1990 when the division was created by merging the bank's insurance, life assurance, leasing and fund management operations. The other new executive directors are Norman McLuskie, managing director of the operations division, and Tony Schofield, managing director of branch banking.</p>

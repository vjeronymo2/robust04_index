			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / 'Solidarity' union defies Beijing DISSIDENT workers in China, trying to organise a free union in the style of Poland's Solidarity, have mailed 2,000 copies of an anti-government manifesto in one of the boldest acts of dissent in nearly three years, Chinese sources said, Reuter reports from Beijing. The workers, calling themselves the China Free Union Preparatory Committee, sent the manifesto to government-organised unions and market places at the end of last month, the sources said, an act certain to bring retribution from a communist government determined to crush dissent. 'Ten years ago, Poland's Solidarity union was established. Now it has won a decisive victory. China's Free Union has now been formed and 10 years from now we will also win a decisive victory,' the manifesto said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Temnenkov -- all </F> quotation marks as received]    [Text] Bonn April 12 TASS -- Replying to a question as to  who controls nuclear weapons deployed on Ukraine's territory,  the republic's Defence Minister V. Radetskiy, who was addressing  a press conference at the end of his visit to Germany, said that  at present there is a bilateral control on such weapons. But it  is ordered by Ukraine, as "it is her property," the minister  emphasised. A tripartite agreement on nuclear weapons was  signed and a time-table of its withdrawal and destruction was  approved this year in Moscow through the U.S. mediation. "The  Ukrainian side is consistently and sincerely observing" this  time-table, he said. According to him, until now two train  loads of nuclear warheads have been despatched to Russia. In  exchange Ukraine was supposed to receive fuel for its nuclear  power plants from Russia. But Russia has not fulfilled this  condition for the time being. That is why we have been obliged  to suspend the time-table of withdrawal, to clarify it and make  it binding on Russia to honour its commitments," he said.</p>

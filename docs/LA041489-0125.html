			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TODAY'S SCHEDULE FOR L.A. INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> The American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival opens today  for two weeks at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas. Here is today's  schedule:  </P> <P> 'The Long Weekend (o' Despair)'  </P> <P> United States, 1989, 93 minutes  </P> <P>  8:30 p.m.  </P> <P>  Bargain-basement Bret Easton Ellis: Six post-punk characters spend a dreary  weekend whining about Angst and ennui, which they mispronounce. The film is a  disaster technically: Some scenes are so dimly lit (and/or badly shot and/or  stained from processing errors) that it's difficult to tell one character from  another. Writer-producer-director Gregg Araki reportedly made this gritty  exercise in self-indulgent alienation for $5,000; it looks like less. CHARLES  SOLOMON  </P></p>

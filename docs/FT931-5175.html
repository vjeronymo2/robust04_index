			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Thomas Cook considers offer for Owners THOMAS Cook, the travel agency and financial services group, was last night considering the final details of a tender offer for shares in Owners Abroad, the tour company fighting a hostile bid from rival Airtours. Representatives of Owners Abroad were meeting Thomas Cook and its advisers to decide pricing and size of tender, accord- ing to sources close to the companies. Any cash tender could put a substantial obstacle in the way of Airtours' all share and partial cash alternative offers as the bid enters its last full week. A tender offer, which could be as early as today or tomorrow and would have to be made this week, is likely to be made dependent on shareholders rejecting Airtours offer. At Friday night's close, the bid values Owners Abroad at Pounds 290m, or 144p per share, through the paper offer. The tender offer would need the approval of Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German state bank that controls Thomas Cook, and LTU, the German travel agency. Thomas Cook has repeatedly reaffirmed its belief in the commercial tie-up with Owners Abroad announced last year. Once Airtours had launched its bid, Owners shareholders were almost unanimous in describing as inadequate the equity swap which underpinned the commercial transaction with Thomas Cook. If Thomas Cook does make a tender offer, Owners Abroad's largest shareholder, Mercury Asset Management, may take centre stage. Last week MAM increased its stake in Owners Abroad to 14.07 per cent, from 13.4 per cent, but gave no indication whether it would accept or reject the offers. Reacting to the possibility of a tender offer, Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said Thomas Cook should bid for all the stock. 'LTU and Thomas Cook have tried to get into Owners Abroad on the cheap once before,' he said. 'Shareholders will recognise this for what it is  - a wrecking move supported by a desperate board.' In judging where, or whether, to pitch a tender offer, Thomas Cook would have to consider that if the offer were too high, allocation of shares would be scaled down. They would also be aware that some institutions are unlikely to be happy being left with shares that no longer attracted a bid premium.</p>

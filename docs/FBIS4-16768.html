According to party chairman Viktor Zolotarev, the press  conference is going to hear the PCD leadership announce a change  in its methods of political activity. As of now the PCD will  rely on populism and scandal. "We are going to fight fascism  with its own weapons, and we hope to do this as early as this  year," V. Zolotarev stated.</p>

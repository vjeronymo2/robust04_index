			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Sterling enjoys remarkable rally against D-Mark Sterling enjoyed a remarkable rally against the D-Mark yesterday, rising by more than 5 pfennigs as investor concern grew over the French franc. The pound closed at DM2.51, up 5 1/4 pfennigs, a level it maintained in New York. It was also strong against the dollar, finishing more than 4 cents higher in London at Dollars 1.5455 and rising to Dollars 1.550 in New York. There were suggestions that speculation against weaker currencies in the ERM, including the French franc, had given the pound a temporary status as a 'safe haven'. London shares, however, finished sharply lower. The FT-SE 100 index closed 27.9 points down at 2,833.6.</p>

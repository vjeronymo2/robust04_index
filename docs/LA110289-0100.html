			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> JOB PREFERENCE PACT STUDIED  </P> <P> The city's First Source Agreement, an unusual proposal that would require  developers and their building tenants -- both commercial and residential -- to  interview Pasadena residents first for job openings, will be scrutinized by a  subcommittee of the Board of Directors.  </P> <P> The idea for a subcommittee arose earlier this week after several board members  balked at adopting the proposal. The agreement's requirements for  record-keeping and inspections by city officials might discourage developers  from building in Pasadena, said Mayor William Thomson.  </P> <P> Similar concerns were expressed by the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce, which  called the agreement punitive and questioned its constitutionality and  legality.  </P> <P> The First Source Agreement previously applied to major projects in the city. It  was modified and made part of the requirements for developers who qualify to  build under the city's restrictive growth management initiative. The initiative  was passed by voters in March.  </P></p>

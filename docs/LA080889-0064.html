			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST INTERSTATE TO SELL LEASING FINANCE UNIT;  </P> <P> ORIX, A JAPANESE FIRM, WILL PAY $190 MILLION  </P> <P> First Interstate Bancorp said Monday that it has agreed to sell Commercial  Alliance Corp., a subsidiary that finances the leasing of heavy equipment, to a  Japanese firm for $190 million.  </P> <P> First Interstate, parent of First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles, said the unit  is being sold to ORIX Corp. of Tokyo because it does not fit with its main  business of consumer banking in the West. In addition, First Interstate said,  the sale will improve its ratio of capital to assets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Restructuring Strategy  </P> <P> Commercial Alliance, based in New York, finances equipment that is leased by  builders, trucking firms, commercial printers and other users of large  equipment. The unit, with $1.9 billion in assets, has been a profitable  business for First Interstate, earning $14.8 million in the year ended June 30.  </P> <P> The move to sell the subsidiary, which operates from 23 offices throughout the  country, is part of a strategy that First Interstate announced in late 1987 to  restructure and put more emphasis on consumer and corporate banking. Since  then, it has sold about $4 billion in assets, not counting Commercial Alliance.  </P> <P> First Interstate said ORIX is Japan's biggest leasing company. The sale, which  must be approved by Japan's Ministry of Finance, is expected to be completed  later this year.  </P></p>

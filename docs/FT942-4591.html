			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / US shipyards split orders The US Navy moved yesterday to safeguard its shipyards by announcing that it would split contracts evenly for six Dollars 1bn Aegis destroyers between two yards without competing bids, Reuter reports from Washington. Navy Secretary John Dalton called the radical departure from competition for such contracts 'a smart business strategy. . . to maintain a healthy industrial base for the surface combatants that will lead the Navy into the 21st century'. The yards are Ingalls, a unit of Litton Industries in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and Bath Iron Works which is a private shipyard in Bath, Maine. Each company has previously built Aegis guided missile destroyers. The contracts will be awarded this year and next.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR WITHDRAWS HOUSING SUPPORT OVER LAWSUITS  </P> <P> The future of one of the largest affordable housing projects in Ventura has  been placed in jeopardy because of recently discovered information about a  pattern of lawsuits involving the project's developer, Mayor Richard Francis  said Friday.  </P> <P> Francis said the extensive litigation involving the head of KNM Development  Inc., which had won tentative approval to build 147 affordable housing units in  east Ventura, has convinced him to drop his support of the project.  </P> <P> Ernest T. Mansi, the head of KNM, and the companies he controls have been sued  at least 10 times over the past six years for allegedly mishandling other  development projects in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, Francis said.  </P> <P> "My fear is that the KNM project will never be completed and we will end up  with an eyesore," Francis added.  </P> <P> Mansi could not be reached for comment at KNM offices in Oxnard and Camarillo  Friday, but Francis said he met with the developer early in the day and was  told by Mansi that there is no legitimate reason for the city to drop its  support of the project.  </P> <P> "He said he had an explanation for everything," Francis said.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Mansi submitted a letter to the city explaining his role in 11  lawsuits and generally denying any financial irresponsibility or negligence in  past construction projects. In some cases, the letter states that Mansi was  victimized by the actions of his partners. In other cases, the letter simply  states that the cases were settled.  </P> <P> KNM had received tentative approval from the City Council on Oct. 15 to build  the 147-unit project on the southeast corner of the intersection of Telegraph  Road and Reata Avenue.  </P> <P> Nearly 1,000 applicants have signed up for the houses, which would cost about  $146,800 for the three-bedroom units and $176,900 for the four-bedroom units,  Community Development Director Everett Millais said.  </P> <P> The council withheld final approval of the project pending a redesign of the  tract's traffic circulation pattern. The required changes were deemed so minor  that City Atty. Peter Bulens said the council was not required to hold a public  hearing next Monday when the project is scheduled to be considered for final  approval.  </P> <P> "I'm sure glad the project was sent back for redesign," said Francis, who had  moved without council support to approve the project without any changes. After  Francis' motion failed, the council voted 4 to 2 in favor of tentatively  approving the project and sending it back to the planning staff for minor  modifications.  </P> <P> Councilman John McWherter voted against the motion because he said it would  bring too much development to the city. Francis voted against the motion  because, although he supported the project, he did not favor the traffic  modifications that were being proposed. Councilman Gary Tuttle abstained,  citing a conflict of interest because he was distantly related to one of  Mansi's partners.  </P> <P> Francis said he decided to withdraw his support for the KNM development after  receiving information from a neighbor Wednesday listing more than 30 lawsuits  involving the head of KNM. Francis, who works as a private attorney in addition  to serving as mayor, said he was able to trace at least 10 of those suits  directly to Mansi.  </P> <P> After reviewing the list of lawsuits and speaking to some of the attorneys  involved in those cases, he determined that allowing the KNM projects to go  through would be too risky, Francis said.  </P> <P> While no evidence of wrongdoing was discovered, Francis said there were so many  allegations against Mansi that he felt uncomfortable about granting the project  final approval.  </P> <P> "What I see is a lot of smoke and you know the old adage," Francis said. "For  the city to be involved in a project of this magnitude, that requires a  presumption of credibility and confidence that all but guarantees the  deliverability of the project as planned."  </P> <P> Francis said he is particularly concerned about Mansi's role in two nursing  home projects, one in Lompoc and another in Santa Paula, which were never  built. Francis said he was also concerned about a condominium project in Oxnard  for which Mansi had done the engineering studies. The mayor said that, months  later, a roof caved in.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Cathy Bean, who was also informed of Mansi's legal disputes and  who earlier voted in favor of the project, said she too will now vote to  withhold approval of the KNM project until all doubts are eliminated.  </P> <P> "This is something we didn't know beforehand," Bean said of the lawsuits. "We  will need more information before we proceed any further."  </P> <P> City officials said they do not check the legal backgrounds of developers  seeking to build in the city. "We just make sure all the documents are correct  and that the actions the City Council takes are correct," Bulens said.  </P> <P> Millais added, "When we do our plan checks, it doesn't really matter whether  the developer is involved in a lawsuit or not, but in this case the developer  appears to be involved in a lot of lawsuits, and that always invites  suspicion."  </P></p>

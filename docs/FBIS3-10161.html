			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Gustavo Rossen, chairman of the Banco Latino  intervention board, announced the beginning of the financial  institution's recovery process. The process will begin next  week and will proceed in accordance with Article 234 of the  General Banking Law.    The statute, which was approved for discussion by the  Venezuelan Central Bank, allows the bank to move from the  intervention stage to the recovery stage. The decision was  based on a report on the banks assets, prepared by the General  Bank Superintendency last November. The report determined the  lost capital and allows the process to continue without waiting  for the final results of the official audit, which has not yet  totaled the trust funds deposited at National Bank of Curacao.    Now the missing Banco Latino assets have been posted as lost  funds, the Deposit Guarantee Fund, Fogade, will provide the  financial institution with funds. The liquidity injection will  be at no cost to Banco Latino, because it will be a capital  investment, thus making Fogade the bank's new owner. These  funds will allow Banco Latino to operate normally and begin its  recovery process, which entails much more than paying back its  depositors. The process could also restore the account holders'  trust in the financial institution and prevent them from  withdrawing all of their money. This would also improve the  quality of the bank's assets, from the perspective of  privatization.    Rossen explained that in a normal situation such as this,  the  Intervention Board can now try to improve the quality of the  bank's credit portfolio. To this end, the board has proposed  several measures to be included in the Emergency Law being  drafted by Congress. "Our proposals will turn loans into liquid  funds, and enhance investments, thus allowing us to resume  payment of the bank's obligations. If we could not count on the  income from such collections as a key element toward recovery,  we would have to resort to additional subsidies and bail out  money."    Rossen underscored the importance of the Emergency Law being  drafted in Congress, because it will allow the bank to resume  payments to its savings account holders. Noteworthy is the fact  that there are 21 billion bolivares at the Central Bank. Only 9  billion have been paid out, while 12 billion are being held in  escrow, because the bank has been unable to provide Fogade with  funds in the amounts it has demanded.    In addition to the beginning of the recovery process at  Banco  Latino, the Intervention Board will also begin collecting the  bank's outstanding receivables, starting with exchange notes,  and continuing with credit card balances. Rossen announced that  the board has not ruled out the possibility of many account  holders becoming shareholders of the financial institution. "We  would have to open a negotiation process to start making yearly  disbursements of 1 million bolivares to those people with large  deposits, in the form of preferential cumulative dividend  shares. The nature and value of such negotiable documents would  change in the secondary markets, in such a case as the  institution being sold to a foreign bank."    The various payment formulas currently under study will  allow  us to improve the banks receivables and future selling  qualities, and provide ways for the State to recover what it has  invested in the institution, within approximately five years.</p>

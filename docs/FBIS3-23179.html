			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Saygi Ozturk report: "Secret File on PKK Leader Abdullah </F> Ocalan"]    [Excerpts] The Turkish intelligence units have discovered  the truth behind the claim Damascus has made for many years that  Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] leader Abdullah Ocalan is not in  Syria. The intelligence units have established that Damascus  has given Ocalan a Syrian identity certificate and a new name.    The Syrian officials maintained during the meetings they  held  with their Turkish counterparts that Abdullah Ocalan is not in  their country. That was correct because no one in Syria is  known as Abdullah Ocalan. His name in that country is "Ahmad  Jasim Musa." The identity certificate that was issued to him was  signed by General 'Ali Duba, chief of the Syrian Intelligence  Organization.    According to the latest report from the Turkish intelligence  units, Ahmad Jasim Musa drives a bullet-proof vehicle that has  red registration plates. The registration numbers on Ocalan's  vehicle has been conveyed to all the security units and they  have been instructed not to stop him. Meanwhile, several  members of al-Mukhabarat, Syria's secret service organization,  are among Ocalan's bodyguards. They accompany him on his visits  to various cities in Syria. [passage omitted]    The PKK militants are obliged to inform al-Mukhabarat about  their activities. The PKK militants in the Aleppo region are  under the control of Brigadier General Hasan Khalluf, deputy  chief of military intelligence. The PKK militants in the  al-Hasakah and al-Qamishli regions are under the control of  Colonel Muhammad Mansur, head of military intelligence in the  two areas, and Amn al-Dawlah [state security]. Syrian officials  accompany the PKK militants to Tel Kocak, al-Malikiyah, and 'Ayn  Diwar on Syria's border with Iraq and help them cross into that  country. That is within the knowledge of Mansur and al-Dawla.    Meanwhile, Syria issues passports and identification to the  PKK militants who wish to travel to Europe. Those who travel  from Europe to Syria land in Beirut first. They are then  transported in trucks to al-Hasakah and al-Qamashli.</p>

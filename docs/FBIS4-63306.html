			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Konstantin Smirnov under the "Ruble Zone" rubric: </F> "What Is Healthy for a Prime Minister, Is Deadly for a Banker"]    [Text] In Belorussia [Belarus], the struggle has  heightened in the top echelons over the Republic's joining the  ruble zone. The Russian and Belorussian prime ministers, Viktor  Chernomyrdin and Vyacheslav Kebich, have agreed in Moscow to  step up Belorussia's "ruble Anschluss," while Stanislav  Bogdankevich, Belorussian National Bank chairman, told a  briefing in Minsk yesterday that the bilateral treaty on the  unification of money systems was "stillborn."    The clash between the prime minister and Belorussia's chief  banker over the republic's "rublization" cannot be called a  sensation. While Vyacheslav Kebich, as a high-ranking Minsk  official put it, is ready "to lie under a roller" for the sake  of the Republic's joining the Russian Central Bank's zone of  responsibility, Bogdankevich has always been skeptical about  attempts to solve Belorussia's monetary problems at the expense  of the Russian ruble (which has been an open secret for all).  In particular, a bill on the introduction of a national  currency, drawn up at the Belorussian National Bank, has been  sitting at the Belorussian parliament for nearly a year now. It  is symptomatic, however, that the National Bank chairman has for  the first time made public his flatly negative attitude to a  ruble union with Russia.    Stanislav Bogdankevich's demarche may be attributed at least  to two reasons: the corporate and the national ones. First,  Belorussia's "ruble Anschluss" is possible only by lowering the  status of the Belorussian National Bank to a branch of the  Russian Central Bank, which will remain the sole money creation  center of the two states. If Belorussia opts for its own  currency, however, and summons up the courage to launch economic  reform, the role of its National Bank in shaping its economic  policy is bound to grow. Hence, a clear conclusion for  Bogdankevich -- it is better to be a Belorussian Gerashchenko  than an assistant of Gerashchenko from Moscow.    Second, Bogdankevich's statement that the ruble union with  Russia is unwelcome may boost the presidential bids of  Vyacheslav Kebich's rivals, primarily former Belorussian  parliament speaker Stanislav Shushkevich, who hold a negative  view on the Republic's accession to the ruble zone.    To all appearances, the Russian Government will not react  officially to Stanislav Bogdankevich's latest statement.  However, if in the end the currency unification of Russia and  Belorussia fails to materialize, benefits granted to Belorussia,  first of all the lifting of Russian export tariffs on  commodities destined for the Republic starting 1 May, may be  cancelled.</p>

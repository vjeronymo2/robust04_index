			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Tigran Liloyan and </F> Sergey Ostanin]    [Text] Yerevan, 2 Apr -- Because of thick fog this morning,  the CIS interparliamentary assembly's peacemaking group on  achieving a Karabakh settlement was unable to fly to  Stepanakert, as had been scheduled the previous day. Only a few  members of the group left in automobiles for southeast Armenia.  Their meeting with Nagorno-Karabakh leaders will be held either  in Armenia's border areas or in a Nagorno-Karabakh village close  to the Lachin corridor. The ITAR- TASS correspondent learned  this at the Armenian Supreme Soviet press center.    It will probably take the parliamentarians 10 hours to  travel  there and back. There is a shortage of seats so no journalists  are involved in the trip.    The CIS interparliamentary assembly delegation plan to  return  to Moscow this evening.</p>

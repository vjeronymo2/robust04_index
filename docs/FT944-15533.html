			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: University reform proposal is recipe for destruction Sir, Your editorial, 'University reform' (October 11), while being music to the ears of certain pressure groups who would subordinate a rational system of higher education to self-interest, will probably be quoted (and - God help us - used) to wipe out the UK system of higher education as an international competitor. You suggest 'a designated 20 or so universities' should be funded to do research, while others would be restricted to being teaching institutions. What this would mean is that there would be 20 universities in the UK. That may be an aim espoused by the Financial Times - although there is absolutely no logic advanced for it. Of course, many universities are currently inadequately funded to carry out their functions as places of teaching,learning and scholarship. The FT's contribution appears to be to propose they are destroyed before they can collapse.

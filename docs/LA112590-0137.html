			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA, OXNARD WINS FLAVORED WITH MIDWEST SPICE  </P> <P> As far as Chicago reunions go, this would have been like seating Al Capone and  Elliot Ness at the same table.  </P> <P> Here was Lester Neal, Ventura's star center who hails from Chicago, playing  against Malcolm X College of Chicago in the semifinals of the Ventura College  tournament Saturday night.  </P> <P> Ventura won, 89-86, to set up a title-game matchup against Oxnard, but it was  hardly happy home week for Neal.  </P> <P> One of the reasons Chicago is known as the Windy City is because its residents  tend to brag so much, and when the Malcolm X players started blowing some hot  air Neal's way, he blew his top.  </P> <P> "A guy told me I was the worst thing to come out of Chicago," Neal said. "When  he said that, I had to go berserk. How could you say something like that? That  kind of hurt my feelings. I said, 'No, I ain't going for that.' "  </P> <P> Neal scored 17 points, 13 in the second half, grabbed nine rebounds had five  steals, four assists and blocked three shots.  </P> <P> Neal is a product of Southside Dunbar High, whereas the Malcolm X guys are  Westsiders.  </P> <P> "They ain't my homeboys, they're just from Chicago," Neal said. "They got off  light tonight."  </P> <P> Ventura's Uba Satterfield led all scorers with 32 points, 20 in the first half.  Jerry Dalton added 23 points for Ventura (5-1).  </P> <P> Oxnard (6-1) rebounded from a six-point second-half deficit to beat El Camino,  68-61, and avenge its only loss of the season. El Camino had beaten Oxnard,  70-58, in the Compton tournament.  </P> <P> "Our kids have been playing the heck out of the defense," said Remy McCarthy,  who is off to his best start in three seasons at Oxnard. "I'm in a pretty good  mood right now."  </P> <P> Shawn Talley, another Chicagoan, led Oxnard with 18 points. Tim Thomas added 15  points, 10 rebounds and six steals. Don Mitchell also scored 15.  </P> <P> Ventura and Oxnard will meet at 7:30 tonight for the championship.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE'S JUST BEGINNING A MAMMOTH JOB;  </P> <P> SKIING: AT 74, DAVE MCCOY HAS ALREADY DONE ENOUGH TO EARN A LIFE OF LEISURE.  BUT HE WON'T STOP WORKING ON HIS MOUNTAIN RESORTS UNTIL ALL HIS DREAMS BECOME A  REALITY.  </P> <P> Bring me men to match my mountains. -- SAM WALTER FOSS, "The Coming American"  </P> <P> As he approaches 75, Dave McCoy might be excused if he suddenly chucked it all,  bought a set of clubs and moved to a condo on a golf course at Rancho Mirage or  some other resort.  </P> <P> His monument, Mammoth Mountain, is secure in its position as one of the world's  great ski resorts, its day-to-day operation in the capable hands of his son,  Gary McCoy. Mammoth's recent acquisition, June Mountain, is being managed  efficiently by his daughter, Kandi McCoy. So, why not relax and enjoy the  remaining golden years in a balmier climate?  </P> <P> "It's too late for me to retire now," McCoy said the other day. "And besides,  I've never seen anyplace that I like near as much as this. It has the four  seasons. It has all the things that go along with each season.  </P> <P> "I'm here seven days a week. I put every ounce of effort into it I possibly  can."  </P> <P> Just kidding, Dave. Nobody thought you would really ever retire. There are too  many irons in the fire:  </P> <P>  -- Connecting Mammoth with June.  </P> <P>  -- Helping to develop North Village.  </P> <P>  -- Working with Snowcreek Resort to interconnect with the proposed new Sherwin  Ski Area.  </P> <P>  -- Providing support for the Juniper Ridge project.  </P> <P> Obviously, Mammoth, which already has three day-lodges and 30 lifts serving  more than 3,500 acres of skiing terrain, is far from finished -- and neither is  McCoy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE MAN AND HIS DREAM  </P> <P> Dave McCoy was born in Los Angeles, but he said, "My father was a highway  contractor, and I lived probably in 95% of the towns in Central California.  </P> <P> "When I was 12 years old, I was over here, and saw the area and just fell in  love with it, and said that's where I'm going to spend my life. My folks  separated before my 13th birthday, and I really didn't see them after that for  quite a long time. I worked on some ranches in the (San Joaquin) Valley, and  then went to Washington where my grandparents were, up by Mt. Rainier.  </P> <P> "I visited here twice, until I graduated from high school, and the minute I  graduated, I headed for here."  </P> <P> This was during the depths of the Depression, and jobs were scarce.  </P> <P> "I went to work on a WPA project, an aqueduct," McCoy said, "and in the winter  it snowed quite heavily, and they needed somebody who could ski, so I just  transferred from the WPA project right into the regular (Los Angeles)  Department of Water and Power.  </P> <P> "I was a laborer but I was doing hydrographic work and cement work and rock  work and everything else."  </P> <P> As he skied throughout the region for the DWP, McCoy noticed that  11,000-foot-high Mammoth Mountain, because of its location, exposure and  bountiful snowfall, would make an ideal ski resort, but he had more immediate  concerns, such as providing for a family.  </P> <P> Just as it was love at first sight with the Eastern Sierra, his choice of a  wife was equally quick and decisive.  </P> <P> "Roma is a native of Bishop," he said, "and the first time I saw her, (I said)  that's the gal for me."  </P> <P> Before Mammoth, there was McGee Mountain.  </P> <P> "I started (in the ski business, part-time) in 1936, working for . . .  Courtlandt Hill when he had a cable lift on McGee," McCoy said. "I was just a  handyman, so to speak. . . . And the Eastern Sierra Ski Club had their ropetows  on McGee. I belonged to the ski club and helped with all the mechanical things  there.  </P> <P> "Corty (Hill) quit in '38, and the ski club sold me all of their ski lift  equipment, I think it was '39. But from then on, I just used portables and put  them wherever we wanted to put them. We had a roving permit from the Forest  Service.  </P> <P> "I had a full-time job (with the DWP) for 18 years. I didn't quit the city  until '53. (But) we were skiing in here (on Mammoth Mountain) -- we had pretty  good-sized ropetows -- prior to that.  </P> <P> "We built the No. 1 chair in '54, and in '55 it was running. Our first little  warming hut here was about 12 x 24, and we called it the Snake Pit."  </P> <P> From that time on, there was no stopping Mammoth, as the post-World War II  skiing boom, fueled by the 1960 Winter Olympics at Squaw Valley, and the  population explosion in Southern California created the demand for first-class  facilities.  </P> <P> McCoy grabbed on and rode the tiger's tail.  </P> <P> Asked when he was finally convinced that Mammoth would make a go of it, McCoy  didn't hesitate. "1953," he said, which was when he left the Department of  Water and Power.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's ever been a time that I haven't questioned whether I've  overextended (myself) or not," he said. "I just keep going as fast and as hard  as I possibly can all the time. I never took anything out of the company,  really, other than just to provide subsistence for the family.  </P> <P> "Me and the bank have a good relationship. And the Forest Service. And the  skiers."  </P> <P> McCoy got the chance to develop Mammoth almost by default.  </P> <P> Not long after World War II, he said, "a team of European and American ski  groups and the Forest Service looked at Mammoth. (This was) before I got the  permit to build the first chairlift. And their survey said that Mammoth was the  least likely to be successful, of any other mountain in the country, because of  its inaccessibility, its Alpine and high-altitude area -- and it's in a storm  belt.  </P> <P> "So, I put all those things together and kept working with them while everybody  else ignored us.  </P> <P> "The Forest Service had put out a prospectus for a big development here, but  that (survey) scared everybody off, so the Forest Service asked me if I wanted  to try to do it. I said sure, I'll try. I had nothing to lose. It was left wide  open for me."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE MOUNTAIN  </P> <P> Mammoth Mountain averages about 335 inches of snow a year, and it's not unusual  for it to open by Columbus Day, in October, and close on the following Fourth  of July. The terrain is about 30% advanced, 40% intermediate and 30% beginner,  and the maximum vertical drop is 3,100 feet.  </P> <P> The two gondolas, 26 chairlifts and two surface lifts have a total uphill  capacity of 43,000 skiers an hour. Of course, not that many are ever on the  slopes at the same time, although it may seem like it on a crowded holiday  weekend.  </P> <P> Mammoth, however, has never had to cut off lift-ticket sales.  </P> <P> "We don't (set a limit)," McCoy said. "They just kind of seem to set their own  quota. Even if they're here, they're skating or they're bike-riding or  cross-country skiing or just hiking or shopping. There's so many things that  they can do, and they seem to just take turns, on their own.  </P> <P> "We have never limited the skier. We always thought we'd have to, but they do a  good job (on their own)."  </P> <P> Although Mammoth, located about 300 miles north of Los Angeles via California  14 and U.S. 395, attracts its biggest turnouts on the weekends, McCoy has no  special plans for trying to boost midweek business.  </P> <P> "If you look at Mammoth during top season," he said, "how many (midweek skiers)  does any other destination resort, say Sun Valley, have -- 2,000 to 3,000  people . . . It's not uncommon for us to have 8,000 to 10,000 people on a  weekday. . . . And 10,000 people on the mountain is nothing. We cover about  3,500 acres, and they just have all kinds of Alpine open skiing on the upper  part of the mountain. You can't count those as acres or runs -- that's just  space. So, you don't even know that there's anybody here with 10,000 people.  </P> <P> "Just from our driving range of 300 miles -- well, San Diego is a little  farther than that -- we must have 14 million people. So, we'll never get away  from that weekend influx.  </P> <P> "Even with all the acreage and all the lifts we have, we still don't try to go  out and bring people outside of California in. We don't have to. We're happy  the way we are, really.  </P> <P> "But there will be a day as we expand and make what we call a "ski circus" out  of it (that we will do that)."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE MOUNTAIN II  </P> <P> June Mountain is another half-hour north on U.S. 395. It is about one-seventh  the size of Mammoth and has seven chairlifts plus a state-of-the-art QMC  tramway that carries skiers from the parking lot to mid-mountain.  </P> <P> McCoy's plan is to eliminate the half-hour drive and enable skiers to ski and  ride lifts between Mammoth and June, which he purchased in the summer of 1986.  </P> <P> Explaining how he happened to buy June, McCoy said: "Bud Hayward (of Tustin)  had June Mountain for 23 years, and it was actually one step from bankruptcy.  Bud and I always got along real good, and he didn't want to turn loose of it  for love nor money. I kept telling him that if there was ever a time when he  wanted to get out of it, I'd see that he got a fair deal. And I would look at  him as the pioneer who saved it for somebody to develop in the future.  </P> <P> "We just had a handshake deal that if it ever came to that time, he would  approach me, and that's exactly what happened. I made him a deal he couldn't  turn down. I was glad to do it, because I felt he had put his heart and soul  into it.  </P> <P> "Now, even though June is small, it has the greatest percentage of any ski area  in the business today of high-capacity units. It has two high-speed quads and  the QMC, which we put in.  </P> <P> "We're really happy with it, and now, it will make it more possible to connect  the two.  </P> <P> "Probably 12 or 15 (lifts would be needed to connect Mammoth and June, at a  minimum). You could do it like a sawtooth, going up and down. (Or) you could  actually connect them with one transportation system. We could take a baseline  lift and go from here to June so that wherever you got up high enough, you'd  ski down into a station on the transportation system.  </P> <P> "So conceivably, you could build that lift and then pick one or two of the most  desirable canyons or ridges or peaks, whatever, and develop them first, and you  could do it with three or four lifts. . . . It would be a cable system of some  kind. You can have angle stations and on-and-off stations. (Eventually,) that's  what I see, that every major collecting point, like a canyon, may have five  lifts in one big canyon, and where it would funnel out, then that would hit the  transportation system.  </P> <P> "You could do it with a smaller number (of lifts), but I would think before  it's over, there are so many places out there to ski, you'd probably put in 50  lifts. There'd (also) be some base facilities out there. Just like here, we  have to put a base facility over at Chair 15 and probably another at Chair 4.  We have to make skiing more convenient, easier and more enjoyable."  </P> <P> Asked if he thought there might be any opposition to such a project from  environmentalists, McCoy said: "I really don't think so. I think they'll just  keep an eye on us like they always do and make sure we do it, in their eyes,  the way that it's right and proper, and to the best of our ability.  </P> <P> "The Sierra Club realizes just like everybody else does that there has to be a  place for the numbers of people to recreate and get out and really enjoy it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE FUTURE IS NOW  </P> <P> The three new developments -- North Village, Snowcreek with its proposed  Sherwin Ski Area, and Juniper Ridge -- are in various stages of development by  other entrepreneurs.  </P> <P> Asked if he was in favor of all three going ahead as planned, McCoy said: "You  betcha."  </P> <P> He also foresees the day when Mammoth Lakes Airport will be expanded to  accommodate the larger jets of a major airline or two. At present, Alpha Air  offers daily small-jet service from LAX's Imperial Terminal, Burbank, San  Diego, Oakland and San Jose.  </P> <P> "A 727 can land on this strip now," he said. "It's adequate. Occasionally,  you'll see one down there (with a charter group).  </P> <P> "I think when we get the bigger hotels, the full-service hotels, then  (expansion of the airport) will happen. It looks like they're sitting there,  ready to come on -- (the airport would) just piggyback right on that.  </P> <P> "That's what the North Village is all about, and Juniper Ridge, and then Tom  Dempsey out in the meadow is figuring on three full-service hotels -- at  Snowcreek. They'll make a regular center out there. It will be beautiful."  </P> <P> As for Mammoth's potential involvement in the proposed Sherwin Ski Area, which  would be adjacent to Snowcreek and southeast of Mammoth, McCoy said: "If  Dempsey doesn't (develop the ski area), and he comes to us to see if we'll do  it, we would maybe consider. I don't know.  </P> <P> "We're going to try to interconnect (our lifts) regardless, and I would hope  (the first lifts at Sherwin) would be ready within two years."  </P> <P> A hearing was held by the Inyo National Forest here last Saturday to obtain  public reaction to the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Sherwin Ski  Area, and written comments on the proposal will be accepted by the U.S. Forest  Service, c/o Dennis Martin, 873 N. Main St., Bishop, CA. 93514, providing they  are postmarked no later than today.  </P> <P> Regarding Juniper Ridge, McCoy said: "Whenever the hotel and condominiums, and  all that, go in over there (adjacent to Mammoth, between the Lake Mary Road  bridge and the base area of Chairs 15 and 24), then we would build a base lodge  at the same time (at Chair 15).  </P> <P> "North Village is right at the bottom, in town here. That's going to be a great  development, a walk-around village. We have people now bidding for the project.  </P> <P> "We owned a lot of the base land right there. That's the only land that I ever  held onto. I gave properties away and stayed out of the real estate in town,  because I wanted the people there to kind of guide their own destiny. I don't  want any involvement with them, other than to help or support them wherever we  can."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BUT IS BIGGER BETTER?  </P> <P> McCoy acknowledges that one of the appeals of skiing is that it allows people  to find some elbow room outdoors, away from the crowded freeways and housing  developments. So, why is he in favor of all this intensive development, and how  can the congestion be minimized?  </P> <P> "That goes back to your (talk that Mammoth needs to be more of a) destination  resort," he said. "The destination resorts that we know of, like Sun Valley or  Aspen or Vail, that's what they are, they're really a congested area where  people get really tight together. Mammoth is spread out, and you do have that  quiet and that enjoyable privilege of being private, you might say, when you're  off the hill. And I think a lot of people really like that about June, also,  because it's very much the same way.  </P> <P> "I think that's why Mammoth spread out like it did. Otherwise, we'd have just  had two or three great big base hotels, and each one take 3,000 or 4,000 people  apiece, like they do in Europe.  </P> <P> "North Village . . . will be a walk-around center with underground parking. You  bring your car in and leave it. (But) I don't see making a parking lot near 395  and bringing people in, because of the numbers.  </P> <P> "That would really be a problem (for Southern California people). They live  with their cars, they really do, and I think the more convenient we make it for  them to use their vehicles, the more they're going to like it.  </P> <P> "But once they get settled in, if we can get transportation systems into the  higher-density areas -- they like that, also. And they're now using our free  shuttle (buses) a lot."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WILL SKIERS KEEP COMING?  </P> <P> On the negative said, one of the raps against skiing is that it is too  expensive. It's easy to spend $2,000 or more just to get started -- with one  pair of skis, poles and boots and one outfit. Throw in the travel, lodging,  meal and apres-ski costs, and the price of an all-day lift ticket actually  becomes a minor item.  </P> <P> At Mammoth and June, it's $35, which McCoy said is less than adequate to keep  pace with rising expenses, although he believes the overall costs are not  especially exorbitant.  </P> <P> "I don't really see (skiing) being too expensive (when) you compare it with any  other recreation, or anything else like a car or food costs," McCoy said.  "We've kept within that same area, and we're still able to develop a little,  but slower. We don't have near the income to develop like we used to . . . say,  up to three years ago.  </P> <P> "The expense now is . . . like our power expenses have changed. It used to be,  the more kilowatts you used, the cheaper it got. Now, the more they have to  supply you, the more it costs you, averaged throughout the year. And the  equipment demand that the skier puts on us . . . like grooming equipment we  used to buy for $25,000, now it's $175,000 for just one piece of machinery.  </P> <P> "The chairlifts that are being replaced, some of them we bought years ago for a  couple of hundred thousand (dollars), and some recently -- the fixed grips --  for $500,000. Now, a good quad detachable costs you three to four million  bucks.  </P> <P> "(Lift-ticket increases) haven't kept pace. So, our margin is a lot less. I  thought there was (skier resistance) to paying more, but apparently there  really isn't, because they see the quality, and we're trying to give them what  they want. The sport is actually growing, as far as we're concerned.  </P> <P> "Skiing has been so good to us here at Mammoth that I can't help but just want  to return it to the skier and see that they have a better place to recreate."  </P> <P> Dave and Roma McCoy show no signs of slowing down, but they have gradually  concentrated more on enjoying themselves, turning over some of their duties to  their children, all of whom grew up on skis, racing and learning all facets of  the sport.  </P> <P> "We've got six kids, 16 grandchildren and a great-grandchild," McCoy said, "and  we still ride bicycles and ride horses and ski all day and just have a ball.  </P> <P> "I hurt myself pretty bad about six years ago on a motorcycle. I tried to get  right back out there (on the slopes) and stayed with it, but it took me awhile  to feel comfortable again."  </P> <P> Four of the McCoys' offspring are still around.  </P> <P> "Gary is the manager of Mammoth," McCoy said. "Kandi is the manager of June.  Penny is in special events both here and at June, and Randy is the pilot for  Mammoth.  </P> <P> "Poncho raises cattle. He has a big cattle ranch in Montana, and we use a lot  of his animals. We use them for hamburger and steaks in the restaurant . . .  all of the meat we can. And Carl -- "Peanut" -- is up in Canada. He has a  little ranch and just kind of likes the quiet; he likes the outdoors very much.  It's just too populated for him here.  </P> <P> "In racing, Penny and Poncho did the best, because they could put up with the  politics."  </P> <P> In the late 1960s, McCoy was mentioned as a possible coach of the U.S. Ski  Team, but he said: "I never even let 'em think that I would consider it,  because I was too busy here.  </P> <P> "When any of the kids left here (to race on the national level), I didn't  interfere at all. I didn't try to coach them or anything, but we'd always  communicate. I probably got more telephone calls from Europe than anyone could  imagine.  </P> <P> "They're still all great kids. They've all grown up. They're in businesses for  themselves and all had good eductions. That's what I really pushed more than  the skiing."  </P> <P> So, Mammoth remains in good hands, according to McCoy, who has one other goal,  improbable as it may be: "I hope I live another hundred years so I can develop  Mammoth as big as it should be."  </P></p>

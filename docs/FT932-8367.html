			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: RPC to join the market with Pounds 75m tag SHARES in RPC Group, the plastic packaging company, are to be sold to the public through an intermediaries offer next week at a price of 125p, valuing the company at Pounds 75m. The company is raising Pounds 33.7m net in the sale and the placing underwritten yesterday by Baring Brothers. The three key directors are not selling any shares and will not do so for at least a year. The company will use Pounds 18.8m of the proceeds and will take on some debt to redeem Pounds 23.1m of preference shares and shares held by employees. Of 28m shares being placed, 9.8m are subject to recall to satisfy valid applications from preferential applicants under the intermediaries offer. At 125p, the company has a historic p/e multiple of 15.1 times. The notional yield is 3 per cent and the notional net dividend for the year to end-March 1993 is 3p. RPC was a management buy-out in 1991 from SCA, the Swedish paper and forest products group. SCA had bought the group from Reedpack, in turn an MBO from Reed International. The offer closes at noon on May 25 and trading begins on May 28. It is underwritten by Baring Brothers and the broker is Cazenove. COMMENT RPC has the look of a thoroughly solid company. Cash generation is strong; it appears, unlike many MBOs, to have invested in its future. And the applications for polymer based rigid packaging are growing soundly, so it can expect to take market share from glass, for example. The company is already producing fine double digit margins, so there can be only limited improvement here. But as the economy recovers, so growth should emerge strongly from its largest market sector - paint pots, even if elsewhere sales are less geared to recovery. The pricing, while by no means ambitious, is also not overly generous. At 125p, RPC is almost bang in line with rival, Plysu's prospective multiple of about 14 times. On balance though this a reasonable rate at which to be getting on board a long-term growth stock where strong management is already up and running.</p>

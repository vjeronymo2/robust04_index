			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / 'No cuts' in upkeep of Canary Wharf THE administrators to Canary Wharf, the insolvent office project in London's Docklands, yesterday rejected criticism that maintenance standards of the complex were slipping, Vanessa Houlder writes. In a letter to tenants, Mr Alan Bloom, one of the joint administrators from Ernst &amp; Young, said there had been no cuts in maintenance staff. It was inevitable that at any particular time there would be items of maintenance outstanding. Tenants should inform the administrators if they considered there had been any shortfalls of performance, he said. Criticisms about the state of the project have included cracked paving slabs and operating problems with the fountain and doors. Mr Bloom said the administrators were in discussion with potential occupiers for more than 1m sq ft of office space, Potential tenants include government departments and Tower Hamlets Council, which is looking for space for 1,000 headquarters staff.</p>

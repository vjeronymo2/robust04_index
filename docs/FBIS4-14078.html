			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Mohammad Gol Aryubwal, </F> deputy defense minister, by unidentified correspondent in Kabul;  date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [Correspondent] Esteemed Lieutenant General  Mohammad Gol Aryubwal, deputy defense minister of the Islamic  State of Afghanistan, I thank you for receiving us for the  interview. I would like to ask you -- since we are now  completing the second anniversary of the Islamic revolution --  since the fall of the previous regime and the disintegration of  its arme, the country has had a new national Islamic Army.  Could you please give us information about the organization and  ideological work in the Army?    [Aryubwal] In the name of God the compassionate, the  merciful. As you said, the Army of Afghanistan disintegrated.  It was an organized plan of the longstanding enemies of  Afghanistan. For ages they planned to destroy the national  treasures of Afghanistan -- the national archive of Afghanistan,  the museums, and to eliminate the Afghan institutions -- to  destroy the national Army of Afghanistan -- and with the  implementation of that plan Afghanistan was faced with a strange  situation which is the cause of the sorrow of every Afghan,  every Muslim, every patriot. Through their servants they took  all Afghan treasures to their countries. In practice now there  is nothing in Afghanistan.    But although Afghanistan was confronted with a civil war by  those enemies of its freedom, the Islamic State of Afghanistan  was able to establish such an army to at least defend the  national honor of Afghanistan, that is to safeguard its national  unity and national sovereignty. And despite the problems  created for it by the enemies, the Afghan Army has been able to  protect national sovereignty and national unity and to abort  many of the enemies' conspiracies. As I said before despite the  fact that the Army is faced with big problems -- for a single  moment the Afghan Army has not been allowed to be  self-confident, to think about itself -- yet, thanks God, a  large number of patriotic and nationalist trained officers, from  every class, every stratum, every profession came together and  organized themselves. As a result of this organization, thus  far several conspiracies, created especially by [word  indistinct] enemies of Afghanistan about which the world knows,  have been aborted by this Army, and God willing so far as  possible it will defend the national honor of the country at any  moment, day and night.    From the ideological point of view too the Islamic Army is  progressing and attention has been paid to the ideological life  of the Army. Courses have been set up and work continues. It  is hoped that when the Afghan Army can rest for a while it is  expected of it to [words indistinct].    [Correspondent] Unfortunately since the victory of the  Islamic revolution there had been fighting in various directions  in Afghanistan. Recent incidents would have caused very grave  consequences, but the mojahedin and officials of our Islamic  Army were able to prevent those grave incidents. Please shed  some light on the activities and the share of the officials and  units of the Islamic Army and mojahedin in the dislodging of the  recent incidents.    [Aryubwal] As I said before, the longstanding enemies of  Afghanistan have not for a moment allowed the Afghan nation,  Army, and state to dress Afghanistan's wounds so as to take care  of its affairs and pay attention to its national unity and  reconstruction. [Words indistinct] especially after the recent  conspiracy this heroic, Muslim and patriotic Army, which cannot  even be called an army compared with other armies, was able to  abort a dangerous conspiracy, a coup d'etat. Not only did it  abort the coup d'etat, but it also gained many victories, which  are a cause of pride for this Army. Military experts can  understand the fact that an army, which even cannot be called an  army, was able to abort such a dangerous coup d'etat that was  supported by many foreign powers, and to capture many areas from  the enemies.    For example since the failed coup d'etat of 11 Jadi [1  January] this Army has cleared up bravely the area of the  airport, where previously militia forces resided, and the areas  of Qabelbai, Hudkhel, Banayi, Alokhel, Milli Bus, Microrayon  Bridge, the area of Idgah mosque, the surroundings of Balahesar,  Maiwand Wat, [east and south of Kabul] the surroundings of  Bagh-e Babor, the surrounding of Dehmazang, the cultural area of  Kabul, and many other areas in Kabul.    Outside Kabul many victories have been achieved. For  instance, Parwan Province has been completely cleared of the  enemies and many positions have been conquered. The enemy is in  very small area of Kapisa Province, God willing, and in a short  time that area will also be cleared [words indistinct]. In  northern areas such as in Faryab Province many areas have been  cleared of the militia. The area of Pol-e Khomri [in Baghlan]  is completely cleared. Northern Salang, Khinjan, Doshi,  Samangan Province, and the districts of Balkh Province have been  conquered. In the near future we will hear about other  conquests too. [passage omitted]</p>

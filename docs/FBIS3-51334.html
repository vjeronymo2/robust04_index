			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 14 Jan (EFE) -- Peru's principal mayors have  created a common front against President Alberto Fujimori's  administration due to its decision to make big cuts in their  municipal fiscal revenues.    What seemed to be only a "skirmish" between Fujimori and  Lima  Mayor Ricardo Belmont could become a major "war" which could  even end up in court.    Belmont received on 13 January the support of Cusco Mayor  Daniel Estrada, who asked him to coordinate with other affected  mayors "a common strategy to force back autocracy and  arbitrariness."    Socialist Alfonso Barrantes, former Lima mayor, has joined  them and said that he is willing to work in "any position  assigned to me to defend municipal laws."    Belmont was unusually tough and has accused the government  of  "harming Lima more than terrorism does." He added that "more  works have been interrupted than those we implemented in one  year due to budget cuts. It is as though The Trebol (the  biggest cloverleaf in Lima) was dynamited."    The possibility that this conflict will reach the courts has  even been left open, because the Popular Action Party (AP) has  decided that its mayors will file an amparo against the law that  cuts municipal revenues.    Arturo Castillo, Association of Peruvian Municipalities  (AMPE) president and Chiclayo mayor, is among the AP mayors.    President Fujimori refused, meanwhile, to change his mind  about his governmental decision and underscored that the  government has not cut municipal revenues, rather, "has  distributed them more equitably."    He added that "what we did was channel more funds to poorer  municipalities, which will then be able to carry out more works  to benefit their peoples." He added that the municipalities  whose revenues were cut "can get more funds from other sources  because they control the regions that are richest in resources."    Certain experts believe that Fujimori is playing a political  game to thwart the presidential ambitions of both Belmont and  Estrada, because they will be unable to deliver the works they  promised and that they planned to use in their campaigns.    The presidential elections will be held in May 1995. This is  why 1994 is considered an "electorally decisive" year for  politicians with governmental ambitions.    Fujimori has yet to decide if he will run for reelection  next  year. Many believe, however, that he is at least trying to  ensure that his eventual candidacy will have the best chance of  succeeding.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News In Brief: Amoco AMOCO, the US oil group, has secured a preliminary agreement to develop the giant Priobskoye oil field in Western Siberia, after a competitive bid with other Western oil companies, writes Richard Waters in New York. The field has reserves of as much as 5bn barrels and could at its peak produce 450,000 barrels a day, making it a field 'of world class', Amoco said. The agreement gives the US company exclusive rights to negotiate a full production-sharing agreement with the Russian government and the two Russian companies which will jointly develop the field.</p>

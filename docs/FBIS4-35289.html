			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Yemeni House of Representatives on </F> 29 May]    [Text] Statement by the House of Representatives  concerning the declaration of secession.    Praise be to God, who said in the Holy Koran: And hold fast,  all together, by the rope which God stretches out for you, and  be not divided among yourselves. Blessings and prayers of God  on His Prophet Muhammad, his household, and companions.    The House of Representatives, the legitimate representative  of all people of the united Yemen and the voice of their will,  [words indistinct] the national responsibility it shoulders, and  out of its understanding of the threats (?facing the country)  these days has broken off its holiday [words indistinct] on 17  Dhi al-Hijjah 1414 hegira, corresponding to 28 May 1994 to  discuss the (?criminal) act committed by 'Ali Salim al-Bid and  his secessionist gang against the country's unity, sovereignty,  and stability by declaring secession on 21 May 1994.    In view of the seriousness of this act, which is considered  high treason and a violation of the Constitution and an  infringement on the Republic of Yemen's sovereignty,  independence, and territorial integrity, the people's deputies  discussed this treacherous act from all Constitutional, legal,  and political aspects in the light of the Constitution and the  valid laws and the country's higher national interests.    Based on these discussions and the constitutional and legal  texts, the House of Representatives decides the following:    1. (?To condemn) al-Bid's declaration of secession as a  violation of the Constitution and all valid laws in the Republic  of Yemen.    2. The House considers this declaration not only a rebellion  against legitimacy, but also a flagrant encroachment against the  will of the Yemeni people and their unity, independence,  sovereignty, security and stability. All unionist and  democratic forces, as well as all citizens, must stand against  this act and confront it through all means since it is a  criminal act, which calls for bringing al-Bid and those who  supported him to trial on charges of high treason on the basis  of the Constitution and the valid laws.    3. The House of Representatives, as a legislative body,  represents all the people and adopts its decisions by majority  at official meetings and in accordance with the Constitution and  its bylaws. No deputy or group of deputies has the right to  hold a meeting or adopt a decision outside its headquarters and  away from its speakership. This indicates that what these  elements had done is null and void. These elements alleged that  they represent the Yemeni Socialist Party bloc, and they  approved al-Bid's secessionist declaration. Their action  represented an aggression against the unity, independence, and  territorial integrity of Yemen.    4. The House of Representatives urges all sisterly and  friendly countries to respect their positions and commitments  toward the Republic of Yemen as an independent sovereign state  that is an Arab League and UN member, and not to interfere in  its affairs, because what is going on is an internal affair in  which no country has the right to interfere, in accordance with  the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen, the Arab League  Charter, and international charters.    The House emphasizes that any interference by any country or  any regional or international organization represents a  dangerous sign that will prolong strife and shift it from the  Yemeni horizon to the Arab and international horizons. This  will also open the way for renegade movements in a number of  countries, and will widen differences among the countries  involved in this interference.    The House of Representatives appreciates the heroic  positions  of the Armed Forces which protect unity and legitimacy. We pray  Almighty God to grant these forces success, and we urge all sons  of the Yemeni people to support the Armed Forces in order to  protect unity and legitimacy by all material and moral means.    The House urges the soldiers, noncommissioned officers, and  officers who are subjected to the orders of the secessionist  clique to join the army of unity and legitimacy in order to  preserve the peoples' respect for them, and to protect their  militant assets.    We seek God's support, and peace be upon you.    [Signed] The House of Representatives on 18 Dhu al-Hijjah,  1414 Hegira, corresponding to 29 May 1994</p>

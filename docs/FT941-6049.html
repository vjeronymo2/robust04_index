			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Disposal of Devenish stake behind rise at Boddington Boddington, the pubs, leisure and healthcare group, produced an 87 per cent rise in pre-tax profit in the year to January 2, thanks almost entirely to the disposal of its stake in Devenish, the rival pub group. At the trading level, profits were up less than 1 per cent. Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, said this was a 'continued strong performance in very difficult market conditions'. Trading in the year to date, he said, had been ahead of last year. Sales were Pounds 242.3m (Pounds 236.2m). Trading profits were Pounds 32.7m against Pounds 32.4m. However, the company pointed out that 1992 had been a 53-week year. Adjusting for that, the underlying growth in trading profit was 5 per cent. Trading profit in the pubs division was Pounds 21.8m (Pounds 22.7m), with beer volumes down 3.1 per cent. Leisure hotels made Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1.6m). Drinks wholesaling profits were unchanged at Pounds 7.5m. Mr Cassidy said there are signs that the price war of the past couple of years may be changing. Profits in health care, hit by the introduction of the Community Care Act last spring, were also unchanged, at Pounds 3.2m. After a Pounds 14.7m profit on the Devenish sale, and net interest charges reduced from Pounds 7.1m to Pounds 4.7m by the Pounds 37m sale proceeds, pre-tax profit was Pounds 41.2m (Pounds 22m). Earnings per share, excluding disposal profits and exceptionals, were up 9.9 per cent at 17.8p. The annual dividend is raised 10 per cent to 8.03p with a final of 5.17p. Mr Cassidy said the supply agreement whereby Whitbread supplies Boddington with beer brands, including Boddington bitter and Stella Artois lager, had been extended to 2000. The price would be tied to the general rate of inflation. COMMENT Though underlying profits are flat this is not a bad performance in Boddington's markets. In particular, both the wholesaling and nursing homes divisions had to cope with supposedly temporary problems. This year, the market expects about 10 per cent growth in earnings: a full year's use of the money from the Devenish sale is worth 2 per cent on earnings alone. On that basis the shares - unchanged at 273p in yesterday's falling market - are on an apparently undemanding multiple of 14. The unsettling factor in the near term is that Whitbread must unload 5 per cent of the equity. Further out, Boddington is contracted to take the bulk of the beer it sells through its pubs at prices linked to the RPI until the millennium. But what if the beer price falls?</p>

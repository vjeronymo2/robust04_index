			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: KEDER, DOUGHERTY TO TRY OUT WITH SOCKERS  </P> <P> With the Major Soccer League season nine days away, the Sockers continue to  audition free agents for four remaining roster spots.  </P> <P> Forward Keder, who scored 28 goals while playing 36 games for the Sockers  during the 1987-88 season, arrived Tuesday, according to President Ron Cady.  </P> <P> Midfielder Paul Dougherty will show up today, Coach Ron Newman said.  </P> <P> Dougherty played three seasons with the Sockers before going to Baltimore as a  free agent last year. His best year was in 1987-88, when he was second on the  team in goals (40) and assists (24).  </P> <P> Like Keder, Dougherty's no lock.  </P> <P> "Let me say this," Newman said. "We're not bringing Paul in -- he's bringing  himself in."  </P> <P> Added Cady, "I don't even know if we want to sign him."  </P> <P> But Newman appeared anxious to get Dougherty in the fold.  </P> <P> "Paul would be a good exciting asset," he said. "He has experience (four years  in the MSL), and we need experienced players."  </P> <P> Dougherty severed his ties with Baltimore when he decided to go back to outdoor  soccer in his native England. He has since cooled on that idea, Newman said.  </P> <P> In other news, the Sockers have ended talks with free-agent midfielder Michael  Collins, Newman said. Also, Cady said the team may reopen talks with midfielder  Jacques Ladouceur. Ladouceur, one of only two players to play in all 52 games  last year, was offered a contract before training camp, but refused to sign,  saying it was too low of an offer. JOHN GEIS  </P></p>

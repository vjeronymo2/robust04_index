			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Hannover (DDP/ADN) -- Lower Saxony Interior  Minister Gerhard Glogowski has announced a halt to the  deportation of Kurds from his federal state to Turkey. Should  the heads of the regional governments fail to decide tomorrow on  a collective halt to deportation, Lower Saxony will act  unilaterally, Glogowski told the Lower Saxony Landtag today.  The interior minister assured the Landtag that at the moment no  one is being sent from Lower Saxony to face death or torture.    In his speech, the text of which was released in advance,  Glogowski stressed that no Kurds will be deported from Lower  Saxony until the prime ministers' decision. The interior  minister criticized the fact that weapons are again being  supplied to Turkey, despite its being well-known that the  Turkish Army uses them against the Kurds. The minister spoke of  a war of extermination against the Kurds in Turkey. He called  on Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to take a firm stand to bring  the murder in Turkey to an end.

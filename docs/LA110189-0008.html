			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH, GORBACHEV WILL MEET AT SEA FOR INFORMAL TALKS;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: THE MEDITERRANEAN MEETING DEC.2-3 IS EXPECTED TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR  AN ARMS SUMMIT IN 1990.  </P> <P> President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet aboard U.S.  and Soviet naval ships in the Mediterranean on Dec. 2 and 3 for an  unstructured, informal conference intended to pave the way for next year's arms  control summit.  </P> <P> The meeting, announced simultaneously on Tuesday by Bush at the White House and  Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Moscow, will be the first  between the two presidents since Bush took office last January.  </P> <P> It will offer the two leaders "a chance to put our feet up and talk," Bush  said.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze, while also saying the session will be relaxed, added that it  should "contribute to broadening the changes taking place in the  Soviet-American relationship."  </P> <P> Occurring at a time of dramatic ferment in the once-monolithic Soviet Bloc of  Eastern Europe, the shipboard sessions are likely to focus on the pressure for  economic and political reforms in the Soviet Union and Eastern and Central  Europe, as well as on the continuing turmoil in Central America and  Afghanistan, U.S. officials said.  </P> <P> However, with Bush and Gorbachev planning to meet in a formal summit conference  in late spring or early summer next year, the White House saw little chance  that arms control would be given a central role next month. Rather, by focusing  on other matters, the two leaders will free up the agenda for their next  meeting, which will deal with weapons reductions, particularly long-range  nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> The warships have not yet been chosen, nor has a decision been made on whether  they will be cruising in international waters or tied up in port for the  meetings.  </P> <P> Cracked one Pentagon official: "I'm trying to get the Love Boat into the  Mediterranean."  </P> <P> More likely, officials said, are two similar cruisers, stationed perhaps off  Naples, the home port of the U.S. 6th Fleet, or, one official said, near Spain.  Gorbachev is scheduled to be in Rome, making the first visit of a Soviet leader  to the Vatican, just before he meets Bush.  </P> <P> A high-visibility superpower conference offers unique political opportunities  for both Bush, who has been criticized for failing to respond to dramatic  changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and for Gorbachev, who has been  juggling to meet consumer demands while fending off critics of his twin reform  programs, glasnost and perestroika.  </P> <P> Bush can demonstrate a willingness to engage in superpower politics and can  encourage and assist the long-sought shifts in the Soviet Union. Gorbachev can  return home with a show of acceptance from the United States and, possibly, a  renewed commitment to arms control that could eventually help him divert  precious rubles from military to domestic spending.  </P> <P> "Any time you have a President (of the United States) meeting with a president  of the Soviet Union, as a catalyst to an arms control summit, it's a plus,"  said one Administration official. "The American people like to see it. There's  no downside to it.  </P> <P> "Any time there's dialogue, it puts people in a good frame of mind," the  official said. "There's a feel-good thing about it. This has a rolling effect.  It's not just a media event here or in the Soviet Union. It has an  international feel to it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Soviets Impatient  </P> <P> In Moscow, officials were growing impatient with the delays in resuming arms  control negotiations after Bush took office, said Stephen Cohen, director of  Russian studies and professor of politics at Princeton University. "They'd  begun to refer to the Administration as 'the long pause,' " he said.  </P> <P> A renewal of the superpower dialogue will allow Gorbachev to "prove once again  to his people that he can bring a recalcitrant American President to a  meeting," said Cohen.  </P> <P> Bush said: "Our talks will be informal in character, designed to allow us to  become better acquainted with one another and to deepen our respective  understanding of each other's views. Neither President Gorbachev nor I  anticipate that substantial decisions or agreements will emerge."  </P> <P> Bush played down the prospects for measurable progress, telling reporters at a  White House news conference: "There's not going to be an agenda or meeting  (that) could be seen to fail or succeed on whether we make agreements" on U.S.  aid for the struggling Soviet economy.  </P> <P> "That's not what this meeting is about. . . . There's nothing off the table,  nothing on it," he said.  </P> <P> What if Gorbachev springs a new arms control proposal on him?  </P> <P> "He's free to bring anything he wants," Bush said.  </P> <P> "The meeting is not being set up to achieve agreements. I would hope we'd see  eye to eye on certain things when we get through, and maybe more narrowly  define, more precisely define, what differences we have," Bush said. He added:  </P> <P> "We'll simply sit down, and I'll give (him) my views on the changes that are  taking place in Eastern Europe, and certainly I'm most interested in getting  his."  </P> <P> The President took pains to portray the meeting in less-than-dramatic terms,  insisting that it would not be a summit conference.  </P> <P> "I've got to make that point over and over again," he said. " 'Summits' take on  a definition, an expectation of grand design and grand agreements, and that's  not what this is."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Secret Talks  </P> <P> In late August, as initial, secret U.S.-Soviet discussions of a meeting were  under way, senior U.S. officials argued that barring an unforeseen  international agreement of some sort, the time was not right for Bush and  Gorbachev to meet. They said a conference without concrete results could be  read as a failure. But, they acknowledged, the failure of the two leaders to  meet over the course of an entire year would also bring risks.  </P> <P> At the same time, Bush has been anxious to establish a personal relationship  with Gorbachev, even though he and his aides said for months that they did not  want a meeting just for the sake of getting acquainted. He last met Gorbachev  on Dec. 7, 1988, when the Soviet leader visited New York to address the U.N.  General Assembly. Bush was then President-elect and Ronald Reagan was  President.  </P> <P> "I'll tell you what changed my mind -- it was consultation with our allies, the  rapidity of change in Eastern Europe, the emergence of democracies in this  hemisphere, and this concept that I just didn't want to, in this time of  dynamic change, miss something, something that I might get better firsthand  from Mr. Gorbachev," Bush said of the shift in his approach.  </P> <P> "I don't want to have two gigantic ships pass in the night because of failed  communication," he said.  </P> <P> According to senior Administration officials, the genesis of the meeting was in  the President's visit in July to Poland and Hungary, when officials there  encouraged him to meet Gorbachev and express his support for the reforms in  Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> On July 19, Bush penned a note to Gorbachev, proposing an informal meeting.  </P> <P> Gorbachev replied "immediately and enthusiastically . . . (that) this was a  good idea," Bush said. The formal Soviet response reached Washington in early  August, setting off an exchange of letters between the two leaders and  discussions by their senior aides of possible dates, places and informal agenda  items. A final agreement came in early October.  </P> <P> Several officials said it was Bush's idea that the leaders meet on ships in the  Mediterranean.  </P> <P> A non-summit-at-sea can be accomplished "without too much fanfare. . . .  There's a relatively few number of people," Bush said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> KEY ISSUES IN CURRENT U.S.-SOVIET RELATIONS  </P> <P>  President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will have a lot to talk  about when they meet in December. The 10 months since they last met have been  filled with "dynamic change" in Eastern Europe, Central America and the Soviet  Union itself, as Bush noted. Here are some of the likely topics:  </P> <P> Soviet Economy  </P> <P> What are Gorbachev's plans for coping with his nation's severe economic  problems? His ability to deal with increasing consumer demands and sagging  industrial production is seen as central to his political survival. But whether  Washington should help bail him out is a major policy debate.  </P> <P> Eastern Europe  </P> <P> Bush hopes to determine how much Gorbachev will be encouraging reform  throughout the region or whether he will swing toward those trying to put on  the brakes. Bush also is trying to clarify at what point active U.S. support  for democratic changes would produce a Soviet backlash. Washington has approved  aid to reform-minded Poland and Hungary but not to hard-line East Germany,  which is racked by nearly daily pro-democracy demonstrations.  </P> <P> Arms Control  </P> <P> Bush said there will be no detailed talks on this issue. But the leaders are  expected to review conventional forces and long-range missiles. Those issues  will be the focus of next year's formal superpower summit in Washington. The  Warsaw Pact, led by the Soviets, has made new proposals on verifying cuts in  conventional arms in Europe. Gorbachev last week offered to pull nuclear-armed  submarines from the Baltic Sea in a step toward a "nuclear-free" Europe; at  right are some of the affected nations.  </P> <P> Central America and Afghanistan  </P> <P> The United States has complained repeatedly about East Bloc arms shipments to  Nicaragua and the transfer of weapons from there to El Salvador's leftist  guerrillas. Moscow recently suspended military aid to Nicaragua and is trying  to become a peace broker in the region. In Afghanistan, the Soviets have been  protesting U.S. military aid for the Muslim rebels attempting to overthrow the  pro-Soviet government.  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES, Pictures, Bush text, A24, A25  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VOTES CAST COST MONEY  </P> <P> The voters of California on Nov. 6 will face one of the longest, most  complicated, and surely one of the most costly ballots ever. With 28  propositions and a potential cost of nearly $20 billion, restraint is urged.  </P> <P> The voter must use the same caution with his vote as he would with his personal  credit card. There will always be items that we think we want, but can't afford  and we must say "NO."  </P> <P> Before the June primary election, the state had a bonded indebtedness of $4.8  billion, with an additional $7.4 billion in bonds approved but not sold. In  June the voters approved every bond issue on the ballot for an additional $5  billion, bringing the total state debt to $17.2 billion.  </P> <P> How much debt can California afford? At what point will the state lose its  favorable credit rating? Perhaps we need an initiative to limit the number of  initiatives allowed on one ballot.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Taxpayers Assn. urges allvoters to think about the debt,  which is their debt, when they mark their ballot.  </P> <P> STEVE BARNARD, President, Ventura County Taxpayers Assn.  </P></p>

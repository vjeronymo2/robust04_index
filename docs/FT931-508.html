			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Secretaries are 'undervalued' THE JOBS of secretaries and their bosses could become indistinguishable, except in two important respects - pay and training, says the Industrial Society. A survey to be published by the society next month shows that secretaries in Britain are increasingly taking on supervision of other staff and carrying out research work. At the same time, bosses are increasingly doing their own typing and making coffee. The society said it was concerned that some organisations were 'playing a confidence trick' on secretaries by not providing them with training for their new responsibilities. Some companies were guilty of double standards by providing training only for managers. It said it was 'a logical next step, if companies expect more and more management tasks to be performed by secretaries, that they must accept that those secretaries are currently undervalued in pay terms'. More than half of the nearly 400 managers surveyed claimed that their companies were prepared to promote secretaries to managerial positions. The managers were asked which jobs they thought would take more of secretaries' time in future. The results included: setting up new systems (52 per cent of those surveyed); own project work (45 per cent); research (39 per cent); organising conferences, exhibitions and annual general meetings (26 per cent); dealing with personnel matters (25 per cent). The findings reinforce an Industrial Society survey carried out last month which revealed that up to one third of a manager's working week is spent on paperwork and that a declining number of bosses now have personal secretaries.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commentator asked how ``unsolicited'' orders should be specified in a dealer's records, and whether such orders should always be handled by the dealer ``as agent.'' Board rules do not require dealers to handle specific types of orders as either principal or agent. Rule G&hyph;8(a)(vi), however, specifies the recordkeeping requirements for the terms and conditions of an agency order, including the fact that it is an agency order. Similarly, rule G&hyph;15(a)(vii) requires the confirmation to state the agency role of a dealer in a transaction. Neither rule G&hyph;8 nor rule G&hyph;15 has provisions for documenting orders as ``unsolicited.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously noted, the Board believes that relatively few transactions in municipal securities actually are ``unsolicited.'' While documenting these relatively rare transactions as such on the confirmation and in the dealer's records may be prudent for the dealer's own protection, the Board is concerned that incorporating a requirement in the Board's rules might have the unintended and undesired effect of encouraging the classification of transactions as ``unsolicited,'' even when they are not ``unsolicited'' under Board rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Institutional Accounts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board received several comments concerning the proposed definition for institutional account contained in the proposed rule change and the more generally stated suitability standard for institutional accounts. No commentator argued that it was inappropriate to distinguish between institutional and non-institutional investors when obtaining customer account data and making suitability determinations. One commentator believed the proposed standard for institutional investors was appropriate and noted that the information relevant to a suitability determination for a specific institutional account is necessarily a matter of judgment for the dealer. One commentator, however, suggested the establishment of specific minimum requirements for institutional accounts and specifically suggested that dealers should document the customer's investment objectives (including credit quality and maturity standards) and ``other information'' used or considered reasonable or necessary by the dealer. Another commentator suggested including corporate resolutions, trading authorization, and yearly audited financial statements as required information for institutional customers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated by several commentators, it is often necessary or advisable to obtain specific kinds of information from an institutional investor. Rule G&hyph;8(a)(xi)(F) currently requires that the customer suitability information used to make a suitability determination be recorded in the customer account record. The proposed rule change to rule G&hyph;8 also makes this requirement clear. In addition, rule G&hyph;8(a)(xi) also requires other customer account information including, among other things, the customer's name and address, tax identification or social security number and with respect to discretionary accounts, the customer's written authorization. For various types of institutional accounts, it may be advisable for dealers to obtain certain additional data and documentation. Often this additional documentation may be necessary for the dealer's own protection ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , trading authorizations). Similarly, for certain institutional accounts, dealers may wish to obtain yearly audited financial statements where assurance is desired that the account is and remains an institutional account for the purpose of rule G&hyph;19. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the wide variety in the types of institutional accounts and the documentation that might be necessary to establish suitability or otherwise considered to be necessary and prudent by the dealer, the Board believes that dealers ultimately will have to employ a certain degree of judgment in determining what information and documentation should be obtained and recorded for specific institutional customers beyond that now required by rule G&hyph;8(a)(xi). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commentator noted that, in many instances, a suitability determination should be made on the basis of the investment objectives articulated by an institution for a specific transaction or a specific component of a large investment portfolio. In these cases, the overall investment objectives of the institution or portfolio may not be the deciding factor in determining suitability. The Board notes that this view is consistent with the current language of rule G&hyph;19 and the proposed rule change, which requires that a dealer have reasonable grounds for recommending a transaction ``based on the facts disclosed by such customer or otherwise known about such customer.'' Clearly, if specific portfolio or transaction objectives are given, the proposed rule change and current Board rules require that such information be used to make a suitability determination and be recorded pursuant to rule G&hyph;8(a)(xi)(F). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arkadiy Solovyev, secretary of the Council of </F> the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of the Russian  Federation (FITUR): "Who Is Continuing the Game of Privatization  Fool?"]    [Text] Privatization is one of the five most urgent  problems of the present stage of shock therapy and stands right  there in line--immediately following price liberalization,  nonpayment of wages, stoppage of enterprises, and unemployment.  A year or 18 months ago the working people hoped that the  redistribution of property would, first, make it possible to  obtain their due share of the socialist national pie and,  second, be a boost to the development of production and a  stimulus of a growth of production activity of both the owners  of the means of production and the wage workers. But the  practice of privatization under the leadership of the State  Property Committee took a different route. A special edict of  the president endowed the State Property Committee with the  super-authority of a second government cabinet. More precisely,  of the first, inasmuch as this decree itself took away, in fact,  from all other ministers, the prime minister included, both the  objects and levers of administration.    A series of subsequent presidential decrees and government  decisions farmed out the actual mechanism and procedure of  privatization wholly to super-officials of the State Property  Committee, who both in the center and locally became the  exponents of the fullness of power: giving away plants worth  many billions of rubles, appointing directors, dismissing  employees, selling fixed capital, and so forth. Not without  compensation for themselves, of course.    It was here that real competition commenced both between the  center and the local privatizers and within departments of the  state property service as to who would "formalize" privatization  facilities (that is, grant permits) more quickly and in greater  volume (within the framework of the forced privatization  program, one rate, in violation of the program, another,  considerably higher). For additional "privileges" for this  privatizing party or the other, special valuations. But we are  not talking about this, about those who were admitted to the  privatization pie (the government official and directors'  nomenklatura, the new bourgeoisie). But about those who were not  admitted to it, that is, all of us.    The popular notion that privatization Chubays-style has  created tens of millions of property owners is being foisted on  people. Even if we allow for the paltriness of the share of  property that may be obtained in the process of the formation of  stock companies by the able-bodied citizens of our country and  those unfit for work, I dare say that not only have they not  obtained anything, they have lost something even. And a  considerable amount at that.    Popular wisdom says that you cannot, it would seem, lose  what  you do not have. On this basis citizens of our country in the  socialist system truly not only did not have property, they were  unable to have such.    But in those illustrious times the state undertook on the  one  hand, in accordance with the socialist constitution, to provide  everyone with accommodations, work, pay, and so forth and, on  the other, distributed via centralized social consumption funds  all life's necessary social "benefits" assuring for everyone  (other than the nomenklatura) equal conditions of survival:  health care and health improvement, education and schooling, and  so forth.    The inevitability of the demolition of a system to which we  had become so accustomed was obvious to specialists from the  moment of the market reforms. It was merely a question of how  this would happen, with what economic and social losses and for  whom. The incompatibility of the socialist rules of "social  justice" with market conditions of management is graphically  confirmed by the entire experience of Western countries also.    Privatization was chosen as the workhorse implement for the  rapid and total destruction of both the economic basis of our  state--public property--and also its social base--general  wage-leveling and the social consumption funds. The first stage  of privatization was geared to this and achieved its purpose.    It may already be said clearly and definitely at the  completion of the first program of privatization who has  obtained what and who has lost. I would distinguish three  interested participants here: the state in the person of the  organs of administration and the bureaucratic nomenklatura, the  corps of directors as the economic nomenklatura, and all other  citizens.    Understandably, the corporate interest for government  bureaucrats amounted to ridding themselves of the onerous  concerns connected with administration of a rotting economy with  the maximum personal advantage.    For the corps of directors the interest amounted to changing  from wage (albeit executive) labor into full masters of  production. This was secured both by the appropriate privileges  and the support of the state.    The most numerous party to the privatization process was  distributed as follows:    --citizens unfit for work, who, aside from vouchers,  obtained  nothing (70-80 million retirees, handicapped children, and so  forth);    --able-bodied citizens employed at enterprises not subject  to  compulsory (forced) privatization (45-50 million persons):  persons in publicly funded institutions, the military-industrial  complex, the agro-industrial complex, the army, students, and so  forth may be attributed to the preceding group, in the main;    --employees of enterprises undergoing privatization (12-15  million persons).    It is understandable that the first and second could merely  sell their vouchers at a price nowhere near comparable either  with the nominal share of public property or, even less, with  that actually due to them, or invest them in roguish private  investment funds. As last year's results showed, none of the 650  private investment funds produced any substantial profit on its  shares. And if a comparison is made with the selling price of  the voucher and following indexation, there is evidence of the  direct losses of the shareholders even of the "honest" private  investment funds. The majority of private investment funds, on  the other hand, frankly cheated its clients either by  distributing dividends with their own stock or by simply making  off with the balance of the money.    Aside from all else, the voucherization of society performed  another, no less important, special assignment: It became an  additional most powerful tool of the inflationary barrage of the  end of 1992 and the start of 1993, which came crashing down on  our economy in a R1.5 billion money issue. Inadequately  controlled, what is more.    But... was privatization to the benefit at least of the  fortunate ones who work at a privatized enterprise and who thus  became its shareholders and full owners? Truly, the majority of  production enterprises were privatized (on the initiative of the  directors) according to the second version, and the work force  obtained, as people are attempting to explain to us, very many  "undeserved privileges."    In what are these privileges expressed? Is it not in the  fact  that the employee has obtained nominal title to part of the  spindle from the machine tool at which he works (whereas certain  directors obtained the real right to manage the activity of the  enterprise)?    I dare say that the "fortunate ones" acquired nothing other  than an extra yoke in an increase in the power of both the  directors and bureaucrats from the State Property Committee.    Now, with the easily attainable compact of the latter, even  the weakest guarantees of the labor rights of wage workers, to  whom wages may not be paid for months on end, with whom a  collective-bargaining agreement may not be signed, for whom  social services are not provided, and for whom there need be no  occupational safety, have disappeared. Finally, it is possible  simply, in the absence of control, and with impunity to take  away from the employee his job inasmuch as the manager of the  enterprise is the real boss.    New vistas of the privatization tyranny are being revealed  in  the activation of the second privatization program (post-voucher  stage), in the course of which the last curtains of social  interests and national goals--the stabilization of production  and a revival of the economy--are being lifted from the process  of the shareout of the remnants of national property.    It is perfectly obvious that not only those unfit for work  but also able-bodied citizens are no longer able even in  fictitious form to join in the property-shareout process  inasmuch as the continuing impoverishment of the populace and  the devaluation of manpower which has occurred in recent months  have conclusively undermined the possibility of employees with  earned income participating in the property shareout. I would  recall that one out of every 10 inhabitants of the country is,  in fact, going hungry, one out of every five is below the line  of the physiological subsistence level, and more than half are  unable to provide for the survival (simple reproduction) of  their families. Only 15-20 percent of citizens have wages above  the minimum consumer budget. Thus only 5-7 percent of them can  join in full in the process mapped out by the privatizers....    The view of the past and future of privatization that I have  expressed says, obviously, nothing that is fundamentally new.  The trade unions expressed their position and forecasts of the  social consequences of privatization back on the threshold of  voucherization. They have, unfortunately, exceeded the direst  expectations in terms of scale of the violation of the citizens'  labor rights, in terms of the exacerbation of social conflicts  in the soil of privatization, and in terms of the orgy of  corruption and malfeasance.</p>

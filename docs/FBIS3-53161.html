They briefed the brother president on  the results of the conference, which expressed the concerns of  the governorate's sons and their aspirations. The conference  also stressed the sons' eagerness to preserve unity, democracy,  and political pluralism, and called on the leadership to adhere  to responsible and serious dialogue in order to end the  political crisis that the country is passing through. This  crisis has damaged the people's national interests, led by  Yemeni unity, and inflicted various forms of economic, social,  and psychological suffering on each Yemeni citizen.    They also briefed the president on the aspirations and  demands of the governorate's sons for accomplishing many service  projects to raise the standard of living in the governorate's  areas.    The president addressed the representatives of the popular  gathering, which included their eminence the ulema as well as  businessmen, social figures, and representatives of political  organizations and parties, shaykhs, and youths. He profoundly  welcomed them, and highly praised the national sentiments shown  by the governorate's sons who expressed their national eagerness  to safeguard the Yemeni unity. He also blessed the results of  the expanded gathering of the sons of the al-Hudaydah  Governorate.    The president reviewed the aspects of the suffering that the  Yemeni citizens are passing through as a result of this crisis.  He regretted the negative results of this crisis, which were  reflected on the community's situation and citizens' life. He  said: These results also cracked the community and created an  atmosphere for the enemies of unity and democracy, so they may  express their grudge against this national achievement that was  realized on the glorious 22 May 1990. This achievement is a  source of pride for us in the Yemeni homeland and an  accomplishment for all Arab unionists and the masses of our Arab  and Islamic nation. It also showed us on the international  level as giants. However, the enemies of unity and democracy  have pooled their resources and efforts to undermine our unity  and fragment the one Yemeni family.    The brother president added: We are pleased with meeting  with the brother sons of the al-Hudaydah governorate, whether  ulema, merchants, social figures, or representatives of  political organizations and parties, whose initiative embodied  their care for national accord. Together, and hand in hand, we  will do our best to safeguard unity and democracy, our rescue  ship in a violent storm.    Salih said: Unity is based on firm pillars, and we must  not abandon these pillars. We have tolerated a great deal for  the sake of unity in order to rob those who want to exacerbate  differences the opportunity of doing so. In order to lead our  country away from internecine struggles, we made many  concessions in order to preserve unity out of goodwill and out  of our sense of national responsibility and so that our people  will not face unnecessary difficulties. However, regrettably,  some today are trying to foment troubles in society and harden  the people's life by escalating this crisis, whose causes and  origin are known to our people and which led to the  deterioration of our economic conditions and reflected on the  general situation in the country.    He said: On 22 May 1990, we announced that all the files of  the past were closed, and we decided to open a new page in the  march of national construction so that all energies would be  mobilized to building the new Yemen. However, some are still  tied to the past and are thinking in the same old way. They  have not gotten rid of this wrong view of things and have  endeavored to foment struggles in society under many names,  using sugar-coated words.    Salih noted that some of the practices have harmed unity,  such as instigating parochialism, sectarianism, and narrow  affiliations. He said: We always ask our people to owe  allegiance to God, the homeland, the revolution, and unity and  to unite in facing the sectarian hatreds that harm our national  unity. He said: Enough tampering with the national economy,  enough corruption, enough irresponsibility that leads to social  anarchy like the situation of 9 and 10 December 1992. This is  unacceptable, and we will not tolerate it. We will fight all  kinds of economic, security, and all other kinds of sabotage.  The security authorities have been given instructions not to  tolerate or be lenient with any saboteurs who practice violence,  sabotage, and anarchy, threatening safety and stability in our  society.    The brother chairman reviewed many developments in our  society and noted that unity was realized on the basis of  dialogue and equality, without a victor or vanquished and was  not an annexation. We are all sons of the same people with equal  rights and duties.    Salih said: We believed in democracy and held elections,  letting the ballot boxes be our arbiters. We must accept the  results. It is in the nature of democracy and pluralism that  some parties emerge victorious and others defeated. However,  some do not accept democracy and work against it if it does not  work in his interests. He said: We reject all forms of  violence, are against political and mental terror, and oppose  all kinds of sabotage. We support dialogue and respect free  opinion and the opinion of others, and we will extend our hand  to all those in favor of union in order to build new Yemen, a  democratic, united, secure, and peaceful Yemen.    The meeting was attended by a number of officials  accompanying the bother chairman.</p>

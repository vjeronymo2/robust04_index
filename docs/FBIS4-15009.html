			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pavel Anokhin: "President Begins Series of </F> Meetings With Representatives of Parliamentary Factions"]    [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin had a meeting 4  April, at his initiative, with a delegation from the "Russia's  Choice" parliamentary faction headed by Yegor Gaydar. The  conversation touched on the consolidation of democratic forces,  the threat of fascism, and the task of improving the legislative  base for the continuation of reforms. The writer Alla Gerber,  who took part in the meeting, shared her impressions of the  exchange of opinions, in an interview with ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's  correspondent. She said that the Russian president gives the  impression of being a perfectly healthy and calm person who  responds sensitively to his interlocutor and knows how to listen  and to hear.    "Boris Nikolayevich came out against the creation of any  kind  of presidential party," Alla Gerber stressed, "but promised to  support the democrats and the party of which `Russia's Choice'  is the initiator...."    In the opinion of the writer and deputy, in the regions  there  is great interest in Gaydar's emerging party, but people have  certain misgivings about victorious communists being in power.  Developing the topic under discussion, the "Russia's Choice"  representatives advised Boris Yeltsin to address the Russians  more often, to participate in democratic actions more actively,  and to define more clearly and precisely both his own positions  and those of his entourage. "The unclear, unspecific nature of  certain pronouncements and actions by the presidential team is  confusing people's perception of Boris Yeltsin's intentions and  his allies," Alla Gerber said.    The problem of legal backup for further Russian reforms was  touched on. The cornerstone of this, in the general opinion,  should be the urgent adoption of laws on joint-stock companies,  securities, and stock exchanges. It goes without saying that  the "Russia's Choice" delegation proposed tougher legal norms  regarding the kindling of interethnic hostility and fascist  propaganda. The delegation called on the president to take the  threat of fascism in Russia seriously and to act openly and  resolutely in this regard. Boris Yeltsin expressed approval for  the "Russia's Choice" initiative on holding parliamentary  hearings in the near future on the danger of fascism in Russia.    It was the mutual opinion that the discussion took place in  a  calm and constructive atmosphere and demonstrated yet again that  one old friend is better than two new ones. The president  promised the legislators that he would hold similar meetings  with deputies from the other parliamentary factions in the State  Duma.    Whether the meeting will be the starting gun for a new  rallying of democrats, time will tell. But one thing is clear  today: Rumors that Boris Yeltsin has lost the political  initiative were patently exaggerated. And suggestions that he  intends to run in the next presidential elections once again as  leader of all democrats are apparently not without foundation.</p>

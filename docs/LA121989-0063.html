			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL TO ALLOW MIA KIN TO CONTACT PLO  </P> <P> Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Monday that he has waived Israeli law and  allowed the families of missing Israeli soldiers to visit PLO officials in  Tunis in order to locate the servicemen.  </P> <P> "I authorized the families to meet with the PLO, even for someone from the  families to travel to (PLO headquarters in) Tunisia, because I thought that in  this matter there are no conditions," Rabin told the Labor Party student  faction at Tel Aviv University.  </P> <P> Under Israeli law, contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization are  illegal.  </P> <P> The defense minister said the military is doing everything possible to locate  and obtain the release of missing soldiers.  </P> <P> "In order to receive information for the families it is allowed to meet without  any conditions or limits whatsoever, also at our expense," he said.  </P> <P> Six Israeli soldiers are listed as missing and one captured. On Sunday, an army  spokesman said that captured air force navigator Ron Arad is being held by Iran  or pro-Iranian militias in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Rabin's revelation comes amid increasing reports that Israeli officials have  had indirect contacts with the PLO and that the government has chosen to  overlook political meetings between Palestinians from the occupied territories  and PLO officials.  </P> <P> Also Monday, military officials confirmed that Jewish settlers in the Gaza  Strip have vandalized homes being built by Palestinians from Egypt. Under the  Camp David agreement, several thousand Palestinians from a refugee camp in  Egypt will be allowed to move to the town of Rafah in the Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, which is intended to reunite families, the Palestinians  are allowed to build homes in Rafah before moving there.  </P> <P> Jewish settlers in Gaza have vowed that they will not cease their activities  until the transfer of Palestinians from Egypt is stopped. The Gaza Settlers  Committee announced that settlers have damaged the walls and foundations of two  houses under construction.  </P> <P> Palestinians angered by the settlers' actions clashed with Israeli soldiers in  Rafah, and at least nine Palestinians were shot and wounded in the violence,  Palestinian sources said.  </P> <P> In both the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, residents observed a  general strike.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, for the first time in the two-year-old Palestinian uprising, police  have charged journalists with entering an area declared closed by the military,  police said.  </P> <P> The charges were brought against three Israeli reporters -- Joel Greenberg of  the English-language Jerusalem Post, Ori Nir of Haaretz and Oren Cohen of  Hadashot.  </P> <P> Shaul Naim, police prosecutor, said the three will not be jailed during legal  proceedings but could be sentenced to up to two years in prison if convicted of  the charges. He said he is uncertain when the trial will be held.  </P> <P> During the uprising, soldiers have regularly blocked reporters from entering  troubled towns or villages by declaring them closed military areas. While  reporters have been detained several times for entering such areas, no charges  had been brought.  </P></p>

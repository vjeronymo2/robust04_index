			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Banja Luka, June 22 (TANJUG)--The Moslem offensive  in the area of Vozuca on the northern Bosnian Mount Ozren has  been stopped, Bosnian Serb Army sources said Wednesday. They  added that the Moslem side had suffered major losses.    As the Moslem side is using in the attacks ordinary and  chlorine- charged artillery shells, around 5,000 women, children  and old people have been evacuated from the Vozuca area, the  army said in a statement.    Denying radio reports by the local Moslem Second Army Corps  that Serbs are fleeing in disarray, the Serb Army said that more  than one hundred Moslems had been killed in the fighting around  Vozuca and that the village and Mt. Ozren were still under their  control.    Violating the Geneva ceasefire agreement, which came into  effect on June 10, the Moslems continued to attack Serb  settlements and positions in other fronts in the former Yugoslav  Republic of Bosnia- Herzegovina.    Serb units hold firmly all their defence positions and  return  fire only when their troops come under heavy offensive attacks,  the Serb Army statement said.    A strong Moslem artillery and infantry attack on Serb  territory in the area of Komar and Mracaj in central Bosnia was  repulsed on Tuesday. Its objective was to break through Serb  defence lines towards Kupres in the south-west  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Moslems are violating the ceasefire agreement also in the  area of Sarajevo, where their snipers open intensive fire on  Serb parts of the city.    Moslem forces also continued to open fire on Serb positions  and settlements in the area of Bihac and Krupa na Uni (formerly  Bosanska Krupa) in western Bosnia, and in the areas of Vlasic,  Olovo and Srbobran (formerly Donji Vakuf) in the central part of  the republic, as well as in the region of Gorazde in eastern  Bosnia and the areas of Gradacac, Trebava and Doboj in the north.    Doboj and Teslic came under the heaviest attacks when Moslem  forces opened artillery fire in early morning hours. Five  civilians, including two children, were wounded in the shelling  of Doboj, while two persons were wounded in Teslic. Heavy  damage was caused to both towns.    Joint forces of the Bosnian Croats and the regular army of  neighbouring Croatia continued attacking the area of Orasje in  northern Bosnia and resumed attacks in the area of Popovo Polje  in the south-west of Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

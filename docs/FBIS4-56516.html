			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lidia Reboucas in Sao Paulo] </F>   [Text] Military research was one of the most controversial  topics discussed at the International Seminar on the Evaluation  of and Proposals for Scientific and Technological Development in  Brazil, which was held in Sao Paulo. The seminar focused on new  courses for scientific and technological development in Brazil.    Controversies erupted over maintaining a model inherited  from  the military period (which envisaged the creation of a large  military power through a scientific and technological effort  undertaken by the Armed Forces) and over discontinuing  military-oriented projects.    Among the ongoing military projects that are worth  mentioning  are the AMX aircraft, the Brazilian Space Mission project (which  totals $1.1 billion), and a nuclear-powered submarine project  ($900 million).    Geraldo Lesbat Cagnari Filho, director of the Group of  Strategic Studies at Campinas State University [Unicamp], said:  "These projects will provide the Brazilian military industry  with great technological capability, and it will thus gain  international standing."    This opinion is not, however, shared by some researchers,  who  find it necessary to make a comprehensive review of the benefits  yielded by these military projects.    One who advocates this idea is Renato Peixoto Dagnino, of  the  technological department at the Unicamp Geoscience Institute,  who believes that "the only benefits these projects will yield  are academic ones, and not technological nor military."    The search for new sources of financing that are not closely  linked to the government, and cooperation between the private  sector and Brazilian universities in undertaking joint  scientific and technological research, were also among the main  topics discussed at the seminar.    Helio Barros, planning secretary at the Science and  Technology Ministry, said: "The Brazilian Government is not  planning to increase funds allocated for science and technology,  which this year will stand at $900 million."    He added that this is happening because "the country's  budget  system does not envisage specific investments in this area, and  thus the budgeted funds are not earmarked for any specific  project." In the past two years only 40 percent of the approved  budget has been disbursed.</p>

He went to Brussels on 9 January to attend the  NATO summit meeting, and thus began his first scheduled trip to  Europe. The climax of Clinton's European trip will be his  meeting with Yeltsin between 12 and 15 January. This will be  Clinton's first visit to Russia after taking office and is aimed  at enhancing the prestige of the Russian president.    The year 1993 was the first year of the Clinton  administration. With the end of the "Cold War," the military  threat of the former Soviet Union against the United States also  came to an end. The global strategy of confrontation with the  Soviet Union pursued by all post-war U.S. administrations lost  its significance. The long arms race placed the U.S. economy  in a predicament. The unemployment rate has stayed at a high  level for three consecutive years and social problems have piled  up. From the very beginning, the Clinton administration took  the reinvigoration of the U.S. economy as its overwhelming task  and is determined to adjust the country's foreign policy.    In recent years, changes have also occurred in Europe's  strategic position. With the disappearance of a common enemy of  the United States and Europe, contradictions between the United  States and Europe have gradually increased. In the economic  field, with the formation of a large, unified market in Europe,  conflicts of interest between the two sides of the Atlantic  Ocean became more prominent. At the same time, a relatively  stable situation and high-speed economic growth existed in Asia.  The broad market and huge potential of Asia are very attractive  to the Clinton administration, which is striving to revitalize  the U.S. economy. Therefore, after taking office in the White  House, different from his predecessors, the destination of  Clinton's first foreign visit was East Asia.    However, the end of the Cold War did not mean that Europe  would have no worries and would enjoy lasting peace. Nuclear  forces in such former republics of the Soviet Union as Russia  and Ukraine continue to plague the Western countries. In  particular, Ukraine still refuses to implement the START 1  Treaty. In order to guarantee their own security, some former  members of the Warsaw Pact have applied to join NATO, but the  United States and other NATO countries hold different opinions  on this issue. In the former Yugoslavia, civil war continues,  and this has deeply upset other countries in the Balkan  region.... When facing new problems on the other side of the  Atlantic Ocean, the United States cannot be indifferent.    The Clinton administration has grounds for slowing its shift  to Asia. According to some analysts, although the war machine  of the former Soviet Union has collapsed, financial and  political problems in Russia and the security of the newly  established democracies in Eastern Europe has forced Clinton to  reassess Europe's importance for the United States. Jiatehuofu  [0502 3676 7202 1133], a foreign policy expert at the Hopkins  Society in Washington, said: "The world's future lies in Asia,  and we certainly will not give it up. However, Europe is now in  trouble, and more and more people feel that NATO should be  strengthened and take on new tasks."    At the beginning of 1994, Clinton's first visit shows that  Europe has become the focus of his attention, and this also  indicates that the U.S. Government is making a new adjustment  to its foreign policy. However, people still need to wait and  see in order to know how much attraction Clinton will find when  he turns to look at Europe again. It seems that the European  countries are not pinning too much hope on the United States'  "return" to Europe. Johnson, a British MP, recently said in a  report to the West European Union: "Europe should embark on  preparations for a future scenario where, once the United States  bears no commitment to Europe, it should be able to safeguard  its strategic interests independently."</p>

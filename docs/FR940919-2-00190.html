			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Not knowing how to use the Internet will be as grave a deficiency as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not knowing how to read. The Internet will become the world's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primary means of communication and will soon carry more mail than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the entire postal service worldwide. <FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 45 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Mark Gibbs,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Internet ABCs Essential, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Investor's Business Daily, Apr. 14, 1994, at 4. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If universal service is defined in terms of a network connection, should that connection provide access to the Internet?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 32. Another important area of inquiry is the extent to which universal service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy should address customer premises equipment (CPE). Without adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment on the customer's premises, network connection and the many services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it affords is meaningless. CPE capable of providing access to advanced services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be expensive at market prices, however, and thus could serve as a barrier to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the availability of advanced services. For the same reason, however, subsidizing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CPE as part of universal service could be expensive, possibly prohibitively so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Including CPE in the definition of universal service could also reverse the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government's existing regulatory approach toward CPE, which is now deregulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and subject only to market forces. <FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>  Local exchange carriers may provide CPE in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conjunction with local telephone service, subject to certain safeguards. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, at present, computer manufacturers, set-top box manufacturers, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> television manufacturers are competing to develop the product or products that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be used for receiving advanced services. It is thus not clear which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment the government should specify, if any, and on what basis it should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choose. Moreover, government selection of a certain type of CPE for inclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the universal service definition carries with it the risk of government picking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> winners and losers, a questionable strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 46 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Although CPE was detariffed and generally deregulated in the early 1980s, the FCC still requires registration of this equipment to ensure that its connection does not cause harm to the public switched network.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  47 CFR part 68 (1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 33. We seek comment on whether CPE should be included in the new definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of universal service, and, if so, whether a category of providers should be obligated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to supply it. Should the Government identify specific equipment or merely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capabilities if it is included in the definition? What other alternative approaches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be adopted, e.g., such as a voucher system, which would assure that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers could purchase the type of CPE they desire from the provider of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choice without government specification?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

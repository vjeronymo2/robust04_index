France recently sent troops to its former colony Cameroon,  which is at odds with Nigeria over their border in the oil-rich  Bakassi Peninsula. Last week it also sent a warship to the  Cameroonian port of Douala.    "There is no way you can say you want to ease tension with  all this show of might," the GUARDIAN quoted a Nigerian official  as saying, renewing Friday's accusations that Paris was  escalating the dispute with Cameroon. The manoeuvres and an  "increasing French military presence" were seen as "part of  gun-boat diplomacy by Paris to intimidate Nigeria," the paper  wrote.    But French diplomats in Lagos said the French-Benin  manoeuvres starting Monday had been planned for a year, "long  before conflict broke out on the other border, and all countries  in the region had been given notice." "The defence attache of  the Nigerian embassy in Benin, and two Nigerian military  observers, are taking part in the manoeuvres," the diplomats  said.    Officials in Paris said the arrival of the ship, due to be  replaced by a smaller vessel from the French Navy on Monday, was  part of "routine" movements which had nothing to do with the  Cameroonian border conflict.    In an effort to dispel Nigerian suspicions, Paris has also  insisted that only about 15 "technical military assistants" were  sent to Cameroon at its own request, and that France wanted to  see a peaceful resolution of the conflict.

Officers sent to settle conflict situation are to be  accompanied by armed guards. Armed units on duty will protect  military objects which do not have permanent guards. In order  to avoid misunderstanding commanders of military units are to  notify local authorities and residents about these measures.    The order was issued in connection with the incident, which  took place in Latvia Monday, when four military objects were  blockaded and two generals were arrested and delivered in  manacles to the state border.    These actions "cast doubt on promises of Latvia about its  intention to solve all the problems of Russian troops in Latvia  in a civilized way, the ability of the Latvian state to control  activities of local troops under their command",</p>

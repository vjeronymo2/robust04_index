			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> To set a numerical emission limit for tank truck loading operations, the total HAP emissions would have to be measurable, so that a comparison with this emission limit could be made. Since the small portion of the displaced vapors which may leak from the tank trucks cannot be quantitatively measured, accurate measurements of total HAP emissions from tank truck loading are not possible. However, the major portion of the displaced vapors can be measured after the vapors are collected at the loading rack. Vapor collection systems typically include the equipment at the loading rack used to contain and route emissions, and generally consist of hoses or arms, manifolding, piping, and check valves. This type of system is consistent with the current state-of-the-art collection systems in use at many existing bulk gasoline terminals. Because of its demonstrated control effectiveness, and because it is not possible to set a standard of performance for the total emissions from the loading operation, an equipment standard requiring a vapor collection system at each loading rack was selected by the Administrator as the format for controlling HAP emissions at the loading racks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since emissions from the vapor collection system can be measured, standards of performance in the form of a numerical emission limit can be applied to emissions from the vapor collection system. Several formats for these standards of performance are possible. Three formats considered for limiting emissions from the vapor collection system include a concentration standard, a control efficiency standard, and a mass emissions standard. A vapor processing system would be necessary under any of these formats to achieve the required emission limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A format expressed in terms of concentration would limit the HAP concentration in the exhaust from the vapor processing system. However, test data from these systems indicate a variation in exhaust gas flow rates and concentrations among the various types of systems. Separate concentration limits might be required for each type of control system at each affected terminal if a concentration format were selected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information from the manufacturers and test results indicate that the control efficiencies of the processing systems are dependent on the inlet concentration to the processor. The data further indicate that concentrations at the inlet of the processor vary considerably from terminal to terminal. It would be difficult to adjust the calculations to account for these variations. Also, control efficiency testing would require two separate measurements of pollutant concentration instead of just one measurement as required in the concentration or mass approaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A mass standard based upon the vapor processor outlet emissions would involve a simpler, less expensive, and more straightforward test procedure. This testing would require measurement of mass emissions at the processor outlet only. In addition, the affected industry has over 15 years experience in conducting this type of testing at bulk gasoline terminals and, in fact, this is the type of test data analyzed to determine the MACT control levels for the facilities to be regulated in this source category. Due to these considerations, a mass emission format, based on measurements at the outlet of the vapor processor only, was selected for the standard to be applied to bulk terminal tank truck and railcar loading emissions. This mass emission format is the same type analyzed to determine the MACT control levels for vapor processors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The test methods that have proved to be acceptable for measuring pollutant emissions from bulk terminal control systems measure the total organic compounds content of the exhaust stream. To analyze the stream specifically for HAP content, more complex testing would have to be carried out. The emission reduction processes utilized in vapor processing systems have been found to reduce HAP's in proportion to the reduction of total organics. Therefore, the emission limit for loading rack vapor collection systems is expressed in terms of mass (milligrams) of total organic compounds emitted per volume (liter) of gasoline loaded into tank trucks and railcars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even at loading racks controlled through installation of vapor collection and processing systems, gasoline vapor emissions may occur from the loading operation due to vapor leakage from closed gasoline tank trucks or railcars during loading. These leakage emissions originate from pressure-vacuum vents and defective hatch covers and seals. Due to the fugitive nature of these emissions, it is not feasible to collect the escaping vapors and route them through a conveyance. Since cargo tank leakage measurements at the loading racks do not provide a quantitative measurement of total organic concentration, flow rate, or mass emissions, an enclosure around a loading tank truck or railcar would be necessary in to trap emissions for measurement. An enclosure or conveyance to accomplish this is not technologically or economically practicable. Due to these considerations, the Administrator determined that a standard of performance, in the form of a numerical emission limit, could not be set, and that a work practice standard would be appropriate for controlling cargo tank vapor leakage emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISCOVERY: ELVA MAY SCHOOL OF FLORAL DESIGN  </P> <P> Ada Kelly, a student at the Elva May School of Floral Design, stepped back from  the work table and admired her latest creation. "All I've ever done before this  was go out and pick a rose," she says.  </P> <P> Kelly, a retired laboratory technician, plans to work part time in a flower  shop after finishing a four-week basic course. The soft lilac and pink-toned  arrangement was the third she'd made since enrolling in the small, family-run  school in Fullerton.  </P> <P> Nearby, John McElrath, a former military aircraft mechanic, was busy putting  the final touches on his arrangement. "After fixing planes for 16 years, I felt  like I was in a rut," he says. "I wanted something more individual and  creative."  </P> <P> He decided to team up with his sister, who ran a flower shop in Garden Grove.  As the new co-owner, he handled deliveries and purchasing. But after he tried  his hand at floral design, he liked it so much he decided to get professional  training. "It's relaxing," he explains. "And I can see the whole thing through  from start to finish."  </P> <P> The school was founded in 1947 by Elva May Devlin, a Fullerton florist who also  founded the American Institute of Floral Designers, a nationwide professional  organization. The school's present owner, Randall Stark, purchased it from  Devlin 12 years ago and retained the original name.  </P> <P> Although no official certification is needed to work as a florist, it is  difficult for those with no experience to find  </P> <P> entry-level jobs, according to Stark. "There are only about 20 other schools  like this in the U.S.," he says. It is the only floral design school in  California certified  </P> <P> by the state Board of Education.  </P> <P> In addition to the elements of design, the school's curriculum includes proper  buying, marketing and handling techniques. "We try to teach students  cost-control concepts right from the start," says director Steve Stark, owner  Randall's son. "Even though it's creative work, it's still a business. We try  to point out the common pitfalls."  </P> <P> Students are taught traditional approaches as well as more exotic European and  Asian concepts. Courses are taught in topical segments and include instruction  in wedding, party and sympathy designs.  </P> <P> Telephone: 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday through Friday  </P> <P> Address: 410 W. Amerige Ave.  </P> <P> Telephone: (714) 525-8464  </P> <P> Enrollment: Tuition for the basic, four-week course is $1,250, plus a $50  registration fee. Experienced florists may enroll in segments of the basic  course and attend special workshops held throughout the year.  </P></p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Hungary takes the lead on foreign investment / A look at who is really getting down to business after the post-communist euphoria FOREIGN investment in eastern Europe is beginning cautiously to take off after a false start during the brief post-communist euphoria. It has gone farthest in Hungary, traditional testbed for the region's economic experiments, where liberal foreign investment laws appeared first more than two years ago. Central Budapest has lost some of the bustle of a year ago, when the flurry of visiting western businessmen gave the impression of a town in the middle of a gold rush. The Forum Hotel is no longer booked for months ahead and consultants complain less of 'corporate tourists' besieging them. But, shorn of the early grandiose hopes and the disappointment which dashed them, investment in Hungary has quietly become substantial. Half of all foreign investment in east Europe (excluding Germany) went to Hungary in 1990, says Mr Bela Kadar, minister of international economic relations. True, that reflects how little has flowed to the rest of the region as much as it does Hungary's own success. Foreign direct investment in the country last year amounted to something between Dollars 750m and Dollars 1bn - either figure is but a fraction of that enjoyed by the south European or south-east Asian countries which compete with east Europe for investment. Accumulated investment is also only 3.5 - 4 per cent of the Hungarian company sector, so there is a long way to go to reach the government's 25 per cent medium-term target. Nevertheless, it is early yet and the trend is sharply upwards. Companies' financial reports showed Ft93.2bn (Dollars 1.53bn) of accumulated foreign investment at the end of 1990, compared with Ft29.3bn a year earlier. Officials expect another Dollars 1bn this year. In newspapers and sugar-refining, foreign ownership has penetrated deep. Foreign media companies now have dominant stakes in all Hungary's main national daily newspapers. Even more dramatically, the number of joint ventures registered jumped from 900 at the end of 1989 to about 7,500 at the end of March, according to Central Statistical Office estimates. In addition, there are another 1,200 companies with foreign stakes. Officials and economists caution that many Hungarian businesses have set up joint ventures simply to avoid tax or customs. A better - albeit indirect - indication of a surge in interest is the breakneck pace of expansion of western accountancy and law firms in the past 18 months. Even so, consultants are finding it difficult to keep up with a quickening rhythm of large acquisitions and new investments. The conclusions of deals worth more than Dollars 40m are running at more than one a month so far this year. Moreover, many more transactions are in the offing as Hungary's flagship First Privatisation Programme begins to take off. Investors are attracted particularly to Hungary because of the official welcome it gives to foreign capital. Western lawyers praise the foreign investment and company acts for their western quality. Officials boast that the country has the most liberal investment regime in the world, citing the right to set up in the service sector, acquire majority control without special permission and fully repatriate profits. The company law mimics the German. Better, the laws have improved with use in the two years they have been in effect. So much for the principle. The practice has been frustrating, which makes the growth in foreign investment all the more impressive. The first problem, especially for deals involving real estate, is to find someone with the authority to sell a property. Central and local authorities and current occupiers and former owners make rival claims. A recent act compensating the last group should help but it leaves questions unanswered. Nor is approval from the State Property Agency, the central privatisation authority, easily obtained. It sometimes treats well-known international companies 'shabbily', says one senior consultant. The agency promises a decision on whether to give the go-ahead to a serious proposal and then delays it, again and again, without explanation. Negotiations themselves are an endurance test. Foreign buyers, state company managers, SPA officials, the enterprise council representing the workforce, and various accountants, valuators and legal counsels - all participate. Turnout at these unwieldy meetings in smoke-filled rooms can easily reach 25 and the whole group goes through agreements word by word, says Mr Theodore Boone, a lawyer at Baker &amp; McKenzie. 'Hungarian managers are willing to bring up issues again which everybody thought the book had been closed on.' Price can be a particular stumbling block because valuations vary wildly. 'A company's past record is meaningless and everything around it is in flux,' says Mr Istvan Denes, managing director of the First Hungary Fund, an investment fund. That can lead to big gaps between negotiating positions. Even once the negotiations are over, the formalities of setting up a new joint venture can hold things up. One of the tightest bottle-necks is the company registration court whose 15 overworked judges can take three months to handle an application. Patience has been one of a potential investor's most valuable qualities. One investment fund which has made it a particular virtue is John Govett's Hungarian Investment Company. 'HIC avoided the mistakes others did by diligence and investing a lot of time,' says Mr Adam Batthany, a prime ministerial adviser who doubles as a board member. Patience is also needed more generally. It takes time to implement essential laws and rules; even longer for them to be worn in and for business culture to change. Hungary is at least showing that the delay, while frustrating, is not fatal for investment in east Europe. Investment is taking off, and, says Mr Denes: 'It's getting easier by the day to get things done.'</p>

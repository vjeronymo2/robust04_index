Particularly, Korean  manufacturers of electronic appliances and autos are hurrying to  set up locally incorporated plants in the region to meet the  strengthened regulations for country of origin clause in the  free trade agreement. The implementation of NAFTA is expected  to affect Korean exports of electronic goods, autos and fabrics  as the regulations for country of origin under the agreement  have been toughened, business officials said.    For example, the new country of origin rules require  exporters of color TV sets to the region to use locally produced  color picture tubes (CPTs) for 14-inch or bigger sets if they  want to enjoy tariff exemption.    In addition, the agreement demands that exporters of  passenger cars, light trucks, engines and transmissions increase  their use of locally produced parts from the present 50 percent  to 62.5 percent by 2002 to gain tariff exemption.    Accordingly, trade officials here have urged Korean  companies  to establish locally incorporated production factories in the  NAFTA region as soon as possible to stave off these  "protectionist" measures.    Goldstar Co., one of the leading electronics manufacturers  in  the nation, will expand the annual production capability of its  Mexican plant, GSMX, from the current 700,000 color TV sets to 1  million by investing $10 million, a company official said. To  meet the country of origin regulations of the NAFTA countries,  the electronics arm of the Lucky-Goldstar Business Group is  groping for ways to enter the region along with two electronic  parts makers, he said.    In a bid to expand its sales of electronic goods in the U.S.  market, Goldstar has been restructuring its locally incorporated  sales company, Goldstar Electronics International Inc., since  1991, the official said.    "Through the revamped sales network, we expect our exports  to  the big U.S. market to rise continually. After-sale services on  Goldstar-made products also will be strengthened across the  United States," he said.    The company also is planning to set up a $100-million  joint-venture factory to churn out TV cathode-ray tubes in  Mexico with Samsung Electron Devices Co. and Orion Electronics  Co., business sources said. TV cathode-ray tubes to be produced  by the proposed Mexican plant could be used in color TVs  produced by Samsung Electronics Co., Goldstar Co. and Daewoo  Electronics Co., all of which hope to expand their market share  in the United States, they said.    Samsung Electronics Co., the electronics arm of the Samsung  Business Group, is expanding the annual production capability of  its Mexican plant, SAMEX, from the current 1 million color TV  sets to 1.2 million, a company spokesman said. To satisfy the  local regulations for country of origin, the company has helped  its Korean parts makers set up their own plants in Mexico, and  the partners are now supplying SAMEX with main TV parts, he said.    Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co. is studying a plan to  establish  a wholly owned plant to produce TV tuners and speakers in  Tihuanisi, Mexico, which is close to the border with the United  States, at a cost of $40 million, a company official said.    Korean automakers have been reluctant to set up locally  incorporated plants in North America as the tariffs which the  United States levies on imported autos are still low, business  officials said. Recently, however, large Korean automakers  including Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo have begun considering  establishing production plants in the North American region now  that NAFTA has taken effect, they said.    According to the officials, such proposed, locally  incorporated auto plants will also help the automakers expand  their exports to South American nations, which are growing  rapidly following radical economic reforms.    Particularly, Hyundai Motor Co., the auto arm of the Hyundai  Group, has already begun expanding its Canadian plant so that it  can churn out 100,000 subcompact car Elantras annually from  1995, a company official said.</p>

This experiment, which  has been strongly criticized by environmentalists, involved  turning off the cooling water supply to a small portion of the  Phebus research reactor, thus for the first time simulating a  "maximum credible accident" (MCA) in a nuclear power station.  The fuel in the 80- cemtimeter long and 12-cm thick tube was  heated to the point where it began to melt. The scientists  compared their experiment with the accident in which the Three  Mile Island nuclear power station in Harrisburg narrowly escaped  a catastrophe in 1979.    This time, however, the faulty portion was 5,000 times  smaller than in a conventional power station, and the  surrounding reactor continued operating quite normally. The  researchers at the French Institute of Nuclear Safety and  Protection (ISPN), who had overall responsibility for the  planning of this international project, are convinced that they  would have been able to stop the experiment at any time in an  emergency. However, German engineer Peter von der Hardt, the  European Union's representative in Cadarache, maintains that  safety precautions were so strict that no radioactive material  could have escaped in any circumstances.    The Phebus experiment began on schedule shortly after 1000  on  Thursday morning with the preheating of the reactor. The whole  procedure was transmitted live to the nearby press center, where  scientists gave a commentary. A screen showed how the  surroundings of a core immersed in a water tank began to glow  blue -- the sign of radioactive radiation being generated in the  reactor. While the major portion remained at the normal  operating temperature of several hundred degrees Celsius, the  lack of cooling in the actual inner test core ensured that its  temperature continued to rise slowly. After one hour and a  half, at 800 degrees Celsius, the fuel rods began to crack  inside. Another two hours later, the housing was so hot that it  reacted chemically with its surroundings, with the result that  the temperature of the test object rose sharply from 1,400 to  2,200 degrees in the space of a few minutes. A measuring tube  inside it burst, and the gas collection tank radioactivity meter  registered the first fission products, thus ringing in the hot  phase. In the subsequent hour, the temperature approached the  fuel melting point. At 1500, sufficient molten fuel had  accumulated, and the experiment was brought to an end. Von der  Hardt confirmed, however, that it was not yet known for sure  whether the results of the MCA experiment were applicable to  existing nuclear power stations.</p>

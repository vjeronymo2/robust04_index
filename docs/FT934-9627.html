			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Tokyo planners reverse forecast of an upturn JAPAN'S Economic Planning Agency yesterday said there was little evidence of an upturn in the economy, reversing its previously optimistic assessment that the country was 'poised' for recovery. The agency, responsible for setting Japan's growth targets, has said for six months that recovery was imminent, but its November report pointed to falling retail sales and capital spending as signs of continuing economic weakness. Agency officials said yesterday housing starts rose 10.6 per cent in September, compared to a year earlier, but most other sectors are still in decline, including industrial production, and the economy is 'generally sluggish'. The EPA had said earlier this year the economy was 'bottoming', but indicators have continued to show a weakening of economic activity, which the agency has blamed on the appreciation of the yen and an unusually wet summer. There is concern within the government that the sudden fall in Tokyo stock prices in the past week will hurt business and consumer confidence, which is particularly weak. New car registrations in October were 6.8 per cent lower than a year earlier and slipped 11.7 per cent from September. An EPA survey found capital investment in the year to the end of March was likely to fall 9.9 per cent on last fiscal year, as most Japanese companies are looking to reduce, not expand, production capacity. Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, said the EPA's gloomier forecast was not reason enough to consider another stimulative package for the economy. He said public works spending would rise in coming months and demand for private housing would remain strong. EPA officials concede their target of 3.3 per cent growth in the year to March is well out of reach, though the agency has yet to release a new estimate. It has described the official estimate as 'a high target to encourage effort' rather than a reflection of likely growth.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Second bidder likely to pull out of ECGD sale A SECOND company is likely to pull out of the bidding for the short-term credit insurance business of the Export Credits Guarantee Department. Management of Cobac, the private sector Belgian credit insurance company, is to recommend to its board this week that it pulls out. The decision will embarrass the government as it will weaken the field further, just as the controversial privatisation legislation is scheduled to come before the House of Lords. Eagle Star was the first of the six shortlisted bidders to withdraw and another, Sun Alliance, is still considering whether to submit a bid by the April 30 deadline. Mr Jason Hadick, Cobac managing director, said that the move reflected doubts about the availability of re-insurance cover for credits to politically risky developing countries. Whitehall policy on this meant that British exporters 'would be at a structural disadvantage to their competitors'. He added he was 'extremely disappointed' by the move earlier this month by Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, to overthrow an amendment to the privatisation bill which would have required Whitehall to provide political risk re-insurance cover for three years after the privatisation. Without such cover from the government, the newly-privatised ECGD would either have to charge very high premiums or sacrifice its rate of return, he said. Export credit bankers say they expect the bidding to end in a battle between NCM, the Dutch credit insurer, and Trade Indemnity, which dominates the UK domestic credit insurance market. They believe NCM has the edge at present, although Italy's Assicurazioni Generali is understood to have made a forceful sales pitch to ECGD management. Cobac's move comes as major exporters, including Trafalgar House and GEC, are mounting a fresh but discreet campaign to prevent what they see as a concerted effort by the Treasury to withdraw government support for exports to developing countries, including those sold under long-term credit. The business of insuring such credits will remain a government responsibility even after the privatisation of ECGD's short-term business.</p>

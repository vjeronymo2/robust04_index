			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Another group of German citizens from  Yemen arrived in Djibouti Saturday evening [7 May]. According  to a Foreign Ministry spokesperson in Bonn, two Bundeswehr  Transall aircraft flew a total of 129 passengers, mainly all  women and children, out of the Yemeni capital of Sana'a.  One-third of the passengers come from EU [European Union]  member states. The operation will be continued this Sunday.    The Defense Ministry has said that another Transall aircraft  was transferred from Bahrain to Djibouti in support of the  evacuation operation, so that three aircraft, which can each  take about 90 passengers, could be used in a shuttle service.  According to the Foreign Ministry, the approximately 250 German  citizens in Yemen had been called upon by Deutsche Welle to  gather in the capital, if possible.    On 6 May, the first group of approximately 20 German  citizens  was taken from the South Yemeni port city of Aden to the French  warship Jules Verne in Djibouti. They and almost 600 other  foreigners were taken out of the country by the French Navy. A  spokesman of the French troops deployed in Djibouti told the  radio station France Info that another French ship was cruising  off the coast of Yemen, if another evacuation operation had to  be carried out. There were currently no plans to use aircraft,  he said.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo to ease Japan Tobacco flotation The Tokyo stock exchange is to introduce measure to curb excessive price movements in Japan Tobacco shares which are scheduled to be listed on October 27. Stock exchange officials are wary of repeating the chaos following the listing of East Japan Railway (JR East) shares last October, when the TSE's computer system broke down due to mass sell orders of the stock, which later affected the whole market. On the first trading day, price fluctuations will be limited to within 30 per cent of the public offering price, the TSE said. If JT shares become bid-only or ask-only at prices deviating more than 30 per pent from the public offering price, trade in JT shares will be halted immediately. In addition, the exchange will require first-day investors to settle on the same day rather than allowing the usual four days delay.</p>

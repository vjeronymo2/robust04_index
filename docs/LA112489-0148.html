			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ACTIVISTS PICKET FUR SHOPPERS  </P> <P> Game show host Bob Barker, joined by 2,500 animal rights activists, marched  down New York City's Fifth Avenue today telling holiday shoppers the price is  always wrong when you're buying fur.  </P> <P> Barker, the host of "The Price Is Right," led the marchers for the second  straight year past chic shops in midtown Manhattan during the fourth annual  "Fur-Free Friday" event.  </P> <P> In Miami, vandals painted over a fur storage company's windows. Protests were  scheduled in cities around the country on the opening day of the holiday  shopping season.  </P> <P> In New York, standing behind Barker was Gary Kaskel of Manhattan, who walked  with his two pet fitch ferrets, which are related to minks and often used for  furs.  </P> <P> "It's a good image to let people see the animals alive," said Kaskel, petting  the animals. "People don't see the animals in the traps, so you have to let 'em  see them alive, see how sweet they are."  </P></p>

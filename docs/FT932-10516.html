			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: Police believe trial sabotage was planned THE POSSIBILITY that a serious attempt to bribe the judge in charge of the trial of Mr Asil Nadir was ever contemplated was again dismissed yesterday by informed sources. However, police investigating the original theories of a Pounds 3.5m 'slush fund' to bribe Mr Justice Tucker believe that some attempt was planned to sabotage the trial of the Polly Peck chairman. The investigation began last October after police obtained a copy of a document relating to the apparent payment of Pounds 3.5m by an acquaintance of Mr Nadir into a bank account. That acquaintance is in northern Cyprus. Mr Nadir was initially suspected of involvement in the apparent plan. However, although he was re-arrested and questioned about the alleged payment, no evidence linking him to it was ever discovered. Doubts remain about whether the copy is of a genuine document or a forgery designed to mislead. Exactly what was intended - and who was behind it - remains unknown. The Metropolitan police said yesterday that the investigation by its International and Organised Crime Squad into the apparent payment was continuing. However, it is widely believed that the inquiries have effectively finished and that charges are highly unlikely. Police suspected the payment could have been part of an attempt to influence the course of Mr Nadir's trial, although they dismiss any suggestion that the apparent payment was to be used to bribe Mr Justice Tucker. He was never subject to any illegal approach and has remained the trial judge throughout. It is generally believed that the copy of the document referring to the payment was intended to destabilise Mr Nadir's trial in some way - but how, to what purpose and to whose benefit remains uncertain. Had such allegations surfaced once Mr Nadir's trial had started, the legal proceedings would undoubtedly be thrown into considerable confusion.</p>

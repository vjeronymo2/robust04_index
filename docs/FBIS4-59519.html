			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] A responsible source at the Ministry of Defense  has denied what was transmitted by Sanaa radio in its news  bulletin of 3:00 PM this afternoon, that is, the forces of  al-Ahmar gang had advanced towards al-Dali' and al-Anad and  restored the al-Musaymir Center to legitimacy according to its  claim.    The source added that the report transmitted by the said  radio and attributed to a so-called responsible source in the  Ministry of Defense about the advance of the forces of the  al-Ahmar gang in many directions, was not based on any truth at  all. It is just part of the psychological warfare and  misleading media reporting. It is cheap lies to which the news  media of the al-Ahmar gang had become accustomed. It is a gang  headed by a man who is not restrained by anyone. [passage  omitted]</p>

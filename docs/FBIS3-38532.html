The damning report from the EU's Court of Auditors follows five  years of investigation by Terry Wynn, the Labour Merseyside East  MEP [Member of European Parliament]. "It's an indictment of not  just the tobacco sector but the whole Common Agricultural  Policy," said Mr Wynn yesterday.    "The report is everything that I have asked for," he said.  But he demanded action yesterday fom both the European  Commission and national governments. "This is a total misuse of  public funds," he said. Nearly all of the EU's 180,000 tobacco  growers live in Spain, Italy and Greece. The cost of propping  up the sector was 1.274bn ecus (1bn pounds) last year. The  report notes that changes have been made to policy, but says  that huge and in many cases unnecessary costs will continue. It  blames the European Commission and member states alike.    The most serious allegation in the report concerns the  fraudulent manipulation of the market with the assistance of a  Commission official who later committed suicide, and inadequate  attempts by the Commission to get to the bottom of the affair.  "In 1990, the Commission carried out an internal inquiry into  the management of the tobacco division," the report notes.  "During the inquiry the Commission received allegations that a  cartel had existed and been aided by the head of division....  The report itself indicates that the possible loss over an  eight-year period could have been as high as ECU 40 million."    During the 1989-90 period one Italian company and one Greek  company accounted for about half of all the tobacco sold off  from EU stocks. The Commission launched a disciplinary action  against the head of division. But, it notes, "no action has  been taken to carry out adequate inquiries into the allegations  of a cartel and the consequences for the Community budget." It  adds: "There was no evidence of action on the part of the  Commission or a member state to bring suspected wrongdoers to  justice." The Commission maintains that the investigation is  ongoing, even though the official killed himself last year.    The Court of Auditors says that it found the Commission "not  as forthcoming as it should have been" over this affair. And it  makes further requests for "a copy of a contract with a company,  connected with a retired Commission official, which conducted  (the investigation) and for details of payments made thereunder."    Large quantities of tobacco were exported at very low prices  from Italy, Spain and Greece with the aid of EU subsidies. In  many cases the tobacco was worthless and simply sent abroad to  claim the cash, mainly to Hungary, Russia and Albania. "The  tobacco had no real commercial value and the exporter's profit  from such operations was almost entirely derived from the export  refund," the report says. A separate investigation is going on  into what appears to be a massive case of fraud involving  exports to Albania, Mr Wynn said yesterday, sparked by his  inquiries. "Exports from Italy to Albania amounted to 25,906  tonnes in 1990 but 23,087 tonnes or 89 per cent did not reach  its destination," the report says, with a lOm ecus cost to the  EU. Fraudulent exports from Greece to Albania cost another  23.4m ecus.    The report says that a large proportion of the EU's  resources  were spent subsidising tobacco for which there is little or no  demand. For two varieties which "hardly had a market"  overproduction was estimated at 215,000 tonnes in 1987-92.  Altogether the EU spent more than 800m ecus on "problem  varieties."    The result of the EU schemes was to make tobacco production  far more profitable than it should have been in proportion to  the amount of land involved. "The net income (per hectare) was  more than three times as high as as the average net income...for  all types of farms in the same member states," the report says.  The level of EU support was 23 times higher than that for  cereals, for instance. The Court of Auditors calculates that if  the EU had handed over the equivalent of the income that tobacco  farmers get in cash, rather than managing the market, the cost  would be halved.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGER NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> RECORD DOESN'T SPEAK FOR ITSELF, MORGAN SAYS  </P> <P> The numbers say Mike Morgan isn't a winner. His lifetime major league record of  34-68 is the worst of any active pitcher with 20 or more decisions.  </P> <P> If you want to avoid an argument, though, don't confront Morgan with such  statistical. The newest Dodger made it clear Sunday that he won't buy it.  </P> <P> When Morgan, 29, checked into camp after having been acquired from the  Baltimore Orioles Saturday for outfielder Mike Devereaux, reporters lost no  time in making references to his past performance.  </P> <P> The right-hander bristled a bit, then said: "There are a lot of people in  baseball like that. It doesn't mean I'm a loser. I haven't been with the best  of teams, either. Some guys are superstars from the start. Others take longer."  </P> <P> For most of his six seasons in the majors, Morgan has toiled for teams that  finished below .500. He broke in with the Oakland Athletics, then went to the  New York Yankees, the Toronto Blue Jays, the Seattle Mariners and the Orioles.  Only the Blue Jays had a winning record when he was with them.  </P> <P> Still, wouldn't Morgan have to upgrade his pitching to turn his career around?  </P> <P> "Not really," he said. "Being with a team like the Dodgers is sure to make a  big difference. They're a great organization. They weren't just world champions  last year. They've been up there almost every year. They're the type of team  that's successful."  </P> <P> Morgan's most victories came in 1987 when he was 12-17 with Seattle. But his  earned-run average was 4.65.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a great year by any means," Morgan said. "I certainly wasn't  satisfied. I'm never satisfied."  </P> <P> Morgan's career was stunted because the Athletics brought him to the majors out  of high school at Las Vegas. He was the fourth player picked in the amateur  draft in 1978, behind Bob Horner, Lloyd Moseby and Hubie Brooks.  </P> <P> Morgan's premature promotion was generally regarded as one of owner Charlie  Finley's many publicity ploys.  </P> <P> "That kept me from excelling," Morgan said.  </P> <P> Morgan hung around for only three starts, all of which he lost, before being  sent to Vancouver. After that, he kept bobbing in and out of the majors until  he finally stuck with the majors in 1986.  </P> <P> Since Morgan is a strong candidate for a starting job, his acquisition may lead  to the demotion of rookie Ramon Martinez to triple-A Albuquerque. Martinez's  spring earned-run average for four innings of work is 9.00.  </P> <P> However, pitching coach Ron Perranoski said Sunday that he felt encouraged  about Martinez after a long instructional session with the right-hander from  the Dominican Republic.  </P> <P> "We did a couple of things to modify his delivery," Perranoski said. "His  mechanics have been off, and we're hoping the changes will give him some  consistency."  </P> <P> In any case, Morgan won't have to wait long to get work. He is scheduled to  pitch two innings against the Detroit Tigers at Lakeland today.  </P> <P> "He got in only three innings with Baltimore this spring," Perranoski. "We'll  start him with two innings, then three, and build him up to where he can start  for us if necessary."  </P> <P> Fernando Valenzuela pitched on the side before Sunday's game against the  Houston Astros, then stalked away in frustration. He has a 12.60 ERA for two  appearances in his attempted comeback from a shoulder injury.  </P> <P> Told of Valenzuela's displeasure, Perranoski said: "He's just getting his arm  strength back. That's the way bodies are made. You can't just go from A to Z. I  don't think it's anything to write Ann Landers about."  </P> <P> Alfredo Griffin continued his hitting spree Sunday, going three for four as the  the Dodgers came from behind for a 7-6 victory in 11 innings. Griffin, who  batted .199 last year, has 15 hits in 24 at-bats for an exhibition average of  .556.  </P> <P> The hero of the day, though, was rookie third baseman Dave Hansen, whose single  off the Astros' Jeff Heathcock drove in non-roster outfielder Mike White with  the tie-breaking run. White and Hansen were drafted one-two in 1986, and both  played for the Dodgers' Class A Vero Beach farm club last year.  </P> <P> Hansen, 20, who was born in Long Beach and attended Rowland High School in  Rowland Heights, was excited.  </P> <P> "I'm just glad I impressed somebody," he said. "I know I'll more than likely go  to Double-A this year, but this was kind of a thrill for me."  </P></p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Payout raised as Gambro lifts income by 27% GAMBRO, the Swedish medical equipment maker, said favourable market trends and acquisitions had helped it lift 1992 pre-tax income to SKr753m (Dollars 102.34m), up 27 per cent from SKr594m a year earlier. The performance encouraged the group to raise its dividend 20 per cent to SKr4.50 per share from SKr3.75. Sales rose 12 per cent to SKr6.3bn from SKr5.6bn. Operating profit rose 24 per cent to SKr972m, with interest expenses up to SKr299m from SKr283m. Gambro's main activity, renal care, saw turnover rise 9 per cent to SKr4.5bn, thanks to strong sales of dialysis machines and other equipment. The intensive care and anaesthesia division lifted sales 17 per cent to SKr408m, helped by the purchase of the UK group MIE, and the blood component technology area increased sales by 18 per cent to SKr385m.</p>

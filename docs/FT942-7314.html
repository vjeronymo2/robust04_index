			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / BAe wins Pounds 66.5m order for missiles British Aerospace Defence has won a fresh government order for its Advanced Short-range Air-to-air Missile worth Pounds 66.5m. The original Pounds 570m development and production order for the Asraam was placed with BAe two years ago, and included a fixed-price option for a further batch of missiles which the ministry has decided to pick up. The number of missiles in each batch has not been disclosed by the Ministry of Defence. Asraam is due to enter service with the Royal Air Force in 1998. The new order will mean further work for BAe's production plant at Lostock, Greater Manchester, between 1997 and 2000, which employs 950 people. Development is being handled at the company's sites at Bristol and Stevenage, where 250 engineers and an additional 250 support staff are working on the project. Asraam is the only replacement under development for the long standing AIM-9 Sidewinder missile and BAe has high hopes for its export prospects. The Ministry of Defence yesterday placed an order worth more than Pounds 20m for submarine command systems - to be installed in Trident ballistic missile submarines and retrofitted to the Trafalgar and Swiftsure classes - with electronics specialists BAeSEMA of New Malden, Surrey. This follows BAeSEMA's success last week in winning contracts worth Pounds 36m for its surface ship control system for the Korean navy.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SUPPORT GROUPS FOR AIDS VICTIMS, BATTERED WOMEN  </P> <P> Two new community outreach programs have been announced by Frank Richelieu,  pastor of the Redondo Beach Church of Religious Science. They are an AIDS  support group called Being Alive, and a support group for battered women and  children.  </P> <P> Both programs are under the direction of the Rev. Cecile Brazille, staff  minister.  </P> <P> Being Alive -- for people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, their  families and friends -- meets privately at the church on the last Monday of  each month. A meeting on the last Tuesday of each month is open to the public.  Assisting in the program are Dr. Neil Schram of Kaiser Permanente Hospital in  Harbor City and Brother Richard, associate chaplain of Little Company of Mary  Hospital in Torrance.  </P> <P> The Family Crisis Center, a shelter for battered women and children in the  Redondo Beach area, is not located at the church but is assisted by the  congregation's fund-raising activities. Donations are also sought to assist  people with AIDS, many of whom are too ill to work.  </P> <P> The church is located at 907 Knob Hill Ave., Redondo Beach. For more  information, call 540-5080.  </P></p>

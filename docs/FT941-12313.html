			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Odd man out in global welfare state: America In the White House 'war room' aides reportedly punched the air with their fists. The cause of the excitement? President Bill Clinton had just taken one of the boldest steps in his political career. In his State of the Union address, he waved his pen at members of Congress and threatened to veto any healthcare legislation that did not guarantee insurance cover for all Americans. The incident is a reminder that policies (such as universal health cover) taken for granted for decades elsewhere remain controversial in the US. In Europe, the political challenge is to find ways of easing the crushing financial burden imposed on public sectors by long-established 'cradle-to-grave' welfare states. There is little stomach for extending government services; the quest is rather for politically acceptable cuts in public provision. The US, by contrast, is still in the building phase. In addition to providing health cover for 37m uninsured Americans, Mr Clinton envisages a larger government role in labour markets. He wants to replace a passive unemployment insurance system with an activist 're-employment service' of the kind pioneered in Sweden. Rather than simply handing out cheques, public agencies would assess workers' skills, organise training and provide assistance in job search. As with healthcare reform, this is part of a broader effort to restore a sense of personal economic security. An extension of the US welfare state is feasible only because social policy has been so circumscribed in the past. Americans grumble about high taxes, but their fiscal burden is still relatively modest. Total government spending accounts for only about 34 per cent of gross domestic product against an average of 52 per cent in Europe. Public spending is under better control because the US relies more heavily on private provision (the majority of Americans still get health insurance through private employers) and because it never entirely lost confidence in the 19th century ideal of self help. Most Americans accept that a safety net for children, the elderly and the disabled - the 'deserving poor' - is needed. But the concept of 'income support' for anybody who falls on hard times remains alien to the culture. Unemployment insurance lasts only six months (except during recessions); thereafter single adults are on their own. Welfare support is restricted mainly to families with children, usually those headed by single parents. Public debate about social policy, however, is strangely skewed. Querying the vast sums lavished on the elderly - including well-to-do senior citizens  -has become politically taboo. There is virtually no discussion of the merits of Social Security, the federally run pension system that costs taxpayers Dollars 300bn a year. Nobody seems remotely concerned by actuarial reports showing that this pay-as-you-go system could become insolvent early in the next century once baby-boomers start retiring. Pundits are instead driving themselves into a frenzy over welfare support for inner city families, a financially insignificant component of the US welfare state that threatens to overshadow the healthcare debate. Total spending on Aid for Families with Dependent Children, the main welfare prop, is only Dollars 23bn a year, or about two per cent of the federal budget. The average payment under the programme is a princely Dollars 377 a month, little more than half the level 20 years ago after allowing for inflation. Welfare touches a nerve, however, because it is widely regarded as having contributed to a host of chronic social problems, including sharply rising illegitimacy rates, violent crime and drug abuse. Ever receptive to public opinion, Mr Clinton has promised to attack the 'culture of dependency' by unveiling tough welfare reforms this spring. He plans to build on the 1988 Family Support Act, which introduced a limited form of 'workfare,' by setting a strict two year limit on welfare cheques. The hope is that most welfare recipients would be placed in private sector jobs before the time limit expires; the remainder would be required to perform community work. This, at least, is the theory although many experts doubt that it can be realised. It would require heavy investment in training and involve the creation of perhaps an additional 1.5m public sector jobs, which would hardly further the administration's objective of 're-inventing' government by reducing bureaucracy. In urging Congress to enact reforms of healthcare, welfare, and job training  -not to mention criminal sentencing policy - Mr Clinton is emerging as the most socially active president since Lyndon Johnson. But whether he will succeed in significantly reshaping social policy remains uncertain. If Mr Clinton obtains a guarantee of universal health cover, it is likely to be phased in over many years. And the role of government will certainly end up more restricted than envisaged in the original White House plan. In the longer run, America's welfare state is likely to remain lean, patchy and relatively inexpensive by world standards - despite Mr Clinton's activist agenda. This is the last in a series analysing the pressures on the welfare state across the world. A reprint of all 15 articles, in A4 format, will shortly be available for Pounds 12.

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Cookery: No place for the faint-hearted PORTUGAL is no place for faint-hearted appetites. Even in a heat wave, the locals persevere bravely with very substantial lunches. And then, in mid-afternoon, they are lured willingly into coffee and cake shops, so keeping the calorie count ticking over nicely. I discovered all this - and managed to adapt to the local customs - when I went there this summer. My base was Estremoz, half-way between Evora and Elvas in the Alto Alentejo, close to the border with Spain. The region is full of fortified hill towns and is the home of the Elvas plum as well as fine fruits and vegetables of many kinds as well as wines, cork and cereal crops. Estremoz itself is a delight: a sleepy, unpretentious, walled town topped by a royal castle - named after the beatified Queen Isabel, who died there in 1336 - where I stayed and a maze of medieval streets. The castle is now a pousada*. Updated for the comfort of 20th century guests, it is cool, calm and imposing. Sous-chef Alice Pola, my guide through the pousada kitchens - most of the chefs in Portugal are women, she told me - described in detail what she was going to cook for dinner. This included salt cod and fresh spinach for the recipe given below; pork and clams for Porc a Alentejana, one of the best known dishes to come out of Portugal; and a pudding with enough egg yolks and sugar to horrify health food devotees. Salt cod is one of Portugal's favourite ingredients. There is said to be a different way of cooking it for every day of the year and it can be found in grocery shops everywhere, stacked in piles like over-sized, over-starched grey napkins and smelling as pungent as a footballer's socks. Set into the grocer's counter is a guillotine used for cutting up the cod. Indeed, these guillotines are as important to Portuguese grocers today as the bacon slicer was to their British counterparts years ago. The Portuguese are not squeamish. In butcher shops, tripes hang from hooks like chamoix leathers and there are pigs' tails, cheeks and testicles on offer. In the markets, shoppers run their eyes and hands over live, fully-grown geese, ducks, hens, turkeys, guinea fowl and rabbits before buying. The majority of birds, though, are sold as chicks, to be fattened by the cook at home in readiness for the pot. Fruit and vegetables have an irrestible appeal. What Briton could resist tomatoes that really taste of tomato, or the squashily-ripe brown and purple figs. Turnip tops are sold for the sake of their leaves, before the root balls are formed. Bunches of herbs are the size of Interflora bouquets, and there are masses of flat-leaf parsley, green coriander and intensely scented wild oregano with flower heads as big as hops. Meanwhile, back to the salt cod . . . BACALHAU A MODA DE ESTREMOZ (Serves 6-8 as a substantial first course, or 3-4 as a main dish. Either way I like to accompany it with halved and baked tomatoes; their mild acidity and juiciness complement salt cod well.) Ingredients: 8 oz salt cod; 1 bay leaf; 1-2 garlic cloves; 12 oz spinach (weighed after stripping away tough stalks); 3 fl oz olive oil; scant 3 oz flour; 12 fl oz milk; 2 oz coarsely grated bread crumbs tossed in scant 1 tablespoon warm olive oil and stir-fried gently until crisp and golden. Soak the salt cod for 24-36 hours, changing the water several times. Cut the soaked fish into chunks. Put it into a pan with the milk, pushing it down into the liquid. Add the bay leaf. Place over a low flame and bring slowly to simmering point. Simmer for 1-2 minutes. Cover and set aside for 20 minutes before straining. Skin, bone and flake the fish. Reserve the milk separately. Wash the spinach, steam it lightly (bear in mind that it will continue to cook in the oven later) and chop it roughly. Crush the garlic and soften it gently in the olive oil. Add the flour and cook briefly. Blend in the milk and bring to simmering point, stirring continuously, to make a very stiff sauce or panade. Whizz about half of it in a food processor together with the salt cod to make fishy paste. Beat in the rest of the sauce by hand, then the spinach, and add pepper to taste. Spoon the mixture into a shallow earthenware dish that has been brushed with olive oil, mounding the mixture slightly in the centre. Cover with a dome of oiled foil. Everything up to this stage can be prepared up to 24 hours ahead. Close to serving time, bake the creamed salt cod with spinach in its covered dish at 375`F-400`F/190`C-200`C (gas mark 5-6) for about 30 minutes until piping hot and and beginning to bubble at the edges. Scatter with hot crisply fried crumbs and serve with tomatoes. * Pousada da Rainha Santa Isabel, 7100 Estremoz, Portugal. Tel. 068-22 618; fax 068-23 982.</p>

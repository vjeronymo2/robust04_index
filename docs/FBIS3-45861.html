Following the dissolution of the former Soviet Union,  Russia,  Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus became heirs to the bulk of  former Soviet nuclear arsenal.    Although Kazakhstan and Belarus had agreed much earlier to  transfer all the strategic weapons deployed on their territories  to Russia for destruction, Kiev had declined to do so due to  controversies.    With 176 strategic missiles and about 1,500 nuclear  warheads,  Ukraine is the third largest nuclear power in the world after  Russia and the United States.    So Moscow and Washington became deeply concerned over Kiev's  unwillingness to give up its nuclear power status.    The concerns had increased after the Ukrainian parliament  decided on November 18 that the country would only destroy part  of its nuclear arms in the first stage and was prepared to  become a non-nuclear state only after being secured against  threats from other nuclear powers.    The parliament also urged the West to fund Ukraine in  dismantling its nuclear weapons.    Taking common interests into consideration, U.S. Vice  President Albert Gore visited Moscow in December to coordinate  the two countries' positions in pressing Ukraine to give up all  its nuclear weapons.    Meanwhile, Kiev was plagued by financial difficulties to  effectively maintain the bulk of strategic weapons, especially  after Moscow had refused to provide the spare parts needed by  such maintenance.    Under such situation, Ukraine agreed to negotiate with  Russia  and the United States. But the talks had deadlocked on  Ukraine's request for financial compensation for the destruction  of its nuclear arms and for sharing with Russia the income from  selling the uranium to be taken from the nuclear warheads.    The three sides had not made any major compromises on the  issue until U.S. President Bill Clinton's trip to Prague for a  summit with leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and  Slovakia earlier this week.    Ukraine finally agreed to destroy all the nuclear weapons  deployed on its soil. In return, the United States will provide  Kiev 175 million U.S. dollars for nuclear arms destruction and  another 155 million in economic assistance, while Russia also  agreed to allow Kiev to share the income from uranium sales.    Because of this, Clinton changed his itinerary and stopped  briefly in Kiev on Wednesday to meet with Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk before flying to Moscow later the same day.    Kravchuk agreed to fly to Moscow on Friday for a summit with  Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin so that they could  sign an agreement on the issue, which has been jeopardizing  Kiev's relations with Moscow and Washington.</p>

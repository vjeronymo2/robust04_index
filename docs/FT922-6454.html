			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / How to Spend It: Perfect for summer parties THE SEASON of summer parties, of marquees in the garden, of picnics and of weddings is upon us. For most of us that means catering on a scale that tests the resources of even the most amply equipped houses. Top Table is worth knowing about because it specialises in hiring out anything and everything the party table might need - but in quantity. Although many companies offer this service what is perhaps different about Top Table is its range of exceptionally attractive tableware. There is, for instance, a chic, striped collection and a smart black and white group due in the autumn. There is plain white china, with a raised fruit pattern on the sides, and colourful fruit patterned china which is fresh and springlike, with a white background, or darkly decorative with a black background. There is a choice of handblown bubble glasses, tablecloths and napkins. Large black candelabra can also be supplied and would suit a function in a barn or marquee. Based in Northamptonshire, the company will deliver all the hired pieces free within a 15-mile radius, otherwise a charge, according to distance, has to be made. For details contact: Top Table Hire, Moors Farm, West Farndon, Daventry, Northants. Tel: 0327-60575. REMEMBER the string bag? Once a hotter than hot little number in the 1960s it was ousted by the plastic bag as a worthy receptacle for pop art. Then, in the 1980s, came designer label shoppings bags. Shops such as Browns, Hermes, Joseph and Chanel were as popular for the chic conveyed by their bags as their labels. In the eco-conscious 90s the string bag is making a comeback. Paper, we are told,is bad - all those forests - and plastic is worse  - all those chemicals that eat up ever-diminishing resources. The fad first resurfaced in New York and has now reached the UK. Reusable and made of 100 per cent cotton in natural, yellow, orange, red, blue, green, and black, the bags can be crumpled up small inside a handbag and emerge later. String bags can now be bought from retailers including The Conran Shop, Michelin House, 81 Fulham Road, London SW3 and Neal Street East, Neal Street, London WC2 as well as by mail from The String Bag Company. It is offering three - one beach bag, one shoulder bag and one shopping bag - for Pounds 11 plus Pounds 1 to cover postage and packing. Tel: 071-581-0196 or write to The String Bag Company, 50 Lombard Road, London SW11 3RY.</p>

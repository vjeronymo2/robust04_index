			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STYLE: FILLING THE 'MAKEUP GURU' VOID;  </P> <P> AN ASSEMBLY-LINE WORKER TURNED COSMETIC ARTIST WANTS TO TEACH HIS CLIENTS THE  TECHNIQUES HE'S MASTERED AFTER 17 YEARS AND THOUSANDS OF FACES.  </P> <P> Richard Stevens wants to be to makeup what Jose Eber is to hair and Richard  Simmons is to the body.  </P> <P> "There is no makeup guru," says Stevens, making it clear that he would like to  fill that void.  </P> <P> In Orange County, he's already making a name for himself.  </P> <P> "He has a number of clients who are walking advertisements," says Candice  Schnapp, a Newport Beach resident and a regular customer of Stevens. She often  has Stevens do her makeup before a formal event, such as the recent Opera  Pacific ball.  </P> <P> "It takes the worry out," Schnapp says. "If I'm under the gun, I'll put on my  lipstick liner and end up with lopsided lips.  </P> <P> "Richard's good at making me have more lip than I have, and he's the only one  who can make my brows look nice."  </P> <P> Stevens' aim is to teach clients how to master their makeup so they can create  their own full lips and perfect brows.  </P> <P> "He insists you watch what he's doing. He wants to make sure you learn his  technique," Schnapp says.  </P> <P> At his group seminars and one-on-one consultations, Stevens' message is always  the same: "If I can do it, anybody can."  </P> <P> To spread the word, Stevens joined forces with fellow makeup artist Julia Cross  and opened the Stevens &amp; Cross Cosmetic Studio in Newport Beach in  November, 1989. Here, in these contemporary black-and-white quarters adorned  with colorful murals, there are no secrets. Stevens and Cross believe in  sharing information, both with each other and with their clients.  </P> <P> "It's information they can't get in department stores," Stevens says.  </P> <P> Stevens came by his knowledge of cosmetics by accident.  </P> <P> "I was going to open up a clothing store for ladies that would carry makeup on  the side," he recalls.  </P> <P> He purchased the cosmetics but then found he couldn't come up with the capital  for the store.  </P> <P> "I tried to get my money back from the (cosmetics) company but they said, 'No.  Why don't you become a makeup artist?' I couldn't even draw a straight line.  </P> <P> "Suddenly, I was selling $2,000 worth of stuff I'd never heard of," he says.  The Vietnam veteran and former assembly-line worker at Ford Motor Co. taught  himself to wield a mascara wand. Seventeen years and thousands of faces later,  he is sharing what he has learned.  </P> <P> "No one leaves here without learning something," he says.  </P> <P> He does not like to call these makeovers -- to him they're more like cosmetic  seminars.  </P> <P> He asks his clients to show up for appointments wearing makeup to see what kind  of look they're striving for and where they might be making mistakes. They sit  facing a mirror under bright studio lights while Stevens paints their faces  with his palette of powders. Often, he'll push a pencil or brush into his  subject's hand and have her practice the strokes.  </P> <P> He recently demonstrated his makeup techniques on the studio's model, Tani  Wright.  </P> <P> "The first thing women want to know is how to do brows," he says.  </P> <P> Cross, watching him work, calls eyebrows the "frame for the picture." Stevens  uses a brow shadow applied with a brush to fill in sparse areas and extend the  brow if it's too short.  </P> <P> "Brow pencils will always look drawn on," he says. "We don't change it, we just  accentuate it." On Wright, the added powder adds definition to the brows but  doesn't change their naturally smooth arch.  </P> <P> To erase circles under Wright's eyes, he places highlighter on the deepest  depression. Many women end up accentuating the dark circles they're trying to  conceal by incorrectly applying the wrong color concealer to the puffy area.  </P> <P> "Nine times out of 10, women wear concealers that are entirely too light, and  they end up with a raccoon effect," Cross says.  </P> <P> Blush poses the biggest beauty hazard. Women typically apply it too low on the  cheeks.  </P> <P> "It's always above the hollow," Stevens says. "It's not across the chin, under  the eye, or all of those crazy places."  </P> <P> Some also choose blush colors that are too bright and end up with an artificial  look, Cross says.  </P> <P> "You should add just a little blush -- it shouldn't be these strong circles of  color," she says. "Blush is one product that if women are feeling pale or down,  they'll reach for it. They get that brush going all over the forehead, nose and  cheeks."  </P> <P> Stevens prefers to emphasize the mouth and the eyes.  </P> <P> "I always do a stronger mouth. The mouth will always lead the way," he says.  </P> <P> Without benefit of collagen injections, he can achieve the fuller, pouty mouth  now in vogue.  </P> <P> "Most women underplay their lips. Lip liner is the key to bringing them into  focus. It's not just a crumby line that goes around the mouth."  </P> <P> He uses a mauve-colored lip pencil to outline Wright's already generous lips,  staying within the natural lines and then using the pencil to shade in the  middle.  </P> <P> "It's the coloring book method -- you never go over the lines," Stevens says.  Liner gives the lips shape and prevents lipstick from bleeding.  </P> <P> For the eyes, he uses a nude powder on the lid to even the skin tone, saving  the colored shadow for the deep recession just under the brow bone. Stevens  prefers neutral shades with a matte finish, choosing a smoky plum to accent  Wright's clear blue eyes.  </P> <P> "When you get into the blues, turquoise or greens on the eyelids, you're in  trouble," he says. Colors should enhance the eyes, not compete with them.  </P> <P> Before applying mascara, he uses a lash curler, a medieval-looking contraption  many women abandon because they don't know how to use it properly. Stevens  positions it on the lashes as close to the lid as possible and squeezes for  several seconds. The resulting curl can make lashes look twice as long and  lasts the rest of the day.  </P> <P> When working with a mascara wand, he first wipes the excess off the tip, then  uses only the first couple rows of the brush.  </P> <P> "That way you're not sticking the lashes together," he says.  </P> <P> He also has practical suggestions for skin care. To prevent eye makeup and  mascara from smudging, wash off the oily eye makeup remover with soap and  water. To keep lips from looking flaky, use a Vitamin E-enriched conditioner,  then blot off the excess before applying lipstick.  </P> <P> "A woman doesn't have to do every one of these things," Stevens says. Just  eliminating six mistakes and adding two or three positive steps can make a big  difference in her appearance.  </P> <P> A personal consultation costs $75 and lasts 1 1/2 to 2 hours for the initial  session, with free follow-ups. For an additional $25, customers can have the  session videotaped.  </P></p>

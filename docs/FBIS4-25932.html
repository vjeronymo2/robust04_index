			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, June 12 (XINHUA) -- China and India will  discuss the ways and means for expanding bilateral trade when  the fifth meeting of the Sino-Indian Joint Team for Economic and  Trade Affairs takes place here this week.    A 12-member Chinese delegation led by Minister of Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi will arrive here on Tuesday  [14 June] for the meeting.    Apart from the official delegation, the Chinese minister  will  bring with her a Chinese businessmen team consisting of chairmen  of major Chinese trading corporations.    The Chinese businessmen will interact with their Indian  counterparts to tap the great potential of bilateral trade  between the two countries.    During her three-day stay here, Wu Yi is scheduled to meet  Indian Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Finance Minister  Manmohan Singh, Minister of State for Steel S.M. Dev and  Minister of State for Coal A.K. Panja.    She is also likely to meet Indian Prime Minister Narasimha  Rao, according to informed sources here.    Hu Guocai, head of the Chinese advance team which arrived  here on Saturday for the preparation of the forthcoming meeting,  said today that there is great scope for expanding bilateral  trade between the two most populous nations in the world.    Two-way trade between India and China, which has been  developing fast over recent years, totalled 670 million U.S.  dollars last year, nearly doubling that of the previous year, Hu  said.    "At the meeting, we will focus on further development of  bilateral trade through setting up more joint ventures and  transferring technologies," he said.</p>

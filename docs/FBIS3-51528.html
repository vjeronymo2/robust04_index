			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Orlando Lugo Fonte, president of the </F> National Association of Small Farmers, by Felix Fernando Garrido  at Radio Rebelde studios in Havana -- live]    [Text] [Garrido] Good evening, Orlando Lugo Fonte,  president of the National Association of Small Farmers [ANAP]  and member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of  Cuba.    [Lugo] Good evening.    [Garrido] As we have heard, 1994 will be a year of  challenges  for the farmers and for our country in general. What are the  main goals of ANAP for 1994?    [Lugo] With the Agriculture Ministry and the Sugar Industry  Ministry, ANAP plans to contribute to the sugarcane harvest. The  farmers and cooperatives will do what they must do. We will also  contribute to the food plan by exploiting, to a maximum, the  production capacity of the cooperative and farming sectors.    [Garrido] In other words, in 1994 the ANAP will not abandon  its production potential.    [Lugo] No. We cannot do that because we know the people need  the products we grow and produce. As the weather improves, and  once we can get more money, we will continue to increase  production.    We are also working along other well established guidelines  aimed at consolidating the cooperative movement. Today, more  than ever, we must consolidate our cooperatives. We must do  this, especially now that the country has created the Basic  Cooperative Production Units [UBPC]. We currently have 1,118  cooperatives; of these 1,008 are profitable. We have  approximately 172 cooperatives that are not reporting profits,  and we are going to work with these cooperatives to consolidate  the cooperative movement and ensure that it truly becomes an  example of efficiency and production. This is one of our main  guidelines.    We are also working on consolidating the credit and services  cooperatives. We want these cooperatives to grow strong. We want  these cooperatives to have some money. The sugarcane workers are  now being allowed to purchase their own tractors, forklifts, and  carts. This enables them to do their own harvesting, their own  cutting and lifting. We believe this is something we must work  on because it is important.    [Garrido] What about idle land and the economic aspect?    [Lugo] In addition to the agreement that created the UBPC,  the Central Committee is encouraging groups of comrades to join  and form new UBPC's to work land that is idle. The agreement  also states that the state will give land that is good for  growing tobacco to those comrades who wish to work the land and  grow tobacco. Hundreds of comrades in the tobacco growing  provinces are joining the movement. They are now producing  tobacco and products to feed themselves.    [Garrido] This year marks the 35th anniversary of the  creation of the agrarian reform law. Will the ANAP be discussing  the economic measures with its farmers?    [Lugo] Yes. On 23 January we will hold our first meeting  with  farmers and cooperative members from all over the country. We  are going to discuss the economic measures the country should  adopt. I have no doubt that farmers, the men and women who have  always participated in the country's great tasks and missions,  will discuss the measures and suggest those that should be  adopted. On this 35th anniversary of the agrarian reform law, I  believe it is our duty to participate in these discussions just  as our working sector is doing.</p>

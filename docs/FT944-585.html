			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Success in seclusion - Mary Bunter discovers a hotelier hidden in an Algarve almond grove Just look at that,' Bill Hawkins says, almost to himself, as we pull up in the turning circle edged by fig trees and bougainvillaea which fronts his country-house hotel in Portugal. It is perhaps not surprising that he is still filled with pride each time he arrives at the steps to the sprawling, gracious, 18th-century former farmhouse billed as 'the Algarve's most picturesque hotel'. It has been a 10-year uphill climb against soaring interest rates. He has had little support from banks, whether in Portugal or in the UK, to achieve his ambition of building a four-star establishment renowned for its cuisine. Now the Monte do Casal, perched on a rise a mile or so from the village of Estoi, attracts a following of holidaymakers who return year after year, and sometimes two or three times a year, to enjoy the good life the hotel has to offer. Some 30 per cent of bookings are repeat visits, and many others stem from personal recommendations. The hotel is also featured in the Sovereign brochure, and now several other holiday companies are interested in taking it on to their books. 'The only way you're going to succeed initially is by using a tour operator, although you might not want to,' says Hawkins. He arrived in the Algarve with his wife and two small children 10 years ago. They bought the semi-restored house on a former 50-acre almond plantation for an initial investment of Pounds 100,000 from family finances and a bank loan, and started a decade of hard work. The first year there were only seven rooms, three of which were suites. Year three saw the bar and dining room constructed from the old coach house. By the fifth year the hotel looked much as it does now. On top of the purchase price, Hawkins spent Pounds 250,000 on renovation. The money came mainly from ploughing profits back into the business. Interest rates in Portugal were running at between 28 and 30 per cent while Hawkins was developing the business and he found that neither British nor Portuguese banks would accept the building as collateral. The guests were, by comparison, easier to find. In 1984, Hawkins advertised in British newspapers and soon the hotel was attracting people looking for something a little different in the Algarve. And different it is - most other hotels in the Algarve of comparable standard have 200 beds or more. The Monte do Casal has 12, five of which are suites with their own sitting rooms and French windows that open on to private terraces where guests are served a leisurely breakfast. Hawkins is not only the owner and host but head chef, too. He has come through the rigours of training with the Savoy Group, including some time at Claridge's. He has also worked in Bermuda, at the Reefs Hotel, and in Switzerland, at the Hotel des Beques. He cooks with the help of his Portuguese assistant chef six nights a week and most lunchtimes, catering not only for the hotel guests but many outside visitors as well. It is a stressful existence which would not suit every would-be escapee from the British rat-race. 'Coming to the Algarve was a real challenge. I wanted to develop my own hotel from scratch, with a very individualistic, English country-house feel,' said Hawkins. 'It must have worked - we had one couple come to stay who had booked purely on the strength of a recommendation from other guests at a dinner party.' Monday is his day off - a time to play tennis with friends, or take a drive along the coast for dinner at one of the picturesque establishments he recommends to his clients. At the Dom Joao restaurant in Fabrica, he is greeted as an old friend. He asks what local fish is good on the menu in Portuguese - he has taught himself the language. When it is time to leave, he wistfully promises the owner that one day, they will go fishing together. One casualty of the hard work and long hours involved in running the hotel is Hawkins' marriage. His wife Carol, who previously ran the hotel with him, is now back home in England with their two daughters. Another could be the overexposure of this unspoilt area. The never-ending stream of tourists needed to feed the business will inevitably contribute to eroding the 'alternative Algarve' of which Hawkins is so fond. Each new batch of guests at Monte do Casal is greeted by Hawkins on their first morning. He presses a map of the area into their hands and gives advice drawn from his personal experience on the most picturesque routes and areas away from the crowds. Most, if not all, of the hotel's rival establishments are the other side of the notorious N125 highway which cuts through the Algarve. It separates the concrete purgatory of its over-developed coastal tourist developments from the unspoilt interior of cork trees and peasant farmers - Hawkins' 'hidden Algarve'. Running parallel to the N125 is a newly-built motorway, which in two years will join the Algarve to Lisbon, opening the area further to tourism. 'Tourism has its downside. It can completely destroy the natural charm of an area if development is allowed unchecked,' says Hawkins. 'But the Portuguese government seems to have learnt from earlier mistakes and I'm hopeful the area will become more accessible while retaining its character.' In the meantime, with an annual turnover of Pounds 500,000 and an occupancy rate of 80 per cent, his hotel has other, more pressing problems. Each year in about December, Hawkins returns to England to interview staff to replace those who inevitably move on in this peripatetic business. He advertises in The Lady, looking for that certain something which will make all the difference to British guests at Monte do Casal. He says: 'It's very difficult, because the staff in a small hotel such as this make or break the atmosphere. It's one of the trickier recipes' Monte do Casal, Estoi, 8000 Faro, Algarve, Portugal.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the 24 March summit talks, Japan and the ROK  agreed that "the international community should jointly show a  firm stance" towards the DPRK's (North Korea's) alleged nuclear  weapons program.    Following recent talks with U.S. and Chinese leaders, Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa again pledged to ROK President Kim  Yong-sam that, if the UN Security Council [UNSC] imposes  sanctions against North Korea, Japan would take "responsible  measures" as a member of the United Nations. Japan has never  deeply engaged itself in security issues in East Asia like this.  However, the United Nations may impose not only economic  sanctions, but also further actions such as a sea blockade. In  that case, Japan is likely to be thrown into a constitutional  controversy over the nation's collective defense rights.    The government has been expressing its hope that North Korea  would accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) through diplomatic efforts. As Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said: "We hope North Korea will  use sound judgment in line with the opinions of the  international community." On the other hand, the Secretariat is  studying definite measures for coping with the worst  developments. A top Foreign Ministry official said "it is  inappropriate to discuss our course of action at prsent," but it  is believed the government is preparing phased measures to  follow moderate sanctions of the United Nations.    The Foreign Ministry feels the UNSC is unlikely to adopt  full-fledged sanctions against North Korea immediately. Rather,  the UNSC is expected to issue a statement urging North Korea to  fully accept IAEA inspections as a first step. Policymakers in  the government think: "The likeliest choice for the United  Nations is multinational sanctions imposed on the step-by-step  basis, which means strengthening sanctions one step at a time  depending on developments."    When the United Nations takes such a measure, possible  options for Japan are: 1) a ban on remittances to North Korea;  2) a trade embargo; and 3) restrictions on travel to North  Korea. It is systematically possible that Japan would ban  remittances to North Korea; even in that case, however, those  who want to send money to North Korea can still do so via third  countries. Moreover, the government would have to control money  taken out of Japan by Korean residents who travel to North  Korea. The government can limit the amount of currency taken  abroad by those travelers, or can tighten the issuance of  re-entry visas, but these may become human right problems, and  their effectiveness is questionable.    Japan would face an even more difficult situation if the  United Nations imposes full-fledged sanctions, such as a sea  blockade against North Korea. If the United Nations requests  the cooperation of the Self-Defense Forces or definite  operations in such punitive actions, the conflict between  constitutional restrictions and international demands would  certainly create a furious controversy in Japan. The  international community would criticize Japan if it hesitates in  participating in UN decisions. In that case, the government  would face a Catch-22.    The coalition government has been neglecting improvement of  its crisis management capability. The Foreign Ministry is  afraid that "the coalition may not agree on anti-North Korea  sanctions," and the issue can create friction within the  coalition government. At the summit, Prime Minister Hosokawa  hoped Japan-ROK-U.S. harmony and international pressures would  result in concessions by North Korea. Probably, the remark  reflects the Japanese Government's lack of determination.</p>

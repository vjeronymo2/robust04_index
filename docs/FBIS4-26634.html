			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Faruq Qaddumi, chief of  the PLO Political Department, met with Luo Gan, state councillor  and secretary general of the Chinese State Council Thursday [23  June] night for talks on the latest Palestinian developments and  bilateral relations.    Qaddumi briefed Luo Gan on the latest developments in the  implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on self-rule  in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, saying, "the implementation of  this agreement ushers in a new phase" for the Palestine  Liberation Organization.    He explained that although the PLO encounters some problems,  it is committed to the peace process in the Middle East and is  seeking to attain a final goal of restoring all legitimate  rights of the Palestinian people.    The Chinese official said that reaching an agreement on  Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho between the  PLO and Israel and its implementation is a major breakthrough in  the Middle East peace process.    He expressed his belief that despite hurdles on the way of  implementing the agreement and the future Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations, the Middle East peace process will forge ahead so  long as all parties concerned adopt realistic positions.    The Chinese official said that the PLO will have to handle  several challenges in the forthcoming stage, such as economic  development, social stability and upgrading the living  conditions of the Palestinian people.    He voiced confidence that the PLO will pursue a policy which  will best guarantee successful implementation of the self-rule  agreement so as to provide a sound basis for an overall and just  settlement of the Middle East issue and regain the legitimate  rights of the Palestinian people.    The Chinese official said that the government and people of  China will as always support the peace process in the Middle  East and contribute to the Palestinian economic reconstruction.    The Chinese official arrived in Tunis Tuesday on a four-day  good-will visit to Tunisia and is scheduled to leave for Libya  later today.</p>

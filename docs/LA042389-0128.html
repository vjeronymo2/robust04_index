			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA DERBY;  </P> <P> ENDOW HOLDS ON FOR HALF-LENGTH WIN  </P> <P> Endow held off favored Flying Continental by a half-length to win Saturday's  diamond jubilee running of the $250,000 California Derby at Golden Gate Fields.  </P> <P> Endow took an early lead and nursed it throughout the 1 1/8-mile race,  finishing in 1:49 2/5. The 3-year-old, ridden by Panamanian-born Amir Cedeno  and carrying 119 pounds, earned $137,500 and paid $17.20, $4.80 and $3.60.  </P> <P> Cedeno also rode Endow to victory earlier this month in the Sausalito Stakes.  </P> <P> "So I have good luck," a smiling Cedeno said after the race. "My horse has  speed, he likes to go head to head. Everything's coming like I think before the  race."  </P> <P> But trainer Laz Barrera, who watched Endow win the California Derby from Santa  Anita, said he had no plans to take the Harbor View Farms colt to the Kentucky  Derby May 6.  </P> <P> Instead, he said he would concentrate on entering the California-bred son of  Flying Paster and Kindheartedness in smaller races.  </P> <P> Laffit Pincay Jr., said he lost too much ground going into the first turn with  Flying Continental, who carried 117 pounds.  </P> <P> "That cost me the race," Pincay said. "They were going so slow that I would  have had to strangle him to get him back. The way the race shaped up just  wasn't for him, but that happens. He tried hard."  </P> <P> The race marked the third loss by Flying Continental to Endow, who beat him  twice when they were 2-year-olds.  </P> <P> Flying Continental is owned by Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke and  was bred at Elmendorf Farms in Lexington, Ky. The colt was nominated for the  Kentucky Derby and needed a first or a strong second in the California Derby to  enter.  </P> <P> Flying Continental paid $2.60 and $2.20, while third-place finisher Briartic  Chief paid $3.20 to show.  </P></p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: BP British Petroleum yesterday overtook British Telecom to become the biggest company by market capitalisation on the London Stock Exchange. Admittedly, BP's achievement is not unaided  - BT's share price fell yesterday as it went ex-dividend. The telecoms group has underperformed this year because of fears about competition from cable television and its less than ambitious dividend policy. But BP's success is real nonetheless. Its re-rating since 1992 is a tribute to the cultural revolution put in place by the the company's new management and its impressive earnings performance in a difficult environment.</p>

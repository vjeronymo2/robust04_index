			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Congress likely to back radical economic change THE SENIOR leadership of the Communist party of China gathers in Beijing today for a week-long congress which is expected to endorse radical plans for economic change but balance evenly the forces of conservatism and reform at the top of the party. China's 'open door policy' to foreign investment and the country's continuing engagement with the rest of the world is expected to gain the full approval of the congress. It is also likely to endorse further industry and price reforms, and proclaim the creation of a 'socialist market economy' as one of its key tasks. Congresses of the Chinese Communist party are, however, as much about policy as they are about jobs. Diplomats in Beijing expect the party to retain Jiang Zemin as its general secretary and titular head, and also to retain Li Peng as prime minister. Li's re-appointment is not expected to be confirmed until positions in a new Chinese cabinet are announced next spring. Neither reappointment is what Deng Xiaoping, China's 88-year-old leader, sought when he embarked on a campaign of reform at the beginning of the year. However, analysts said, Deng was forced to accept their reappointment during a round of intense horse trading among the country's gerontocracy. The congress will elect a new central committee for the Communist party. One of its first tasks at the end of the congress will be to elect the politburo and its all-powerful standing committee. Zhu Rongji, 63, China's industry chief and a leading economic reformer, is expected to be appointed to the politburo but it is unclear whether he will make the standing committee. Zou Jiahua, 65, head of state planning and moderate, is also expected to enter the politburo as is Hu Jintao, 50, a possible reformer and the current party secretary for Tibet. On the military front, General Liu Huaquing, 76, is expected to be appointed to both the politburo and its standing committee. Recently, he was made first vice-chairman of the Military Affairs Commission - the organ which controls China's People's Liberation Army. The congress will, however, mark the passing of an institution erected more than 10 years ago for the party's ageing senior membership. The Central Advisory Commission, numbering more than 100 souls, and chaired by Deng's ideological rival Chen Yun, 87, will be shut down. At a briefing yesterday, a foreign ministry spokesman said that there was a motion on the Congress's agenda for it to be disbanded and that no elections would take place for this body. Deng looms over this, the 14th congress of the party since its founding in 1921. Although he has accepted an invitation to attend he is not expected to do so. Diplomats in Beijing believe that the effort he put in to relighting the fires of economic reform earlier this year have affected his health. Some think he is is seriously ill. His name, however, will be enshrined in party documents - which may possibly making him an equal of Mao Zedong, the nation's revolutionary leader and unifier - and his daughter, Deng Nan, a scientist, may well be elected to the central committee.</p>

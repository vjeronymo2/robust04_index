			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed NEGA report in the "Uzbekistan" column] </F>   [Text] Informed sources say that Uzbek President Islam  Karimov recently had a kidney removal operation. In this  connection all scheduled meetings with various delegation were  cancelled. True, he was present at a cabinet of ministers  session devoted to the introduction of the national currency.  According to eyewitness accounts, he did not look very well and  was present for only 20 minutes. His visit to Turkey, scheduled  for 23 June, has not been canceled, though. In the course of  the visit a number of earlier signed agreements bearing on  credits, investments, student and teacher exchanges, and so  forth, are expected to be revised.</p>

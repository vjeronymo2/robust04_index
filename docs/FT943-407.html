			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cash calls send right signals - A report on the announcement of further rights issues The announcement of a further three rights issues yesterday, following Monday's Pounds 235m cash call from Reckitt &amp; Colman, indicates renewed corporate confidence in the demand for new shares, after the summer lull. However, the number of such offers is likely to be linked increasingly to mergers and acquisitions activity, as balance sheets are replenished by record net cash inflows, due to the improving economic back-drop. This week's issues have all been linked to corporate purchases, while last year's record Pounds 11.4bn of rights money was more frequently applied to patching up balance sheets. In part, the change in motivation reflects a waning of institutional demand, in the face of both an over-supply of flotations and the more volatile stock market conditions. Mr Richard Kersley, UK equity strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities, said: 'There is not the same wall of money that there was this time last year, particularly from the overseas institutions.' What money there is, has been drawn towards flotations. The Stock Exchange estimates that Pounds 5.81bn was raised from rights issues in the first eight months of the year, while the corresponding figure for flotations was close to Pounds 9bn. However, James Capel expects rights issue activity to pick up in the last quarter, with a full-year forecast of Pounds 10bn. This would represent almost 1.5 per cent of the stock market's capitalisation at the start of the year, which is close to the average figure since the late 1970s. The attraction of raising funds through share issues might be expected to increase with the turning of the UK interest rate cycle, which has raised the cost of long-term bank money. Analysts point out, however, that interest rates remain at an historically low level. In addition, there is a limited need for cash. Statistics released last week, show that UK industrial and commercial companies generated a capital account surplus of Pounds 4.7bn in the first quarter of 1994, and Pounds 4.78bn in the second quarter. The figures demonstrate the highest level of corporate liquidity since the late 1970s, a consequence of low interest costs and capital expenditure, and the fact that earnings are increasing at a faster pace than dividends. By comparison, the first half of 1993 saw a Pounds 1.75bn capital outflow, although there was a Pounds 917m surplus for the full year. As a result, there has been a sharp decline in the number of so-called 'rescue rights issues,' with the only substantial example being Eurotunnel. Other large issues, from companies including Allied Lyons, Commercial Union, Reckitt, Williams Holdings and GKN, and to a lesser extent Lasmo, have been motivated by acquisitions. Analysts predict that the improvement in corporate cash flow will result in a substantial revival in takeover activity, since companies have recharged their balance sheets. This would increase the flow of rights issues, since the scars of the late 1980s can be seen in companies' preference for using capital markets rather than banks to fund expansion. M&amp;A activity peaked at Pounds 27.2bn in 1989, but had fallen to Pounds 7.06bn last year. However, Hoare Govett is forecasting a recovery to about Pounds 11bn this year. This should be matched by increases in the number of rights offerings.</p>

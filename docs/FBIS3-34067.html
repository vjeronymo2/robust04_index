The second dialogue was held in January 1994  almost exactly a year after the first one. As in the first  dialogue, for the second dialogue too the U.S. Institute of  Peace brought together for three days some 15 unofficial people  from India and Pakistan among whom there were four Kashmiris  from the two parts of the State.    The framework of the January 1993 dialogue was open-ended.  It gave the impression that the U.S. was probing, if not  promoting, the possibilities of an independent Kashmir, its  security and autonomy jointly guaranteed by India and Pakistan.  This impression was fortified in the subcontinent by the  diplomacy of Ms. Robin Raphel, assistant secretary of State for  South Asia, who added an edge to the conflict with her statement  that the "entire State of Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed  territory" and the accession of the State to India in 1948 did  not change that position. The "concept paper" drawn up by the  USIP for the January 1994 dialogue did reiterate that the  "final disposition" of the territory of the State was still in  dispute; however, it also made it clear that a resolution of the  conflict in Kashmir could be attempted only within the existing  political framework of the subcontinent. This important premise  lent an air of reality to the discussions and promoted joint  quests for ways out of the expensive bloody insurgency that has  been savaging the Kashmir Valley since December 1989.    The USIP framework paper made several other points that were  both realistic and constructive. First, the conflict could be  resolved only "over time" and "step by step" through a peace  process that was still to be introduced. Secondly, the gradual,  incremental peace process must start with a significant  reduction in the volume of violence. Several measures were  needed for this constructive opening of a peace process, and  these had to be taken both by the governments in Delhi and  Islamabad and the Kashmiri militants. The USIP document  suggested that the militants take the first step with a  unilateral ceasefire and that the Indian government respond to  it with a strong and generous reciprocity in the form of  releasing political prisoners, a thinning out of security  forces, gradually handing over the charge of maintaining law and  order to the State police and stopping all custodial deaths. In  between these measures by the two sides to the conflict in the  Indian part of the State, Pakistan stops all material aid to  the militants. Violence must be ended as quickly as possible  without weakening the security of the State.    The participants agreed that the Kashmir issue had undergone  a "significant" change with the outbreak of insurgency and  Pakistan's involvement in it. The issue is no longer of  exclusive domain of India and Pakistan or India and the people  of the Kashmir Valley. In the new situation, "it is essential  that the people of Kashmir are central actors" in a political  process of conflict resolution "along with the governments and  citizens of India and Pakistan". Implied in the foregoing  sentence is recognition of three elements that make the Kashmir  issue significantly different today from what it had been in the  past. The conference document recognised that the Kashmiri  people cannot be a single actor, because of the ethnic plurality  of the population and its political division of the last four  decades. There was also recognition of the fact that the  conflict in Kashmir had to be resolved at several levels, each  interacting with the other. This makes the peace process  extremely difficult to build, and an eventual solution more  complex than in the past. The two channels of dialogues as a  prelude to negotiations link the governments of India and  Pakistan on the one hand and the Indian government and the  militants of the Valley on the other. In view of the emotional  overloading of the Kashmir issue in both Pakistan and India,  which makes it difficult for political leaderships to take  initiatives that could run counter to widely held popular  positions, unofficials have a role to play in bridging the gaps  between the two governments.    There are several channels of unofficial dialogues between  Pakistan and India but none whatsoever between Indians and the  militants of the Kashmir Valley. This is particularly  unfortunate. To be sure, individual Indians outside the  government, especially those working in the field of human  rights and civil liberties, travel to Srinagar and meet with  militant leaders or cadres individually or in small groups.  What does not happen is an open-ended dialogue between Indian  who can influence government policies and leaders of  representatives of the militants. The USIP provides an  opportunity once a year for several Indians to meet with a  couple or so of Kashmiris who are in contact with the militants  and can speak their minds with a certain credibility. The USIP  conference also provides Indians with an opportunity to meet a  couple of persons from Pakistan held Kashmir, and Pakistanis to  converse with Kashmiris from the Indian part of the State.  However, two meetings are nearly not enough to bind the  participants in silken bonds of trust and confidence so that  they can speak with openness and candour and do not have to  repeat the "national" scripts. Especially when the participants  change from one conference to the next. Only three of the  Indians who joined the 1994 dialogue had attended the dialogue  of the previous January. It was the same with participants from  Pakistan. But why must Indians depend on an American  institution to come face to face with spokesmen of the militants  in their own part of the State of Jammu and Kashmir which they  regard as an integral part of their country?    Indian academic and other bodies must be able to bring  together for a free exchange of views numbers [as published] of  unofficial Indians and representatives of militants in Kashmir.  If the militant bodies are in no mood to come to Delhi, a  dialogue can be organised in Kathmandu.    India and Pakistan cannot isolate themselves from the impact  of the end of apartheid in South Africa, the Middle East peace  process, the Anglo-Irish accord to resolve the 200 year-old  conflict over Northern Ireland. Ms. Benazir Bhutto could not  persuade the leaders of China to support the Kashmiri people's  right to self- determination. India may be able to "live with"  resolutions adopted at the UN or elsewhere criticising its human  rights record in Kashmir. How long can it be indifferent to the  status damage it suffers as a result of the continuing  bloodletting in Kashmir? How long will it take the rulers of  India to realise how the Kashmir conflict is gradually  militarising Indian polity and undermining Indian democracy?    The full-scale civil war in Afghanistan cautions external  powers like the United States against the breakdown of political  systems anywhere in South and Central Asia. Some militant  groups in Kashmir talk openly about the establishment of a  Caliphate spawning Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kashmir and the  Islamic republics of Central Asia. This Caliphate concept is  nourished by some of the fundamentalist groups fighting amongst  themselves in Afghanistan. At the Washington meeting on Kashmir,  the danger of reducing the State of Jammu and Kashmir to another  Afghanistan was brought to the notice of all participants. This  danger appears to be one of the factors that have prompted the  USIP to suggest a resolution of the Kashmir conflict within the  prevailing political framework in South Asia. India has a  window of opportunity to bring the conflict under control and  then translate it into a peace process. For this a number of  unilateral initiatives on the part of the prime minister should  be extremely effective.    A short ceasefire will not cost India a tuppence but may  gain  it a lot. The release of several hundred political prisoners  will be another similar gesture of peace. An envoy of the prime  minister could then conduct confidential negotiations with the  All Parties Huriyat Conference. To encourage a dialogue, the  Kashmir police could be given greater law and order  responsibility in areas where it can function effectively. At  another, simultaneous level the talks with the Pakistan  government need to be pursued with increasing seriousness of  purpose. The aim should be to conclude a basket of accords  easing the much-flawed relationship towards normalisation.</p>

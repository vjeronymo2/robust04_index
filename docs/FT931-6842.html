Serb commanders in Zvornik, eastern Bosnia, delayed the convoy, which makes a weekly trip to Sarajevo. In an unprecedented move, Serb forces insisted on searching the 60 lorries, said a UN spokesman. Part of the convoy yesterday remained in Zvornik, while 25 trucks returned to Belgrade. Meanwhile Serb military leaders softened resistance to the planned US air drop after the administration included Croat and Serb communities in the operation. But Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said he was worried Moslems would down one of the aircraft and blame it on Serbs to provoke US military intervention.

All three sides possess the means to down transport planes.'</p>

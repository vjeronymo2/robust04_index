			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Labour says tax debate gagged The Labour party yesterday accused the government of 'gagging' debate on new taxation measures, as the row over the parliamentary guillotine on the finance bill continued. Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary, said: 'The way the government has tabled this debate shows that they want to stifle debate on key tax issues.' Labour attacked the government for placing important issues at the end of each day's procedures. This means they are unlikely to be discussed before the guillotine falls. The row arose after the government's decision to put a strict limit on the time available for discussion of the finance bill. This is the first time since 1974 - other than before an election - that a guillotine has been used on the bill which implements the Budget. Sir John Cope, the paymaster-general, said the government had allowed 'generous' time for debate of the bill.</p>

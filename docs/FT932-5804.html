			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: Swapping foreign debt for nature - Madagascar and the WWF have developed a plan to save the island's unique flora The crustacean biologist ushered the two World Bank specialists into his office. They were there to discuss Madagascar's debt. The biologist spoke, the economists listened. Such are the anomalies in this Indian Ocean island that a scientist has become a key player in high finance. Paul Siegel, of the World Wide Fund for Nature, is helping to reduce significantly Madagascar's commercial debt - through a series of debt-for-nature swaps. One of the poorest countries is thus managing to counter intense pressure on its fragile and increasingly threatened environment. Madagascar, the fourth largest island in the world, is home to a host of unique flora and fauna. About 80 per cent of its plant species are found nowhere else on earth. It is proving a race against time. The island's fast-growing population of 12m people needs land for agriculture and trees for fuel and construction. Current rates of deforestation would leave forest on only the steepest slopes by 2020. Soil erosion is silting up rivers, over-grazing is extending the desert and recent years of drought have further compounded problems, particularly in the south. The WWF has chosen to invest in debt-for-nature swaps in Madagascar because of the close link between debt, poverty and environmental destruction. To service its international debt, the country has to earn foreign exchange through exports; such exports are largely agricultural, meaning undue pressure on the land. Since 1989, the WWF has bought Pounds 3m worth of Madagascar's commercial debt on the secondary market, at the knock-down price of about Pounds 1.5m. This year, the conservation organisation will buy another Pounds 2m of debt at a similar discount. Madagascar's outstanding commercial debt is estimated at about Pounds 59m, according to the World Bank, but only half is thought to be available for purchase on the secondary market because of the country's good reputation for repayment. That reputation extends to the details of the debt-for-nature swaps. The WWF is able to sell the debt back to the Malagasy government at 100 per cent of face value, and receives the equivalent - Pounds 3m so far  - in local currency. Often, developing countries operating debt-for-nature swaps will pay back only a proportion of the debt's face value, for example 75 per cent. In return for such good terms, the WWF agrees not to use any of the money for imports, thus saving precious foreign exchange. The WWF has used its debt-for-nature money to develop a new level of conservation managers locally. Working closely with the Department of Water and Forestry, the fund finances the recruitment, training and salaries of 'agents pour la protection de la nature', or nature protection agents. The APNs are recruited from local communities and help promote sustainable use of forestry resources, environmental education and conservation activities. Small projects are also being funded. These include reforestation, or tree nursery schemes and 'trade-offs', where village leaders protect a forest against fire or livestock in return for a school, clinic, or irrigation dam. The debt-for-nature project works because it benefits everyone, Siegel says. Aid donors like it since their money goes twice as far - every Dollars 1 donation buys Dollars 2 worth of conservation. Donations to the WWF have come from members as well as USAID, the US agency for international development. The WWF benefits because the Malagasy central bank repays its loan in a lump sum, which is then invested by the WWF and earns substantial interest payments - enabling what Siegel calls 'endowment funding' of projects. So far, interest payments alone have been large enough to finance almost all of the APN projects, thus significantly extending its life span. 'That's crucial to the project's success,' Siegel says. 'It takes a long time to grow a tree, and we now have a much more realistic timeframe to work in.' In the past, environmental projects have faltered as funds dried up after only a few years. The Malagasy government benefits because it not only reduces foreign debt, but encourages reinvestment in environment and development schemes. The success of endowment funding is encouraging other conservation groups to follow suit in the country. This year, Conservation International will purchase Dollars 5m worth (Pounds 3.2m) of debt to provide long-term financing for the protected area of Zahamena in the country's north east. The integrated conservation and development project is designed to encourage local participation in the management of the nature reserve and surrounding area. Missouri Botanical Gardens is, meanwhile, arranging to buy Dollars 1.5m of debt over a three-year period to finance research, training and administration at Tsimbazaza Botanical Park in the nation's capital, Antananarivo.</p>

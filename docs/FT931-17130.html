			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Washington defines water The US Food and Drug Administration ended the year by publishing its long-awaited rules for the labelling of bottled water, Nikki Tait reports from New York. Under the proposed new rules mineral water will be defined as bottled water with at least 250 parts per million in total dissolved solids, coming from a source 'tapped at one of more bore holes or springs, originating from a geologically and physically protected underground water source'. Spring water, meanwhile, is defined as bottled water obtained from an underground formation from which the water flows naturally to the surface - or would if it were not collected underground.</p>

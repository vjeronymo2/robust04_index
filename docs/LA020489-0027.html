			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SERIAL KILLER BUNDY'S EXECUTION AND DEATH PENALTY CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> My gratitude to Colman McCarthy ("Falsely Convicted but Truly Dead," Op-Ed  Page, Jan. 24)) for discussing the most unequivocal argument against the death  penalty -- the unfortunate execution of those wrongly convicted.  </P> <P> In the column he quotes Ernest van den Haag as saying that the 23 executions of  innocent people is "a very acceptable number." Why is it not acceptable for an  individual to kill an innocent person while the government is allowed to  perform the same tragic act time after time? The only acceptable number is  zero, and as long as the justice system is capable of error the death penalty  must be considered an immoral act.  </P> <P> The only successful argument for the death penalty is specific deterrence --  those executed will not kill again. The same can be accomplished, however, by  simply keeping these people locked up forever.  </P> <P> I don't want anyone to get the idea that I condone the acts of mass murderers  -- I feel that those with no possibility of rehabilitation should remain in  jail for life. I merely feel that only vengeance, not justice, is served by  execution, and that we cannot allow this unjust system to endure.  </P> <P> DAVID HOLLAND  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P></p>

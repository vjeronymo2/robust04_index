			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii said Friday [25 February] he does not plan to discuss  specific prospects for reducing Japan's current account surplus  when he meets U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen this weekend  at a conference in Germany.    The government's forecast for the surplus, as a percentage  of  gross domestic product, "is not something to discuss" with  Bentsen or at Saturday's meeting in Frankfurt of finance leaders  from the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial nations, Fujii  told reporters after a morning cabinet meeting.    Fujii said he expects to meet his U.S. counterpart  "face-to-face" before the multilateral meeting and will explain  the recent 15.25 trillion yen economic-stimulus package, which  includes 6 trillion yen in tax cuts. Deregulation and measures  such as the tax cuts to stimulate domestic demand "will have a  great significance" in the medium term to reduce Japan's  surpluses, he said.    Some government and ruling coalition leaders have recently  hinted that the surplus forecasts could be used as "effort  targets" in Japan-U.S. trade talks, which bogged down over  targets to measure progress in opening Japan's markets.    Instead, Fujii said he plans to explain the stimulus plan to  Bentsen.    "If there is a misunderstanding" that the 6 trillion yen tax  cuts are a one-time measure, Fujii said, he would try to explain  that the cuts are to be part of a full-fledged tax reform.    Fujii noted that the coalition agreed, and the cabinet  endorsed, a plan to enact balanced tax reform by the year's end  that will reduce the burden of direct levies such as incomes  taxes and increase indirect taxes such as the consumption tax.    "As fellow human beings, if we meet face-to-face, I think I  can get him to understand how we feel," he said. He said he has  been in contact with Bentsen on "various matters" but declined  to elaborate.    Asked how much understanding he could expect from his U.S.  counterpart with reports circulating that Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa plans to reshuffle the cabinet, Fujii said he  would ask Bentsen to trust him as finance minister.    Fujii said the bilateral meeting might take place Saturday  morning before the G-7 talks begin, adding that it would be  "rude" to ask Bentsen to meet the night before.    Asked about the high yen, Fujii repeated that G-7 finance  ministers and central bankers have agreed that rapid currency  fluctuations are undesirable and that foreign exchange rates  should reflect economic fundamentals. It is their "common  understanding" that drastic swings in a single nation's currency  rate are undesirable not only for that country but for the world  economy, he said.    The major topic of the G-7 talks will be aid to Russia, with  discussions to include conditions for disbursement of  multilateral aid, he said. Large chunks of already-approved aid  funds have been held up over Moscow's political and economic  turmoil.    Russian representatives are to meet with G-7 finance  officials after the G-7 talks.</p>

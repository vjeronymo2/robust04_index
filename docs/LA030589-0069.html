			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLEDGING ALLEGIANCE TO ONE NATION, DIVIDED BY TWO RELIGIOUS FACTIONS  </P> <P> Americans have been urged repeatedly in recent months to make this, using  President Bush's words, "a kinder and gentler nation." We have been asked to  show compassion to our enemies, to seek common ground and social kindness and  to engage in activities that enrich and ennoble us all.  </P> <P> Throughout much of our nation's history religious conviction supplied the  muscle necessary to put such fine admonitions into practice. Utilitarian  self-interest was constrained, as Alexis de Tocqueville observed on his visit  to the United States in the 1830s, by a common tradition of biblical virtue and  by extensive participation in voluntary religious organizations. Whether they  belonged to one faith or another, believers found much on which to agree. As  recently as the early 1960s, when Will Herberg published his widely read book  "Protestant, Catholic, Jew: An Essay in American Religious Sociology,"  America's several faiths seemed to provide a common identity and shared  assumptions about our nation's calling.  </P> <P> Today American religion is less a source of kindness and gentleness -- or even  gentility -- than it is a war zone of antagonism. Rather than infusing public  debate with harmony and reconciliation, it presents an image of tension and  conflict. The one public theology Tocqueville saw uniting us has been torn  asunder by two competing factions:  </P> <P>  -- A conservative public theology champions strong traditional morality,  strong national defenses and a heady brew of free enterprise. It stakes its  authority in a literal interpretation of the Bible and claims to return the  nation to biblical ideals on which it was founded.  </P> <P>  -- A liberal public theology argues for a more relativistic code of personal  morality, a cooperative multilateral spirit in foreign relations and strong  government initiatives capable of infusing norms of social justice into the  capitalist mind. It also stakes its authority on biblical tradition, but often  interprets this legacy as cultural wisdom rather than divine revelation.  </P> <P> Both sides believe deeply that religious values must be heard in the public  square. They hold implicitly that the United States must be godly -- or at  least good -- if it is to remain great. They take their cues from religious  sentiments expressed in the Declaration of Independence and printed on U.S.  currency. They hold strongly that America is, as we say when we recite the  Pledge of Allegiance, "under God." But the two place emphasis on different  understandings of what it means to be a nation under God. Indeed, the two  positions can be summarized with reference to different phrases in the Pledge  of Allegiance itself.  </P> <P> Advocates of a conservative public theology stress the fact that the United  States is "one nation" under God. Translated: We are unique, a special nation,  privileged by having been chosen of God, unlike any other nation in the world.  Our forebears founded the nation on biblical concepts. They believed we were a  covenant people, the New Israel. Even to this day, conservative religionists  argue, the United States has a special mission to fulfill for God. It is a  mission of hope for the Free World, of opposition to atheistic communism, of  presenting an image of biblical morality to the world. To be true to our  calling, they argue, we must unite once again around these collective ideals.  </P> <P> The liberal public theology takes its cue from the phrase "with liberty and  justice for all." Liberty means greater tolerance and diversity. Justice means  a driving concern for minorities and the poor. In this view, America has a  special role to play in the world mainly because of its power, not because of a  special divine calling. As long as Americans enjoy material success and  military power, they must use it for the common good of the world. Liberal  religionists agree that America must be a lamp shining in darkness. But the  glow of this light must shine especially on deeds of mercy toward the poor and  of justice for the oppressed.  </P> <P> How deep is this division? According to a Gallup survey, the American public  divides itself almost evenly between religious conservatism and religious  liberalism. About 40% put themselves in each camp when asked about their  religious beliefs. At the extremes, about 20% say they are either very liberal  or very conservative religiously. The same study showed that a majority of the  public regards the conflict between religious conservatives and liberals as an  area of serious tension. Conservatives described liberals as unloving, shallow  and unsaved. Liberals characterized conservatives as rigid, narrow-minded and  fanatical. And that survey was several years ago.  </P> <P> Newer evidence shows that this division in orientation corresponds closely to  differences of opinion on a wide range of religious beliefs and social issues  -- from views of the Bible to opinions about abortion or positions on welfare  spending. It is aggravated, not lessened, by greater contact with the other  side and by greater knowledge about the other side. And it cuts through the  middle of all the major faiths and denominations. Thus, conservative  Methodists, for instance, often feel they have more in common with conservative  Catholics or conservative Baptists than they do with liberal Methodists.  </P> <P> In short, the two varieties of public theology that offer competing definitions  of what it means to be a kind and gentle nation have cast their shadow broadly  on the American people. Antagonism between religious liberals and religious  conservatives comes not only from the voices of the Rev. Jerry Falwell and  Norman Lear or from the bureau chiefs of the National Council of Churches and  the National Assn. of Evangelicals. It gains expression in local pulpits and  prayer fellowships. And it has begin to register in public-opinion polls.  </P> <P> We have, of course, experienced religious conflict many times in U.S. history.  But the current division is particularly deep. The abortion debate has been an  especially serious source of misgiving. Feminism, prayer in public schools,  pornography, AIDS and the sex scandals of highly visible TV evangelists have  all added fuel to the flames of religious controversy. Genuine differences of  theological interpretation and moral conviction are at issue. But differences  in educational levels and life styles add to the level of misunderstanding.  </P> <P> The conflict is largely a product of the turbulent quarter century we have  experienced as a nation since the early 1960s. The civil-rights movement drew  some of the initial lines still dividing religious liberals from religious  conservatives. The Vietnam War reinforced those initial differences. In both  instances, these were events that challenged longstanding assumptions about the  impact of our values on our nation's behavior. Increasingly, religious leaders  questioned whether good values alone would lead to good behavior. And as they  did, some -- those who were to be called liberals -- began to emphasize the  behavior of direct action while others -- conservatives -- argued for purity of  values.  </P> <P> During the 1970s, two other developments added to the growing cleavage between  religious liberals and conservatives. One was the rapid growth in religious  special-interest groups. Ethnic and racial caucuses in the major denominations,  special organizations for homosexuals and an increasingly wide array of  conservative groups -- Presbyterian Laymen, the Creation Research Society,  Moral Majority -- all came into being to pressure their denominations and the  public at large in one direction or another.  </P> <P> The other development was a marked erosion in the significance of traditional  denominational boundaries and of the barriers between Protestants and Catholics  and between Christians and Jews. The very reduction of these divisions made it  easier for leaders on the left and on the right to mobilize large  constituencies.  </P> <P> The 1980s has been a decade of nearly continuous battle between these religious  constituencies. Public officials have often courted one side or the other.  Preachers have become more active politically. And in the process much of the  latent conflict between evangelicals and fundamentalists on the one hand and  liberals and secularists on the other has become painfully evident.  </P> <P> What then are the implications? For the 10% to 20% of the public that has  become indifferent to religion, the most likely conclusion is to say a plague  on both your houses. Neither side will inspire conviction as long as it is at  the other's throat.  </P> <P> For those who still care about our nation's churches, parishes, synagogues and  fellowship halls, the gravity of the situation needs to be recognized. Priority  must be given to counsels of reconciliation. The common ground must indeed be  sought. And within this common ground, genuine diversity must be encouraged.  For, as Jefferson recognized, pluralism can only strengthen our nation, but  polarization always weakens it.  </P></p>

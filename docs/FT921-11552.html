			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Fuel cells get a green light A PORTABLE fuel cell, weighing just 62 pounds, could provide enough electricity to power the lights for an outside video recording or throw light on a game of tennis. Developed in Japan by Sanyo electric, the cell produces up to 250 watts of electricity directly from a chemical reaction. The materials used are phosphoric acid and a hydrogen-absorbing metal. Only water vapor is released outside the case, says Sanyo, making the fuel cell environmentally sound. Sanyo is now concentrating on developing 2kW and 3kW models for use in home power supplies.

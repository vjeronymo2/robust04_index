			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Barco rises 34% on positive US demand NET PROFITS at Barco, the Belgian electronics group, increased by 34 per cent in the first half of 1993 to BFr373m (Dollars 10.9m) from BFr279m. Current profit after tax rose from BFr436m - restated to take account of new valuation rules - to BFr535m on sales of BFr5.12bn against BFr4.94bn. Sales outside the EC make up 41 per cent of total turnover, compared with 36 per cent in the first half of 1992. The group said it expected the trend towards better results to continue in the second half, in spite of the fact that Europe is suffering from recession. 'A slight recovery of the economy can, as in the US, bring with it a significant increase in turnover,' the company said yesterday. Barco said that demand for its products remained positive in the US, which accounts for 27.5 per cent of the turnover in the group's dominant division, manufacturing video display units and projection systems. Consolidation of goodwill reduced current profits by BFr162m, compared with a reduction of BFr156m last year, but current cash flow rose from BFr963m to BFr1.03bn. Almanij, the Belgian financial holding company, will pay a net interim dividend of BFr180 per share at the end of October. The company is extending this financial year to 18 months to bring its accounts in line with those of Kredietbank, the Belgian bank in which it has a substantial stake. In the 12 months to June 30, the group made a profit of BFr1.87bn, against BFr1.71bn in the equivalent period. Kredietbank will announce its interim results tomorrow. The European Commission said it had cleared the purchase by Alcatel Cable of the submarine telecommunications systems and satellite television antenna business of the UK's Northern Telecom Europe Ltd a unit of Northern Telecom of Canada, Reuter reports from Brussels.</p>

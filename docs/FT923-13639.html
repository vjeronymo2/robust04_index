			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Markets: Electricity profits, a highly charged question - The Bottom Line THURSDAY was the last day of a hard results season for the electricity industry. The 12 regional companies, privatised a year ago, found themselves alternately apologising for their profits and proving they could be sustained. A chorus led by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, and Frank Dobson, the Labour energy spokesman, warned that their profit increases - which averaged around 49 per cent - were higher than expected. Top of the list was Norweb, with a 126 per cent increase against last year's pro forma profit, followed by Manweb at 75 per cent and Southern at 57 per cent. Last came Yorkshire with a 20.9 per cent increase and South Wales with a 28.3 per cent rise. Any companies found overcharging customers, they were warned, will face regulatory thumbscrews when the industry watchdog Offer reviews the formulae that govern how much they can increase their prices in 1994. Meanwhile, City analysts wondered how the companies could sustain this year's high dividend increases - averaging 14.5 per cent - in the long term. Even if the regulator is not too hard on them, the chances the companies will ever make windfall profits by increasing prices is slim. Given that the outlook for electricity sales growth is modest - about 1 per cent next year - they are left with little opportunity to boost growth other than cost-cutting, although for the next year or two their figures will improve as exceptional charges disappear and interest charges fall. The non-core businesses - shops and contracting - are unlikely to do much in the foreseeable future except turn small losses to break-even or small profits. The underlying increase in the electricity companies profits, moreover, are much less than the figures suggested. That is because the companies undercharged customers in the year to March 1991, and recouped the loss by charging more in the year to March 1992. If this effect is stripped out, the underlying rise in profits was between 15 and 20 per cent, rather than 40 per cent. These figures show that most companies made most of their extra profit by increasing prices and cutting costs for the transmission of electricity across their wires. Profits in the supply business (buying and selling electricity on the wholesale market) fell, as costs rose sharply. Next year, profits from distribution (the business of selling electricity from the main network into customers' premises) will probably fall, because price rises this April were modest. Supply should do a little better, as exceptional costs for running the national grid disappear. Most analysts expect an overall profit increase of 10 to 12 per cent with similar dividend growth in the years up to the regulatory review in 1994. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, last week gave investors a hint of what they should look for beyond that date. He seemed to suggest that companies which have cut costs, and prices, and improved customer service face lower regulatory risk. Cost-cutting is also one of the few ways they can improve underlying profits. Manweb, which cut 18 per cent of its workforce and controllable costs by about Pounds 10m, must be near the top of the list. followed by South Wales and Eastern. South Wales and Seeboard promised to hand back cash to customers. This looks good, but there has been no sign yet that companies such as Yorkshire which have charged customers as much as they can will be penalised. Nor is it clear what the regulator will make of recent price changes. Eastern, for instance, has the lowest price, but the highest increase. South Wales, meanwhile, has the highest price, but a below average increase.</p>

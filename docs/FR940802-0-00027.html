			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most of the congressional debate focused on the various detailed requirements of section 211(k) such as the content requirements of section 211(k)(2), and the emissions standards of section 211(k)(3). There was relatively little debate or discussion concerning the scope of EPA's general authority in section 211(k)(1). However, there are indications that this was considered a reservoir of broad, general authority. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There was no indication that section 211(k)(1) did not mean what its plain language indicates_that Congress provided EPA with broad, general authority to establish the requirements for reformulated gasoline, including requirements that tend to optimize the energy and other benefits obtained by the emission reductions requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> From the debate on Conference Committee bill: 1 Leg. Hist. at 855&hyph;6 (Sen. Durenberger noted that the performance standards and the formula were minimum requirements, and EPA had authority to require greater emissions reductions if appropriate); 1 Leg. Hist. at 968&hyph;69 (colloquy between Sen. Durenberger and Sen. Baucus on same point); 1 Leg. Hist. at 1219 (Rep. Sharp discusses the threat that EPA could exercise its authority to reinstate a program akin to the 1970's oil price and allocation controls); 1 Leg. Hist. at 128&hyph;9 (Rep. Bliley) (``It is vital that [section 211(k)(1)] be viewed as residual authority to modify the more specific requirements throughout.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.''). From the debate on the Senate bill: 4 Leg. Hist. at 5052&hyph;3 (Sen. Symms recognized that the bill reported out of the Committee on Environment and Public Works provided EPA broad, general authority when he noted that ``the bill directs the Administrator .&blank;.&blank;. to promulgate regulations establishing specifications for fuel quality. This, in essence, would give the Administrator the authority to mandate specific fuel formulations.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's interpretation of its authority under section 211(k)(1) is a reasonable interpretation based on the plain language of the provision. The legislative history supports this interpretation and fails to show a contrary intent. The changes made in the reformulated gasoline provisions, and textual changes made in the two houses and in conference indicate an intent to broaden EPA's general authority. The floor debates support this and fail to show a contrary intent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's exercise of authority under section 211(k)(1) also helps to obtain the important benefits identified by Congress for reformulated gasoline. The legislative history makes it clear that in addition to emissions reductions, Congress expected that reformulated gasoline would benefit the nation by obtaining various energy and other benefits from the expanded use of oxygenates, including specifically the benefits from using renewable oxygenates like ethanol and ETBE. EPA's interpretation and this rule are fully consistent with this Congressional goal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress established a complex statutory structure to ensure achievement of these various goals while retaining an appropriate degree of refiner flexibility. EPA's final rule is carefully designed with refiner flexibility in mind, and draws an appropriate balance between obtaining the benefits from using renewable oxygenates and retaining refiner flexibility. For example, the rule establishes as close to a performance standard as is currently possible, does not mandate one specific fuel or fuel additive, allows for a phase-in over two years to minimize disruption, allows averaging over a long time period, and allows for generation, use and trading of credits to show compliance. It also is carefully designed to minimize any adverse environmental impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's interpretation of its authority is consistent with the plain language of the statute and its legislative history, and furthers the goals identified by Congress for this program. As such it is a lawful exercise of agency authority under section 211(k).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Program Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The renewable oxygenate requirement is one component of the reformulated gasoline program. It does not alter the emission performance standards or other provisions for the reformulated gasoline program contained in the final rule for reformulated gasoline (See 59 FR 7716; February 16, 1994). In addition, it does not mandate the use of any particular oxygenate, but rather ensures a specified minimum use of a range of oxygenates derived from renewable resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As mentioned previously, EPA is requiring that 30 percent of the required 2.0 weight percent oxygen content of all reformulated gasoline be produced using renewable oxygenates. Renewable oxygenates must meet two criteria for them to be used to comply with the requirements of the program. First, they must be produced from non-fossil fuel feedstocks (i.e., other than petroleum, natural gas, coal, or peat), or their oxygen content must derive from oxygenates produced from such feedstocks, as described more fully in section III.C.1 of this notice. Second, to be considered ``renewable'' when blended into VOC-controlled RFG, the oxygenate must not cause commingling-related increases in fuel volatility (i.e., the oxygenate must have a linear vapor pressure blending curve). In addition to the requirements of this program, renewable oxygenates must also be approved for use in gasoline in keeping with the provisions of section 211(f) of the Act, and must be approved for use in reformulated gasoline (i.e., certifiable under either the Simple or Complex Model, as discussed in the final rule for the RFG program).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The oxygenates which are expected to meet these requirements, at least in the near term include: (1) Any alcohols derived from biomass or waste products other than untransformed fossil fuels, except when used in RFG designated as ``VOC-controlled,'' and (2) all approved ethers produced from renewable feedstocks, when used in either VOC-controlled or non-VOC-controlled RFG. EPA recognizes that some non-ether oxygenates, including some alcohols, may not cause commingling-related increases in fuel volatility. Upon submittal of sufficient data demonstrating that addition of a non-ether renewable oxygenate does not cause a nonlinear increase in RVP, the Administrator may permit the oxygenate in question to receive credit under today's renewable oxygenate program when blended into VOC-controlled RFG. However, methanol and ethanol will not be granted such permission, since the nonlinearity of their effect on RVP is well-established at the present time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The program will be phased in over the course of two years. Fifteen percent of the minimum 2.0 weight percent oxygen content of reformulated gasoline is required in the form of renewable oxygenates, as defined above, from December 1, 1994 through December 31, 1995 (hereafter referred to as the ``first year of the program''). Thirty percent of the minimum oxygen content in reformulated gasoline is required to be from renewable oxygenates in 1996 and each year thereafter. As a result, on average reformulated gasoline will be required to have at least 0.30 weight percent oxygen content (15 percent of 2.0 weight percent) provided by renewable oxygenates in the first year of the program and 0.60 weight percent oxygen content provided by renewable oxygenates in subsequent years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A program phase-in is necessary because the reformulated gasoline program takes effect at refineries December 1, 1994. As discussed more fully in section III.F of this notice, EPA is concerned that insufficient time is available for ethanol producers to adjust their production schedules, for ether suppliers to set up contracts for the purchase of renewable alcohols, for fuel producers to obtain supplies of renewable oxygenates for addition at the refinery or for blending with refinery-produced reformulated blendstock for oxygenate blending (RBOB), and for terminal operators to build and obtain permits for sufficient ethanol and ether storage and blending facilities in order to meet the full 30 percent requirement in 1995. Reformulated gasoline producers may also have to adjust their gasoline production plans to accommodate a different mix of oxygenates than they might have used in the absence of today's rule. The phase-in addresses these leadtime concerns, ensures a more orderly startup of the program, and minimizes the risk of any market disruptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

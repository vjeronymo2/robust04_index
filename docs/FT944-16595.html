			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Insurers on bid alert Composites surged ahead on a mixture of takeover rumours mainly prompted by talk that Allianz, the German insurance group, may sell its Cornhill subsidiary and launch a bid for another UK concern. Commercial Union settled 15 ahead at 545p, General Accident 21 to 584p, Guardian 10 1/2 to 195 1/2 p and Sun Alliance 7 1/2 to 331 1/2 p. Royals added 5 at 294p. Legal &amp; General, viewed as a prime bid target in life/general insurers, ran up 11 to 456p. Prudential moved up 9 to 308p. Of the smaller stocks United Friendly added 2 at 505p, Britannic 10 to 406p and Refuge 8 to 279p. Aggressive buying of the traded options was said to have been the catalyst for a 21 surge in Lloyds Abbey Life to 348p.</p>

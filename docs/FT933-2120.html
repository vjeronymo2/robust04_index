			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Rechem fined on chemical disposal RECHEM International, the waste disposal company owned by Shanks and McEwan, was yesterday fined Pounds 22,500 and ordered to pay costs of Pounds 100,000 after admitting discharging dangerous chemicals into a main sewer near its incineration plant at Pontypool, Gwent. In the four-week trial at Newport Crown Court Rechem at first denied three charges but then last Tuesday admitted them. It also admitted one charge of breaching conditions of its licence to discharge into the sewer and was formerly cleared of three similar charges. Mr Ian Brown, for Rechem, said after the hearing that the company had only admitted the charges because it wanted to appeal against the judge's interpretations of the law.</p>

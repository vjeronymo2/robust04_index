			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: UK markets It took expectations of strong earnings growth and lower gilt yields to drive UK equities to their recent peaks. Now these assumptions have been called into question on both fronts. Disappointing results from English China Clays and British Aerospace suggest earnings hopes have run ahead of reality, while bond markets in the UK and the US are suffering a bout of inflation jitters. It is dangerous to read too much into one month's price data, but the risk to the virtuous circle is particularly acute in the UK. If world bond markets lose their nerve, the government's deficit will become much harder to finance. Gilt market weakness would be quickly transmitted to equities as well as the exchange rate. One must hope this morning's PSBR number is not another nasty surprise.</p>

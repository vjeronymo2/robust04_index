President Callejas met yesterday with Discua, with whom he  discussed the report, but did not give any details of the  content of their discussion.    Callejas stated that he has been a loyal advocate of human  rights in Honduras and said that the report should help  reconcile Hondurans, because it lacks legal validity to identify  any culprits.    Callejas said the document contains the facts, but attention  must be given to the state's decisions in this regard, such as  the court trials, the decisions issued, and the amnesties  granted, which protect the rights of many people who have been  identified as presumed culprits.    Callejas reiterated that the report should not be used to  generate hatred and resentment among Hondurans or divisions. He  said: "Rather, it should be the basis for the unification of  Hondurans."    Callejas expressed his concern over certain statements that  have been made in various media. According to Callejas, these  statements seek to assign responsibilities based on assumptions,  which is the sole responsibility of the courts.    Asked about if this was going to be a "let us start anew"  incident, Callejas said that above all justice must prevail, but  what is important is that everything leads to a national  reconciliation.    Regarding the amnesties granted by his and Jose Azcona's  government, Callejas clarified that they cover some of the  crimes involving individuals that were included in the report.  The rest will be up to the courts to decide but based on  factual and concrete evidence.    Although Callejas supports the idea that justice must  prevail, he believes that Hondurans should not be divided and  that the report should seek mainly to reunify Hondurans.    Callejas believes that one cannot judge based on simple  assumptions, but the courts should always have the last word.  <H5>  Discua Maintains Firm Position </H5>   When asked whether Discua's position could be jeopardized by  the developments and certain problems within the armed  institution, Callejas said he is unaware of such an extreme  situation, adding "there has been no action shedding doubt on  the legitimacy of the current Armed Forces commander."    Callejas said that it is absolutely illegal to call for  Discua's temporary suspension from his post as requested by the  Committee of Relatives of Missing Detainees in Honduras  (Cofadeh).    The president added that this organization is not even close  to being a court and that the Constitution of the Republic and  other laws establish the procedure that should be followed in  this case.    Callejas said that it is difficult for a request of this  nature to prosper at the National Congress, adding that leaders  of this branch of state already issued their opinions about this  issue.  <H5>  Oversight Commission </H5>   The Executive Branch Oversight Commission has yet to issue  its report, because it is still investigating the huge  contraband discovered in San Pedro Sula.    Callejas said that the report will be revealed as soon as  the  investigations are concluded. The president added that he is  awaiting a message in this regard from commission coordinator  Israel Gonzales.</p>

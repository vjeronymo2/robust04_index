Chairman and Chief Executive Robert M. Rosenberg said in a  news release that the offer by D D Acquisition Corp. "does not reflect the  maximum value achievable" for stockholders and that the Massachusetts-based  chain's advisers are exploring alternatives, including remaining independent or  a possible sale. D D Acquisition is a partnership between Cara Operations Ltd.,  a restaurant franchise company, and Kingsbridge Capital Group, the merchant  banking arm of Toronto investor George Mann's Unicorp Canada Corp.  </P></p>

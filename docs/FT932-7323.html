			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Chinese police fire tear gas at Tibetan protest CHINESE POLICE yesterday fired rounds of tear gas for two hours to quell protests by several thousand people in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital. It was not known whether there were casualties or how many people had been arrested. Westerners were confined to their hotels and police were patrolling the streets in strength last night. A protest by about 800 people, apparently against price rises, began peacefully during the morning outside a main government building. The demonstrators initially met no response from police, but were eventually moved on. During the evening, the crowd swelled to between 1,000 and 4,000 and attacked shops, almost certainly those run by Chinese, said Mr Robbie Barnett, director of the London-based Tibet Information Network. An influx of Chinese traders into Lhasa has aroused enmity among Tibetans. Reuters news agency, quoting travellers in Lhasa, said protesters were throwing rocks at the police headquarters and chanted slogans calling for Tibetan independence. Public demonstrations of Tibetan hostility to Chinese rule are rare because of tight control by the authorities. The protests came the day after the 42nd anniversary of the surrender document being signed following China's 1951 invasion. A dozen senior European diplomats are due to produce a report on human rights in Tibet after a week-long visit which ended on Sunday. They had abandoned plans to hold a dinner for their hosts because of continuing arrests of Tibetan dissidents.</p>

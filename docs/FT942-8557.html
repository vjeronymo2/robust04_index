			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Crimea backs away from showdown Crimea's parliament yesterday backed away from a vote on separating from Ukraine and reuniting with Russia in the face of threats from the central government and rumours of a troop build-up on the Black Sea peninsula, AP reports from Kiev. 'It is a very hard moment for Crimea,' said Crimean President Yuri Meshkov. 'We are being humiliated and forced to tolerate illegal, unconstitutional actions,' he said, in reference to more warnings from Kiev.</p>

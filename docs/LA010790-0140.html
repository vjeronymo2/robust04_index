			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP FACES: 'CITY BOY' IAN HUNTER RETURNS TO HIS ROOTS  </P> <P> Back in the early '80s, Ian Hunter was more like landed gentry than the  street-rocker he had been in his younger days. He was living in the country in  Upstate New York, breeding German shepherds -- and watching his music go down  the tubes.  </P> <P> "I just don't think there's any energy in the air. It must be in the air," said  the veteran rocker, whose erratic solo career has yet to eclipse his tenure  with the storied British band Mott the Hoople. "In the city there's more energy  in the air. See, when I was in Mott I'd always written the songs in a little  apartment in London, and it just seems to work better. I moved into Manhattan  around '86, and then I wrote 'Big Time,' and I thought, 'Well, that's the first  decent song that I can put on a record.' "  </P> <P> Hunter's urban renewal plan has led to his re-teaming with his longtime  sidekick, guitarist Mick Ronson, and to their record deal with PolyGram, which  recently released their album "Y U I Orta" -- Hunter's first record in six  years. Perhaps more important, it revived the spirit of this classic rock 'n'  roller.  </P> <P> With his red ringlets and ever-present shades, the Englishman cut a Dickensian  figure as he led the star-crossed Mott the Hoople through the  late-'60s/early-'70s rock crusades.  </P> <P> The band, cynical and softhearted, hard-bitten and romantic, supplied  much-needed urgency and challenge to a largely sterile scene. In the personnel  department, its internal workings were a study in contradictions, a prototype  for the conflicting forces and thrilling instability that would later make  bands like the Clash, the Replacements and Guns N' Roses so fascinating.  </P> <P> In the end, Mott ended up with the respect of the punk generation that rejected  so many of the group's contemporaries.  </P> <P> "They were all-encompassing," said Hunter, reflecting on his old band's appeal.  "They had their heavy-metal side, what's called heavy metal now. We never  called it that then. They had their kind of glam side and they had their punk  side. If you listen to 'Brain Capers,' if you listen to 'Moon Upstairs,' it's  kinda like listening to the Pistols before it ever happened.  </P> <P> "We were genuine. I knew what I was talking about when I did lyrics 'cause I'd  been in the factories. I was straight out of 'em. Had a lot to talk about. Mick  Ralphs was a tasty guitar player at a time when there weren't too many tasty  guitar players around.  </P> <P> "It was a combination of assets. I don't think as a band it was that great  musically. It just seemed to have a lot of things going for it."  </P> <P> More than 20 years after Mott's origins, Hunter is more sure than ever about  what he's doing -- "Especially if people keep on churning out the crap they're  churning out. I mean, one of the reasons I came back was 'cause I lay on the  bed and watched MTV and moaned at everything I saw, 'til my wife turned around  and said, 'Well why don't you go out and do something about it instead of just  moaning?'  </P> <P> "I mean, there's nothin' out there like me. Maybe there shouldn't be, but I  just feel there should be." RICHARD CROMELIN  </P></p>

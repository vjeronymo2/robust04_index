			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: Sony breaks silence on Mini Disc SONY, the Japanese electronics group, is gearing up its marketing and publicity campaign for the introduction of its Mini Disc, an 8cm recordable compact disc which it hopes will capture the portable music market, valued at well over Dollars 10bn. After a prolonged silence, which aroused speculation that the Mini Disc was facing technical difficulties, Sony has recently been demonstrating its product throughout world markets. It wants to dispel ideas that Mini Disc is being overshadowed by a rival product, the digital compact cassette (DCC), to be launched by Philips later this year. 'Product development is progressing on schedule,' Sony said at a Europe-wide demonstration in Salzburg this week. 'We now have the facts and can start talking.' A crucial technology which Sony demonstrated at Salzburg was the recording capability of Mini Disc, which had been of particular interest among industry-watchers. Prototype models of the Mini Disc player shown included a gold radio cassette boom box model, a lightweight playback-only Mini Disc Walkman, and a slightly heavier recordable Walkman. Sony said the hardware, planned for introduction in Europe by Christmas, would be priced at below DM1,000 (Dollars 625) for playback-only models, and 25 per cent more for a portable record/playback unit. It plans to ship 1m hardware units in the first year of production, with 250,000 allotted for Europe. Pre-recorded discs, of which there will be an initial 300 titles, are expected to cost about the same price as Compact Discs, while blank discs will be priced at around DM15. Three of Sony's own production facilities in Japan, the US and Europe are ready to produce a total of 1.5m discs worldwide within the year. Breaking the silence about the Mini Disc should go some way in dispelling rumours that Sony's new product was plagued by a difficult technology, and a format that was too different and too small to appeal to either consumers or retailers. The group has addressed the problem of the size - which would have forced retailers to invest in completely new racks for display - by fitting the 7cm by 8cm discs into a case as big as, and shaped like, a cassette tape case. However, Sony, whose Mini Disc will be competing with DCC, a digital audio cassette to be launched by Philips and its licensees, still has some catching up to do in marketing and publicity. Its Dutch rival, which has shown a previously-unknown zeal for marketing the product, has already won widespread industry support from hardware manufacturers and recording companies. Sony, by contrast, has lagged behind Philips in winning industry support. There have been signs of resistance within the software industry to a product that they worry could kill CD sales. Recording companies to have signed up to release music on Mini Disc format include Sony Music Entertainment and EMI. Negotiations are still continuing with Warner Music Group, a division of Time Warner. Polygram, which is 80 per cent-owned by Philips, has no plans yet to release on Mini Disc. Sony, which has been set back recently, first with the failure of Betacom, its VCR format, and then with digital audio tape, is nevertheless confident that consumers, if not record companies, will vote for its technology. Sony believes the main reason cassette tape sales have fallen is because of their lack of random access, which Mini Disc has but DCC, being a tape, does not. 'DCC is not the right product to address the demands of consumers,' it says. And once consumers show their preference for Mini Disc, record companies will not be able to dictate what medium their artists record on.</p>

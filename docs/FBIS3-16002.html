It Can Only Pay in  Property"]    [Text] Yesterday's talks in Moscow on clearing the debts  for deliveries of Russian gas to Ukraine to the tune of 1.5  trillion rubles ended in the signing of a protocol defining the  ways of debt settlement.    Ukraine is supposed to pay nearly half of the entire debt in  money; in payment for the remaining part, Gazprom will receive a  share in the authorized stocks of the gas transportation  infrastructure enterprises (51 percent) and in a number of  factories in which Gazprom is interested (51 percent). The  facilities in question are in particular the export gas pipeline  to Europe, subterranean storage tanks on the territory of  Ukraine, and the Odessa port factory. The Ukrainian side made  some concessions, agreeing to hand over property to clear off  the already amassed debts rather than pay for future deliveries  of gas, something with which Gazprom categorically disagreed.    The question of transfer of property to Gazprom is supposed  to be considered by the Ukrainian side within a week. No  deadlines on the payment of monetary debts was set, although the  process of payment of the monetary debt is likely to be one of  the main subjects of another meeting between the sides on 10  April to discuss the progress of implementation of the March  protocol provisions.    Ukraine has no money, and its only real asset is property  accumulated in the past years. Gazprom can therefore only hope  for the material source of debt settlement which, however, can  be cut off at any moment under pressure from nationalist forces.    A high-ranking Gazprom official said that deliveries of gas  to Ukraine resumed in the previous amounts right at the  completion of yesterday's negotiations.</p>

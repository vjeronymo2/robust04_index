			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS ET CETERA: HAWAII SHOCKS 14TH-RANKED SDSU WOMEN  </P> <P> Shooting just 28.2% in the second half, the 14th-ranked San Diego State women's  basketball team was upset by Hawaii, 73-60, Wednesday night at Peterson Gym.  </P> <P> The loss stopped a 9-game home winning streak for the Aztecs, who fell into a  third-place tie at 5-2 with Nevada-Las Vegas in the Big West Conference. Hawaii  (8-4, 4-1) moved into second place behind Long Beach State.  </P> <P> "This is our biggest win ever," Hawaii Coach Vince Goo said. "This is the  highest-ranking team we've ever beaten. It was a great, great team effort."  </P> <P> Playing its eighth game of a 9-game trip, Hawaii rebounded from a 35-30  halftime deficit. Tondi Redden made a 3-point shot with 11:50 to play to put  Hawaii ahead to stay, 46-43. Hawaii then outscored SDSU, 30-14, the rest of the  way.  </P> <P> San Diego State played without its second-leading scorer, Julie Evans, a  starting guard who has the flu, and starting forward Stefanie Massie, who also  was ill.  </P> <P> Chana Perry had 27 points and 16 rebounds for SDSU, and Crystal Lee added 11  points.  </P> <P> Judy Mosley led Hawaii with 24 points, Ayesha Brooks had 21 and Redden 14.  </P> <P> SOCKERS  </P> <P> The Sockers, who are looking for a defender to replace recently retired Gary  Etherington, may have found one in John Stollmeyer, an All-Star for the  Cleveland Force last season.  </P> <P> Stollmeyer, 25, is currently playing with the U.S. National Team. He told  Socker Coach Ron Newman earlier this week that he was interested in joining the  team.  </P> <P> "He's interested in us, and we're interested in him," Newman said. "If  something could be worked out with his national team schedule, he'd be a good  bet to join us."  </P> <P> Another national team player who could take Etherington's spot is former Socker  forward Hugo Perez. Newman spoke with Perez last week, and the 1988 MISL  Championship Series MVP told Newman he'd be interested in returning.  </P> <P> "The only thing is he was supposed to call me last Sunday, and he hasn't called  yet," Newman said.

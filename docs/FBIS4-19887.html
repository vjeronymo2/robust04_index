			<p>BFN     [Text] The diplomatic staff of the Greek Embassy in Tirana  will not leave. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today  said that Albania is reexamining the measures taken to reduce  the number of diplomatic staffers at the Greek Embassy. He  added that, following this development, Greece will decide its  stance on the issue after a meeting between the foreign  ministers of the two countries on 3 May in Zurich. Six  administrative staffers will be leaving the Greek Embassy in  Tirana. It should be noted that the Greek Embassy in Tirana has  19 people while the Albanian Embassy in Athens has only one  administrative staffer out of a total of six people.    Replying to questions, the government spokesman said the  Albanian Government obviously made these decisions after taking  current developments into consideration. Venizelos also said  that it should be considered self-explanatory that Mr. van der  Stoel, as CSCE officer responsible for minority issues, is  interested in the situation of the Greek minority in Albania.    A short while ago, our correspondent in Ioannina, Yeoryios  Kirousis, reported that the Albanian authorities began releasing  [from detention] officials of the Greek minority party, Omonoia.  So far, the president and two members of Omonoia's chapter in  Gjirokaster have not been released.</p>

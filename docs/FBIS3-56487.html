In an interview with Interfax-Ukraine, Marmazov said the  Supreme Soviet would not ratify the deal unless the conditions  it had set for the ratification of the Start-I treaty were met.    Last November, the Supreme Soviet ratified the Start-I  agreement but with some strings attached. Among other things,  the deputies demanded security guarantees and sufficient  compensation for the nuclear weapons Ukraine had inherited from  the former Soviet Union.    Under the parliament-approved deal, Kiev is to transfer 36  percent of its long range missiles and 42 percent of the nuclear  warheads to Russia.</p>

			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Chrysler chief attacks 'predatory practices' MR Lee Iacocca, chairman of Chrysler, said yesterday that President George Bush's visit to Tokyo had produced 'too little, way too little' to reduce the US trade deficit with Japan. Mr Iacocca, who was part of the US business delegation accompanying the president, delivered a blistering attack on Japan's 'predatory' trade practices on his return to Detroit yesterday in a speech to the city's Economic Club. He warned the US Congress would now have 'its crack' at the deficit, referring to a bill before Congress is seeking to force a 20 per cent reduction each year for the next five years in Japan's Dollars 41bn trade surplus with the US. He claimed, however, that Mr Bush's decison to take a business delegation was a 'historic' move by Washington. 'Now we can start taking care of business like Japan has been doing for the past 45 years. . . Seeing American government and business arm in arm for the first time sent the Japanese a message.' Mr Iacocca, an outspoken advocate of protectionist measures to halt the relentless rise in the Japanese share of the US car market, said correcting the deficit had to be done mainly in automotive trade, which accounted for three quarters of the total trade deficit with Japan. He claimed that the Japanese would 'fight it every inch of the way. They have have this industry targeted, and they're not about to take us out of their gunsights.'</p>

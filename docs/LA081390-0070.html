Sommers, U.S.  Golf Assn. official, said Sunday, but did not reveal the other clubs.  </P> <P> The Shoal Creek controversy, before the PGA Championship, was ignited by Hall  Thompson's statement that the club he founded would not be pressured into  accepting black members.  </P> <P> Shoal Creek awarded an honorary membership to Louis Willie, a black Birmingham  executive, and derailed plans of demonstrations.  </P> <P> Sommers said the controversy would not affect the decision.  </P> <P> The PGA Tour announced this week that clubs selected as future sites for  tournaments must have open membership practices. U.S. Open sites have been  selected through 1995.  </P></p>

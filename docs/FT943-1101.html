			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Forte first-half boost asit straddles Meridien - Other Companies Forte announces half-year results on Thursday, with pre-tax profits of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 55m expected compared with Pounds 37m last time. The results come at the end of one of the most momentous months in the hotel and restaurant group's history. It has been given a formal say in the management of the Savoy Hotel group, although it has not won overall control. More significant from a commercial point of view, it won control of Meridien hotels, the French chain controlled by Air France. Attention is likely to focus on Forte's success in holding on to contracts to manage Meridien properties.</p>

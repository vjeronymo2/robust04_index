			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASIAN;  </P> <P> ENTREPRENEURS;  </P> <P> AN INFLUX OF IMMIGRANTS, MANY EDUCATED HERE, ARE BRINGING JOBS AND INNOVATION  TO THE U.S. MARKET.  </P> <P> Gerry Liu still winces at the greeting that he received in San Francisco after  a trip abroad last winter: At the airport, a U.S. customs agent lectured him  about Asian immigrants taking jobs from other Americans.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Not true -- the company that I founded created more jobs for  Americans than it took away,' " the Taiwan native recalled recently. "It wasn't  a pleasant conversation."  </P> <P> Liu, president of Knights Technology in the San Francisco Bay Area, is not  alone. Little noticed outside Northern California, a growing corps of high-tech  entrepreneurs has emerged with roots that reach from America to the Far East.  Like Liu, they are immigrants who were drawn to this country for economic  opportunity, and they have found it.  </P> <P> In the process, they also have given something back: Their firms -- more than  500 in the San Francisco Bay Area -- have created thousands of jobs, enhanced  the nation's competitiveness in high technology and spurred innovation. All  together, they generate over $1 billion in sales, according to the Asian  American Manufacturers Assn. in Menlo Park, Calif.  </P> <P> "We're getting an actual commitment to build products in this country, and to  build them the way they ought to be built," said Charles H. Nevil, a member of  the California State World Trade Commission. "I think it's a very significant  contribution."  </P> <P> Most of the entrepreneurs are ethnically Chinese, born in mainland China,  Taiwan or Hong Kong. But unlike other Asian immigrants who have eked out  livings in restaurants, laundries and grocery stores, these have entered  America's mainstream via the classroom.  </P> <P> Many hold advanced degrees in physics, engineering and computer science from  U.S. universities. They stayed here to work after graduation, mostly in the  1970s and 1980s, and have since launched firms that run the spectrum of modern  technology.  </P> <P> "I received the best education in the world," said Liu, 32, who has a Ph.D.  degree in computer science from University of California, Berkeley and whose  firm makes advanced equipment used to design semiconductors. "I want to stay  here a long time and contribute my talent to the same society where I got it."  </P> <P> By all accounts, the group is diverse. Some of the entrepreneurs are more at  home in American society than others are. Their command of English varies. Some  always wanted to run their own companies, while others took the step only after  feeling mistreated by Caucasian employers. Their companies vary from fledglings  with just a handful of workers to established enterprises such as Everex, a  personal computer maker with 1,900 employees.  </P> <P> And many are starting to benefit from their connections in Taiwan and Hong  Kong, where booming economies have touched off a wave of U.S.-bound investment  money and transpacific business opportunities.  </P> <P> "The one thing they have in common is that they have roots elsewhere," said  Calbert Lai, a spokesman for the AAMA. "It's a tremendous boon to their  businesses."  </P> <P> Actually, they have more than that in common: They come from families in which  scientific pursuits are held in high esteem. And science is a uniquely portable  skill for immigrants, because it is a language that they can speak as fluently  as native Americans.  </P> <P> "Science is basically numbers and symbols," said Fred Wong, the Hong Kong-born  vice president of Rapro Technology in Fremont, Calif. "It speaks a universal  language.  </P> <P> Gradually, in different areas of modern technology, the Asian-American  entrepreneurs are making their presence felt.  </P> <P> Southeast of San Francisco Bay in Milpitas, David S. Lee -- schooled in China,  Taiwan, Argentina and the United States -- runs Qume, a maker of computer  printers. At Pantronix in San Jose, employees of Chinese-born Stanley Wang  build semiconductors used in the space shuttle. Expert Edge in Palo Alto --  headed by David Lam, an immigrant from South Vietnam and Hong Kong --  constructs devices used in robotics and other factory technologies.  </P> <P> Of the many entrepreneurs, few have strived harder or journeyed farther than  Lee, 52, whose early education had more to do with basic survival than advanced  science. "We appreciate more about America than many Americans do," he said in  a conference room at Qume, the company that he helped start in 1973.  </P> <P> While growing up in war-torn China in the 1940s, his family was uprooted 13  times. They eventually moved to Taiwan, but the island was painfully close to  grim wartime memories: In 1951, the Lees took a 59-day voyage to Argentina.  Settling in Buenos Aires, they started a Chinese restaurant and import business  where Lee helped translate Spanish for his parents.  </P> <P> His journey wasn't over: Lee studied engineering at Montana State University  and later, while working in the private sector, helped develop a letter-quality  computer printer system known as the daisy wheel. When Xerox bought Diablo  Systems -- a company he co-founded, "I made my first million dollars," he  recalled.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Secret to Success  </P> <P> The corporate world had disappointments, as well. Lee stayed on at Diablo after  the sale but was passed over for a newly created executive post. In the  following years, he helped found Qume, sold it to ITT for more than $10 million  in personal profit and later bought it back from a different owner. Today he  serves as Qume's chief executive.  </P> <P> "For every company there is a secret of making money," said the executive. "If  you find it and protect it, then you will make money."  </P> <P> Like other Chinese, Lee is conscious of ethnic stereotypes in which  Asian-Americans are pegged as hard-working, obedient and loyal, while lacking  in the sort of strong leadership traits expected of top-level managers.  </P> <P> "I don't think they even considered me as a manager," he said of his superiors  at the Xerox subsidiary more than 15 years ago. "Even today," he added, "some  large companies have a problem with Asian-Americans as managers."  </P> <P> But if the majority culture is not uniformly hospitable to Asian-Americans,  many are learning to make strides with the help of each other. In the Bay Area,  many of the high-tech entrepreneurs know each other, enjoying a built-in  network that translates into new contacts, new business, even new companies.  </P> <P> A typical case: Fred Wong met David Lam several years ago when Wong's job  involved purchasing high-tech equipment from Lam's firm. Lam later introduced  Wong to a Chinese-American executive at IBM who was launching his own  enterprise in Silicon Valley.  </P> <P> Today, Wong is a vice president at Rapro Technology in Fremont, a 2-year-old  firm that designs and makes equipment to produce advanced integrated circuits.  Lam serves on the board. "David and I actually went to the same high school,  though we didn't know it till after we talked about it," Wong recalled.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overseas Ties  </P> <P> At the same time, Wong is quick to note, the significance of such personal  contacts is not peculiarly Asian and in fact "is no different from any start-up  company in Silicon Valley."  </P> <P> Increasingly, such contacts stretch across the Pacific, where the  Asian-American capitalists have family and friends that date back to early  school days. Amy F. Chung, a product marketing manager with Sun Microsystems in  Mountain View, Calif., makes no secret of her wish to make use one day of  Taiwan-U.S. business links in a venture of her own.  </P> <P> "Who you know is very important. The connections you have are very important,"  said Chung, 28, the daughter of a former Taiwanese consul general in San  Francisco. "As a marketing person, I would just hit myself over the head if I  cannot utilize these opportunities."  </P> <P> For some of the immigrant entrepreneurs, opportunity is knocking in the form of  cash. In April, for example, Taiwan's Bank of Communications -- a national  industrial development bank -- opened its first U.S. office in San Jose.  </P> <P> "In California alone, there's at least a dozen (non-Japanese) Asian venture  capital groups investing in high-tech businesses," said Robert E. Mast,  director of corporate services for Venture Economics Inc., a private research  firm in Needham, Mass.  </P> <P> Banks and other financial institutions aren't the only sources of Asian cash.  More and more, entrepreneurs tell stories of rich individuals in Taiwan and  Hong Kong buying stakes in fledgling, private enterprises. The amount of such  money is unknown, because there is little way to track it. "These are family  dollars," said William E. Claggett, San Jose's director of economic  development.  </P> <P> Through their personal contacts, some of the Asian-American capitalists have  special entree to such families. The link has become more important lately,  because many U.S. investors have become wary about gambling on high tech.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Got Foreign Funds  </P> <P> "The first instinct is to look to the guy down the street (for financing),"  said Lam. But these days, when the guy down the street isn't interested, some  of the Asian-Americans look across the ocean. Thus, one new company making  electronics testing equipment turned to the Far East for critically needed  financing.  </P> <P> "In an industry that no U.S. venture company would touch with a 10-foot pole,  they raised $4.5 million from Taiwan," said Lam, who started his current firm,  Expert Edge, in April with the help of $2.5 million from a Hong Kong family.  </P> <P> Despite such examples, Asian-American entrepreneurs still maintain that it's  ideal to be "color-blind" when making business decisions. They are especially  sensitive to any suggestion that they operate in business as an ethnically  closed circle.  </P> <P> At Pantronix, for instance, half of the managers are Asian-American; the other  half are not, said Stanley Wang, the firm's president and founder: "We can work  as a team -- to improve the quality of life."  </P> <P> Rapro regularly employs local, non-Asian machine shops to produce some of its  parts. When Asian-American contractors have asked for some of that work, "we've  told them we're satisfied with the (non-Asian) people we're working with, and  if there are any opportunities, we'll let you know," Wong recalled.  </P> <P> It's likely that in the future there will be more opportunities in Asia. Amy  Chung tells the story of a friend who recently quit his California research job  for a chance to work in a more sophisticated laboratory -- back home in Taiwan.  "Just 10 years ago you wouldn't see him go back -- because there wasn't the  opportunity for him to do what he wants to do," she observed.  </P> <P> For now, however, America remains the beacon for some of the Far East's most  able high-tech entrepreneurs, drawn to this country's universities, business  climate and political stability. "We have so much freedom in this country,"  said Lee, who remembers climbing walls in Beijing's Forbidden City when he was  a child. "Every time you come back from a foreign country, you say, 'How lucky  we are.' "  </P></p>

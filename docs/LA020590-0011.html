			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVING HISTORIC LEONIS ADOBE  </P> <P> I would like to clarify some of the statements made in Al Martinez's column "An  Itch in Old Calabasas" (Jan. 16) regarding the historic Leonis Adobe and  Caltrans' proposal for the Valley Circle Boulevard interchange with the Ventura  Freeway.  </P> <P> None of the historic Leonis Adobe property is in any way threatened by  Caltrans' proposal.  </P> <P> No property will be taken from either the National Register property (which  contains the Adobe, barn and other structures) or from the adjacent Leonis  Adobe Assn. property.  </P> <P> The present right-of-way line that runs between the Ventura Freeway and a  portion of the Leonis Adobe Assn.'s property (containing the corral, the adobe  area, and part of a nearby restaurant's parking lot) will be maintained.  </P> <P> The proposed project would require approximately 0.5 acres of property held by  the Leonis Adobe Assn. Most of the property in question is located between  Calabasas Creek and the Valley Circle Boulevard/Mulholland Drive intersection.  </P> <P> Caltrans is working closely with the Leonis Adobe Assn. on plans to construct a  sound wall along the present right-of-way line to reduce the level of freeway  noise in and around the adobe structure.  </P> <P> Caltrans is also working on plans to enhance the area with new landscaping and  to relocate and replant some of the existing oak trees located on the property.  </P> <P> JERRY B. BAXTER  </P> <P> Caltrans District Director  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

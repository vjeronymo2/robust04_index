			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies Whatever else, the cut represents a gamble on German interest rates. Not only is the differential with Germany reduced to only a quarter of a percentage point but the Frankfurt money market is also tight, with call money approaching the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. It can be argued that in the short term the UK may get away with it, if only because the Bundesbank is unlikely to raise rates while the strikes last. But in the slightly longer run, the bank may be forced to act if money supply growth continues close to 10 per cent. Then the UK would be in a similar position to France last year in trying to buck the German trend. True, the UK can now claim the attraction of political stability while the Kohl government appears to be losing its grip. But France's past inability to sustain lower rates is still sobering given its outstanding inflation record. Even without a German rate rise, sterling is sailing close to the wind. Yesterday's move must cast at least some doubt on the urgency with which the government hopes to move to narrow bands within the ERM, and by extension on the expectation of currency stability which has underpinned the gilts market since the election. No doubt the UK government will do its utmost to prevent sterling falling below its narrow band floor of DM2.8844. But to fund its deficit, it may now need to rely more heavily on expectations of lower inflation and on Mr John Major's new image as the strong man of Europe. The danger is that a half-point rate cut might prove insufficient to yield the non-inflationary growth that such a leadership role requires, while still deviating too far from the German norm.</p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Defendants face abolition of right to elect trial by jury THE ABOLITION of a def-endant's right to elect trial by jury will be recommended tomorrow in a report by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice. At the moment, defendants are allowed to choose jury trial in cases which can be tried either by magistrates or in a crown court. Sources within the Criminal Bar who have seen the commission's report said the commission had been convinced that allowing defendants to elect jury trial only to have them plead guilty at the crown court was a waste of court time and resources. According to one QC this proposal will cause a political storm. Mrs Barbara Mills QC, the director of public prosecutions, has been pushing for the change. But Lord Taylor, the lord chief justice, is strongly opposed, describing the right to jury trial as 'an inalienable right stretching back to the Magna Carta'. The commission, chaired by Lord Runciman, will also recommend that defendants must disclose their defence before trial once the case against them has been outlined by the prosecution. The commission makes a number of suggestions as to how such an obligation might be enforced, and appears to favour holding defendants who refuse to co-operate in contempt with the ultimate sanction of being jailed. These measures are seen by criminal barristers as the most controversial proposals in the report. 'I think it is a reasonably solid report,' said one QC, 'not very exciting - it's not revamping anything. But that's not a bad thing. It would be fatal to go for too radical change when the system works well in general.' The commission, which was set up in March 1991 after a series of miscarriages of justice had rocked public confidence in the criminal justice system, has stopped short of recommending abolition of the so-called right to silence of the accused. Although it will recommend that defendants should disclose their case, and that juries should be able to draw inferences from the defendant's silence at trial, it says that the accused should not lose the right to stay silent at the police station. The Runciman report also concludes that there is no need for a requirement that confession evidence should be corroborated before it can be admissable as evidence at trial. Instead, the commission will recommend that judges should give a warning to juries about placing too much emphasis on a confession which is unsupported by other evidence. Similar warnings are already given to juries about identification evidence. Among the other recommendations, the commission calls for: An independent tribunal to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice and refer cases back to the Appeal Court; A system of sentence discounts, where judges will outline a maximum sentence a defendant would receive if he pleaded guilty; An independent forensic science service available to both defence and prosecution.</p>

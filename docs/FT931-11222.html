			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: North Sea storms halve Norwegian crude oil output NORWEGIAN North Sea crude oil production was cut by half yesterday as raging storms forced the closure of the Statfjord and Snorre fields, and sharply cut output from the Gullfaks field, said Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company. Norway normally produces a daily average of 2.3m barrels of oil but extremely high waves prevented crude tankers from loading oil from buoys at Statfjord and from Gullfaks as storage capacity had reached its limits at the two fields. Statfjord also stores oil from the 100,000 barrel-a-day Snorre field. Gullfaks was producing just 15,000 barrels yesterday, compared with its normal daily output of 491,000 barrels. A Statoil spokesman said the weather forecast did not bode well for the resumption of full production until at least Friday, when crude oil tankers might be able to commence loading if waves subside to 4.5 metres or less. He said that storms had created the worst conditions in 20 years for offshore crude oil loading by tankers.</p>

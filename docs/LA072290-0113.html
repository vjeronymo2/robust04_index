			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LIBRARY SWEATSHOP REVISITED  </P> <P> I am writing on behalf of the Librarians Assn. of the University of  California-Los Angeles (LAUC-LA) in response to the "Endpapers" by Ron Kelley .  . .  </P> <P> The UCLA Library is in the forefront of applying technological developments to  the acquisition, processing and accessing of its vast collections. It is  inevitable that as a traditional work environment adapts to a new technology,  some employees may find it difficult to make the transition. This is true not  only in the library, but in any work environment in which automation has  altered the way information is being processed.  </P> <P> Large research libraries are no longer a quiet refuge from the turbulence of  the world. Vast amounts of information must be organized so that  access/retrieval is possible. The computer has made this traditional library  mission easier to accomplish; unfortunately, like most changes, it has raised  other issues that need our attention.  </P> <P> The negative portrayal of librarians presented by Kelley is far removed from  the reality of the 150 librarians at UCLA. Librarians at the University of  California are academic appointees who have completed a Master of Library  Science program and are professionally active in state and national  associations. The charge that "librarians typically achieve only the minimal  level of 'computer literacy' to do their jobs" is particularly galling, since  most of us spend many hours using computers to enable us to improve the quality  of service we offer to the University community.  </P> <P> As professionals, we are involved in all aspects of ORION, UCLA's  state-of-the-art on-line information system, from its development and  implementation to instructing library staff and library patrons in its use.  </P> <P> One of the characteristics that does indeed separate librarians from library  assistants is the broad perspective and core of knowledge that comes from the  graduate education required for appointment.  </P> <P> MIKI GORAL  </P> <P> Chair, LAUC-LA  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES  </P></p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Restructured Halkin returns to black with Pounds 1.25m at midway Halkin Holdings, the accessories and brewing group, announced a profit for its first six months as a restructured company. Pre-tax profits at the group, bought by Mr Howard Hodgson, the former funeral director, in August 1993, were Pounds 1.25m on turnover of Pounds 11.4m for the six months to July 2. The year-end was changed from March 31 to end-December; for the nine months to December 31 the group incurred a loss of Pounds 998,000 on turnover of Pounds 478,000. The group has ungone a radical restructuring in the past year, acquiring Ronson, the lighter and aerosol group, for Pounds 10m and LGW, a gift company now trading as Clifford International, for Pounds 9.5m. The purchases were funded partly by a Pounds 15m rights issue, and Halkin said both were performing well. The company said it was beginning an 'international brand-building programme' to re-establish the Ronson name. Three new collections of lighters, pens and watches were being launched. Clifford International has strengthened its product range, with airline listings up on the previous year, and the brewery has returned to profits. Earnings per share were 2.46p, against losses of 17.2p. No interim dividend is declared, but the board said it intends to recommend a full-year distribution.</p>

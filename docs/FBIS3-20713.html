			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Tulevski: "Macedonians on Trial"] </F>   [Text] The plight of the Macedonians in Bulgaria continues  despite the alleged policy of our eastern neighbor, in its  transition to European, just, and civilized values. This, some  will say extremely harsh, claim can be easily justified by what  has been published over the past few days: The district  prosecutor of the town of Sandanski has leveled charges against  four distinguished activists of the United Macedonian  Organization [OMO] "Ilinden" for organizing an illegal rally  near the Rozen Monastery last year, on the occasion of the  anniversary of Jane Sandanski's death. The head of the District  Prosecuting Attorney's Office used Article 174 of the Criminal  Law to institute prosecution for the organizing of meetings,  since he was not able to find any other legislation with which  to punish those who feel and declare themselves Macedonian.    Jordan Kostadinov, Bozidar Kirijanov, Vihren Zaprev, and  Kiril Gilev can be sentenced to a year of imprisonment. That is  the conclusion of the joint, four-year battle that they have  waged together with hundreds of other Macedonians in Pirin  Macedonia, with the aim of proving to the world that neither  tsarist, nor Zivkov's totalitarian -- let alone present  democratic -- Bulgaria can suffocate this feeling or eradicate a  national identity.  <H5>  "Deliberate" Justice </H5>   Of course, the whole farce was preceded by exclusive  preparation in the vrhovists' [Bulgarian nationalists] "studio"  in Sofia, which involved Ivan Tatarcev, the Bulgarian prosecutor  general, being available night and day, a man who, by the way,  is the nephew of one of the founders of the VMRO [Internal  Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]. The top Bulgarian  prosecutor issued a personal warrant to start this new political  process against the four Macedonians. Moreover, Tatarcev is  well known to the Bulgarian public and beyond for the many cases  of "deliberate" justice, adapting cases to the needs of  day-to-day policy, and ignoring the provisions of the law. He  became equally famous when he arrested two former Bulgarian  prime ministers, Andrej Lukanov and Georgi Atanasov, by using  ridiculous and unsubstantiated evidence adapted to fit some  article of the criminal law adapted especially for the occasion.  He was not ashamed to act as a prosecuting attorney in a range  of other cases involving reprisals against various personalities  of the former regime.    In any case, this is another attempt to shape the modern  history of repression in order to deal a blow (besides using  police batons) to a very serious movement headed by OMO  "Ilinden."  <H5>  Public Disqualification </H5>   The Macedonians in Bulgaria for the first time, after many a  year of persecution in Zivkov's ethnically "pure and  homogeneous" state, publicly raised their voices in the cold and  dramatic autumn of 1989. It happened at a mass meeting for  democratic changes in the large square near the "Aleksandar  Nevski" monument in Sofia. Among the hundreds of thousands of  spectators there was a group of Macedonians who came with their  own slogans as a sign of identification and to announce their  struggle against the suppression of political rights. Soon  afterwards OMO "Ilinden" was formed and its activities were  stepped up.    However, in spite of the upsurge of democracy, the great  waves of euphoria following the fall of Todor Zivkov and his  police regime in Bulgaria at that time, and the feeling that a  climate for real democratic resurrection was being created, the  ranks of the nationalists were soon consolidated and the  vrhovists organized the Alliance of Macedonian Associations  (later on the VMRO-SMD [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary  Organization-Alliance of Macedonian Associations]), assisted by  the frightened state leadership, started, as provokers and  initiators, the whole battle against OMO "Ilinden." They began  to organize counterdemonstrations, to deny the existence of the  Macedonian national minority in Bulgaria, to humiliate the  "Ilinden affiliates", and discredit them as "foreign  mercenaries," "lost souls," and so on, all to prove that they  were a small group of "renegades from the system."  <H5>  Halting Assimilation </H5>   OMO "Ilinden" did not suspend or abandon its goals despite  the strong media and other public pressures. On the contrary:  On 11 March 1990, over 100 Macedonians organized a march  through the streets of Sofia and they handed a petition to the  Bulgarian parliament with a request to end the assimilation of  Macedonians and for the reestablishment of minority rights.  Despite the fierce anti-Macedonian campaign launched in  Bulgaria, only a month later OMO "Ilinden" organized a rally  with around 15,000 Macedonians from Pirin Macedonia in the  courtyard of the Rozen Monastery, marking the anniversary of  Jane Sandanski's death. The rally ended without incident, but  with straightforward demands for cultural independence and  respect for human and minority rights, accompanied by Macedonian  folksongs and dancing.    This demonstration at the Rozen Monastery eventually angered  all the Bulgarians, from the ultra leftist to the ultra rightist  parties and movements. The first consensus reached at that time  between the hated communists and the new democratic forces was  to suspend the Macedonian movement. Events unfolded this way:  False accusations were made about the Macedonian organization,  it could not be legally registered, its activities were then  banned, and finally police batons were brought into play and  every kind of demonstration was banned. In the meantime,  members of OMO "Ilinden" went on hunger strike, wrote letters to  foreign embassies and offices, and then directly addressed the  Bulgarian leadership in July 1990 to insist they were not what  they were accused of being -- separatists -- but were loyal  citizens who were simply asking for the freedom to express their  national identity.  <H5>  Bloody Clash </H5>   Instead of receiving understanding, the response to all this  was that the OMO "Ilinden" activists had their passports  confiscated, while some were arrested in December of the same  year in Blagoevgrad, others were beaten up in the streets as  they collected signatures for support, and so on.    Consequently, the traditional Rozen rally was banned in  1991 and 1992, and there was a brutal, bloody clash between the  police and the rally around the tomb of Jane Sandanski in April  1993.    Last year's Rozen persecution, the latest in a series of  anti- Macedonian activities, completed four years of the  Bulgarian political leadership's attempts to suppress the  Macedonian organization using the state's apparatus and  organizations founded specially for the purpose, neither minding  the means, nor economizing on money or words for propaganda,  schemes, or actions in the field.    However, the truth about the assimilation of the Macedonians  in Pirin Macedonia has become known, as well as the suppression  of the Macedonian national minority in Bulgaria, and is to be  found in all the reports of international associations. Now,  the political trial of four OMO "Ilinden" leaders approaches.  It is further proof of the continuing policy, contrary to all  Bulgaria's declarations on its respect for human rights, the UN  charter, the CSCE documents, Vienna.... It is naive to imagine  that prison sentences will eliminate the existence of the  Macedonian national minority. Unfortunately, Bulgaria has not  learnt any lessons from history -- many Macedonians rotted in  camps and jails for years and even decades, and yet there now  come fresh generations that refuse to forget about their  ancestors' national identity.    Is it not more rational, just for once, to accept the bitter  truth in order to help the Balkans, during its transition into  newly oriented states, to become a stable region liberated from  its complex historical past. The borders remain, and that may  be the strongest motive for the elimination of some inherited  syndromes.</p>

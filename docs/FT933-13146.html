			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Venezuela fears new terror outbreak LETTER bombs sent to members of Venezuela's Supreme Court over the past few days have raised fears that the country may be facing a fresh wave of political destabilisation, writes Joseph Mann in Caracas. A letter bomb addressed to the Supreme Court exploded on Monday when a court employee tried to open it. Bombs were also sent to the homes of the chief justice and his deputy but they were defused by police. No one has claimed responsibility. On Monday the court was scheduled to review a decision on corruption charges against former president Jaime Lusinchi. He condemned the letter bombs. El Diario, the Caracas newspaper, said yesterday three other bombs were being sought by the police. Defence Minister Radames Munoz Leon said the devices were planted to 'create a climate of terrorism' and impede general elections in December. Last year the country was shaken by a series of terrorist acts supposedly carried out by a self-styled vigilante group.</p>

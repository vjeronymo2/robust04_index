			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Station short commentary" from the "News and Press Review" </F> program: "Always Keep the Masses in Mind"]    [Text] Yao Liejue [political commissar of an engineering  regiment under the 2d Artillery Corps of the People's Liberation  Army, PLA, who was commended for having refused gifts], as a  leading cadre, enjoys the support of officers and men because he  bears firmly in mind what fighters asked him to do: Always keep  the masses in mind.    The basic purpose of our party is to serve the people  wholeheartedly. It is all the more important for leading cadres  to firmly foster a concept of identifying oneself with the  masses.    Reform and economic development require us to emancipate our  minds and adopt new ideas. But this does not in the least mean  that the concept of doing everything possible for the people can  be allowed to become diluted.    Yao Liejue's deeds show us: In the final analysis, whether a  leading cadre can be honest and upright is a question of how to  treat the masses. A leader's power is given by the people, and  all the money and materials in his charge are the people's  property which is created by them through hard toil. A leader  who always keeps the masses in mind will never abuse the power  given by them to appropriate their property.    As reform deepens, our leaders at all levels should care for  and cherish the masses all the more, help them surmount various  practical difficulties, and share the same fate and breathe the  same air with the masses.</p>

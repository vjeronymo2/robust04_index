			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / UB buys into US own-label biscuits UNITED Biscuits, the biscuits and snacks group, is moving into the US own-label cookie market through the acquisition of Bake-Line, a private company. UB is paying Dollars 70m (Pounds 47m) and taking on Dollars 5m of debt. Sir Robert Clarke, UB chairman, said the purchase would not dilute UB's earnings in the short term and there would be merger benefits further out. Bake-Line should strengthen the position of Keebler, UB's branded cookie, cracker and snack subsidiary in the US. Keebler suffered a sharp drop in profits - from Pounds 29.7m to Pounds 12.1m in the first six months of 1992  -because it met difficult trading conditions as consumers switched to cheaper, often own-label, cookies. Keebler had not moved into the own-label sector although this area has been growing rapidly in the US in recent years, following a similar trend in the UK. In Britain, UB, which has the McVitie's brand, is also the leading own-label biscuit producer and makes the same margins on branded and own-label biscuits. Own-label now accounts for nearly 14 per cent of the US cookie market by volume. Bake-Line has a 25 per cent share of the own-label sector. Bake-Line, based in Chicago, has a modern factory with 40 per cent spare capacity. Benefits should come from joint purchasing, distribution, technology and the use Keebler can make of Bake-Line's spare capacity. A longer term aim is to move into the own-label cracker market. The purchase price compares with Bake-Line's net assets of Dollars 17m, sales in the year to June 27 of Dollars 73.8m and trading profits of Dollars 5.2m. Bake-Line's profits are expected to be substantially higher in the current year. However, stockbrokers expressed concern about the effect of the deal on UB's balance sheet, coming after the Pounds 200m acquisition of CCA Snacks in Australia, which was completed on Monday. Sir Robert said that gearing, excluding brands from the balance sheet, would be 88 per cent after the deal. He said UB had no plans to issue shares - a Pounds 80m placing of shares helped finance the CCA deal - but added that it could make disposals. He said interest cover would be 4.9 times after the Bake-Line acquisition. London Stock Exchange, Page 30</p>

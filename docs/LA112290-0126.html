			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> RENT MEDIATION RESTORED  </P> <P> The City Council has unanimously voted to reinstitute the city's rental  mediation program for mobile home parks in response to complaints from tenants  at the Westland Estates Mobile Home Park whose rents are being raised to $347 a  month, up from $233, effective Jan. 1.  </P> <P> The park was recently purchased for more than $4 million by Long Beach  businessman Allen Alevy and Amusement Industry Inc. David Kracoff, asset  manager for the new owners, said the new rents are in line with the market.  </P> <P> In addition, he said, more than $200,000 is being spent to upgrade the park.  </P> <P> Both Kracoff and tenants said they welcome the city's decision to reinstitute  its rental mediation program. Park resident Linda Jones said that tenants are  willing to accept higher rents but that the owners are demanding excessive  amounts and have offered unfair lease terms.  </P></p>

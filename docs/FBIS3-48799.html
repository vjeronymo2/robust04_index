Beside  the criticism of whether there was not, in the manner of placing  orders for public works, a foundation which spawned corruption,  these scandals involving public works ordered by prefectures are  also inviting observations as to whether the oversight function  of prefectural assemblies was functioning in a healthy manner.  It can be said that the basis of local government is being  shaken because the so-called "phenomenon of a shift to the  government party" of prefectural assemblies has become a  nationwide trend, and the number of governors who are retired  officials from central government agencies has risen. If things  go on like this, the "decentralization of power" which the  Hosokawa government espouses can also fade.    Governor Shuntaro Honma of Miyagi Prefecture, who was  arrested on suspicion of having accepted bribes, aided by such  things as Recruit-scandal distrust and helped also by the  defeat-by-default of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], was  elected in March 1989 with the endorsement and support of the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the United Social  Democratic Party [USDP], and some conservative members of the  prefectural assembly. But four years later, in February 1993,  the parties supporting him had increased to four: the LDP, SDPJ,  Komeito, and the Japan Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and he  defeated by a great margin a candidate endorsed by the Japan  Communist Party [JCP].    This kind of phenomenon is seen in every region throughout  Japan, and as will be clear from the table, even though there  are differences in the combinations, in general, it has become  normal for all parties other than the JCP to share in the  relationships of endorsement and support of the current  governors of urban and rural prefectures.

                                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      In the case also of former governor Fujio Takeuchi of  Ibaraki  Prefecture, in the gubernatorial election of 1991 he received  the endorsement and support of three parties--the LDP, Komeito,  and DSP--and of the Ibaraki Rengo, so, including the SDPJ, which  voted independently, it was, in fact, a sharing by four parties.    In the gubernatorial election on 26 September to choose his  successor, four conservative parties: the LDP, Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party], Japan New Party, and new Sakigake [Harbinger]  party, cooperated, transcending the government-opposition party  framework, and elected a former Home Affairs Ministry division  chief. But the former mayor of Mito City, who did not receive  party support, was catching up with him, and the turnout dropped  below 40 percent, so criticism of the central political parties  by the people of the prefecture stood out sharply.    Why does "a shift to the government party" advance apart  from voter consciousness? Professor Hitoshi Abe (political  science) of the University of the Air says, "Every party gains a  great benefit by a shift to the government party because the  volume and speed of information related to prefectural  government is incomparably greater than that of opposition  parties, and its "influence" regarding administration is also  effective." But, on the other hand, he points out that an  assembly's supervisory function toward prefectural government  certainly declines.    Following the arrest of Governor Honma, a certain governor  in  eastern Japan said, "One can point out two problems in the  arrest of two governors. One is the individual problem of the  evil or flaw in ethical view of being elected many times. The  other is the fact that governors are leaders who can act  promptly in response to situations. In addition to being chosen  by direct election, they have exclusive control of such things  as the authority to compile budgets and to manage personnel.  Concentration of authority leads to a trap."    At a press conference on 28 September, Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who has served as governor of  Shiga Prefecture, also pointed out the dangerous nature of the  corruption that lies dormant in the "position of governor,"  saying, "If one lowers one's guard for a moment, one will be led  astray. It is a battle with one's own heart."    Of current urban and provincial governors, 27 have a  background in central government agencies or in  government-related agencies. Although one cannot condemn them  wholesale, one expects there are many cases in which  "connections with the central government" were used as selling  points when running for election. It is surmised that, to that  extent, it was expected by constituents that the governors would  have skill in such things as attracting large national projects.    Concerning the influence that general contractor corruption  exerts on "decentralization," a Ministry of Home Affairs  executive says, "The view is spreading that corruption would  advance even further if we delegated power from the central  government to the provinces." It seems that the scandal this  time involves substantive questioning of local autonomy and the  proper nature thereof.</p>

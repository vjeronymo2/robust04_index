			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Japan fears trend to protectionism THE Japanese government warned yesterday that the collapse of the communist bloc could lead to increased protectionism, as a sense of common purpose among western countries which encouraged the trend toward freer trade had now eroded. In an annual white paper on international trade, the government said the disappearance of this shared political purpose could encourage countries to 'pursue their own short-term domestic interests at the expense of the world's general benefit'. The paper also called for continuing trade reforms within Japan, which has just reported a record surplus of Dollars 113bn on its trade account for fiscal 1991, and is facing increasing pressure from Washington to open markets and make business practices more transparent. In language similar to that used by US trade negotiators, the report said that increased opportunities for foreign suppliers in the Japanese market 'will benefit not only foreign corporations, but Japanese consumers as well'. The report noted that in 1991, when Japanese economic growth slowed, the value of imports rose by only 0.8 per cent, the smallest increase since 1986. It said the causes were the collapse of the financial 'bubble', leading to a fall in luxury imports and slower capital spending by Japanese companies. However, Japan's exports rose by 9.6 per cent, and the paper said that about half the increase was due to expanded trade with south-east Asian countries and the other newly-industrialised economies of Asia. As for trade with the European Community, Japan recommended that EC companies should 'boost competitive power' in manufacturing industry. 'EC corporations have to make the most of their sales and product-development strength, and construct close co-operative ties with non-EC corporations possessing high technology - his can be done by providing intermediate goods and taking part in product development,' it said. The paper, prepared by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) and approved yesterday by the cabinet, conceded that the 'enhancement of industrial efficiency has not proportionally enhanced the Japanese standard of living' and that infrastructure must be improved. 'We should utilise the surplus supply capacity and savings to build a social infrastructure instead of exporting our products and financing other countries' investments,' it recommended. 'These efforts to emphasise Japanese demand rather than supply will help to reduce the Japanese macro-economic imbalance, to mitigate trade friction, and to encourage the world economy to grow.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, chief of </F> the Armed Forces, by Reporter Trino Murillo on 25 January; place  not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Murillo] Yesterday, General Luis Alonso Discua  Elvir, chief of the Armed Forces, explained certain Armed Forces  plans and rebutted criticism from certain sectors of Honduran  society. At the beginning of the interview Gen. Discua  discussed a very important issue: the transfer or change over of  Joint Chief of Staff Reynaldo Andino Flores to the Defense  Ministry. My first question is if this should be viewed as a  purge or a normal change within the Armed Forces.    [Discua] Allow me to tell you that no ulterior motives  should be attached to this situation. A list of officers who  could fill the Defense Ministry post was presented to the  president-elect, who had publicly requested such a list at a  council meeting. When he returned from the United States I gave  him a list of several officers and the selection was made  exclusively by the president- elect.    [Murillo] That is a normal decision during a change of  government. Nevertheless, he also spoke of the duties the  military institution would carry out through the Executive  Branch to coordinate with Congress a purging of the police and  to counteract the crime wave that is destroying the country.    [Discua] As I said, there are many issues that must be  approached in a very serious manner, such as military service,  human rights, and the police. I have spoken at length with the  president- elect about these issues because the Armed Forces  want to resolve them. Of course, it would be irresponsible on  our part to [words indistinct] because that requires a process  that should conclude prior to the year 2000 when the police and  Armed Forces are in the condition the people would like to see.  The Armed Forces have always agreed with a constitutional  reform pertaining to the police, and we are working on it. In  due time we will present a report to the president-elect; the  general situation has been outlined to him and we are waiting  for him to summon us. We are [words indistinct] to all the  issues that have been sources of controversy at any given time,  but this has helped us to reconsider and begin a period during  which, I believe, the people will be content.    [Murillo] Spokesmen from the party that is about to take  office have said that international organizations are pressing  for constitutional reforms and that they have established  certain conditions. These conditions include reducing the Army  and making certain basic taxes mandatory so payments will  continue to be made to the government. What is your reaction to  this? You have always said that foreign pressure should never  prevail.    [Discua] I must tell you that approximately three months  ago, or, in other words, last year a meeting was held in Chile  to examine Latin America's military spending. The participants  took a very close look at military spending with regard to each  country's gross domestic product. In Latin America, military  spending fluctuates between 1 percent and 7.6 or 7.8 percent.  Therefore, there are countries whose military spending is very  high. Honduras' spending is less than 1 percent. In other  words, our military spending with regard to our GDP is the  lowest in Central America and even in Latin America. The  Honduran Armed Forces have a budget of $40 million; Costa Rica  has $48 million, and the figure rises. In other words, Honduras  is the Central American country that spends the least on its  military.    [Murillo] [words indistinct] making of demands seems to be  a prerequisite?    [Discua] This is logical. However, I believe the  president-elect stated categorically in Washington that the  Armed Forces reduction had to conform to each government's needs  for equipment [word indistinct]. I have always said that we  have to find a balance in Central America. I know the  institution must make structural reforms to be in keeping with  the new government's modernization policy.    [Murillo] With regard to the implementation of the military  law, General Discua said there is no wrestling for power or  internal strife in the military institution. He added that new  groups arise in the Armed Forces as classes start to retire in  compliance with the institution's bylaws and military law.    [Discua] Logically, we at Mufoco [expansion unknown] will no  longer be active Armed Forces officers, and new classes will  start taking our places. I believe we have to start the opening  process. My entire graduating class will retire when I finish my  term and new classes will take our places. They are young  military men with experience who will always try to do what is  best for the institution. We have to hope that this is how it  will turn out.    [Murillo] As an institutional policy, and based on  international agreements, several U.S. Government sectors have  already asserted that they support turning Palmerola into a  regional counter narcotics center for Central America and the  Caribbean. This prospect is also supported by President Reina.  Do the Armed Forces endorse it too?    [Discua] One of my administration's main objectives has been  the struggle against drugs. I have supported all the programs  initiated by our government and those initiated by friendly  countries to defeat the scourge of drug trafficking. I have  always said the Soto Cano Base should be turned into a Honduran  base to combat drug trafficking at a regional level. It should  unify all actions in the region to enable us to stop or lessen  the flow of drugs to northern countries.    [Murillo] Has this been discussed at top levels, General?    [Discua] Yes, we have been talking about this possibility  constantly. I visited Washington and talked with senators and  congressmen about my plans to combat drug trafficking.</p>

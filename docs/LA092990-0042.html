			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EMRY GAINS 143 YARDS IN ESPERANZA VICTORY  </P> <P> Garrick Emry rushed for 143 yards in 18 carries and scored a pair of touchdowns  to lead Esperanza High School to a 36-21 victory over Long Beach Jordan Friday  in a nonleague football game at Valencia High.  </P> <P> Emry turned a fourth-down play into an important touchdown in the third quarter  for Esperanza (4-0).  </P> <P> Leading, 22-14, with 9:30 left in the third quarter, the Aztecs faced a  fourth-and-two at the Jordan 43. Emry, a junior fullback, took the handoff into  the middle of the line looking for first-down yardage, but broke free for a  43-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> Esperanza added to its lead with the help of a long pass. Quarterback Keith  McDonald completed a 42-yard pass to running back Jarod Smith for a first down  at the Jordan eight. Three plays later, Mark Parlin scored on a one-yard run.  Clay King then kicked the extra point, his fourth, to give Esperanza a 36-14  lead with 4:05 left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Jordan (1-3) had taken a 7-0 lead early in the game, but Esperanza rallied to  tie with the help of a 15-yard scoring pass from McDonald to Reid Pullen with  1:41 left in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Esperanza, the fourth-ranked team in Orange County, took the lead for good with  19 seconds left in the period on Emry's 24-yard touchdown run. He then ran in  the two-point conversion to give Esperanza a 15-7 lead.  </P> <P> On the play before the touchdown, Jordan was called for too many men on the  field and the penalty gave Esperanza a first down on the Jordan 24.  </P> <P> Smith broke free for a 68-yard touchdown run with 6:05 left in the half to give  Esperanza a 22-7 lead.  </P> <P> Jordan cut the lead to 22-14 on a 39-yard scoring pass from Johnny Nansen to  Joel Rosborough with 10 seconds left in the first half.  </P> <P> Jordan's final score came when Jerome Henderson took a punt and ran it back 88  yards for a touchdown with 1:46 left to play.  </P> <P> Esperanza recovered the following on-sides kick and ran out the clock.  </P></p>

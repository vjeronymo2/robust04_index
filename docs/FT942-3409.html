			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Guidelines on wind farms The UK wind energy industry is to establish best practice guidelines to promote the development of wind farms. These will cover site selection, environmental assessment, and community consultation and involvement. The industry is responding to mounting controversy over the rapid development of wind farms, often on prominent sites and against local opposition. Mr Ian Mays, chairman of the British Wind Energy Association, said he believed that 'with care and sensitivity the potential of wind energy to provide a significant, clean, sustainable and popular contribution to our energy needs will be realised'.</p>

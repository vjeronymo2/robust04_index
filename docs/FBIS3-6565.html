			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Honolulu, March 19 KYODO -- U.S. Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen and Japan's Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii set  aside bilateral bickerings on trade Saturday and focused their  attention on regional issues of high finance instead.    The two ministers shared the same roof for two days in a  beachside Honolulu hotel but spent most of the time conferring  with their counterparts from the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum. No bilateral issues were taken up,  Japanese and U.S. officials said.    Bentsen and Fujii met one-on-one Friday but chose to skip  issues on bilateral trade. "We came here for the APEC meeting,"  Fujii explained.    Yet the shadow of trade disputes loomed every time Bentsen  and Fujii faced reporters.    How would frictions in U.S.-Japan relations affect the two  countries' efforts to build a bridge with other nations in the  Asia-Pacific region? That was the first question Bentsen faced  at a joint news conference after the APEC conference was over.    Bentsen put up an air of optimism, not only on U.S.  frictions  with Japan but also with China. "I am optimistic that we're  going to work these types of concerns out," Bentsen said.    On Japan, Bentsen said the United States is working to see  what can be done.    "We're hopeful that will work out. I think that will be for  the betterment of all of us," Bentsen said.    Fujii, who stood alongside 16 APEC ministers behind Bentsen  at the joint news conference, took no initiative to offer his  own views on the subject. When pressed on that point at a  separate news conference later on, Fujii again offered no fresh  insight.    Fujii reiterated that the meeting in Hawaii was about APEC,  and not on U.S.-Japan frictions. "We would like to settle  Japan-U.S. issues in a cooperative spirit," Fujii said.</p>

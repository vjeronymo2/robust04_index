			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / World Bond Markets: Germany considers long-dated sector - International The Republic of Austria's successful DM2bn offering of 30-year Eurobonds last week, which prompted a flood of long-dated issuance by six German states, has raised the possibility that the German government could follow suit. There is clearly strong demand for long-dated D-Mark bonds, especially outside Germany. International interest was such that Austria's issue was increased on Friday by DM500m from DM1.5bn. Excluding Austria's offering, just over DM3bn worth of bonds with maturities of more than 10 years emerged last week, through a combination of 30-year bonds and 20-year bonds puttable after 10 years. The sudden rush of long-dated paper and a perception that some issues were too tightly priced has resulted in this new market reaching saturation point sooner than many syndicate managers had hoped. However, they are confident the overhang of paper will be absorbed fairly quickly, which will enable other highly-rated borrowers to raise long-term financing at the current low interest rates. Deutsche Bundespost, Germany's post office which set up a DM2bn medium-term note programme last week, is expected to raise DM500m via a 30-year bond issue this week. The bonds are likely to be priced to yield around 70 basis points over 10-year German government bonds (bunds). The pricing of 30-year D-Mark bonds is more an art than a science due to the lack of benchmarks beyond 10 years. The yield spread on Austria's bonds was calculated by using the yield differential between 10-year and 30-year Dutch and French government bonds, a mechanism devised by JP Morgan when it arranged a DM1.5bn offering of 15-year Eurobonds for LKB Baden-Wurttemberg Finance in August, the first offering with this maturity in the D-Mark sector. So long as there is no 30-year bund, Austria's offering will be seen as the benchmark against which future issues will be priced. Syndicate managers hope it will not be long before the German government does so, since this would provide the liquidity and credibility which most investors require. The German government does have experience in this area. In 1986, Germany's low inflation rate prompted the government to issue two DM1bn offerings of 30-year bonds. They became illiquid as a change in market conditions dissuaded the government from issuing more long-dated paper and concentrate instead on issuing 10-year bunds. The German finance ministry has declined to comment on whether the government will resume its issuance of bunds with maturities of more than 10 years. The government is thought to be seriously considering the option but is put off by two main factors: uncertainty about how well the market could absorb large issues of 30-year bunds (a bund issue totals around DM10bn these days) and the lack of a relevant futures contract. Nevertheless, the desire to conform could well encourage the German government to overlook these problems. Italy has become the latest European sovereign borrower to issue 30-year debt and Spain will make its first issue of 15-year bonds in the domestic market in December.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Management: The toddler begins to show promise - How AT&amp;T and NCR bucked the trend of failed computer marriages to form a successful partnership It was not love at first sight, but a match based on the sheer wealth of the rudely aggressive suitor. Many onlookers pronounced with relish that it would all end in tears. Yet after 18 months of married life, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's Dollars 7.5bn (Pounds 4.9bn) takeover of NCR, the US computer company, seems to be shaping up rather better than the Jeremiahs predicted. NCR and AT&amp;T's much smaller computer business have combined their product lines and sales forces relatively smoothly, and without any evidently serious loss of customers. And whereas AT&amp;T's old computer business lost money for years, the merged entity is modestly profitable. Nor is there any of the rancour which critics feared could linger between the two companies in the wake of AT&amp;T's hostile bid. However, these are still very early days and the combined business has a long way to go to justify the Dollars 7.5bn paid by AT&amp;T or the strategic thinking behind the takeover - that the convergence of computer and telecommunications technology will give a competitive advantage to a company which successfully combines both skills in-house. Still, the progress so far does point up some lessons for the management of computer sector mergers, which in the past have proved difficult to execute, either because of differences of technology, making it hard to put customer bases together, or of corporate culture. Four main factors have helped overcome such potential difficulties: the way in which AT&amp;T approached the takeover; the technological similarities between the two companies; the compatibility of their product mixes and customer bases; and the execution of the merger. Arguably most important was AT&amp;T's decision from the outset of the bid that, although it would be acquiring NCR, it wanted NCR to be in the driving seat as the computer operations of the two companies were merged. There were very good reasons for this. NCR, the fifth largest computer manufacturer in the US, was a large and reasonably successful business. Founded as National Cash Register in Dayton, Ohio, in the late 19th century, it had expanded far beyond its origins in retail sales tills into general business information systems, though its slowness to move from electro-mechanical to electronic equipment in the 1960s and 1970s had left it in the second rank of computer companies. However, at the time of the bid, NCR had just started introducing a new product range which correctly anticipated a move by the industry towards open systems, which allow computers made by different manufacturers to operate together, rather than proprietary products, which lock the customer into one company's products. By contrast, AT&amp;T's computer operations were only founded in the mid-1980s, were much smaller and were awash in red ink. AT&amp;T essentially handed this business to NCR and said: 'Take what you want, discard the rest, but make sure you keep customers happy and are profitable.' Charles Exley, the NCR chief executive who headed the fight against AT&amp;T, left the company when the bid was successful but his place was taken by another NCR executive, Gilbert Williamson, the former president. AT&amp;T's clear-cut approach to the post-merger power structure meant, he says, that there was no waste of energies discussing 'who's going to sit in the corner office'. NCR only took on about 2,000 of AT&amp;T's 7,500 computer staff and AT&amp;T formed a special unit responsible for redeploying the discarded employees elsewhere in the group. As a result, NCR did not become bogged down in politicking or administrative minutiae and could remain externally focused, concentrating on the critical tasks of combining product offerings and reassuring customers that they would continue to be served properly. In so doing, it was helped by the fact that both companies were pursuing the same technological strategy of open systems based on Unix, the computer operating system devised by AT&amp;T, with microprocessors manufacturered by Intel. The two companies shared a belief that the future of the industry lies in what Williamson likes to call the 'new way of computing'. Apart from a commitment to open systems, this involves computer power being distributed by networks across an enterprise, using many small desktop machines, rather than being centralised in a mainframe computer. Transition teams, involving people from both companies, began integrating the product range the moment the takeover was clinched, and three months before the deal was legally consummated. They found there was a lot less overlap than many had expected. Take, for example, network interface boards, the peripherals which allow a computer to connect to local and wide-area networks. There was only one serious conflict among 36 products made by the two entities. Nor was integration of the sales force too difficult, since the two companies had different areas of strength. NCR was particularly well placed internationally (some 60 per cent of its revenues came from outside the US) and in finance, retailing and state and local government. AT&amp;T was essentially North American and better represented in telecommunications, transport, manufacturing and the federal government. Culturally, too, the two businesses were a relatively good fit. Both were members of the eastern business establishment, but both had been through big shake-ups in the recent past. AT&amp;T, once a slow-moving, paternalistic bureaucracy, was turned into a more profit-oriented operation through a restructuring in the late 1980s. Since the merger, AT&amp;T headquarters has largely left the computer business to run itself, though NCR has been exposed to AT&amp;T's business methods by representation on the parent company's management committee and numerous cross-business initiatives. But while the combined business is reporting profits, these are modest and are partly dependent on NCR's two large non-hardware businesses - computer services and business forms. Moreover, while NCR is faring reasonably well in a depressed computer market, it still seems less dynamic than some of its most direct US competitors, such as Hewlett-Packard, which has been enjoying double-digit revenue growth. Nor is it clear how strongly NCR will grow when the US and European markets recover. Its areas of greatest strength, cash registers and banks' automated teller machines, are mature although the link-up with AT&amp;T will help it introduce more sophisticated offerings, such as an ATM which identifies customers by voice, rather than the numbers punched on a keyboard. Significant growth is likely to depend on gaining market share in the ferociously competitive general business computer market, and on using the AT&amp;T link to provide both innovative products and distinctive ways of solving clients' computer networking and communications problems. NCR now has one of the industry's broadest product lines, which is compatible across the range and fully dedicated to open systems. Elton White, the company's president, reckons AT&amp;T has given the company much stronger networking products. However, open systems by definition allow customers to pick and choose equipment from the cheapest manufacturers or those who are fastest to market with new products, and neither AT&amp;T nor NCR have traditionally been known for strength in these areas. Moreover, some of the greatest profit opportunities in computer networking come from providing software. Many industry analysts feel NCR still lacks muscle here, though company officials argue that AT&amp;T's celebrated Bell Laboratories may add to their strength. Even less certain is how far AT&amp;T's telecommunications businesses and NCR will take advantage of the convergence of the two industries. Williamson says six cross-business initiatives set up after the merger have produced some early results, and he is enthusiastic about the potential. He insists that this depth of co-operation could not have taken place in an alliance between two separate businesses. The proof will come in the form of new products. The company is promising to unveil the first 'computing telecommunications' product next year and Lee Hoevel, who heads the technology and development division, says NCR can spend three to five years just 'strip mining' inside Bell Laboratories, 'going after ore that is already there, buried by a small layer of dirt of disuse'. 'As mergers go, so far so good,' says Bob Allen, chairman of AT&amp;T. 'We've done better than most people expected, but the jury's still out. It's probably going to be five years before people can look back and say this made sense.' An article on AT&amp;T's wider strategy appeared on the Features pages yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Heinz Schmitz: "Bonn Has Ambitious Plans for </F> Europe"]    [Text] In the two-day Franco-German summit, due to open in  the Alsatian city of Mulhouse today, Federal Chancellor Helmut  Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand are planning to  develop together a program for a year's presidency in the  Council of the European Union [EU]. Against the background of  high unemployment, initiatives to promote economic growth and  employment will stand in the foreground. Germany is to assume  the presidency of the EU Council on 1 July, to be succeeded by  France in the first half of 1995.    In a government declaration on Europe policy that he  delivered in Bonn last Friday [27 May], Kohl said that his  objective was "to achieve certain agreement with our French  partners to make sure that what we begin during our presidency  can continue under the subsequent presidency." With measures at  the national and European level it is of prime importance to  fight unemployment, Kohl said.    This joint initiative is supported by the leading business  associations in both countries. A joint memorandum of the  Federal Association of German Industry [BDI], the Federal  Association of German Employers' Associations [BDA], and the  National Council of French Employers [CNFP], notes that the  successive German and French presidencies must be used to create  the conditions for a sizable improvement in Europe's competitive  strength and employment. From the business community's point of  view the decisive step toward improving the job situation in  Europe is to take some burden off the enterprises.    The starting point for a Franco-German initiative are  probably proposals EU Commission President Jacques Delors made  in his White Book on Securing Europe as an Economic Center.  Kohl picked up Delors' suggestions for more flexibility on the  labor market, reducing ancillary wage costs, creating new  employment opportunities, and special measures against youth and  long-term unemployment.    Yet, Kohl also mentioned the trans-European networks in the  areas of transport, energy, and telecommunications as suggested  by Delors. The objective is to create as quickly as possible a  fast rail link from London to Moscow via Paris, Frankfurt,  Berlin, and Warsaw.    In one point, Bonn seems to be getting near Delors, whose  position has been strongly supported by Paris. So far, the  Federal Government has regarded the creation of European  networks, particularly in the areas of energy and  telecommunications, as a task for the private economy, for which  only the preconditions ought to be created at the political  level.    What Bonn is eager to avoid is giving the EU the possibility  to finance its budgets via credits through these programs, as  was suggested by Delors.    Thus, Finance Minister Theo Waigel emphasized in the  Bundestag that for projects related to the transport  infrastructure, one was expecting "a sizable contribution by the  European Community, but no new credit instruments." In this  connection, Waigel mentioned two essential transport routes that  are important for Germany: the tunnel through the Brenner Pass,  and a high-speed east-west rail link from Paris via Nuremberg to  Leipzig and Berlin.    Apart from its program on employment promotion, Federal  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Mitterrand, in their talks  in Mulhouse, will also examine the timetable for European  monetary union. As a precautionary measure the chancellor  pointed out that compliance with the stability criteria as laid  down in the Maastricht Treaty would have precedence over keeping  up the timetable.    The cross-border fight against crime is also of major  importance for the Federal Government. Kohl and Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel emphasized in the Bundestag that the  fighting of the narcotics mafia, illegal arms trade, and  cross-border crime require the creation of a European policy  authority and agreement on a common asylum policy. Another  focus of Bonn's European projects is intensifying cooperation  between the EU and the reformist countries in Central and East  Europe.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Corporate operators ready to take a slice of the caring market: Today sees the implementation of the government's care in the community initiative which moves the onus on to local councils CARING for people is set to become a serious business sector with large operators moving in to challenge small providers - as long as there is enough finance to make it profitable. The reforms are designed to create a 'mixed economy' in care, with local authorities purchasing services but contracting out delivery to the private and voluntary sec-tors. Local authorities will be required to spend 85 per cent of social security transfer funds - about two thirds of their total care in the community grants - in the independent sector. That will not be hard,since local authorities provide only a minority of places in homes. But there will be a battle royal between competing providers for the new business. The residential care market is something of a cottage industry, with large numbers of small, owner-managed homes. But there is growing activity by big corporate providers such as Takare, Westminster Health Care, Crestacare and Ashbourne Homes, and from voluntary sector providers such as the Anchor Housing Association and the Abbeyfield Society. As the reforms reduce the flow of people entering residential care the smaller homes will come under increasing pressure from corporate operators. Mr Keith Bradshaw, chairman of Takare - the biggest corporate provider, still with only about 2 per cent of the market - believes many smaller homes are not economically viable. Many local authorities have hived off their own former homes into trusts which will count as part of the independent sector for financing purposes. The private sector suspects it may face unfair competition from these and from National Health Service community services trusts, which will also be regarded as independent providers. The private sector is far less developed in day care and home care - which is where growth will be. Here, initially at least, the voluntary organisations will make the running. Today's reforms provide the biggest opportunity yet to bring a fundamental policy shift in provision of welfare services from public authorities to the voluntary sector. Some household name charities are likely to become very large welfare service organisations as a result of the reforms. The British Red Cross and Age Concern are setting up central contracts units to support branches in negotiations with local authorities. Even so, the voluntary sector still has worries. Some fear loss of independence and campaigning power if charities become too dependent on public-sector contracts. Others fear that local authorities will not pay an economic price for charities' services. Many charities have had to cost their services for the first time - and concluded that in the past they were receiving far too little in public grants. Age Concern has expressed 'grave anxiety' about charities subsidising public services to the detriment of other activities, stressing that local authorities should pay an economic price for services purchased from charities. The private sector has similar concerns about the rates local authorities will pay for services such home helps - unglamorous activity, but vital if the objective of helping dependent people stay in their own homes is to be achieved. Ms Lucianne Sawyer, who runs Care Alternatives, a non-profitmaking organisation in London, and is president of the UK Home Care Association, says: 'It really doesn't make much difference whether you are a profitmaking organisation or not, because there is so little profit there. Maintaining quality is essential, and we insist on high standards from association members. But they are competing with people who puts cards in newsagents' windows. Home care will not work if it is regarded as a cheaper alternative to residential care.' The care in the community reforms are also being watched with keen interest by the insurance industry. Long-term care insurance is a recent innovation in the UK market, but since 1991 policies have been available providing residential and home care benefits.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE BIG COMPANY. . .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Takare  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Largest private-sector provider of nursing home care with 2 per cent of   the market Stock market capitalisation pounds 217.6m 1992 turnover pounds 48m, pre-tax profit pounds 11.8m No. of beds 4,785.

Much will depend on finance, including some people   discovering they have to pay for services that may have been free in   the past.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- AND THE COMPANY FLOTATION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Westminister Health Care  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Second to Takare in provision of private nursing home beds Stock market capitalisation pounds 132.6m, at issue price of current   flotation Forecast pre-tax profit 1992-93 pounds 9.3m No. of beds 3,,096.

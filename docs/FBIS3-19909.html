			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "J.-F.R.": "When Mitterrand Fans the Flames"] </F>   [Text] The hazards of timing would be worrying if we did  not know that the president of the Republic is a past master in  the art of adapting to them. It was just as Employment Minister  Michel Giraud was beginning to receive the trade unions to  explain to them the virtues of the vocational training contracts  [CIP] (or at least what remains of them) that Francois  Mitterrand emphatically returned to his favorite theme, the  protection of social achievements. His aim was probably mainly  to go back over the recent G-7 meeting devoted to employment.  "I and others in France have worked very hard to ensure that  the big countries deal with the actual problems of their fellow  citizens," he stressed.  <H5>  Defender of the Welfare State </H5>   "That has been made possible because a few big countries are  no longer advocating wage cuts or questioning social protection  as a remedy for unemployment, although many countries still are  tempted to do so."    A temptation for whom? At all events, it is impossible not  to see a relationship between the head of state's remarks and  the slogans hostile to the vocational training contracts which  are resounding in most of France's cities. Of course, Francois  Mitterrand, despite the Socialists' defeats, "clings" to the  image he intends to leave to posterity -- that of the defender  of the weak and oppressed. His statements probably differ  little, at least on this point, from those made at the G-7  meeting by Bill Clinton, one of whose avowed objectives is to  prepare for the future by allowing wage earners to "gain higher  qualifications and wages." On this point alone, because by  stating, some 20 days before the signing of the GATT agreements  in Marrakesh, that "there will only be lasting progress when  social clauses are included in international agreements," the  French president, even with the best intentions--who can  decently approve of the shameless exploitation of child labor or  political prisoners?--is nonetheless invoking the virtues of  protectionism to eliminate relocations which destroy jobs.    After having worked for a more open European single market,  after having started the privatization of government companies,  and after having allowed the power of the trade unions to  decline, the president of the republic has stood out for one  year now as the defender of the welfare state, which is being  undermined by the increase in world trade, the decentralization  of capitalism, and the recession. By fanning the funeral pyre  of a vocational training scheme doomed before it was born, what  could he hope to gain from the 750,000 young people without  jobs? Probably their support...</p>

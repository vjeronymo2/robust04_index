			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jesse Torres Jr.] </F>   [Text] A large group from the underground Christians for  National Liberation (CNL) bolted from the National Democratic  Front (NDF) this week.    The breakaway group composed of priests, pastors, nuns and  seminarians from the National Capital Region (NCR) have also  formed the Organisasyon ng mga Kristiyano para sa Sambayanan  (OIKOS) [Organization of Christians for the People].    "We are tired of the endless debate," OIKOS secretary  general, Reverend Librado Espiritu, told Philippine News and  Features (PNF). "It hinders our work from moving on. We believe  we have to make a new organization and redefine roles."    In a statement issued at its founding congress, OIKOS blamed  those loyal to exiled Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP)  leader Jose Maria Sison for destroying the CNL. OIKOS said "the  free space of intelligent, sober and comradely debate (in the  underground movement) has become a suffocating vacuum." The  statement also said "the noble CNL of 1972 has become a  subservient slave in 1994."    Espiritu explained that OIKOS is not "another force" in the  leftist split, but a "distinct group" that offers an  alternative. OIKOS recognizes the history, tradition, heritage  and action of the CNL, Espiritu said.    OIKOS is Greek for household. It is the root word for  economics, ecology and ecumenism. In its biblical meaning, it  covers the whole inhabited world.    One of the most influential NDF member-organizations, the  CNL  recently split into pro-Sison and anti-Sison factions. Last  week, Reverend Felipe Patricio, CNL national chairperson joined  other NDF officials who have "rejected' the leadership of NDF  chief Manuel Romero and spokesperson Luis Jalandoni. Former  priest Jalandoni was himself a former CNL member.    Despite the break, OIKOS adopted several of CNL's  "fundamental tasks" including armed revolution. The group said  it will continue to build mass bases, and serve in communities.  It will also continue to aim to "unite Christians in the  revolutionary movement" and help in its advance.    Felipe de San Jose, former secretary general of CNL in Metro  Manila, said OIKOS will help broaden, the "united front" and  mobilize support for the revolution "under the leadership of the  proletariat, not necessarily the CPP."    San Jose said OIKOS will engage in parliamentary struggle,  stressing that this is not secondary to armed struggle. "We  don't want to equate revolution with war. We launched a  revolution to stop war and the causes of war," he told PNF. He  said five OIKOS members were running in the 9 May barangay  [village] elections.    OIKOS believes in a "theology of wholeness," in contrast to  the theologies of liberation and struggle popularly espoused by  Christian activists, San Jose called this a balancing of faith  and ideology. "What we are after" he said, "is the goal, the  vision of a society where there is equality and fraternity,"  beyond the victory of the revolution.    Meanwhile, CNL spokesperson Reverend Wesley Fiore denied  last  Monday the claim by former CNL chair Fr. Felipe Patricio that a  "Sison faction" has drawn the CNL into the internal rift of the  Communist Party.    In a press statement to the INQUIRER, Fiore said Patricio  can  no longer speak for the organization since he was expelled from  the organization by the CNL's national council last 20 April.    Fiore said Patricio was expelled for "conduct unbecoming of  a  CNL chairperson and a comrade" after he was accused of contempt  for the CNL constitution and inciting the membership for  rebellion against the national leadership of the organization.    "It was unfortunate that Father Patricio was too eager to  `meet the press' to create the illusion that the CNL is for the  estranged `NDF democratic bloc' of which, it turned out, he has  long been a secret member," Fiore said.    "The CNL respects the private persuasion of Fr. Patricio but  denounces his attempts before media to deliver the organization  to a political faction, well intentioned perhaps, but alien to  the CNL's principles," Fiore said.    The NDF, the umbrella organization of underground leftist  organizations, has also been rocked with debates on political  line and revolutionary strategy and tactics which has earlier  resulted to a split between "reaffirmists" and "rejectionists"  in the CPP.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 'BOOTLEG' UNITS: BLESSING OR BLIGHT?;  </P> <P> HOUSING: TO OFFICIALS, ILLEGAL ROOM RENTALS ARE A SAFETY HAZARD. TO RENTERS,  THEY'RE AFFORDABLE LODGING.  </P> <P> Dennis Cassity's beach house is a modest place, really. OK, so it's a garage.  </P> <P> But such a cozy garage! Tiled bathroom, kitchenette, wall-to-wall carpeting, a  patio with an ocean view, only steps from the sand, on one of the better  streets in Hermosa Beach -- all for about $100 a month less than the cheapest  one-bedroom in town.  </P> <P> "Of course, I knew it was illegal!" the 40-year-old computer repairman said  with a laugh, recalling when he moved in 4 1/2 years ago. "I was born and  raised on the beach. I know a bootleg (apartment) when I see one. But I was  going through a divorce and, well, you throw in two ex-wives and child support  -- I just wanted something I could afford."  </P> <P> So Cassity settled for a rental on the beach side of Hermosa Avenue and the  wrong side of the law. And though he has been comfortable there, he was not  surprised last month when he learned his apartment had been built without a  permit in a place where apartments are not allowed. His landlord gave him the  word last week, he said -- he has to be out by the end of June.  </P> <P> Welcome to the underground of the Southern California real estate market, where  one man's misdemeanor is another man's home. No one knows exactly how many  "illegal dwelling units" there are in the Los Angeles area, but planning and  building authorities say they have become an irksome fixture in garages and  spare rooms throughout the region and a particularly troublesome problem in the  beach cities.  </P> <P> City officials hate them for the crowding and safety hazards they cause,  claiming they make a mockery of zoning laws. Renters, on the other hand, say  they are one of the few sources of affordable housing for young adults, single  parents, the elderly and the poor in densely packed and high-priced  communities.  </P> <P> In Manhattan Beach, where a one-bedroom apartment rents for $750 a month or  more, about 100 bootleg complaints a year are filed with the city's residential  zoning inspector. Culver City, on the cramped Westside, launched a crackdown in  March. Redondo Beach, which logs about five bootleg complaints a month, last  year caught a landlord on the city's north side who had lined his wine cellar  with bunk beds and rented it out to 16 Latino immigrants.  </P> <P> "Illegal units have been a problem for as long as I've been here, and that's  been since 1978," said William Grove, director of building and safety for  Hermosa Beach. "At any one time, we've got a solid core of 25 to 30 cases."  </P> <P> Every few years, he said, the city launches a new enforcement campaign, but the  problem always seems to return. The most recent get-tough effort involved  hiring a special prosecutor in November to concentrate on enforcing the city's  anti-bootleg laws.  </P> <P> The first of those special prosecutions is scheduled to go to trial May 9 --  against Cassity's landlord, Edward W. Roszyk of Redondo Beach. Besides  Cassity's cheery bachelor apartment, Roszyk is accused of having added at least  two other illegal units to single-family homes he owns, one taking up 120  square feet at the back of a Manhattan Avenue garage, and the other in the  garage of a shingled cottage down the street from Cassity's place.  </P> <P> The units have prompted city prosecutors to charge Roszyk with a dozen  misdemeanor violations of the Uniform Building Code, the Uniform Plumbing Code  and the Municipal Code.  </P> <P> One afternoon last week, Roszyk tacked up hand-lettered FOR SALE signs on two  of the three properties named in his case. On one of the properties, a handyman  dismantled what court records say had been a garage apartment with an extremely  low-slung loft bed.  </P> <P> Roszyk declined to comment on the charges. But interviews with the city's  prosecutor and court records indicate he is taking steps to cooperate with the  city. If he complies, the city may drop the charges.  </P> <P> But, according to an affidavit by city building inspector F. Paul Conreal,  Roszyk has been reluctant in the past. He was offered the chance last summer to  voluntarily shut down his bootlegs, and "his response was that he would not do  anything (to comply) because he felt there was selective enforcement . . . and  he was being singled out and harassed."  </P> <P> Roszyk's tenants -- and other supporters of bootlegs in the beach cities -- say  he has a point.  </P> <P> "I don't think the landlord was that much in the wrong," said 24-year-old Jeff  Gunn, who said he paid Roszyk $400 a month for one of five units in what was  supposed to be a single-family home with a garage.  </P> <P> "There's garage conversions everywhere -- everyone wants to live by the beach."  </P> <P> A Manhattan Beach renter, who spoke on condition that her name be withheld,  agreed.  </P> <P> "I'd rather have a lot of little houses for people than these big, giant houses  they're putting up in Manhattan Beach that I'll never be able to afford unless  I win the lottery," the woman said.  </P> <P> She does not live in a bootleg herself, she added, but she shares a house in  which one bedroom has illegally been converted to a bachelor apartment.  </P> <P> "If my landlord can cheat and, in turn, save me money, I'm not going to tell on  him," she said, adding that as a resident, she is far more offended by the  trend toward tearing down little beach cottages and erecting two- and  three-story mansions in their place.  </P> <P> "You want to talk about codes," she said, "let's talk about these people who  block everybody's view with 5,300-square-foot homes in tiny little love shack  zones."  </P> <P> But there's another side of the argument: the side, for example, of the people  who live next door to illegal apartments. Consider the observations of Roy A.  Judd, who lives next door to the Roszyk property where Gunn lived.  </P> <P> "He (Roszyk) is getting $2,600 a month total income off what's supposed to be  one single-family dwelling," Judd said. "But there are six people living there  with no legal parking places, and so there are six times the cars, six times  the trash and six times the people going in and out at all hours of the night."  </P> <P> For the first few months after Roszyk remodeled the house next door to Judd's  in 1984, Judd said he didn't complain because the tenants there were friendly  and quiet.  </P> <P> "But then they moved out and he rented it to a bunch of party animals who  seemed to live in split shifts," Judd said. "There were 24-hour-a-day parties.  Twenty people in the hot tub at 2 and 3 in the morning. . . . Finally enough  was enough. The neighbors declared war."  </P> <P> Judd fired off a flurry of letters to City Hall. Other neighbors followed suit.  At one point, he said, about 15 people marched over to the city manager's  office to complain about the bootleg and the noise.  </P> <P> Such feuds, city officials say, are the most fruitful source of tips about  illegal apartments. In Roszyk's case, it was the complaints of his angry  neighbors that prompted the city not only to crack down on him, but finally to  hire the special prosecutor.  </P> <P> And the battles can be bitter. In 1988, for example, the annexation of the  unincorporated Orange County community of South Laguna to Laguna Beach left the  city with 119 new complaints about bootlegs. When the city launched an effort  to phase the units into compliance, the result was an all-out war.  </P> <P> A recall campaign was launched, and city officials soon found that their own  building records were being probed. The community development director got  caught with an illegal addition. A city councilman was nabbed with an improper  den off his garage. But most dramatic was the case of building inspector John  Hingula, who ended up suffering an anxiety attack and quitting his 10-year job  because the pro-bootleggers revealed that his mother-in-law had a bootleg and  the inspector hadn't cited her.  </P> <P> As soon as the complaint arose, Hingula had it corrected, city officials said.  But the incident "became political," Hingula told The Times afterward. When he  passed out at work on the day after he removed the stove and opened up the wall  that had turned his mother-in-law's house into a duplex, he decided to quit his  job, he said. Former co-workers at Laguna Beach City Hall said he has since  moved with his family to El Salvador.  </P> <P> One problem with bootlegs, city officials say, is that they are rarely built in  compliance with fire and other safety codes, and so can be hazardous for the  tenants.  </P> <P> "I saw one guy try to rent out what he called a 'single' that consisted of a  six-foot-high basement area that was 60 square feet, with the appliances  plugged in next to the water heater for the main house," said Mike Magdaleno,  senior code enforcement officer for Redondo Beach. "The appliances were a hot  plate and a microwave, and the ceiling was so low that you bumped your head  every time you walked up the stairs."  </P> <P> Often, Magdaleno and others say, the inhabitants of such places are elderly  people. In those cases, city officials say the best they can do is to bend the  rules to give the landlord and tenant extra time, so the tenant can find a new  home.  </P> <P> "But it's a very sensitive and delicate social issue," added Kyle Butterwick,  community development director for Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> Only rarely do bootleg cases reach the point of criminal prosecution. Most of  the time, just the threat is enough to prompt a landlord to dismantle the unit  and evict the tenant, authorities say.  </P> <P> "But then the property changes hands," said Manhattan Beach zoning inspector  Bee Wilkening, "and another quote-unquote 'creative' owner thinks that maybe  something can be done with the property.  </P> <P> "And wouldn't you know it," said Wilkening, laughing, "the complaints you got  before start coming around again."  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> MARSHALS EXONERATE DEPUTY IN SCUFFLE  </P> <P> The county marshal's office has exonerated a bailiff who was accused of  manhandling a Vietnamese interpreter in a back hallway of the courthouse in  Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Deputy Marshal Richard H. Emmons, who is a bailiff to Superior Court Judge  David O. Carter, was cleared of wrongdoing in an Oct. 17 scuffle with  interpreter Jamie Nguyen.  </P> <P> Nguyen, 33, said she is considering filing a lawsuit against Emmons over the  episode, which began when Emmons was escorting a prisoner through a private  courthouse hallway used only by court personnel.  </P> <P> Nguyen said Emmons, 42, had come at her "like a mad dog" when she got in his  way, twisting her arm behind her back and wrestling her to the ground.  </P> <P> Emmons said that she had defied his orders to move aside and that her conduct  had endangered the security of the watch he was keeping on his prisoner.  </P> <P> Emmons has been told by superiors not to discuss the incident or the  investigation. A marshal's office spokesman said it is department policy not to  release the results of internal investigations.  </P> <P> But sources familiar with the outcome confirmed that Emmons has been exonerated  of wrongdoing.  </P></p>

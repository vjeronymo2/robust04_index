			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara's pressure for the dispatch of Turkish  forces to Bosnia is creating a new situation. The Greek  Government is now considering the likelihood of being compelled  to send Greek troops to join the peace forces in Bosnia.    According to information available at the Foreign Ministry  and the National Defense Ministry, the United Nations will  accept the Turkish proposal for the dispatch of Turkish troops  as Blue Helmets [UN forces] in Bosnia.    Referring to this possibility, Foreign Minister Karolos  Papoulias said yesterday that a new situation is developing with  pressure by Turkey, which the Greek Government has to address.    The Greek Government has been intensely preoccupied since  yesterday with the new developments. Our diplomats have already  put pressure on UN officials so that the Turkish proposal will  not be accepted because Turkey falls within the guidelines of  international conventions that define which states cannot  participate in the peace forces.    Along with the diplomatic moves, the competent departments  of  the National Defense Ministry are also vigilant. A number of  meetings have been held at the National Defense Ministry and  officials of the [Greek] Pentagon said that Greece is prepared  to address any eventualities.    Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos also stressed in a  statement the requirement that no Balkan country should  participate in the UN peace forces in Bosnia. Mr. Venizelos  said that Greece is following the developments with particular  attention and makes a joint appraisal of all the facts. The  spokesman stressed: What is of primary importance is that  Balkan countries and countries that have historically been  involved in the problem must not participate in the UN military  forces in Bosnia.    Responding to a question on convening the party leaders'  council under the chairmanship of the president, the government  spokesman said that the government does not oppose the principle  of such meetings but it does not seem that there is a specific  reason now for a party leaders' meeting under the president.  Besides, he added, the basic options of the government's  foreign policy cover a broad political spectrum and move within  the framework that was formulated at the recent meetings of the  party leader under the president.    Deputy National Defense Minister Nikolaos Kouris, in a  statement to a private radio station, said: The Greek position  on the participation of military forces from other Balkan  countries in the former Yugoslavia is firm. However, if there  is a case of military involvement by other Balkan countries in  the situation that now prevails in the Balkan region, then the  government might find itself in need of reconsidering its  position. This is something that we will see in the course of  things, Mr. Kouris concluded.</p>

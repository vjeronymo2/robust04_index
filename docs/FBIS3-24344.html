A legal basis has been laid, and organs  of multilateral cooperation in economics, defense, and foreign  policy have been established and are functioning. The  Coordinating-Consulting Committee and the Executive Secretariat  of the Commonwealth have begun active operations. A unified  economic space is being formed, although it is not simple, on  the basis of the Treaty on Formation of the Economic Union.    We declare our sincere resolution in carrying out the will  of  the peoples of our states to broaden and strengthen the  traditional, historically established relations of friendship,  cooperation and mutual understanding among our states on a new  basis.    In the given historical stage, under the difficult  conditions  of the transitional period, it is vitally important to preserve  everything good that bound our peoples together through the  centuries of common history in politics, economics, culture,  humanitarian ties, and personal dealings and on this basis  develop cooperation on a qualitatively new level. Respect for  the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the states, mutual  trust and openness, renunciation of the use of force, the threat  of force, and economic pressure, resolving disputes by peaceful  means, non-intervention in internal affairs, conscientious  performance of obligations assumed, and mutually advantageous  partnership should become the foundation of interstate relations.    It is essential to be aware of the exceptional nature of  this  stage in the life of our peoples, who are living through not  just a political and economic transformation, but also a  profound psychological change, growth in national  self-awareness, and the rebirth of their own spiritual cultures.    Under these conditions we, the heads of states, politicians,  as well as cultural, scientific, and artistic figures, and all  the citizens of our states must show balance in evaluations of  one another and an attitude of cherishing the priceless heritage  acquired by our peoples and the possibility of civilized  development on the basis of sovereign equality in the system of  international relations.    We affirm that the most important thing, on whose behalf we  aspire to strengthen trust among ourselves, is international  consensus as the highest political, ethical, and human value.    The members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, in  introducing their national currencies, will strive to establish  free, civilized exchange of national currencies and solve  problems in mutual payments. This should create the objective  conditions for evaluating the possibility of forming a payment  and currency union by stages.    We all need one another's support, cooperation, and mutual  understanding today. The future of our peoples, security,  stability, and peace and tranquility in the homes of simple  people depend directly on the level of trust among the members  of the Commonwealth of Independent States.    We, the heads of state and also of governments, must show  maximum wisdom, good will, and responsibility and do everything  possible to perform the obligations assumed by the Commonwealth.  Willingness to reach reasonable compromises will make it  possible, without infringing on the interests of sovereign  states, to progress along a constructive path and jointly shape  an effective treaty-law basis for our cooperation in the name of  the flourishing of our peoples.    The experience of the 2 years of existence of the  Commonwealth of Independent States convinces us that  constructive dialogue, multilateral consultation, and  consideration and respect for the positions of the partner  foster a real consolidation of the political and economic  independence of the members of the Commonwealth of Independent  States and help them achieve a high level of integration.    The Commonwealth of Independent States has demonstrated its  openness in practice. Its participants have grown. While  permitting each state to realize its own choice as to political  and economic order according to its own specific features and  nationality characteristics, participation in the Commonwealth  has created the necessary political and socioeconomic conditions  for building a democratic society in each of them.    The sovereign members of the Commonwealth, as independent  and  equal subjects of international law, preserve to themselves the  right to participate in world and regional organizations.    Recognizing the importance of maintaining peace and  stability  within and among the countries of the Commonwealth of  Independent States, the heads of state of the Commonwealth  members have agreed on the need for new efforts to strengthen  the peace-making potential of their states. Expressing concern  at the continuing armed conflicts arising on the soil of  expansionism, nationalism, chauvinism, xenophobia, and religious  intolerance, the participants of the Ashgabat meeting take note  of the importance of efforts to bring these phenomena to a  prompt end and are filled with determination to broaden  cooperation with one another in this sphere and do everything  necessary, including collective measures aimed at peaceful  settlement of armed conflicts and eliminating the causes that  lead to their occurrence in the future.    We, the heads of the states of the Commonwealth of  Independent States, expressing the will of our peoples, declare  our readiness to do everything we can to ensure a normal life  for people, provide them with social guarantees, prevent forced  migration, and ensure conditions for economic stabilization and  the realization of large-scale development programs.    We express our profound conviction that the political,  economic, and humanitarian potential of the Commonwealth of  Independent States is a powerful guarantee that the historic  challenges facing our peoples will be met.

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEALTH BOMBER ENDS SUCCESSFUL 3RD TEST FLIGHT  </P> <P> The B-2 Stealth bomber ended the longest and most secretive of its three test  flights over the Mojave Desert on Saturday with a safe landing here, an Air  Force spokesman said.  </P> <P> The bomber, which resembles a bat, took off at 8:30 a.m. from Edwards Air Force  Base and landed there four hours and 36 minutes later, Capt. Tess Taft said.  </P> <P> Brig. Gen. Richard M. Scofield, program director for B-2 System Program Office,  called the bomber's third flight successful. "We are extremely pleased with  today's mission," Scofield said in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> The B-2's flight Saturday "was by far the longest, highest and fastest thus  far," Taft said.  </P> <P> The aircraft flew at 25,000 feet and at speeds of up to 300 knots, or about 345  m.p.h., she said. In the previous two flights, the bomber never exceeded a  height of 10,000 feet, speed of 180 knots or two hours in the air.  </P> <P> "The primary mission was to check out the systems and see how it flies," she  said. "That's what test flights are for, to go a little bit higher, fly a  little bit faster."  </P> <P> As in the July 17 and Aug. 16 flights, the bomber was piloted by Air Force Col.  Richard S. Couch and Northrop chief test pilot Bruce Hinds, Taft said.  </P> <P> She did not have any other details about the flight.  </P> <P> The abbreviated second test flight of the radar-evading B-2 on Aug. 16 was  scrubbed in mid-flight because of a tiny crack in a part provided by a defense  contractor once fined for billing fraud.  </P> <P> A hairline crack in a casing of an accessory drive, which powers the  $530-million jet's generators and controls, caused oil pressure to drop during  the earlier test flight, Taft said Friday.  </P> <P> The bomber's two-hour maiden flight was called a success.  </P> <P> Unlike the previous two test flights, the flight Saturday was not announced in  advance by the Air Force.  </P> <P> The government has spent about $22.4 billion on the B-2 program, which is 18  months behind schedule. Congress has balked at paying more than $500 million  apiece for 132 bombers.  </P> <P> Engineers claim that the use of composite materials combined with its smooth  leading edges give the bomber a tiny radar signature making it nearly  impossible for Soviet systems to detect.  </P></p>

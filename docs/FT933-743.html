Three outstanding cases in the UK are scheduled to be heard in January. They involve charges of false accounting against Mr Nazmudin Virani, former chairman and chief executive of Control Securities, Mr Mohammed Abdul Baqi, former managing director of Attock Oil, and Mr Imran Mohammed Ahmad Imam, an assistant to Mr Swaleh Naqvi, BCCI's former chief executive. The SFO has issued three arrest warrants in connection with the cases. They cover Mr Ghaith Pharaon, a former BCCI depositor now believed to be in Morocco, Mr Mohammed Moizul Haque, a senior accounting officer at the bank, and Mr Basheer Chowdry, BCCI's UK general manager. Mr Haque and Mr Chowdry are both thought to be in Pakistan. The SFO investigation is continuing and officers say they expect more arrests in future. One active part of the inquiry is taking place in the Cayman Islands in co-operation with the Royal Cayman Island Police. Warrants have not been issued in the UK against Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, BCCI's founder, who is now in Pakistan, but an SFO official said yesterday: 'If Abedi landed at Heathrow he would certainly be arrested.'</p>

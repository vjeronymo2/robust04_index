			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, February 18 (XINHUA) -- NATO is cautiously  optimistic about the Serbian withdrawal of heavy weapons from  around Sarajevo in compliance with the NATO ultimatum, a NATO  spokesman said here today.    Although Bosnian Serb Forces have announced they are  withdrawing their big guns from around Sarajevo, NATO's  ultimatum is still in effect, he said.    News reports reaching here said that NATO Air Forces  deployed  in Italy are conducting training flights in preparation for  possible strikes against Serb artillery positions.    Earlier today, Bosnian Serb leaders announced that Serb  Forces will complete their withdrawal of heavy weapons from  around Sarajevo before the NATO ultimatum expires by midnight  GMT on Sunday [20 February], or will place them under the  control of U.N. peacekeeping forces.    In return, the Bosnian Serbs have demanded that Russia send  troops into Sarajevo to prevent the Bosnian Moslems from taking  advantage of the Serb withdrawal.    Reports indicate that Bosnian Moslem Forces have also agreed  to hand over their heavy weapons to U.N. peacekeeping forces.    Under the NATO ultimatum, artillery must be withdrawn from a  20-kilometer exclusion zone, or put under U.N. control.    The Clinton administration has warned the Serbs there will  be  no extension of the deadline.    In New York, Joe Sills, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali, said that the removal of Serb heavy weapons  was "moving ahead at a very good pace."    He said the Moslem Forces were also complying with U.N.  demands.    It is believed that Serb Forces have about 500 heavy  artillery pieces. The Moslem Forces have fewer guns, but more  infantry troops.</p>

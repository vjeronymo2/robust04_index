			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREENBERG WITHDRAWAL  </P> <P> I have developed a serious addiction, and this week was in danger of going into  severe withdrawal. Where was Peter Greenberg's column? I so look forward to his  wit and insight every Sunday morning, and slink sadly away from my Times Travel  Section when he's not there. I hope this was only a rare oversight. But since  his column was missing several weeks ago as well, I felt it warranted a  protest.  </P> <P> MEG THIDWICK, Los Angeles  </P></p>

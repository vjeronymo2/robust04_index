			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Sacked workers may claim up to Pounds 2bn if Lords reject appeal The House of Lords will today begin hearing appeals from the administrators of Paramount Airways, and the receivers of Leyland Daf and Ferranti, in a case with far-reaching consequences. If the appeal is rejected, thousands of employees who lost their jobs at other companies which failed will also be able to make claims against the receivers and administrators who took over the businesses. Such claims could reach Pounds 2bn. Payments to individuals would depend on the case and the employment contract. The accountancy firm Arthur Andersen, the receiver of Leyland Daf, the automotive group, and Ferranti, the electronics group, joins Touche Ross, the administrator of Paramount, in today's appeal. The case has been taken to the Lords because of a court ruling in March making receivers and administrators responsible for the contracts of employees at troubled companies. If receivers and administrators kept employees on after a 14-day period, they were deemed to have 'adopted' the company's pay and benefits obligations. The ruling, which made it more likely that employees would lose their jobs quickly after a company failure, was superseded by the Insolvency Act in May. This measure absolved receivers and administrators of responsibility for employment contracts after the 14-day threshold. But receivers and administrators are still potentially liable for jobs lost at companies between 1986, the date of the previous Insolvency Act, and March's court ruling. Because of time limitations on claims, the period for which damages could be sought is likely to be between 1989 and this year. Some workers will have taken new jobs and may not wish to pursue claims, which could render the final payout much less than Pounds 2bn. In some cases, claims would be met from the assets of the company to which administrators were appointed. In most cases, the claims will fall on receivers, who are personally liable, unlike the administrators. In the Leyland Daf and Ferranti cases, the receivers are in a good position to meet claims because they still hold assets from the companies involved. If the Law Lords grant the appeal, the threat of having to meet huge claims will be lifted from the insolvency profession. A judgment is expected in the new year.</p>

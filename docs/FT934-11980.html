			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Demand for wool at rising prices built up further at Australian sales in Newcastle, Geelong and Freemantle this week. There were full clearances, with only between 1 per cent and 2 per cent passed in. The AWC market indicator yesterday rose 17 cents to a seasonal peak of 485 cents a kg, a level last recorded early in February when the market was falling towards its April low point. It is now widely accepted that the market is past its worst in the recession and that the stockpile itself may yet be liquidated painlessly. In consuming markets business is better but buyers are reluctant to follow the rise.</p>

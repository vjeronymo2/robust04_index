			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Chechen leaders accused Moscow of elevating  terrorism to the level of state policy, but stated that "under  no circumstance will they resort to return measures." On  Monday, the Chechen Foreign Ministry circulated a statement  which lays the blame for such a policy on the Russian  authorities.    The attempt on the life of President Dudayev on May 27 was  merely the latest terrorist act carried out by the Russian  special services over the three years since the Chechen state  came into existence, says the statement. [passage omitted]    "Under the cover of democratic rhetoric, the Russian  leadership is undermining the sovereignty of Chechnya," says  this document. "All this is taking place amid reports about  forthcoming talks between Boris Yeltsin and Dzhokhar Dudayev,  although the Chechen leaders have not received any official  proposals," says the statement.    The Chechen authorities believe that the actual plans of the  Russian leaders boil down to "backstage contacts between  Russia's high-ranking officials and dubious figures, who have  compromised themselves by anti-democratic actions in the Chechen  Republic," says the document.</p>

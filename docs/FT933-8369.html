			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / International Company News: Swiss wake up to winds of change  -Once content with modest returns from their protected home market, SBC, UBS and Credit Suisse are now among the world's more profitable banks / Exchange-rate turmoil has reinforced traditional safe-haven status Once content with modest returns from their protected home market, SBC, UBS and Credit Suisse are now among the world's most profitable banks, reports Ian Rodger THE SWISS, according to a joke they like to tell against themselves, get up early but they wake up late. The big three Swiss commercial banks - Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) - were among the slowest to wake up to the liberalising winds that swept through the world banking industry in the 1980s. Comfortable in their protected home market, they were content to make modest returns on their exceptionally strong capital bases. But the revelation by UBS last Thursday of first-half consolidated net income of SFr1.29bn (Dollars 845m) - 40 per cent of it coming from overseas operations - indicates that they are now wide awake and among the world's more profitable commercial banks, as well as the soundest. Credit Suisse will report its first-half result on Wednesday and SBC on September 2. Both are expected to reveal profit growth similar to the 89 per cent surge at UBS. The transformation at these banks dates from about two years ago, when their traditionally dependable profit streams were coming under increasing threat and the need to cut costs and develop new sources of income became pressing. In Switzerland, they were forced to break up the pacts by which they long shared dominant positions in the lush domestic securities markets. And with the end of the cold war and the stabilisation of west European currencies, it looked as if the country's role as a safe haven for capital was becoming obsolete. Meanwhile, a deepening domestic recession was exposing the excessive commercial banking capacity in the Swiss market. Like the Japanese, the Swiss take a long time to get moving, but once they do, they tend to move quickly. In the past couple of years, more than 60 banks have disappeared, and CS Holding, the parent company of Credit Suisse, virtually completed the process of domestic rationalisation in April with its SFr1.6bn acquisition of Swiss Volksbank. Abroad, the three turned equally decisive. In 1991, after seven years of struggle, UBS finally began to see some profits from its acquisition of Phillips &amp; Drew in London. Coincidentally, Credit Suisse was bailing out its First Boston investment banking subsidiary in New York and SBC was forming what has turned out to be a highly profitable alliance with O'Connor, the Chicago derivatives partnership. By the first half of this year, these efforts were paying off handsomely, as the UBS results show. But the Swiss have also been very lucky. Fiscal troubles in Germany, political upheaval in Italy, explosions within the European exchange rate mechanism - this is the stuff on which safe havens thrive. Since last summer, huge sums of money have poured into Swiss banks, mainly from Germany and Italy, but also from other European countries. This enabled the Swiss National Bank to start lowering interest rates long before its counterparts in other continental European countries. From a peak of more than 9 per cent in May of last year, the three-month Euro-Swiss franc rate has plunged to 4.5 per cent. While banks in other European countries are only beginning to be able to widen their spreads, Swiss banks have been doing so for nearly a year. In its typically cautious way, UBS managed to hide much of the positive impact, recording only a modest 10.9 per cent gain in net interest income in the first half. (UBS raised its bad loan provisions in the first half by SFr265m, rather more than the SFr188m by which it raised its net interest income. For a bank that was shrewd enough to avoid any exposure to Robert Maxwell, Polly Peck and Olympia &amp; York, this performance is, to say the least, implausible.) But the main contributor to the UBS profit gain was trading. The bank's profits from securities and foreign exchange trading soared by 144 per cent in the first half to SFr1.55bn, due to an extraordinary combination of positive forces. Foreign exchange markets continued to be active in the first half, as the yen rose against the dollar and various European currencies were under pressure against the D-Mark. Bond markets have risen and the London stock market, where UBS is a leading participant, was also buoyant. The Swiss stock market has been a spectacular performer, with a 26 per cent advance in the all share Swiss Performance Index since the beginning of the year. Analysts were fulsome in their praise for UBS. A couple worried about the excessive contribution of volatile trading income to profits, but Mr Derek Bullman of London broker James Capel said any reduction in trading income in the near future would be offset by continued recovery in other operations and reduced provisions. 'I am not worried about the bottom line at all,' he said. Analysts are also confident that Credit Suisse and SBC have benefited from the same factors that lifted the UBS result. 'Credit Suisse has already been getting a larger portion of its earnings from securities and commissions than the other two,' Mr Hans Kaufmann, head of Swiss brokerage research at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, pointed out. However, special factors make it difficult to estimate the results from both. Credit Suisse figures will include for the first time the activities of Swiss Volksbank, and no one knows how rationalisation costs or the roughly SFr400m of 'badwill' acquired as a result of paying less than book value will be treated. SBC profits should show the highest growth rate, but only because they will be compared with an exceptionally poor first half of 1992. Net income from operations plunged 30 per cent to SFr758m then, mainly because of the costs of reorganising the group's Swiss private banking subsidiaries and of integrating O'Connor. The shares of all three banks have performed extremely well this year, and analysts, while still confident of further profit growth, are becoming cautious about recommending them. 'They are not yet overvalued, but they will probably have a bit of a pause,' predicted Mr Daniel Koenig, banking analyst at Pictet in Geneva.</p>

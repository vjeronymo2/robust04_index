"It is precisely because of the lack of such control that we  have been unfoundedly accused so far," he said [word indistinct]  a meeting with Andrea Colombo, head of the International  Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) European Office, in the  Bosnian Serb political centre of Pale.    The two sides discussed humanitarian and political issues.    Krajisnik said he had conveyed to the ICRC official the  stand  of the Bosnian Serb leadership that the latest threat with NATO  air strikes was "not an ultimatum to the Serb side because such  a category in relations with the Serbian people is out of the  question."    "We believe that this is pressure aimed at restoring peace  in  Sarajevo and controlling heavy weapons so that it could be  established who initiates conflicts in this area," he said.    Krajisnik added that Colombo had informed him about visits  of  ICRC teams to prisons under Moslem control and promised to do  everything in his power to ensure the earliest possible exchange  of prisoners.    "Mr Colombo assured me that not a single member of the ICRC  missions working in this area would leave our territory after  NATO's ultimatum," he said.    Colombo said his visit was aimed at intensifying  humanitarian  operations in the entire area of the former Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which entailed cooperation of all sides.    "I must point out the cooperativeness of the Serb side,  which  today again agreed to participate in the realisation of our  programme," said Colombo.</p>

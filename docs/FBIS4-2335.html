			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Caroline Puel report: "Balladur Touches on Human Rights in </F> Beijing"]    [Text] Beijing -- A hint of malaise went through the  French delegation when Tienanmen Square resounded to the 19-gun  salute against the background of the Marseillaise and then the  Chinese national anthem. Standing in a brisk wind alongside  Prime Minister Li Peng, Edouard Balladur had time to contemplate  the historic esplanade of Beijing which was deserted. He  probably thought about the cynicism of realpolitik which meant  that, less than five years after the repression of the Chinese  democratic movement, firmly condemned at the time by France, he  was standing next to Li Peng, who is held responsible for the  massacre of hundreds of Beijing's citizens on this same  Tienanmen Square. This was one of the prices to be paid for  this four-day visit by the French Government chief to China,  which enabled the Chinese television commentator to stress  yesterday evening that "relations between France and China have  entered a phase of complete normalization," expressing the hope  that these relations "will be stabilized in a long-term view."    The element which would have made it possible to finally  close the Tienanmen chapter -- an invitation to Li Peng to visit  France, for which the Chinese were hoping -- did not come. "We  did not specifically discuss that question," Chinese spokesman  Wu Jianmin said, although he pointed out that "the two countries  decided to step up the rate of high-level visits." Indeed, the  French Government does not want the Chinese prime minister to  make an official visit during the presidential campaign and  hopes to find a diplomatic means of inviting President Jiang  Zemin instead or at least of only issuing the Chinese with an  invitation in theory, without any specific name or date.    The question of human rights in China and Tibet was  nonetheless the subject of a "select committee" meeting, at  French initiative, which brought together Li Peng and Edouard  Balladur, and Qian Qichen and Alain Juppe, the two foreign  ministers. No detail had filtered through yesterday evening on  this four-man meeting, which lasted around 20 minutes at the end  of the general meeting, which had been attended by around 30  participants. In particular, it was impossible to ascertain  whether or not Edouard Balladur handed over a list of political  prisoners and raised the case of Wei Jingsheng, the main Chinese  dissident who was again arrested on Tuesday.    Wei had been released last September after spending more  than  14 years in Chinese prisons for having called for democracy back  in 1979. Four Nobel Prize winners and around 40 prominent  French people asked Edouard Balladur to intervene on the  dissident's behalf. Yesterday, the Chinese spokesman described  Wei Jingsheng as a "fringe element, cut off from the real  Chinese situation," and expressed appreciation of the fact that  "France does not intend to interfere in Chinese internal  affairs" -- the customary expression when human rights is under  discussion.    During the general meeting which took place "in a very  constructive atmosphere," to cite French spokesman Bernard  Brigouleix, the two sides discussed economic questions more than  expected. Li Peng accepted the idea that the French presence in  Canton "should be strengthened" in a form yet to be defined.  The Chinese authorities had ordered the closure of the French  consulate in Canton in January 1993, thus punishing Paris  following the sale of French fighter planes to Taiwan. China  also announced that the second phase of work on the Daya Bay  nuclear power station will be carried out "in cooperation with  France." Purchases of wheat, a dam on the Yellow River, and  projects in the energy sphere (especially oil) and  telecommunications sphere were also mentioned.    Other projects were to be discussed by French Trade Minister  Gerard Longuet who is due to return to Beijing before the summer  at the head of a large delegation of industrialists, the two  sides announced. "French enterprises are not competitive with  regard to prices or quality," the Chinese spokesman nonetheless  said in a statement reported by Beijing television. This remark  stresses that the "success" of the visit is not yet certain,  notably because of France's failure to issue an invitation to Li  Peng.</p>

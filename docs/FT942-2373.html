			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Working Life: Pension relief for the self-employed - Finance If you are self-employed, in the UK, the second instalment of your income tax is due on July 1. This payment will be the second for the 1993/94 assessment. For those who have been in business for a number of years, it is based on profit earned in the 1992/93 tax year. One way of reducing the tax bill is to check that you are happy with the level of contributions paid into your pension scheme. You obtain relief at your highest rate of tax on premiums paid into a personal pension plan but only up to a certain percentage of earned income. The percentage is determined by your age, as the table shows. The earnings cap for 1994/95 is set at Pounds 76,800, up from Pounds 75,000 the previous year. The 'carry back' rules allow pension premiums made now to be treated as if they had been made in 1993/94 so that the tax relief becomes available immediately, instead of being delayed until the tax due on the 1994/95 assessment is paid next year. Since the tax relief is granted at the rate for the earlier year, the carry back provision is useful if you have moved from being a higher rate taxpayer to the lower band. Eileen Doherty, tax manager at Fiona Price &amp; Partners, independent financial advisers, says: 'If you were a higher rate taxpayer last year and pay Pounds 5,000 into a personal pension plan now, you could cut tax due next month by Pounds 2,000. You need to complete a claim form and send it to your Inspector of Taxes with a receipt from the pension provider.' You cannot carry back any further than one year unless you had no taxable earnings in 1993/94, in which case you could go back to 1992/93. But no further than that. 'Carry forward' provisions let you 'mop up' unused pension pension contributions from the past six years but you must have first used up all the present year's allowance. Andrew Frape, tax partner with chartered accountant Wheawill &amp; Sudworth, says people often overlook the fact that life assurance premiums paid under a pension policy can also qualify for tax relief. The limit is 5 per cent of earnings regardless of age. Note that this is not in addition to those limits listed in the table. Do not, however, increase your pension contributions only to reduce tax. Consult a fee-based independent financial planner or your accountant to see if it fits in with your wider financial plans.  --------------------------------------------------                CONTRIBUTION LIMITS  --------------------------------------------------                                     % of Age on April 6                    earnings  -------------------------------------------------- 35 or less                          17.5 36-45                                 20 46-50                                 25 51-55                                 30 56-60                                 35 61-74                                 40  -------------------------------------------------- Figures shown are for personal pensions for tax years 1989/90 onwards.

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The Japanese Election: Makiko Tanaka - The heiress / How candidates fared Japanese politics is a family affair, with seats often left to sons, daughters and even to a son-in-law. Ms Makiko Tanaka is the daughter of Mr Kakuei Tanaka, a former prime minister and a founder of the Liberal Democratic party's largest faction, the split of which led to the fall of the Miyazawa government. Makiko Tanaka stood and won in her father's old electorate of Niigata, having announced her candidacy at the family's bus company, Echigo Kotsu, which has been assisted by the many new roads and bridges built in Niigata during the reign of the scandal-stained Mr Tanaka. With her father's political support group officially disbanded, Ms Tanaka rounded up the remnants, and stood as an independent, as local LDP officials opposed her candidacy. Her success, she says, was due to 'the continuing respect for my father' and to support for 'my concerns for ordinary people'.</p>

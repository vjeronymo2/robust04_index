			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STARLING AND BRELAND WIN TITLES, NOW THEY'LL MEET AGAIN  </P> <P> A couple of former welterweight champions became champions again at Caesars  Palace Saturday night, one in a near-classic brawl that looked like something  out of boxing's bygone years and the other in a disgraceful mismatch.  </P> <P> The bell-ringer was Marlon Starling's come-from-behind, 9th-round technical  knockout of England's Lloyd Honeyghan, giving Starling the World Boxing Council  welterweight title.  </P> <P> The mismatch was Mark Breland's one-round destruction of an inept South Korean,  Lee Seung-Soon, giving Breland the vacant World Boxing Assn. title.  </P> <P> For reasons that remain part of the confused business of professional boxing,  the WBA consistently ranks South Korean boxers higher than the sport's two  other organizations. And almost every time a South Korean comes to the United  States to fight for a championship, he loses.  </P> <P> Breland had Lee on the deck in 40 seconds, and finished him in 54 seconds. For  that, Lee made $85,000.  </P> <P> For Breland (23-1-1), who earned $125,000, it was easy redemption. He had lost  his WBA title to Starling in 1987, then had a disappointing draw with Starling.  His original opponent Saturday was to have been WBA champion Tomas Molinares of  Columbia, who withdrew -- and was stripped of his title -- because of "severe  depression."  </P> <P> Starling-Honeyghan was a memorable bout between two tough fighters.  </P> <P> Starling (44-5-1) seemed to have won the first two rounds, when both fighters  were throwing bombs. Both started fast, and Starling rocked Honeyghan with left  hooks and short right uppercuts in the early going.  </P> <P> He staggered Honeyghan early in the second with a long right hand to the  forehead, but Honeyghan danced away from danger.  </P> <P> In the third, Honeyghan suddenly caught fire. On the attack, he chased the  unorthodox Hartford, Conn., boxer all over the ring. In the third and fourth  rounds, Honeyghan was throwing about a hundred punches a round, a tiring pace.  The most effective of the punches were thumping right hands to Starling's ribs.  </P> <P> At that point, it was difficult to see Starling holding together. But that was  the ebb. Then came the flow.  </P> <P> Honeyghan seemed to have tired badly by the fifth, and he looked it. His right  eye was closing, a big lump was growing over his right cheek and his nose bled.  </P> <P> Starling, sensing Honeyghan was fading quickly, turned up the heat in the  fifth. He worked him over on the ropes, and with a left hook knocked  Honeyghan's bloody mouthpiece into the second row of the press section.  </P> <P> In the sixth, Honeyghan was running and holding. Now the British champion was  taking a brutal beating. His distorted face and the roar of the 4,069 in  Caesars Pavilion evoked an earlier era in boxing, when fights such as these  were held behind locked warehouse doors in the middle of the night, or on  barges in the Hudson River.  </P> <P> In the 7th, 8th and 9th, the beating continued. The end came at 1:19 of the  9th. He simply crumpled over, not, seemingly, from any one punch, but from the  accumulation of Starling's crisp blows.  </P> <P> After the eighth, the ringside physician, Dr. Flip Homansky, checked to see if  Honeyghan had a broken jaw. Satisfied that it wasn't, Homansky let him  continue.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Honeyghan (33-2), who earned $650,000, went to the hospital for  X-rays afterward. Starling made $250,000.  </P> <P> Honeyghan, 28, must sit on the sidelines and watch Breland and Starling meet  for the third time, a match Breland's co-manager, Dan Duva, began talking up  immediately.  </P> <P> Starling was asked whether the much-described bad blood between he and  Honeyghan had now softened.  </P> <P> "Well, I'm not going to sleep with him," Starling said, straight-faced.  </P> <P> He simply wanted to demonstrate who the champion was, he said.  </P> <P> "I wanted to show the world that there is only one welterweight champion in the  whole, wide world," he said. "I went in there to get respect from Lloyd in the  ring. He was ready to quit in the fifth round, I knew then it was only a matter  of time."  </P> <P> The battered Honeyghan, stopped by the interview tent to make a short  statement, took no questions, then left for the hospital.  </P> <P> "Marlon gave me a great fight. . . .I wish him the best. He'll be a great  champion. He beat me, so he has to be the true champion."  </P> <P> At that, Starling stood up and hugged the former champion.  </P> <P> Breland, who was 110-1 as an amateur, thinks he has acquired the fire many in  boxing felt he lacked as a pro.  </P> <P> "Things were easy for me for so long," he said, "I had to learn that you have  to get mentally pumped up for this sport every time. Tonight, I felt real nasty  in the dressing room, like an animal. I felt great."  </P></p>

During a working meeting with his Brazilian  counterpart Celso Amorim at the Foreign Ministry yesterday,  Sunsiri decided to postpone the opening of a Thai commercial  bureau in Brazil. The minister decided rather to begin by  seeking to promote commercial and economic ties with Brazil, and  by sponsoring a seminar in 1994 for entrepreneurs to exchange  views and become acquainted with the economic situations in the  two countries.    For Sunsiri the main problem is distance, for which reason  Brazil "does not import products like jewels, electronics, and  textiles" from his country. In 1992 the bilateral exchange  stood at $367 million, of which $13.3 million are accounted for  by Thai exports. Brazilian sales on the Thai market amounted to  $353.7 million.    The Thai minister added that the two countries do not have  the same economic potential. In the technological field, he  said, Brazil is ahead in some areas, while Thailand is ahead in  others. "We must use this in joint investments, `joint  ventures,' and in cooperation with other markets," he said.  "Within the foreseeable future I see the economies of Europe  and the United States going through a period of recession, while  the economies of Asian and Pacific countries will grow."  Sunsiri said that in the 21st century Brazil will have to look  toward the Pacific in a different manner, as an alternative to  dependence on European and U.S. markets.    The minister is accompanied by three entrepreneurs: Kanchana  Thaichon, of Thailand's Chamber of Commerce; Prasert  Poongkumarn, senior vice president of C.P. Trading Company, and  Suphat Wibulseth, of the same enterprise. The C.P. Trading  Company is Thailand's biggest group, with investment in various  sectors such as farm industries and telecommunications. The  entrepreneurs will afterwards visit Santiago de Chile and Buenos  Aires.    The objective of the tour of Chile and Argentina is to sound  out opportunities for investment. Chile, the minister said,  will become a full APEC -- Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation --  member in 1995.    Brazilian imports from Thailand include natural rubber  products, motorcycle accessories, cameras, watches, and  teleprinters.</p>

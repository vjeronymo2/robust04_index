			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS APPROVE CANYON DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors Thursday approved a 69-home development in  Malibu's scenic Encinal Canyon after the developer abandoned plans to include  an 18-hole golf course, tennis courts and restaurant.  </P> <P> Opponents of the project were relieved that the developer, Anden-VMS Ranch  Malibu Venture, scaled down the development, but they argued that the 1.9 cubic  yards of grading needed to build the homes will alter the fragile character of  the area.  </P> <P> "Sixty-nine homes is the absolute maximum the zoning will allow if it were a  perfect situation, but this is not a perfect situation," Sally Womack, a member  of the West Malibu Community Council, told the supervisors.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 6 May (MENA)-- Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat has affirmed that if it were not for President Mubarak's  wisdom, endurance, and patience the agreement to implement the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles would not have  been reached.    In an interview with AL-JUMHURIYAH published today, 'Arafat  says that President Mubarak made phenomenal efforts to  accomplish this and that he has always been the best support,  authority, and honest adviser to the Palestinians.    'Arafat affirmed that the Palestinians are fully prepared to  enter Gaza and Jericho, pointing out that he will enter Jericho  in May to do his job as chairman of the Palestinian National  Authority.    President Mubarak has been our refuge whenever we  encountered  obstacles. If it were not for his endurance, his good  experience with the Israelis, and his firmness we would not have  been able to restore the lands, 'Arafat said.    Asked why he refused to sign the maps at first, 'Arafat said  that he trusted that the Palestinians would be bound by what  they signed and that the same would apply to Israel. The text  was inconsistent with the maps; they brought the blue file with  the amended text and annexed to it the old maps with the Israeli  viewpoint, he said. But after negotiations and with President  Mubarak's mediation, I agreed to sign. But I noted in my  handwriting that: "Jericho's borders and area and the Gaza coast  are under consideration."    'Arafat said: I trust that President Mubarak will back our  serious efforts to implement what we have achieved and to settle  later on the problem of inconsistencies between the maps and the  text.    Asked about the first decision he had made after signing the  agreement, 'Arafat said: In my capacity as chairman of the  Palestinian National Authority, I issued general instructions to  all Palestinian self-government authorities and other organs to  respect the rights of Palestinians wherever they might be and  regardless of political orientation.    Commenting on reports that the Palestinians are not prepared  to enter Gaza and Jericho in implementation of the agreement,  the Palestinian president said: We are fully prepared. He  affirmed that he will enter Jericho during May and that he will  do his job as chairman of the Palestinian National Authority  from his headquarters in Jericho.    'Arafat affirmed that every Palestinian citizen is entitled  to enter Gaza and Jericho. We will prevent no one from entering  and we will coordinate with the Israeli side in this connection,  he said.    The Palestinian president revealed that a large number of  Arab and foreign states, as well as the United Nations and all  its affiliated organizations have made requests to establish  accredited representation offices in Jericho. He added that the  European Union, the Islamic Conference Organization, and the  Arab League have also requested permission to open  representation offices. He welcomed all these organizations to  Palestinian national soil.    Touching on international assistance to the National  Authority, 'Arafat said that the World Bank has decided to grant  the Palestinians $2.2 billions to assist them in development  efforts and in arranging their household from within.    On the area of Jericho, 'Arafat said: We have reached a  compromise solution on the area of Jericho. As for the Gaza  coast, it will all be under the Palestinian National Authority.  We agreed to give the Israeli side an opportunity to exploit  some 7 kilometers for oil-related and other services. The  Palestinian navy will begin operating along the coast, where we  will have two ports along Gaza's Mediterranean coastal stretch.    Asked about the absence of any reference to a Palestinian  state in the agreement, and about the absence of any such  reference in Israeli officials' statements, 'Arafat said: In  spite of this, there will be Palestinian autonomy on our  national soil. No people in history who obtained the right to  rule themselves did not eventually establish a state.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Growth in M4 still sluggish INDICATIONS of continuing economic weakness were underlined by sluggish growth in the M4 measure of the money supply last month. M4 rose in the year to February by a seasonally adjusted 3.3 per cent, only slightly above the 3.2 per cent rise in the 12 months to January, the Bank of England said. The year-on-year growth in M4 - which takes in notes and coins plus deposits at banks and building societies - is only just inside the Treasury's 'monitoring range' established in the Budget of 3 per cent to 9 per cent. Bank and building society lending to companies and individuals rose by Pounds 700m in February. M0, the narrow measure of money which is mainly notes and coins, rose by 4.5 per cent in the year to last month.</p>

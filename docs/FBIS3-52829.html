An official of the mainstream Sudan People's Liberation Army  (SPLA) who asked not to be named said fighting broke out early  last week in areas east of Kaya, close to the Ugandan border.    Rebels have since killed 28 goverment soldiers, he claimed,  but refused to give rebel casualty figures.    An SPLA spokesman in Nairobi, Justin Arop, confirmed that  fighting was raging.    Arop gave other regions where fighting was also going on as  Bor, Yei, Morobo, areas between the southern Sudan regional  capital of Juba and Kit, and along the railway line in the Bahr  al Ghazal Province.    Ugandan officials said the fresh fighting had triggered a  new  influx of refugees into northern Uganda.    An estimated 3,000 Sudanese were arriving in the region  every  week, Ugandan deputy minister for local government Steven  Chebrot said.    Uganda has a Sudanese refugee population of 200,000. Some  70,000 of them have arrived in the past five months.    The SPLA has waged a decade-long war against the Khartoum  government to free the mainly animist and Christian southern  Sudan from domination by the Moslem, Arabised north.</p>

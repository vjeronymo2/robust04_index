			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department recognizes that there may be questions concerning the Department's use of interim rulemaking for subtitle D of title VI, but not for subtitle B of the title VI. Subtitle B provides public housing agencies (PHAs) with the option, subject to certain requirements, to designate public housing projects, or portions of these projects, for occupancy by elderly families, by disabled families, or elderly families and disabled families. Under subtitle B, to elect this option, a PHA must submit an allocation plan to the Department for review and approval before designating a project for occupancy by one of the three categories of families listed in the statute. Additionally, for projects to be designated for occupancy by disabled families, the statute requires the PHA also must submit, and receive approval of, a supportive service plan. The Department added requirements, by regulation, to the allocation plan and supportive service plan to supplement those set forth in the statute. For this reason, it was necessary to provide the public with advance notice and public comment before making those regulatory requirements effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, to the extent that this subtitle D rule, which concerns section 8 housing, and the subtitle B rule, which concerns public housing, address similar issues, the public comments on the subtitle B rule are applicable to this interim rule. Both statutes (subtitle D and subtitle B), which permit housing to be reserved for occupancy by elderly families, may have the affect of reducing housing assistance for non-elderly disabled persons. Subtitle D attempts to minimize the reduction of housing assistance for non-elderly disabled families by limiting the preference for elderly families to covered section 8 housing that was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families. Subtitle D also requires owners of these covered projects to reserve units in the covered project for disabled families who are neither elderly nor near-elderly, and the number of units to be reserved is determined in accordance with the formula established by the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subtitle B attempts to minimize the reduction of housing assistance for non-elderly disabled families by requiring housing authorities that designate projects for elderly families to submit a plan for securing sufficient additional resources that the agency owns, controls, or has received preliminary notification that it will obtain, or for which the agency plans to apply that will be sufficient to provide assistance to not less than the number of non-elderly disabled families that would have been housed but for the designation of the project for elderly families. Further, both statutes prohibit the eviction of any tenant lawfully residing in a section 8 covered project or a public housing project because the project is to be reserved for elderly families or to be designated for elderly families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Persons with disabilities commenting on the subtitle B rule were concerned about the possible reduction of public housing assistance for non-elderly disabled families as a result of projects designated for elderly families, and several requested that the Department not permit designated housing. The Department anticipates that persons with disabilities will have the same concerns about the subtitle D rule, and perhaps make similar comments. However, in both cases, the statute permits the reservation or designation for projects for occupancy by elderly families, and the Department cannot preclude this an as option for project owners or housing authorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Persons with disabilities commenting on the subtitle B rule requested that the Department carefully monitor the statutory protections provided for non-elderly disabled families. The Department anticipates that persons with disabilities commenting on the subtitle D rule will make similar comments. The Department will monitor both the subtitle D reservation, and the subtitle B designation, to ensure, to the extent possible, that there is minimum adverse impact on non-elderly disabled families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Persons with disabilities commenting on the subtitle B rule stated that their concern about loss of access to projects designated for elderly families should be construed to mean a concern about reduction of housing assistance generally, and not concern about loss of access to ``elderly'' projects. These commenters stated that an integrated housing setting is not a project that houses only elderly families and disabled families. The commenters asked the Department to make available section 8 assistance to non-elderly disabled families so that they could live in housing with ``mainstream'' populations. The Department anticipates that similar comments will be made by persons with disabilities on the subtitle D rule. The Department will make every effort to increase section 8 housing assistance for non-elderly disabled persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the statutory framework of the system of preferences for elderly families authorized by the subtitle D rule, the Department reiterates that, except for the types of documentation a project owner should be able to produce to support a determination of eligibility to make the election of preferences, there is very little that will change at the final rule stage as a result of public comments. Given the similarity of certain issues addressed by subtitle D and subtitle B, the Department also reiterates that those comments received on the subtitle B rule and that are applicable to this rule were taken into consideration in developing this interim rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although this interim rule is being published for effect within 30 days from the date of publication, the Department requests comments from the public on this interim rule, and the public comments will be considered by the Department in development of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, in accordance with the Department's policy on interim rules, the amendments made by this interim rule to parts 880, 881, 883, 884, and 886 will expire on the twelve-month anniversary date of publication of this interim rule unless extended by notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or adopted by a final rule published on or before the twelve-month anniversary date of publication of this interim rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Matters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This interim rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review.

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Asian-based tabloid sells 20,000 THE PEOPLE newspaper, a Sunday tabloid, sold an estimated 20,000 copies at the weekend of its new Asian edition, edited for the Asian community. It is the first national newspaper to produce a separate edition for the UK's people of Asian origin, who number more than 1m. The lead headline in yesterday's edition - the second issue - reported: 'Bloodbath fears halt Hindu unity march.' Other reports said Bangladesh was on a war footing in preparation for an attack from Burma; profiled Ms Kim Vithana, an actress; and told of Wild West, a film to be shot in Southall, west London, a leading Asian centre. A guide to Asian radio stations is also provided, and the latest Asian videos. For more traditional Asians, the special news from the sub-continent will sit uncomfortably with some of The People's more traditional fare. This week's issue had eight pages of Making Love - 'the guide to better sex that all Britain is talking about'. Mr Bill Hagerty, editor of The People, accepted that traditionally minded Asians were unlikely to buy his newspaper. His main market is young second-generation Asians for whom English is their first language. Mr Hagerty said: 'What sells in Indian films is sex. Once you couldn't kiss in Indian films - now you can kiss.' The newspaper sells about 2.2m copies a week. The Asian edition is being targeted at the main centres of Asian population such as Southall, Leeds and Bradford. The People has been planning the Asian edition for the past three months with the help of Mr Daljit Sehbai, a publisher who has been acting as consultant. If the Asian edition boosts circulation, The People believes, other national newspapers may follow.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECTS CAUGHT IN ARMED ROBBERY OF BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE  </P> <P> A man and a woman were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of taking $100 at gunpoint  from a beauty supply store, police said.  </P> <P> The robbery occurred shortly after 1 p.m. when a man walked into Regal Beauty  Supply and demanded money after showing the store's lone employee a handgun,  Police Sgt. Bob Gustafson said.  </P> <P> The gunman then fled the store with the money and ran to a blue pickup parked  outside the store in the 800 block of North Tustin Street, Gustafson said.  </P> <P> The store employee ran out of the shop and yelled to two passers-by that she  had been robbed, Gustafson said.  </P> <P> The passers-by followed the gunman, who turned to them before getting into the  truck, pointed the gun at them and warned them not to get involved, Gustafson  said.  </P> <P> The gunman got into the passenger side of the truck, and the woman drove off.  </P> <P> The passers-by followed the suspects in their car but stopped when the gunman  got out of the truck and "again pointed a gun at them and told them to quit  following," Gustafson said. Moments later, a police officer spotted the  suspects' truck, pulled it over and arrested them. The money was recovered,  police said.  </P> <P> Booked on suspicion of robbery were Danny Lee White, 40, of no known address,  and Jeanette Carpenter Jorgensen, 38, of Chino.  </P></p>

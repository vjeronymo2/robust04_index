			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Brewer plans to shed 300 jobs CARLSBERG-TETLEY, Britain's second-largest brewer, is to shed about 300 jobs as part of a rationalisation affecting three of its breweries and several depots, Guy de Jonquieres writes. The company said the cuts were caused by keen competition in a declining beer market. Most of the redundancies will be at breweries in Burton, Wrexham and Northampton. The company also plans to close or relocate three depots in Wales, with the loss of 12 jobs.</p>

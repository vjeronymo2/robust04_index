			<p>BFN     [Text] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who was in  Nancy, stressed the need for the NATO ultimatum:    [Begin recording] [Juppe] The Serbs must now carefully  consider their responsibility. They must commit themselves to  de-escalation and they must understand that the negotiating  process remains constantly open. They must therefore stop their  attacks, their shelling, their killing. Once more, everyone  must sit around the negotiating table.    [Unidentified correspondent] Do you agree with Prime  Minister  Balladur, who said yesterday evening that what is now happening  in Gorazde is shameful?    [Juppe] Obviously. This is why we have fully committed  ourselves to obtain an end to all this. I remind you that the  UN Security Council resolution is a French initiative which was  passed by a unanimous vote, including the Americans and the  Russians. We later supported the idea of a more robust  commitment by the Atlantic Alliance. The proposal for a summit  between the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the  United Nations is a French idea put forward by the president of  the Republic and the government several day ago. I hope that we  will also move forward in that direction. [end recording]  [passage omitted]</p>

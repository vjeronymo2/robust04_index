			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Three-fold rise at Dyno despite 'difficult' year DYNO INDUSTRIER, the diversified Norwegian group, yesterday reported a three-fold increase in 1992 pre-tax profit to NKr160m (Dollars 23.1m) from NKr54m a year earlier. Group sales fell to NKr7.5bn from NKr7.7bn as Dyno experienced a 'difficult year' in most of its main markets, caused by pressure on prices and the sale of its construction machinery business. Group operating profit rose by NKr26m to NKr329m and financial income improved by NKr55m to NKr212m. Plastics suffered an operating loss of NKr12m compared with a NKr69m profit in 1991. The explosives division made progress in the US and Australia but profits fell in Scandinavia due to low construction activity. Leif Hoegh, one of Norway's biggest shipowners, yesterday revealed a sharp fall in 1992 net profit to NKr173m from NKr368m in 1991. Freight income fell by NKr138m last year to NKr2bn, but operating and voyage-related expenses were the same as in 1991 at NKr1.5bn. Leif Hoegh said its 1992 performance wes satisfactory but admitted to difficult market conditions for combination carriers and container/bulk vessels. Group operating profit fell by NKr153m to NKr309m in 1992. The shipowner said that asset value increased last year to NKr2.3bn from NKr2.2bn.</p>

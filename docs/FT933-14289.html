			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith claims breakthrough in union links battle MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour party leader, yesterday claimed a 'breakthrough' in the first round of his battle with the unions over their links with the party by striking a deal on sweeping reform proposals. Yet the initial reaction of some of the main union leaders was negative. Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, said: 'There has been some movement and that is encouraging, but we are still not able to support Mr Smith's proposals for the selection of local candidates.' A spokesman for the shopworkers union USDAW said last night: 'It is a small step forward but we are clear that unless there is some union element in any formula our delegates could not accept it.' Last night, Mr Edmonds faced bitter criticism from Labour MPs at a private meeting in Westminster after again backing the principle of unionists voting collectively in leadership elections and in the selection of MPs. Mr Smith had expressed delight when an internal review group of union representatives and Labour MPs backed changes in line with his own thinking on the selection of Labour candidates, the election of future leaders and on ending union 'block votes' at party conferences. The Labour leader attended the meeting and afterwards a spokesman said: 'The chemistry is beginning to work.' Mr Smith's confrontation with union bosses over the principle of one-member-one-vote has turned into a test of his leadership. But he still faces a struggle to win approval for the proposals on selecting candidates. The agreement goes to Labour's National Executive Committee on Monday. A summer of attrition between the Labour leadership and the union movement is likely before the party conference. The review group's report was agreed without a vote when representatives of the GMB and TGWU general unions, the most vocal opponents of one-member-one-vote, apparently decided not to try to block the plan. The group backed Mr Smith's insistence that only full Labour party members should vote in the selection of parliamentary candidates. Under a so-called 'levy-plus' system, Labour-supporting trade unionists would also have to pay a reduced membership fee, in addition to the political levy, to become members.</p>

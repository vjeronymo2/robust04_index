			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION 2-A WATER POLO FINAL;  </P> <P> DELAHUNT SCORES EIGHT, BUT SOUTH PASADENA TAKES TITLE  </P> <P> Three South Pasadena High School players each scored four goals to overpower  Costa Mesa, 17-12, in the Southern Section Division 2-A water polo final  Wednesday at Belmont Plaza.  </P> <P> Dan Cherrie, Eric Norvedt and Tim Rohr combined for 12 goals as South Pasadena  won its second consecutive 2-A title.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa was led by senior Corey Delahunt, who scored eight goals.  </P> <P> "I thought in the second half we were still in range," Costa Mesa Coach Jason  Lynch said. "I figured it was out of reach about the fourth quarter."  </P> <P> South Pasadena (26-4) led, 7-4, at halftime and was ahead 11-6 after three  quarters. The lead was extended to 15-8, with 3 minutes 58 seconds left to  play.  </P> <P> "They didn't do anything in particular, they were just the better team,"  Delahunt said. "They took advantage of size a little bit, but what can you  really say? They just beat us."  </P> <P> Costa Mesa seemed to let down midway through the third quarter when it was  unable to convert three counterattack opportunities.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa (18-10) was competitive early, causing problems for South Pasadena  offense in the first quarter. South Pasadena led, 3-2, after the first quarter  when Ben Johnson scored in a six-on-five situation with 51 seconds left in the  quarter.  </P> <P> South Pasadena came out strong in the second quarter, quickly stretching its  lead to 6-2 with 1:51 left in the half.  </P> <P> But Delahunt scored twice in the next minute to pull Costa Mesa within two at  6-4. Cherrie scored with three seconds left in the half to give South Pasadena  a 7-4 halftime lead.  </P></p>

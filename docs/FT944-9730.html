			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (5): Time is running out - Relations with the European Union Greece is used to its near-traditional role as both the bete noire and the enfant terrible of the European Union. In the economic field, it is the state furthest away from the meeting the 'convergence criteria' determining members' readiness for economic and monetary union at the end of the century. During the 1980s, Greece differed sharply from Spain and Portugal by suffering a continued fall in prosperity compared with its European partners. In foreign policy, Greece has frequently angered the rest of the EU over its intransigent position on the recognition of neighbouring Yugoslavia. During the summer, Greece was dogged by a series of problems over disbursement of EU funds earmarked for much-needed infrastructure projects. At the root of Greece's fraught relationship with the rest of the EU lies the task of achieving better economic convergence with the rest of Europe. The Socialist government of Andreas Papandreou is dependent on funding from Brussels to ease budget revenue shortfalls caused by the sluggish state of the economy. However, hopes faded soon after his return to power in October 1993 that Mr Papandreou would bring in urgent action to correct the country's economic imbalances. Formal EU monitoring of the Greek economy, put into place in 1991 after the granting of a loan from Brussels to shore up the balance of payments, has now lapsed, so the EU has no clear-cut lever to set conditions for the disbursement of Brussels largesse. However, annual transfers from the EU make up roughly 5 per cent of Greece's gross domestic product, so the Athens government is clearly vulnerable to vexation in the rest of the EU that it is not living up to standards of economic policy prudence. Greece is not the only EU country to have overshot earlier targets to bring down budget deficits. But its wayward economic record often results in its forecasts of improvement - particularly in the budgetary field - being treated with more than usual scepticism. Projections of increased fiscal revenue have proved grossly over-optimistic in recent years - one reason why the government's hopes of holding its budget deficit to a mere 10.4 per cent of GDP this year have been widely disbelieved. However, a new tax law aimed at reducing VAT evasion, combined with a generous settlement system for disputes involving back tax, has resulted in better than expected tax receipts this year. More than any other EU member, Greece remains beset by stagflation. At a time when the EU inflation average has fallen to 3 per cent, the Greek inflation rate is still about 12 per cent - and no lasting economic recovery is expected until 1996. While this degree of divergence persists, bringing the drachma into a formal exchange rate link to the European Monetary System will remain a pipe dream. As for the long-term goal of economic and monetary union, it is evident that countries in eastern and central Europe are far more likely than Greece to join a de facto European D-Mark zone later in the 1990s. Indeed, a chief strategic worry for the Athens government must be that, as the EU's centre of gravity moves to the north and east, the attitude of its partners towards economically divergent southern states will become steadily frostier. That could spell problems for Greece as the rules for disbursements of structural funds for poorer states are redrawn later in the 1990s. Present structural fund arrangements run until 1999. But in view of the likelihood that new members from central and eastern Europe will be competing for funding early in the next century, later conditions for distributing EU funds are likely to be much more stringent. Time for Greece to put its economic house in order has not yet run out. But by the end of the century, it may have done.</p>

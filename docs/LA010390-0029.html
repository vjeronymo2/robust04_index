			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A San Diego police officer was legally justified in shooting a 70-year-old man  last fall when the man fired a handgun at the officer in an attempt to keep his  son from being arrested, the San Diego County district attorney's office has  ruled.  </P> <P> Officer Andrew T. Hoffman had "no choice but to defend himself with deadly  force" when he fired 15 rounds at Lawrence W. Jarman, striking him in the groin  and leg during an altercation near 29th Street and Imperial Avenue, the  district attorney concluded.  </P> <P> Jarman, who recovered from his wounds, later pleaded guilty to brandishing a  firearm. The officer was not injured.  </P> <P> According to the district attorney's report -- dated Oct. 19 but released by  police Tuesday -- Hoffman and a civilian ride-along responded to a fight  outside Jarman's home Oct. 1. While attempting to arrest Jarman's son, the  officer was confronted by the elderly Jarman, who, according to the report,  appeared behind the screen door and demanded that Hoffman let go of his son.  </P> <P> In an interview after the shooting, Hoffman said he "turned around, looked at  the screen door and saw Jarman behind the door holding the gun with his arm  extended."  </P> <P> Believing the elder Jarman should have easily recognized him as a police  officer, Hoffman said, he began firing when the man did not lower his handgun.  </P> <P> Jarman, in a separate interview with authorities, said he genuinely worried for  the safety of his son, Lawrence W. Jarman Jr., during the fight.  </P> <P> "I told him (the officer) to get . . . off of my son or I'd shoot him . . . and  I meant it. I didn't know at the time he was a police officer."  </P></p>

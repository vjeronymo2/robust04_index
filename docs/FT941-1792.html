			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Major willing to compromise over EU voting rights Mr John Major last night raised the possibility of a two-tier voting system in the European Union to break the deadlock over voting rights when four new countries join next year. Amid intense diplomatic activity to end the stalemate which has pitted Britain and Spain against their 10 EU partners, Mr Major insisted the Council of Ministers' present voting arrangements must remain for contentious issues such as social policy legislation. But after a meeting with the prime minister, senior Conservative MPs said he appeared willing to allow the number of votes required to create a blocking majority to be increased from 23 to 27 for less controversial issues. Officials said Mr Major was studying a potential compromise involving a legally binding protocol that would allow countries mustering between 23 and 27 votes in the Council to postpone decisions indefinitely. The two-tier proposal would mean that 23 votes - representing two large countries and one small - would still be enough to block directives in areas such as employment policy, where Britain most fears an extension of EU authority. But the number would rise to 27 for other less contentious areas of legislation. Mr Major raised the possible compromise at a private lunch with senior Tory backbench MPs at which he insisted that Britain would defend implacably its position at this weekend's meeting of EU foreign ministers in Greece. The attraction of the suggestion was that it offered the hope of breaking the deadlock with Britain's European partners, while satisfying demands on the Tory back benches that Britain's power to veto contentious legislation must not be diluted. Whitehall officials cautioned that there might be serious practical difficulties in deciding which directives would fall into which category in any two-tier system. The proposal might also face strong opposition from other EU governments. But the substance of the compromise might be preserved in the suggested legally binding protocol that would allow decisions to be shelved indefinitely if countries representing more than 23 votes opposed them. Other suggestions include relating the size of the blocking minority to a population threshold or raising the number of votes required to 25. The full cabinet is expected this morning to endorse the government's tough negotiating line after a report from Mr Douglas Hurd on Tuesday's inconclusive meeting of the foreign affairs council in Brussels. The foreign secretary, who has looked uncomfortable with Britain's hardline stance, will set out the parameters for any compromise in a speech on Europe at the annual spring Conservative Central Council in Plymouth tomorrow. Later in the day he will fly to Athens for the meeting of EU foreign ministers. At Westminster, the delight in the Tory Euro-sceptic camp at Mr Major's stance appeared to have spread to much of the parliamentary party. Government whips claimed the prime minister's tough words earlier this week were supported by 90 per cent of Conservative MPs. But the sceptics' applause was tinged with contempt as to the motives behind Mr Major's startling change of tone. One leading Euro-sceptic said the prime minister had been 'speaking from the bottom of the chief whip's heart'. The number of votes to block decisions would not be 23 in a year's time, he predicted. Pro-European Tories continued to warn of a serious outbreak of internal party strife if Britain did delay enlargement.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Colombo, April 15 (AFP) -- President Dingiri Banda  Wijetunga Friday banned ruling party MP's [members of  parliament] from travelling abroad and said they should pay more  attention to their local constituencies in preparation for the  December presidential polls.    Wijetunga told his legislators that they "should devote  their  full time and energy to prepare" for the upcoming elections.  The travel ban will take effect May 1, Wijetunga said in his  letter released to the press Friday.    "I am sure you will appreciate that I have to be very strict  in this matter, in the interest of the government parliamentary  group, as well as in the national interest," he told the 125  legislators of the UNP [United National Party].    The ban followed the UNP's humiliating defeat at a key local  election last month. Analysts have said that the setback at the  southern provincial council could trigger a national trend.    The UNP came to power in 1977 and has since won every  election except the May 24 local council vote. The defeat has  sent shock waves through the UNP, which will field Wijetunga as  its presidential candidate in the December polls.</p>

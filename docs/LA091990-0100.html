			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNIONS TO SEEK BANKS' HELP IN THEIR NEW BID FOR UAL  </P> <P> The unions at United Airlines plan to hold a meeting with banks, perhaps as  early as today, in an effort to interest them in a new, $3.9-billion offer for  the airline's parent, UAL Corp.  </P> <P> The new offer of $175 to $180 a share is said to include around $150 in cash.  The rest consists of notes worth around $30 a share.  </P> <P> The unions, whose members include United's pilots, mechanics and flight  attendants, have invited representatives of about 20 banks to the meeting. The  unions face an Oct. 9 deadline to have their financing for the deal completed.  </P> <P> The new offer would be financed with $2 billion in bank credit and $2 billion  from other sources. Alternatives under discussion include notes from aircraft  and engine suppliers, equity from the pilots' retirement plan and the  sale-leaseback of aircraft.  </P> <P> The Wall Street Journal, quoting anonymous sources, reported in its Tuesday  editions that an unnamed foreign airline is interested in participating in the  deal. UAL's shares rose $7.625 Tuesday to $105 in response to the report.  </P> <P> One airline that might be interested is British Airways. It has a marketing  agreement with United, and it joined in an earlier, failed bid for UAL Corp.  The failure of that $300-a-share bid last October touched off one of the  biggest stock market plunges in history.  </P> <P> British Airway's role would be limited by federal rules that restrict  foreigners from owning more than 20% of a U.S. airline. A spokesman for British  Airways in New York declined to comment on its possible participation in a UAL  buyout.  </P> <P> So far, the unions have lined up four banks -- including Los Angeles-based  Security Pacific Corp. -- to help raise $2 billion. But neither Security nor  the other banks -- Manufacturers Hanover, First Chicago and Bankers Trust --  have committed any of their own funds to the proposed deal.  </P></p>

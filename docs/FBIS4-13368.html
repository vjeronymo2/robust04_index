			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut--The Lebanese Council of Ministers has  decided to sever Lebanon's diplomatic ties with Iraq, because  the latter refused to lift the diplomatic immunity of two Iraqi  diplomats the Lebanese authorities charged with assassinating  Talib al-Suhayl, an Iraqi opposition figure.    This was announced by Lebanese Information Minister Michel  Samahah at the end of a session held by the Council of Ministers  tonight. Samahah added that Lebanon has given the two Iraqi  diplomats 72 hours to leave the Lebanese capital, Beirut.</p>

This is equivalent to 300 kilograms  of pollutants for each inhabitant of Russia during the year. The  leaders in industrial discharges of solid substances are  Magnitogorsk, Nizhniy Tagil, and Chelyabinsk, as well as the  cities of Asbest, Troitsk, and Suvorov; the highest levels of  sulfur dioxide emissions have been recorded in Norilsk,  Monchegorsk, Nikel, Orsk, and Omsk; the highest levels of  nitrogen dioxide emissions are in Moscow, St. Petersburg,  Surgut, Asbest, and Omsk; the highest levels of carbon monoxide  emissions are in Novokuznetsk, Magnitogorsk, Lipetsk,  Cherepovets, and Nizhniy Tagil. Vehicle emissions are at the  highest levels in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Krasnodar, Omsk, Ufa,  Volgograd, Nizhniy Novgorod, Samara, and Voronezh. Calculation  methods based on the relationship between the total amount of  substance discharged and its allowable concentration are used in  the hygienic assessment of discharges of toxic substances into  the air. This coefficient, which is known as the "relative risk  coefficient," served as the basis for the categorization of  substances in order of risk and the cities where these  substances are present in the atmosphere.    The main substances recorded were benzpyrene, sulfur  dioxide,  and nitrogen oxides, which are connected with the substantial  emissions of power engineering facilities, and lead.    It must be borne in mind that official emission statistics  do  not reflect the whole spectrum of pollutants because some  enterprises do not submit this information in the necessary  detail. Furthermore, many enterprises discharging substances  containing toxic metals that are dangerous to human health are  not included in these indicators.    Official air pollution statistics also do not include  emissions of toxic metals resulting from the consumption of  solid and liquid fuel (coal and fuel oil). Calculations based on  information about the elements of fuel indicate that the  volatile microelements contained in coal--arsenic, mercury,  bromine, and antimony--enter the atmosphere along with thousands  of tonnes of vanadium, manganese, fluorine, and zinc compounds.  The estimated 80 million tonnes of fuel oil used each year in  power engineering pollute the air with thousands of tonnes of  vanadium, nickel, boron, and bromine and dozens of tonnes of  many other elements. Motor transport is a major source of lead  particles in the air of virtually all Russian cities (except  Moscow). These emissions can amount to 2,000 tonnes a year. An  assessment of the relative danger of discharged metals indicates  that lead is the main hazard--furthermore, it is the most  pervasive element--followed by compounds of vanadium, nickel,  manganese, and fluorine.    The relative danger of pollutants in the air of different  cities was judged by six types of substances (solids, sulfur  dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and  volatile organic compounds) listed in official reports.    The leaders in terms of the relative danger of emissions per  unit of municipal area are Norilsk, Nikel, Novotroitsk, Angarsk,  Monchegorsk, Novokuybyshevsk, Magnitogorsk, Cherepovets, Orsk,  Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Novokuznetsk, Nizhniy Tagil, Zima,  Zapolyarnyy, Sterlitamak, Lipetsk, and Salavat (Table 1).    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Many cities where the air is polluted by substantial  quantities of organic and inorganic substances--small and  medium-sized metallurgical cities in the Urals and the chemical  production areas in Stavropol Kray and in Kirov and other  oblasts--are not on the list.    A detailed description of the composition of emissions, with  a view to the makeup of organic substances and the presence of  metals, could change the ranking of cities considerably. The  problem of dioxins entering the air and the environment also  requires immediate action. Existing estimates and evaluations of  technological processes suggest that the existence of dioxin  could present problems in around 20 cities in Russia.    The large quantities of substances entering the air of  cities  are resulting in higher concentrations of pollutants in the air.  According to the 1992 state report on the environment of the  Russian Federation, levels of air pollution exceeding 10 times  the maximum allowable concentration (MAC) were recorded in many  of Russia's cities and industrial centers. The most highly  polluted cities with metallurgical industry include Lipetsk,  Magnitogorsk, Kamensk-Uralskiy, Krasnoyarsk, Nizhniy Tagil,  Novokuznetsk, Cherepovets, and Bratsk; the most highly polluted  cities with chemical industry include Berezniki, Omsk, Perm,  Tolyatti, Usolye-Sibirskoye, and many others. The combined  findings of air pollution studies by Roskomgidromet [Russian  Hydrometeorology Committee] indicate the presence of a variety  of pollutants in the air of many cities (Table 2).

The  results of air quality surveys at Roskomgidromet stations that  are published in almanacs provide no opportunities for assessing  the spatial features of pollutant distribution. Air pollution  levels near enterprises are much higher, however, than the city  averages. In the air near the Permneftorgsintez enterprise in  Perm, for example, the concentration of phenol can be as high as  22 times the MAC, the concentration of sulfur dioxide is 3.8  times the MAC, and the concentration of nitrogen dioxide is 6.6  times the MAC. The concentrations of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde,  acrylaldehyde, acetone, ethanol, and butanol in the air of  residential neighborhoods near the Khimvolokno and Azot  enterprises in Kemerovo are 250 times the MAC.    Higher concentrations of pollutants in the air are carried  for long distances encompassing sizable developed territories.  In Berezniki, for example, a city surrounded by potassium  production units, the concentration of many pollutants exceeds  the maximum allowable concentration even at a distance of 5  kilometers from the plant.    An analysis of some of the results of air pollution surveys  conducted by the public health service, scientific research  institutes, and departmental laboratories revealed even more  problems with air quality than those listed in the reports of  Roskomgidromet.  <H5>  Pediatrics and Air Pollution </H5>   The level (or quality) of public health depends on many  biological, socioeconomic, medical-organizational, and  ecological factors. An analysis of just one health  indicator--the number of children with chronic illnesses in  clinic records--throughout the Russian Federation reveals that  the number doubled between 1980 and 1990 and reached around 6.5  million in 1990. Therefore, one out of every five children had  one chronic illness. Of the 16 recorded types of illnesses,  there was a higher rate of chronic pharyngitis, nasopharyngitis,  and sinusitis (2.3 times the earlier figure), iron deficiency  anemia (1.5 times), and bronchial asthma (1.3 times). The  ecological component plays a significant role in the etiology of  all of these illnesses. It is possible that if there were  separate medical statistics for the urban population of large  industrial cities, the rise in the rate of illness would be even  more perceptible there.    Studies of the health of schoolchildren, conducted according  to a single set of methods over many years (1960-1990),  indicated that the number of virtually healthy children in the  first grade decreased over the 30 years from 60.8 percent to  45.4 percent, and the number in the eighth grade decreased from  59.8 to 47.9 percent. The rate of chronic illness in these age  groups rose from 39.2 to 54.6 percent (first grade) and from  40.2 to 52.1 percent for the eighth-graders.    The most severe effects of environmental pollution take the  form of the higher rate of infant mortality and the increased  frequency of birth defects.    Many studies of the effects of environmental pollution on  the  state of public health record a significant rise in various  indicators of illness among children, primarily respiratory  disorders.    Half of the adult patients have suffered from bronchial  asthma since childhood. In recent years this disease has grown  indisputably "younger." Cases of bronchial asthma in children in  the first months of life are no longer extremely rare. In some  cities the number of people with bronchial asthma is five or six  times as high as it was. In Moscow, for example, the rate of  bronchial asthma among children was seven times higher in 1981  than in 1949 (6.9 cases for each 1,000 children). In St.  Petersburg the number of children suffering from bronchial  asthma increased from 2.9 per 1,000 in 1982 to 3.7 per 1,000 in  1987. The number suffering from asthmatic bronchitis also rose:  from 6 to 7.7 per 1,000 (T. Pogorelova and I. Malysheva, 1986).  The rising rate of bronchopulmonary disorders is connected  largely with air pollution in the cities. The rate of upper  respiratory disease in children in the zone affected by chemical  production units in Samara is twice as high as the average. The  rate in neighborhoods near petrochemical production units and  petroleum refineries is 2.5 times as high; the rate near the  metallurgical combine is 4 or 5 times as high, and so forth. In  a city with metallurgical industry the rate of otorhinological  disease is 3-5 times the average near the combine, 2-3 times the  average at a distance of 1.5 kilometers from the combine, and  1.5 times the average at a distance of 6 kilometers.  <H5>  Moscow Statistics Illustrating Spatial Features of </H5> Distribution of Bronchial Asthma Among Children    The highest levels of air pollution are in the center,  northwest, and northeast of the city. The rate of bronchial  asthma in children within the territory of 110 pediatric clinics  here is three or more times as high as indicators in "clean"  districts of the city. All exceptions were closely correlated  with the spatial locations of major highways and industrial  enterprises. The loci of this illness are concentrated in homes  situated near the zoo, the race track, the perfume factory, and  other plants and major highways.    ...A direct relationship between bronchopulmonary disease in  children and the level of air pollution has also been discovered  in several other parts of the country. The very fact that twice  as many children in the Russian Federation died of bronchial  asthma in 1990 as in 1980 is indicative.    The results of clinical epidemiological studies of the role  of air pollution in the onset of pulmonary disease in children  in one of the most highly polluted Russian cities--Nizhniy  Tagil--are indicative.    Starting in the 1970s, more and more children in Nizhniy  Tagil began complaining of hoarseness and breathing difficulties  that did not fit the usual clinical definition of pneumonia or  typical bronchial asthma. The same child could suffer from  bronchial obstructions several times a year. This coincided with  the start-up of the bank of coke ovens in December 1986 without  the necessary dust and air filters. It was then that the rate of  tracheobronchitis rose and asthmatic attacks in children became  more common. The number of children hospitalized with bronchial  asthma in the city also rose.    The effects of air pollution are experienced by the  residents  of industrial cities and of small communities located near  industrial enterprises, gas and oil fields, and toxic waste  disposal sites. There is so little information about the state  of public health in these communities, and the findings of  existing studies can only be viewed as preliminary results.    The village of Cherkasskiy near Ufa has a population of  2,300. The village is surrounded on three sides by oil  refineries, a synthetic alcohol plant, and the "Khimprom"  enterprise. Concentrations of phenol in the air are 1.9-4.2  times the MAC, the level of hydrocarbons is 2.7 times the MAC,  and the hydrogen sulfide level is 1.5 times the MAC. Drinking  water does not meet standard requirements in terms of  organoleptic or chemical indicators. The children there are more  likely than those in the control group to suffer from disorders  of the respiratory organs, the central nervous system, the skin,  and the urinary organs. The rate of these illnesses is also  higher among adults, as well as the rate of cardiovascular and  otorhinolaryngological disease (materials of the Ufa Scientific  Research Institute of Human Ecology and Occupational Medicine).    The pollution of the air with emissions of specific  pollutants has had severe effects in several cases: Specific  symptoms and complex syndromes. The most disturbing and most  vivid examples are the effects of the operations of plants  producing protein-vitamin concentrates and other enterprises of  the microbiological industry....    The rate of bronchial asthma rose dramatically in Angarsk  after the start of operations at the protein-vitamin concentrate  plant in 1979. The number of cases of chronic upper respiratory  disease in children increased 7.3-fold and there was an  eightfold increase in the number of cases of chronic bronchitis.  The mass poisoning of the population occurred in 1988.    People living near plants producing antibiotics in Saransk  have complained of frequent pains in their joints and skin  rashes. The growth of antibiotic production has been accompanied  by coughing, sneezing, and allergic rhinitis. Special studies  attest to the specific allergization of the organism to  penicillin (52 percent of the respondents), the candida antigen  (54.5 percent), or both antigens (29 percent).    ...In the "aluminum" cities, just as in some other large  industrial centers, dental pathology is accompanied by changes  in the whole motor-reflex apparatus in children.    A special in-depth study of the children in Shelekhov, which  is the site of an aluminum plant, revealed that the frequency of  skeletal dysplasia was three times the average, corroborating  the data on the osteotropic properties of fluoric compounds.  <H5>  Physical Development of Children </H5>   A variety of functional and morphological defects in  children  exposed to the effects of air pollution arises virtually at the  time of birth. This is connected with the effects of air  pollution on the mother during pregnancy and prior to conception.    In Moscow the average weight of the newborns of mothers  living in the zone affected by emissions from the Motor Vehicle  Plant imeni Likhachev is 400 grams (or 10 percent) below the  average weight in the southwestern subway region.    Cities and villages of the copper ore mining and enriching  combines in the Urals have a higher number of children with  extreme anthropometric characteristics. These cities are marked  by lower indicators of body length at birth and less balanced  anthropometric indicators.    Children weigh less on the average in Novotroitsk near the  Orsk-Khalilov metallurgical combine and in Orenburg (materials  of the School of Hygiene of the Orenburg Medical Institute).    A comparative analysis of the growth standards of physical  development in infants and toddlers (the first three years of  life) for oblast centers--Ufa, Yekaterinburg, Nizhniy Novgorod,  and Samara--revealed that the worst indicators were in Ufa:  clear signs of increasing asthenia (narrow chest and minimal  weight combined with minimal growth). The physical development  of children in different regions of Ufa revealed verifiable  disparities depending on the intensity of the influence of  anthropogenic factors (materials of the Bashkir Medical  Institute).    Lower anthropometric indicators were also found in children  of pre-school age in the zone affected by emissions of boron  production units in Dalnegorsk, ferroalloy production units and  enterprises producing building materials (keramzit gravel and  asphalt) in Moscow, copper smelting and aluminum plants, and  many other production units.    In one of the most highly polluted neighborhoods in Moscow  (Kalininskiy Rayon), there were 5 percent fewer children between  the ages of 3 and 7 with balanced (or proportional) physical  development and almost twice as many children who were  underweight or overweight.    These deviations from anthropometric standards are  indicators  of the state of pediatric health at the time of the study and  indicators of possible subsequent changes. Children with maximum  deviations from average anthropometric characteristics are known  to suffer more frequently from pathological changes than  children who deviate little from the norm. An analysis of the  development of children in the "copper" cities of the Urals  indicates retarded physical and neuropsychological development  (these children are older when they take their first steps) and  delays in primary dentition. These children are also older than  the average when they begin speaking. Therefore, changes in the  normal physical development of children, particularly in  combination with an unhealthy lifestyle (hypodynamia, inadequate  physical training, and so forth), can lead to deviations in the  state of their health later as well. As a rule, however, it is  rarely possible to define the main external factor or only  external factor destroying the nervous system in children.  Special studies have established the influence of small doses of  lead, mercury, and organic phosphates (pesticides), a shortage  of iodine, and possibly of goitrogenic substances affecting the  neuropsychological development of children.    Paradoxically, the development of the system most vulnerable  to ecopathogenic influences in children, namely the brain, and  deviations in the neuropsychological development of children in  the zones of ecological stress have not attracted enough  attention from pediatricians, psychoneurologists, hygienists,  and ecologists.  <H5>  Health of the Adult Population and Air Pollution </H5>   It is difficult to assess the state of health of the adult  population in cities with higher levels of environmental  pollution. This is due to the lack of official statistical  reports and to the procedural difficulties of keeping records of  this kind, which require consideration for the role of  occupational factors, bad habits, and the lifestyle in general.  There are some studies that offer convincing evidence of the  negative role of air pollution.    The rate of chronic respiratory and pulmonary disease  (pneumonia, bronchitis, laryngitis, and pharyngitis) and otitis  in adults between the ages of 15 and 60 in Vladimir was 2.8  times as high in the zone affected by emissions from the  chemical plant as in the control group.    A detailed study of the effects of air pollution on public  health was conducted in Novokuznetsk.    The non-specific pulmonary disorders of workers of the  metallurgical combine were studied to assess the effects of air  pollution on the health of the adult population. In accordance  with hygienic air quality surveys in the developed part of the  city, workers were divided into one group living in the zone of  maximum air pollution, a second group living in regions with  average pollution, and a third in the zone of minimal pollution.    The engineering and technical personnel and employees of the  combine with no contact with occupational hazards of a chemical  nature were used as the control group. This method revealed some  tendencies in the combined effects of chemical pollutants on the  health of workers in production and non-production areas.    Perceptible differences were discovered in an analysis of  the  general rate of illness among workers living in the zone of  maximum air pollution and workers in the zone of minimal  pollution.    Unfavorable ecological conditions lead to the development of  occupational pathology. The Novokuznetsk aluminum plant workers  living near the plant, for example, were twice as likely to  suffer from occupational fluorosis. It developed much more  quickly in this group, and cases of toxic hepatosis and specific  changes in dental enamel were more common, reflecting the  influence of fluorides at work and at home.    A study of the effects of air pollution on the frequency of  requests for emergency medical treatment for cardiovascular and  pulmonary disease revealed a direct connection. The number of  requests for emergency treatment for cardiovascular disorders  was 2.4 times as high as in the zone with a relatively low level  of air pollution (materials of the Comprehensive Hygiene and  Occupational Disease Institute of the Siberian Department of the  Russian Academy of Medical Sciences in Novokuznetsk).    Similar patterns were observed in other large industrial  centers in East Siberia--Bratsk and Angarsk.    Indicators of requests for medical assistance by adults with  no relationship to occupational hazards were much more numerous  in Bratsk than in other cities in Irkutsk Oblast--Selenginsk and  Baykalsk. The population of Bratsk is more likely to suffer from  disorders of the nervous system, sensory organs, and  cardiovascular system (1.2-1.9 times as likely). Besides this,  the inhabitants of Bratsk are more likely to seek treatment for  immunologic disorders and diseases (N. Matorova et al, 1990).    A verifiable connection was established in Angarsk between  the levels of short-term air pollution in the city and the daily  patient rate--and in some years, the daily death rate. Chemical  air pollution was responsible for 6-21 percent of the  fluctuations in the daily patient rate (for different categories  of illnesses) and 2.7-19.4 percent of fluctuations in the daily  death rate (Ya. Leshchenko et al, 1993).  <H5>  Public Health and Food Pollution </H5>   Food can be the source and agent of many chemicals posing a  potential threat to human health.    The results of surveys conducted from 1988 to 1991/92  indicate that from 0.8 to 3.8 percent of the analyzed samples of  food products exceeded public health limits for lead, from 1.1  to 1.7 samples exceeded the cadmium limits, and from 0.4 to 4.7  percent exceeded mercury limits (V. Tutelyan et al, 1993).    High levels of environmental pollution by metals in the  environs of metallurgical production units can cause the  considerable accumulation of toxic metals in vegetables, fruit,  and berries. The content of heavy metals--lead, cadmium,  chromium, and nickel--is extremely high in vegetables and  berries grown between the cities of Revda and Pervouralsk in  direct proximity to [passage omitted in source]    In Russia as a whole, there were signs of nitrate pollution  in from 9.8 to 7.7 percent of all analyzed samples of food  products.    Levels of food pollution began to decline in 1990. The  degree  of produce pollution by pesticides also decreased (from 3.2-3.5  percent in 1988/89 to 1.7-2 percent in 1991/92), but pesticide  levels are still quite high in some parts of Russia. In  Krasnodar Kray, for example, pesticide use is two or three times  the national average.    Studies of the state of public health in different parts of  Krasnodar Kray indicate that high pesticide levels in  communities in grain and rice farming regions are accompanied by  higher rates of otorhinolaryngological disease, bronchial  asthma, tuberculosis of the respiratory system, severe  respiratory infections, and retarded physical development in  children. Changes in the state of health are less pronounced in  the adult population, but the rate of treatment for arterial  hypertension and disorders of the digestive organs is three  times as high.    The health of children is much worse in regions with high  pesticide levels in Rostov Oblast.  <H5>  Reproductive Health </H5>   The reproductive health of the population is one of the most  accurate indicators of public health and an indicator of local  ecological conditions.    Environmental pollution causes disturbances of endocrine  functions and the immune, hemopoietic, and other systems in  pregnant women and infants.    The rate of severe pregnancy complications is constantly  rising in Russia. The rate of pregnancy-related toxemia rose by  41 percent between 1981 and 1989, representing 7.7 cases per 100  births. Furthermore, cases of severe forms of toxemia--eclampsia  and preeclampsia--increased 4.8-fold. Pregnant women were 2.6  times as likely to suffer from anemia, twice as likely to suffer  from kidney disorders, and 21.9 percent more likely to suffer  from cardiovascular disease (N. Vaganov, 1991).    Although the rate of prenatal problems has risen everywhere,  the rise is more pronounced in large industrial centers, where  many women are employed in jobs with hazardous working  conditions.    In Ufa the rate of toxemia in pregnant women rose from 8.9  to  20.1 per 100 births in the last 21 years. This is almost three  times as high as the republic average. The reason is the  employment of many of the women at enterprises of the  petrochemical complex (Bashkir Medical Institute, 1992).    It is extremely difficult to gage the effects of  environmental pollution in these cities on the state of  reproductive functions. An analysis of the health indicators of  pregnant women not employed in hazardous jobs but living in  highly unsatisfactory ecological conditions confirms the  presence of significant disparities.    Women in the metallurgical cities of the  Urals--Kamensk-Uralsk, Kirovograd, and the Novokuznetsk  neighborhoods near the aluminum plant--were more likely than the  women in the control group to suffer miscarriages, spontaneous  abortions, premature births, and other pathological disorders.    A similar situation was recorded in Krasnokamsk in Perm  Oblast, the site of a pulp combine.    In Baykalsk and Bratsk, other cities with pulp and paper  industry, and in Shelekhov, a city with aluminum production  units, disorders of reproductive functions were much more severe  than in a "cleaner" city in East Siberia.  <H5>  Infant Mortality </H5>   The rate of infant mortality is an important indicator of  the  quality of public health and social welfare.    It is extremely difficult to judge the effects of  environmental pollution in cities on the rate of infant  mortality. Studies in this field are extremely few in number.    Indicators of the early neonatal death of infants (death in  the first week of life) over nine years in seven cities and  seven rural rayons inhabited by around 2 million people were  studied in Chelyabinsk Oblast (Chelyabinsk-40). The rate of  infant mortality turned out to be most closely related to the  level of nitrogen dioxide emissions (correlative coefficient of  r=0.76) and hydrocarbons (r=0.79). These factors have an impact  of around 60 percent on the rate of infant mortality. The same  study, incidentally, did not establish a connection between  radiation levels and birth defects and early neonatal mortality.    A comparative analysis of infant mortality rates in the  urban  and rural populations is of some interest in revealing the role  of the ecological factor.    The rate was higher in urban locations in 14 oblasts. They  included such industrially developed territories as Moscow,  Kursk, Lipetsk, Rostov, Orenburg, and Novosibirsk oblasts and  the Republic of Bashkiria.  <H5>  Effects of Environmental Pollution on Rate of Malignant </H5> Tumors in Russia    The rise in the rate of malignant neoplasms in Russia is  staying ahead of general population growth and the growth of the  population over the age of 60.    The number of new cases of oncological disease among  citydwellers increased 1.7-fold in the last 20 years. The number  of people first diagnosed with malignant growths in Russia rose  by 23 percent between 1980 and 1991 and reached 394,300,  corresponding to an average of 1,080 new patients a day. The  number of patients who died during this period rose by 30  percent and amounted to 290,500 in 1991 (an average of 796  deaths a day). Death from malignant neoplasms has reduced the  average lifespan of the male population of Russia by 2.8 years  and the female lifespan by 2.2 years. The amount of hypothetical  unproduced national income resulting from this is 4.1 billion  rubles (in 1990 prices). The number of new cases of disease is  expected to rise to 480,000 by the year 2000, or one new case  each 66 seconds, and the number of deaths is expected to rise to  346,000 (or 940 a day). Around 18 of every 100 babies born in  Russia in 1991 could suffer from malignant neoplasms, and the  average lifespan of patients in some age groups could be as low  as one-seventeenth of the general lifespan of these age groups  (Ye. Aksel et al, 1993). The number of people categorized as  completely disabled by malignant neoplasms exceeded 72,000 in  1990 in Russia, or 20.2 percent of the total number.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   The adverse effects of environmental pollution on public  health in Russia are a genuine threat to national security and  can affect each of us. According to current estimates, around 20  percent of the total rate of illness is connected with the  irritating effects of environmental pollution; in some areas the  figure can be much higher. Regrettably, conclusive studies  providing quantitative assessments of the contribution of  environmental pollution to the development of various diseases  are extremely few in number. The definite deterioration of  public health indicators in recent years has been connected with  environmental pollution and with socioeconomic difficulties.    A more complete understanding of the role of environmental  pollution in changes in the state of public health could result  from the improvement of several types of activity on the  federal, regional, and local levels. They include the following:    --more detailed reports of the discharges and emissions of  all potential polluters, with lists of the substances entering  the atmosphere and surface and ground water, and detailed  reports of the substances in solid waste disposal sites;    --improvements in the pollution monitoring system for more  complete records of the whole range of pollutants in a specific  territory and for information about the spatial distribution of  pollutants;    --the widespread use of modern remote methods of emission  control--such as the laser and sonar systems--for constant and  current data on pollutants;    --a better system of regional and federal public health  statistics with more detailed breakdowns (by ages and  territories);    --the collection of statistical data for small territories  that might be subject to the effects of various types of  pollutants;    --analytical epidemiological studies to determine risk and  dose indicators for specific pollutants and their combinations;    --the compilation and implementation of national programs to  minimize the effects of all substances known to be highly toxic  (benzpyrene, PAC's, PCB's, radon, beryllium, cadmium, lead, and  other toxic metals).</p>

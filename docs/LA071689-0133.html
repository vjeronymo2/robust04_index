			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CASE OF MISSING BOY BECOMES TEST OF FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS  </P> <P> Maurice Miles was born Oct. 3, 1986, in Baltimore, the son of an unwed mother  who was borderline retarded and a father who peddled drugs on street corners  before being shot to death.  </P> <P> By the time he was 4 months old, Maurice had been hospitalized twice with a  broken arm, thigh, shoulder blade and shoulder socket, and a possible spinal  cord injury.  </P> <P> Even while he was immobilized in a full-body cast, according to a court  petition, "his mother was observed throwing him into a crib on one occasion and  shaking him profusely on another."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Returned to Mother  </P> <P> The state took custody of Maurice after his second hospitalization, but he was  returned to his mother seven months later -- despite a psychologist's report  warning against it.  </P> <P> Then he vanished. No one in authority has seen the boy for nearly two years --  and his mother adamantly refuses to say whether she knows where he is, for fear  of being charged with child abuse.  </P> <P> Now the strange case of baby Maurice Miles has become the focus of a Supreme  Court case that asks: Which is more important, the boy's safety or his mother's  constitutional right not to incriminate herself?  </P> <P> The answer is important, observers say, because it will help determine the  extent of the power of juvenile courts to protect battered children in such  circumstances.  </P> <P> The case has also prompted renewed criticism of Baltimore's troubled, state-run  Department of Social Services. The agency was supposed to monitor Maurice's  care by his mother, but lost track of the boy, then waited more than half a  year before alerting the police.  </P> <P> Baltimore police at one point handled the matter as a possible homicide, but  detectives could find no solid evidence that Maurice was dead. The case was  turned over to the department's youth division and remains unsolved.  </P> <P> Maurice's mother, Jacqueline Bouknight, 23, described by one of her attorneys  as immature and "extremely limited" intellectually, has been locked in the  Baltimore City Jail since April, 1988, for contempt of court for refusing to  disclose his whereabouts.  </P> <P> She has not been formally accused of a crime. But in an unusual civil  proceeding, Bouknight, on the advice of her attorneys, has refused a Baltimore  juvenile court judge's order that she produce Maurice -- or arrange for him to  be found -- so the state can retake custody.  </P> <P> Fifteen months ago, the judge ordered her locked up until she changed her mind.  Bouknight's attorneys appealed to Maryland's highest court and won an order  releasing her. The state then appealed to the Supreme Court, which ordered her  kept in jail until it reviews the case this fall.  </P> <P> Bouknight's situation bears some resemblance to the well-publicized case of  Elizabeth Morgan, a physician jailed for civil contempt in Washington, D.C.,  since 1987 for hiding her 6-year-old daughter in defiance of a court order  giving visitation rights to her former husband.  </P> <P> Throughout Bouknight's time in jail, one of her attorneys said, she "has always  denied that any harm has come to the child."  </P> <P> But because police suspect Maurice was harmed or even killed by his mother,  Bouknight's attorneys argue, their client would be supplying evidence against  herself if she admitted having control over the boy and it turned out he had  been abused. Compelling her to produce her son violates her Fifth Amendment  right against self-incrimination, attorneys contend.  </P> <P> If the Supreme Court agrees with Bouknight, "then it means the risk to children  in this country will be substantially increased," because other parents in such  situations could hide their children and invoke the Fifth Amendment, said Ralph  S. Tyler III, an assistant Maryland attorney general who is seeking to keep  Bouknight in jail.  </P> <P> Tyler, echoing numerous child-welfare advocates, said the power to coerce  uncooperative parents by jailing them is the most potent weapon available to  juvenile court judges in trying to rescue battered youngsters.  </P> <P> "Frankly, we're going to be in a real mess" if Bouknight prevails, said Judge  W. Don Reader of Stark County, Ohio, president-elect of the National Council of  Juvenile and Family Court Judges. "I think the court, as a practical matter,  loses its power to protect a child -- and protecting children is what we're in  business for."  </P> <P> The state, in court petitions, argues that the Fifth Amendment does not protect  Bouknight from the judge's order that she surrender Maurice -- just as it does  not protect citizens from certain other "potentially incriminating,  state-compelled actions," such as standing in police lineups or supplying  court-ordered blood samples.  </P> <P> Even if the Fifth Amendment does apply in Bouknight's case, she still ought to  be forced to produce Maurice, the state says. The "juvenile court's statutory  duty to protect this abused and neglected child outweighs his mother's  constitutional privilege against self-incrimination," the state says.  </P> <P> Bouknight's attorneys said the state has succumbed to "hysteria" in its concern  about the case's potential impact on juvenile courts.  </P> <P> There are other ways besides civil contempt for authorities to put pressure on  a parent in Bouknight's situation, said George Burns, one of four Baltimore  public defenders representing her. For instance, he said, they could use  criminal prosecution.  </P> <P> Burns said, for example, that laws "in virtually every state" make it a crime  for a parent willfully to cause a child to become "in need of assistance" from  a social services agency. He said Maryland authorities could charge Bouknight  with criminally creating such a situation for Maurice by having concealed him.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rely on Criminal Statutes  </P> <P> If the Supreme Court rules for Bouknight, he said, "it won't be devastating at  all. It'll just require (states) to rely more on criminal statutes, and not go  the easy way with civil contempt."  </P> <P> Burns also disagreed that the state's duty to protect Maurice "outweighs" his  mother's Fifth Amendment right -- a right that one of Bouknight's other  attorneys called "part of the backbone of our due-process system."  </P> <P> The Maryland Court of Appeals agreed with Bouknight's attorneys and ordered her  freed Dec. 19, after eight months in jail. But U.S. Chief Justice William H.  Rehnquist granted an immediate stay, keeping her locked up.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, where is Maurice?  </P> <P> Attorneys on both sides say the Baltimore Department of Social Services'  failure to keep track of him is partly to blame for his disappearance.  </P> <P> Cristina Gutierrez, another of Bouknight's attorneys, said Social Services'  handling of the case left her "appalled as a parent and appalled as a citizen."  </P> <P> In January, 1987, when Maurice was hospitalized for the second time, the social  services agency was notified of the possibility of child abuse, according to  court documents.  </P> <P> "From what I know about my client, her limitations might render her guilty of  child neglect and an inability to learn parenting skills, but not a battering,"  Gutierrez said of Bouknight, who was not criminally charged with child abuse.  </P> <P> "Her IQ is borderline retarded," Gutierrez said. "She grew up in and out of  foster care, and she was basically left hanging. I don't think she even  finished the seventh grade. . . . She has no skills at all."  </P> <P> Gutierrez recently arranged for her client to be interviewed in jail for this  story, but canceled the meeting, saying Bouknight was too distraught.  </P> <P> When Maurice was born, Bouknight was living in her grandfather's well-kept row  house on Baltimore's North Washington Street. The infant's father, Terrance  Miles, a convicted small-time drug dealer, was shot to death in 1988 at age 22.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Began Counseling Sessions  </P> <P> After Maurice's second hospitalization, the social services agency obtained a  juvenile court order placing him in foster care. Bouknight, meanwhile, followed  the agency's advice and began counseling sessions with a clinical social  worker, according to court petitions.  </P> <P> A juvenile court judge scheduled a hearing for Aug. 18, 1987 -- seven months  after Maurice had been placed in a foster home -- to decide whether he should  be returned to his mother, under monitoring from the agency.  </P> <P> An attorney involved in the case, who asked not to be identified, said the  judge's decision was to hinge on a psychologist's evaluation of Bouknight.  </P> <P> After meeting with her, the psychologist wrote: "She is not now able to relate  constructively to her child, since the child is seen as fulfilling her needs  rather than the reverse. She becomes totally frustrated and enraged to find  herself unable to gain from her child what . . . she lacked in her own  childhood. When her frustration mounts, she is likely to act out toward the  child."  </P> <P> Court records indicate that because of a bureaucratic snarl, the psychologist's  report was not available for the hearing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Protective Supervision  </P> <P> Nonetheless, with no objection from Social Services, the judge put Maurice back  in his mother's custody. Bouknight signed an "order of protective supervision"  that required her to refrain from striking her son and to cooperate with social  workers.  </P> <P> A few weeks later, on Sept. 4, 1987, a caseworker assigned to supervise  Bouknight visited the row house on North Washington Street for the first time.  </P> <P> "Maurice appeared well-fed with good affect and hygiene," according to the  agency's chronology, which is included in court records.  </P> <P> Four days after the first visit, a Social Services parenting aide stopped by  the row house. "Saw mother and child," reads the entry for that day, Sept. 8,  1987.  </P> <P> No one in authority has seen Maurice since.  </P> <P> From Oct. 13, 1987, to April 7, 1988, social workers visited the row house nine  times but never saw Maurice, according to the chronology. Bouknight often was  not home. When she was home, she told them that her son was with an aunt but  refused to disclose the aunt's name.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called Relatives  </P> <P> Finally, on April 7, a caseworker told a supervisor about Maurice's absences.  The chronology indicates a suddenly frantic effort to locate him starting that  day. The caseworker called clinics where Maurice had been treated, asked  colleagues if they had seen him, and called or visited "every known relative"  of Bouknight's from Baltimore to North Carolina.  </P> <P> "There was a plan, when this child was returned to his mother, that he'd be  watched over and protected, and these things weren't done," said Susan Leviton,  a University of Maryland law professor and director of Advocates for Children  and Youth, a nonprofit group. "What was going on all those months? What were  these (social workers) thinking? What were they doing?"  </P> <P> The Baltimore agency has been criticized often in the past after children under  its supervision were abused by their parents or in foster homes.  </P> <P> J.C. Shay, a spokesman for Maryland's Department of Human Resources, said the  department's social services agencies across the state are monitoring about  6,000 children who live with their parents under orders of "protective  supervision," as Maurice was. Citing confidentiality laws, he declined to  discuss the Bouknight case.  </P> <P> On April 12, 1988 -- seven months and four days after Maurice had last been  seen by anyone from Social Services -- the caseworker reported him missing to  Officer Charles Klein of the Baltimore police.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Why Did You Wait?'  </P> <P> Klein recalled recently that when the caseworker told him he had not seen  Maurice for seven months, "I came about four feet up off the floor. I looked at  him and I said, 'Man, are you for real?' And he said, 'What do you mean?' And I  said to him, you know, 'My God, why did you wait so long?' "  </P> <P> Klein said he "never got a straight answer."  </P> <P> A few weeks later, after Bouknight failed to produce Maurice, a juvenile court  judge sent her to the Baltimore City Jail, and there she remains.  </P> <P> How long she will stay locked up is unclear. Civil contempt orders are intended  to be coercive, not punitive. At some point, if Bouknight's attorneys can  persuade a judge that the coercion has failed and that their client will never  give in, she could be released.  </P> <P> In the meantime, she waits for the Supreme Court.  </P></p>

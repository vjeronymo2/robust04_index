			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A. PANEL OKS $2.1 MILLION TO PAY ALTERNATIVE LANDFILL FEES  </P> <P> A Los Angeles City Council committee Tuesday approved paying $2.1 million to  dump debris from city streets and parks in private and public landfills around  the county for the next few months.  </P> <P> The action by the Budget and Finance Committee was in response to a state order  issued this summer to reduce to 400 the number of trucks dumping daily at the  city-operated Lopez Canyon Landfill, in the northeast San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> The committee's action must be approved by the full City Council.  </P> <P> Although the city challenged the California Waste Management Board order in  Superior Court and won a temporary restraining order, city Bureau of Sanitation  officials said Tuesday that the city attorney recommended that they voluntarily  comply with the truck limit, which could be used to demonstrate good faith in  future state and court hearings on the issue.  </P> <P> The city is not voluntarily complying with the other limits set down in the  state order -- including a reduction in the dump's height. On Oct. 27, the City  Council is scheduled to consider voluntarily complying with all the limits.  </P> <P> The $2.1 million would cover dumping fees for smaller trucks from the Bureau of  Street Maintenance and the Department of Recreation and Parks, reserving Lopez  Canyon for larger, fully loaded trucks. The city plans to prepare a new area of  Lopez Canyon for dumping and will attempt to persuade the state to increase the  400-truck limit later this year.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> GARTH FAGAN'S BUCKET DANCE AT ROYCE HALL  </P> <P> Garth Fagan is one of the great reformers in American dance: a choreographer  who has redefined and updated black dance but also a teacher who has extended  modern-dance virtuosity.  </P> <P> Jamaican-born, and now based in Rochester, N.Y., Fagan draws movement  influences from his rich American and pre-American heritage -- but evidently  has no use for show business traditions and priorities. Thus the two programs  presented by Fagan's splendid 13-member Bucket Dance company, Friday and  Saturday in Royce Hall, UCLA, utterly bypassed the limited notions that  audiences often pick up of black style, black attitude, black energy, black  dance.  </P> <P> Indeed, Fagan's "Traipsing Through the May" (on the Saturday program) included  a wicked parody of one bedrock cliche of the idiom: the terminally glamorous  star (Valentina Alexander) dramatically swirling her long, long skirt. And his  suite "Never Top 40" (Friday), pointedly suggested that blackness is more than  skin deep by collecting lush melodies from across the centuries and then  claiming them all through choreography of kaleidoscopic, multicultural variety  that wore its "mainstream" postmoderisms no less proudly than its "minority"  Afro-Caribbeanisms.  </P> <P> Fagan's sophistication as a structuralist allows him to make the choreographic  process transparent -- to show "random" movement ideas linking up like an  add-a-pearl necklace in the opening of "Time After Before Place" (both  programs), for example.  </P> <P> Often, however, Fagan seems to use this skill to prevent the disruptive,  premature audience outbursts that sometimes pass for dance appreciation. Corps  excursions overlap showy solo passages and the endings of his works often  deliberately subside.  </P> <P> Similarly, Fagan technique demands some of the most spectacular balances in  contemporary dance but only occasionally do his dancers cut loose for purposes  of display. Fagan named the most conventional showpiece in his UCLA repertory  "Discipline Is Freedom" (Friday), and you feel the title could serve as the  personal motto for any member of his company.  </P> <P> In the elegiac group vehicle "Landscape for 10" (Friday), postmodern spatial  and sequencing gambits, Third World and New York vocabularies and Fagan's  enlightened social and sexual convictions all fuse in dancing of the highest  achievement and deepest commitment. But this is not an engulfing experience; it  aims for something far more complex. Fagan is here making a statement about  relationships, and he carefully gives same-sex partnering absolute parity. He  also reverses the conventional power structure of male-female duets, demanding  a strength from his women and a refinement from his men that few companies  anywhere could match.  </P> <P> If you thought that male adagio dancing couldn't be more sensitively masterful  than in Paul Taylor's "Roses," think again. Fagan keeps his men modulating in  and out of impossible radically cantilevered, asymmetrical extensions and then  smoothly shifting into his characteristic bursts of up-tempo counterpoint.  Normally, when a choreographer needs this kind of sustained control, he uses  women. Fagan has created an instrument with no such limits.  </P> <P> Still, you could argue that Norwood Pennewell is his ideal interpreter.  Throughout both programs, but especially in the somber "Passion Distanced"  (Saturday), Pennewell's restrained quality of expression and steady energy-flow  almost allowed you to grow complacent about the fabulous versatility and  precision of his dancing, the way his absorption in the choreography made you  see it (and not just him) more clearly.  </P> <P> There were times on each program when Fagan's obsession with discontinuity  threatened to fragment everything a piece had achieved. But without exception,  Pennewell and his colleagues helped you through, kept you involved, left you  satisfied. If Fagan's choreography is sometimes compelling primarily for the  sense of creative integrity and risk it reveals, his dancers are simply as good  at what they do as anyone anywhere.  </P></p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Major denies Maxwell intelligence claim MR JOHN MAJOR vigorously denied yesterday that the government had had any intelligence information about the financial activities of Mr Robert Maxwell before his death last year. The prime minister came under pressure in the House of Commons about the report in Monday's Financial Times that the government had intelligence information that suggested Mr Maxwell was acting dishonestly. Responding to questions from Labour MPs, he said: 'The government had no information about Mr Maxwell's financial affairs as alleged in the Financial Times yesterday - whether in 1989 or subsequently. 'I saw no such information, my office saw no such information, no other minister saw any such information - for the very good reason it never existed at all.' He refused to be drawn on another element in the FT's story, in which Mr Robin Robison, a former administrative officer for the joint intelligence committee (JIC), claimed that other leading British and foreign companies, largely in the defence field, routinely had their communications intercepted. Governments did not comment on security matters, Mr Major said, adding that he had 'made the point perfectly clear on Maxwell because of the damaging effects that the report could have had on the Maxwell pensioners'. Mr Major's words were seen at Westminster as deliberately falling short of a broader denial that Mr Maxwell had been the subject of intelligence reports at all. Mr Robison last night stood by his statements. He said: 'Most if not all the JIC material of any relevance to this story was shredded and burnt a long time ago, and Mr Major can only rely on civil servants who were probably not in the PM's private office at the time.' Mr Robison said not all the material handled by the JIC found its way into the weekly intelligence summary that went to the prime minister and othergovernment departments. He told the FT last night: 'All that I told you about economic intelligence and the Bank (of England) being in receipt of that, I am utterly confident of.' Mr Robison added: 'As far as I am concerned the big issues are the way in which intelligence intercepts are made on companies, and who is in receipt of this information. 'I am very confident in my knowledge about JIC circulation of material, and also how the system works.' Some MPs have suggested that pressure on the government over the involvement of the security services could detract from pressure on the banks to accept a moral obligation and return pension fund assets used as collateral for loans. But the FT's report was raised by Mr John McFall, a Labour backbencher, who said the allegations 'proved' that the government had more responsibility than it had admitted. Mr McFall urged Mr Major to make the Treasury use its Banking Act powers to force the banks to return the assets. The Treasury has said previously that it has no plans to become involved in exerting pressure on the banks. This, it says, is a matter for the special unit, led by Sir John Cuckney, in the Department of Social Security. Yesterday there were signs at Westminster that MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners were now turning their attention to financial institutions in Liechtenstein.</p>

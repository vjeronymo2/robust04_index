			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Interest costs curb Welsh Water RISING INTEREST costs because of growing capital investment held back profit growth at Welsh Water, the Powys-based water and sewage company, to 1.5 per cent in the six months to September 30. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 74.1m to Pounds 75.3m after net interest earnings fell from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 5.6m. Mr John Elfed Jones, chairman, said the performance was 'very commendable'. The recession, which appeared to hit Wales later than England, led to a 4 per cent fall in income from metered consumption, reflecting lower usage by companies and factories. Mr Graham Hawker, managing director, said the fall in metered usage seemed to have levelled off. Turnover increased 8 per cent to Pounds 185.4m (Pounds 171.1m) because of average price rises of 9.3 per cent. Operating costs moved up nearly 8 per cent to Pounds 118.4m. Staff numbers were unchanged and pay rises held at 4.3 per cent. Cost controls helped lift operating profits 9 per cent to Pounds 67m (Pounds 61.3m). Capital investment remained on target and is forecast to rise this year to Pounds 206m (Pounds 189m). Depreciation for the period increased 15 per cent to Pounds 16.1m while infrastructure renewals rose 6.7 per cent to Pounds 11.1m. Welsh's net cash holdings fell to Pounds 90m (Pounds 154m) and the company expects to have small net borrowings by the end of next year as its investment programme continues. Non-regulated businesses, which include a pipeline company and a hotel group, continued to perform poorly and reported operating losses of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 2.8m) on turnover of Pounds 28.4m. Mr Jones said he hoped non-regulated businesses would break even in 12 months. Earnings increased to 49.1p (48.5p) and the interim dividend is raised to 7.8p (7.13p). The shares added 3p to close at 526p. COMMENT After limiting its price increases by 1 per cent in June, Welsh can feel slightly smug at seeing Ofwat impose similar constraints on the rest of the sector. That does not detract from those who argued Welsh could most afford such restraint. Pre-tax profit growth may have been flat, but operating profits rose strongly and Welsh is in the enviable position of having at least another year before it goes from net cash to net debt. But the company's forays into unregulated areas such as hotels continue to disappoint. The timing of these ventures ahead of recession was unfortunate, but their lack of success continues to provide somewhat of a drag on the shares. Perhaps with Mr Jones retiring next year, and management promising 'greater focus' to the non-core side, a more radical review of strategy will be forthcoming. Full year forecasts of Pounds 143m put the shares on just under six times, which looks about right relative to the sector.</p>

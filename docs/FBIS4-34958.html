			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 25 Jun (PL) -- Today, Cuban and Canadian  companies announced their decision to establish a joint  enterprise to extract, refine, and market nickel and cobalt on  an international scale. This major agreement was signed by the  General Nickel Co., Inc., owner of the shares of the nickel and  cobalt production plant in Moa Bay in eastern Cuba, and by  Canada's Sherritt Inc.    The basic agreement confirms the intention to establish a  jointly-owned enterprise backed by the Cuban Government. This  joint enterprise is considered one of the best operations  worldwide for the production of nickel and cobalt, the two  parties indicated in a joint news release issued today.    Everyone knows that Cuba has one of the world's largest  reserves of nickel and cobalt and that it conducts preliminary  processing of these metals at an installation in Moa Bay.    Sherritt Inc. is already getting a large part of the  production of nickel and cobalt sulfides extracted from Moa Bay  to use as raw materials at its refinery in Ft. Saskatchewan,  Alberta. Under the agreement, the plant in Moa Bay, as well as  the above-mentioned refinery, will be included as assets of the  joint enterprise. The news release signed by the two companies  adds that a corporation to market the products will be included  in the assets.    The Cuban state will grant mining concessions to the joint  enterprise. These rights will include more than 60 million tons  of nickel marsh ore -- with an 80 percent of the reserves  classified as confirmed reserves -- and will guarantee the  operation of the plant in Moa Bay for 25 years.    The news release says there are concessions available for  more than 15,000 hectares with additional reserves to maintain  production in Moa Bay for 25 additional years.    This major operation thereby links Cuban reserves with the  plant in Moa Bay and the Canadian refinery, and it will enable  the joint enterprise to begin a broad effort to expand the  installations located in eastern Cuba.    Basic Industry Minister Marcos Portal stressed that his  country holds in high esteem the relation established with  Sherritt Inc. in the production of nickel and cobalt, as well as  in oil and gas -- areas in which cooperation is under way.    The Cuban Government believes that the expansion of our  relations will result in a commercial activity that will  strengthen Cuba's position within the international industrial  community, Portal added.    Ian W. Delaney, Sherritt's president and director, said his  company is pleased with the new enterprise because Cuban and  Canadian installations are compatible and because Cuban reserves  of nickel and cobalt are abundant.    Our previous relations with Cuba have been very successful,  and we believe that our new association will lay the foundations  for a new type of business in Cuba, he asserted.    The conclusion of the new agreement, the news release  stressed, will depend on a thorough examination and review of  the plants, the signature of legal documents, and the necessary  regulatory approvals.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai (CEIS) -- Shanghai, China's leading  industrial and financial center, has become a new production  base of nuclear power equipment, according to industry sources.  The city's power equipment manufacturing industry has provided  equipment for the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power stations,  the country's only two nuclear power stations. Recently, the  industry signed technical agreements to assist the second-phase  construction of Qinshan and part of the contract for exporting a  300,000-kw nuclear power plant to Pakistan. So far, the city  has invested nearly 200 million yuan in its nuclear power  equipment manufacturing industry, for construction of capital  projects covering 93,000 square meters. Since 1988, Shanghai  has also earmarked more than 13 million yuan from its treasury  to support crucial nuclear power research projects. Sixty-two  of the research projects have passed appraisals. Meanwhile,  the central government has commissioned Shanghai to tackle 11  key research projects related to the construction of a  600,000-kw nuclear power station, and has allocated more than 12  million yuan to upgrade Shanghai's nuclear power equipment  production capacity. During the 1996-2000 period, Shanghai  will be able to build one to 1.5 sets of nuclear power equipment  a year.</p>

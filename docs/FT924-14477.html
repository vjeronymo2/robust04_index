			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Letter: Free from football 'slavery' Sir, Many football supporters, and perhaps some managers, might occasionally recognise Observer's description of some football players as intangible assets ('Numbers game', October 7). However, the assertion that investors 'own' 197p of players for each share seems to contravene the anti-slavery laws, where it becomes illegal for one person to 'own' another person. A great deal of the impetus for human asset accounting failed the anti-slavery test. The whole contract-transfer system in football should also be abolished, freeing players to sell themselves in this labour market and encouraging employers to have less ownership and perhaps more respect for the players.

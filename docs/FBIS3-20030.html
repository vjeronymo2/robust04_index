Zdenka  Kardum reporting from Helsinki:    [Kardum] Finland has been intensely following all  developments in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has been  present in the area through its international peace negotiators  and its UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] units in Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina. After the signing of the Washington  agreement, Finland for the first time deems there is a  possibility to restore peace in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.    This was stated following talks with Finnish President  Ahtisaari in the presidential palace in Helsinki today by  Granic. Granic described their talks -- which were held behind  closed doors -- as interesting and open, stressing that the  Finnish president was an expert on our area, as he was one of  the negotiators at the international peace conference in Geneva.    Finland's share in sending humanitarian aid to Croatia has  been considerable, and it is also ready to offer aid in the  future, both in the humanitarian field and through the  deployment of its UNPROFOR units. It is interested in  comprehensive economic, scientific, and cultural cooperation  with our country. Finnish President Ahtisaari has accepted an  invitation from Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to visit our  country.    Granic also had talks today with his Finnish counterpart  Heikki Haavisto. Haavisto also accepted Granic's invitation to  visit Croatia, on which occasion the two ministers are to sign  agreements on economic, scientific, technical, and cultural  cooperation.    The Croatian foreign minister has also met the chairman of  the foreign affairs committee of the Finnish parliament and is  expected to meet the Finnish parliament speaker in the course of  the afternoon.</p>

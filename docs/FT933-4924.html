			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Reforms lift exports 27% INDIA'S exports are growing strongly in the wake of its economic reforms and the devaluation of the rupee over the past two years, according to figures published yesterday. After two years' sluggish growth, exports in the first four months of the financial year, which started in April, rose 27 per cent to Dollars 6.9bn (Pounds 4.56bn), far exceeding the government's expectations. This compares with growth of under 5 per cent in the year to the end of March. The sudden increase in growth has given rise to hopes that India is at last seeing the benefits of the reform programme launched in 1991 by the government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister. Exports of textiles, leather goods and agricultural goods are growing strongly, as are those of engineering products. But the surge in performance this year also includes shipments of goods delayed in the first three months by the religious disturbances which hit the country following the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque and terrorist bombs in Bombay. Imports in the first four months were 7 per cent down at Dollars 7.35bn, due to low demand for machinery and industrial raw materials. However, companies continue to be concerned about possible foreign competition as barriers to the entry of imports come down. However, the decline in imports is helping to maintain India's foreign exchange reserves at a high level of about Dollars 7bn, on latest figures.</p>

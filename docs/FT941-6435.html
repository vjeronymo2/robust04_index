			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Kazakh office for Wimpey Wimpey says it has become the first UK construction group to establish a permanent office in Kazakhstan, the oil-rich former Soviet republic. Because of its large mineral wealth, Kazakhstan offers some of the most attractive development and business opportunities in the former Soviet bloc. The country is second only to Russia among the 15 ex-USSR republics in attracting foreign investment. Wimpey has identified up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 685m) of construction and engineering work which it says the country is likely to let this year to international contractors, with next year's figure likely to be twice as big. By 1996, as it modernises and improves its infrastructure, the country could be offering work worth up to Dollars 4bn a year to international construction companies. Investment by multinationals in Kazakhstan should provide a further impetus for construction work, says Wimpey. Mercedes-Benz, Fiat, and Daewoo have all established sales offices in the country. Philip Morris is investing Dollars 300m for an 88 per cent share in a cigarette factory and some tobacco farms, and Grand Metropolitan, the UK drinks group, last month announced a joint venture to market Smirnoff vodka in the country. Wimpey has established an office in the capital, Alma-Ata. The country has substantial deposits of gas, gold, silver, lead, zinc and copper. After Russia it is the second biggest former Soviet oil producer, with an annual output of about 22m tonnes and reserves estimated to be as high as 35bn barrels. Other potential contracts include substantial road refurbishment, upgrading the capital's subway system and mass transit systems generally. Wimpey is already thought to be close to winning contracts to build several hotels.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Arts: Canadian Opera Company One of the splash-making themes of this year's Edinburgh festival is the representation of four internationally 'hot' theatre-directors: Peter Sellars, Bob Wilson, Robert Lepage, and - the focus of this final week - Peter Stein. This is the sort of high-wire planning and achievement that (in this country at least) now go on nowhere else. And certainly, the Canadian Opera Company double bill of Lepage-produced one-act operas by Bartok and Schoenberg - shown at the Edinburgh Playhouse at the weekend (for two performances only]) - proved the very stuff of festival art: fresh, daring, full of striking ideas executed on a level well beyond the quotidian mundane. It was an occasion full of firsts: the first British sojourn of Canada's leading opera company, Lepage's first encounters with opera, the first performances at the restored Playhouse after the eve-of-festival backstage fire. The French-Canadian Lepage, whose in-the-mud Midsummer Night's Dream was recently staged at the Royal National Theatre, is a theatre magician, conjuror of a floating succession of picturesque images, sometimes haunting and sometimes startling, through which narrative is advanced. Bartok's duo-drama Bluebeard's Castle and Schoenberg's monodrama Erwartung - two crypto-autobiographical masterpieces from the first decade of our century in which the deepest human passions are analysed in music and through psycho-symbolic stagecraft - would seem to offer him rich opportunities for just such conjuring. Both operas, designed (by Michael Levine, brilliantly) to operate different features of the same setting, here colonise different corners of the same dream-world. In both the stage, fronted by a gauze scrim, is lined along the right by the same large block-built wall, a surface pregnant with possibilities - in Bartok, for reflecting the light-images thrown by the seven-fold door-opening on the opposite stage side; in Schoenberg, for suddenly releasing surreal visions through unexpected apertures and for supporting marvellous slow-motion body-tricks with gravity. Fluid patterns of imagery are set in motion by cinematic changes of lighting (or should have been: at the Playhouse neither Robert Thomson 's lighting-plot nor the general level of stage management was expertly seamless as one guesses they were meant to be). The unfolding of both operas, indeed, borrows from film method and manner: in grossly oversimplified terms, Eisenstein-cum-Disney. In principle the style would appear ideally devised to unlock the tortured poetic secrets of both pieces. In practice I found it unexpectedly erratic ' partly because banal moments (advert-style autumn leaves and over-used plays with water-reflection) mingle with the magical, partly because a certain intellectual shallowness can be detected in Lepage's larger response to both operas. The Bartok couple, though handsomely personated by Victor Braun and Jane Gilbert, are prone to obvious, melodramatic gesturing. More simple-minded still, in the Schoenberg, is the framing of the whole piece as an asylum patient's pathological fantasy - a straitjacket, a hospital bed, a psychiatrist with notebook are some of the ways in which Lepage, by 'explaining' the opera's content, robs its symbolic substance of multi-layered suggestiveness. Blood-links between the worlds of Schoenberg and Freud may be numerous and easily instanced, but that is no excuse for a cartoon-ish reductiveness in treatment of Erwartung. If the reason was a determination to make more accessible a supposedly 'difficult' opera by a famously tough-nut composer, why then the singing of both Schoenberg and Bartok in the original languages, with surtitles high up and far away on the Playhouse proscenium arch? The total effect - of production style linked to the distancing impact of language-choice and of gauze limiting the performers' expressiveness of acting detail - was, I would say, the opposite: concealment as much as revelation. Happily, however, the excellence of the purely musical realisation worked its own countervailing action. The Canadian Opera Company orchestra, plainly of very high quality, showed itself in complete command of the Bartok's floods of colour no less than Schoenberg's nerve-end refinements of musical imagery; under Richard Bradshaw (COC chief conductor) both scores were revealed in depth. Victor Braun, though lacking lowest-register solidity, is a superbly dark, noble Bluebeard, Jane Gilbert a vocally lustrous, wide-ranging mezzo Judith. The Erwartung protagonist, Rebecca Blankenship, used an uneven dramatic soprano with admirable warmth, commitment and emotional urgency. In spite of my cavils, it all added up to a genuine festival-event. Sponsored by AT&amp;T</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Britain heads for fresh clash on Hong Kong Britain and China were heading for another bruising row over Hong Kong last night after three days of talks in London failed to produce a consensus on the establishment of the territory's court of final appeal. Mr Hugh Davies, head of the British delegation, said the colonial government would nonetheless proceed early in the new year with legislation to establish the court, which is to be Hong Kong's supreme judicial authority after it reverts to China in 1997. Mr Zhao Jihua, his Chinese counterpart, warned that the UK should not take unilateral actions before agreement had been reached on the details of the legislation. Tabling of the legislation by the British side seems set to bring the matter to a head in a way reminiscent of the decision by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten to proceed with his electoral reform proposed in 1992. Britain has argued that it needs to establish the court in time to provide legal continuity for Hong Kong after 1997, but there have been suspicions that China is prevaricating because it would prefer not to be saddled with arrangements in which Britain has had a hand. Mr Zhao declined yesterday to give specific reasons for China's reluctance to endorse the bill setting up the court. China and Britain had agreed in principle as long ago as 1991 the basis on which the court should be set up, he said. But he told a meeting of the joint liaison group set up by the two countries to administer handover arrangements that China had only recently been given the text of the bill and needed more time for discussion. 'Pending a consensus reached by the two sides through discussion, no unilateral action should be taken by the British side,' he said. The proposed arrangements for the court of final appeal are controversial in Hong Kong because the bill provides for one judge to be appointed from overseas. While China is apparently reluctant to be tied down specifically in this way, some liberal politicians are reluctant to accept wording that seems to limit foreign participation to one judge. British officials believe that putting the bill before the Legislative Council will force the issue, because the council would only vote for a bill providing for the participation of a single foreign judge if it was clear that China would accept the result after 1997. This week's meeting did reach agreement on a series of issues ranging from Hong Kong's continuing participation in international agreements on intellectual property and on the signing of a bilateral air agreement with Germany. But it was clear after the talks closed that a wide gulf remains on a number of important issues. Mr Davies said no progress had been made on the dispute over the colony's ninth container terminal, for which China refused to sanction contracts. 'I urged the Chinese side to lift what is in effect a veto on the project and pointed out once again the damage which this continuing delay is inflicting on the economy of Hong Kong and on investor confidence more widely.' There was also no progress on the question of travel documents and rules on right of abode after 1997, an important area where 'time is rapidly running out', he said. For its part the Chinese side complained about Hong Kong's plan to set up a reserve fund for civil service pensions and - in an apparent reference to relaxation of the laws on film censorship - about unilateral changes to existing legislation which Mr Zhao said was out of line with the original agreement on the handover. China was also 'gravely concerned' about the recent release into the Hong Kong community of 125 Vietnamese boat people. China wanted the question of Vietnamese refugees dealt with before 1997, he said. Despite the disagreements, Mr Davies said he would not characterise the meeting as a failure and added that agreement had been reached to step its work and hold more expert consultations. 'But I am afraid that the result does not match up to what is required and expected of us,' he said. 'It is clear that we are going to have to do much better in the next two and a half years if we are to live up to what people rightly expect.'</p>

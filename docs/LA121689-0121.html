			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FANS CAN'T TAKE TOO MUCH MAS OF THIS  </P> <P>  It is widely accepted that former NBA center George Mikan is credited with the  widening of the "key" area on a basketball court.  </P> <P> Well, after viewing the "no mas" boxing farce between Roberto Duran and Sugar  Ray Leonard, Sugar Ray could very well be the boxer responsible for the  shortening of the dimensions of a boxing ring. If I want to watch people dance,  I'll rent "Saturday Night Fever." Give me Golden Gloves or Olympic boxing any  time.  </P> <P> ANDY S. GUYER, San Diego  </P></p>

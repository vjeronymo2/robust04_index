			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> LAWYERS SEEK TO HALT EXECUTION  </P> <P> Lawyers for condemned killer Robert Alton Harris filed an emergency request  today asking a federal appeals court to halt his April 3 execution at San  Quentin -- the first in California in 23 years.  </P> <P> The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals scheduled an afternoon session to hear  oral arguments on the appeal.  </P> <P> The 9th Circuit is one step away from a final appeal by Harris to Supreme Court  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.  </P> <P> Harris' lawyers, Charles Sevilla and Michael McCabe, renewed their argument  that jurors in Harris' 1978 trial were "fundamentally misled" about his mental  state and would not have sentenced him to die if they had the information.  </P> <P> Sevilla said evidence of his brain damage, organic personality disorder, fetal  alcohol effects and post-traumatic stress disorder was not given to the jury  because psychiatrists failed to investigate properly.  </P> <P> Harris, 37, received the death sentence for the July 5, 1978, murder of Michael  Baker and John Mayeski, both 16, in the parking lot of a San Diego fast-food  restaurant.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In connection with the fact that about 70 kilograms  of plutonium remained in residue in processing equipment of a  plutonium fuel fabrication plant of the Power Reactor and  Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. (Donen) (located in Tokai,  Ibaraki Prefecture), the Science and Technology Agency [STA]  announced on 10 June that it has reached an accord with the IAEA  on reducing the amount of residue plutonium by 80-85 percent in  two years through such measures as changing equipment.    An STA official in charge, who visited Vienna to attend a  regular IAEA board of directors meeting, briefed the IAEA on 6  June -- Vienna time -- on three possible measures to reduce the  amount of residue plutonium, and he obtained an agreement from  the IAEA. The three measures are: 1) to tighten control of  collecting plutonium from processing equipment; 2) to promptly  take apart the glove boxes [preceding two words in English] for  producing fuel, which were formerly used at the plant and are  now in safekeeping, and to collect plutonium from these boxes;  and 3) to promptly adopt new glove boxes that are difficult for  residue plutonium to stick to.    The residue plutonium issue has come to the fore at the  "third laboratory for producing plutonium fuel" of the plant,  which has supplied fuel to fast breeder reactors "Joyo" and  "Monju" since 1988. Plutonium powder sticks to facilities like  glass-walled glove boxes, in which workers' gloved-hands handle  plutonium to shape it into fuel.</p>

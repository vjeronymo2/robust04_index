			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Pedro Ross Leal, Politburo member and </F> secretary general of the Cuban Workers Federation, CTC, by  Antonio Resillez in Havana on the "Open Agenda" program -- live]    [Text] [Resillez] Good evening. As announced, we have on  our Open Agenda program today Comrade Pedro Ross, a member of  the Politburo and secretary general of the CTC [Cuban Workers  Federation]. I should say that we contacted Comrade Ross by  phone at noon yesterday, Monday, 10 January, while he was in  Pinar del Rio on a work visit. That is how we came to invite him  to appear on this program today, so we could have a talk in  front of the cameras with a view to informing the public.    Before beginning this conversation, I would like to recall a  number of figures and reflections on the nation's financial  situation: At the last ordinary session of our national  assembly, our parliament, the sector minister, Comrade Jose Luis  Rodriguez [minister president, State Committee for Finance],  presented a list of indicators, illustrative of the tight  situation our national economy is in. Of these indicators, I  wish to mention only three, to serve as a reminder to our entire  population. The excess currency circulating in the country at  the present time is the equivalent of 14 months' salary: that  is, slightly over 12 billion pesos. The state budget deficit  comes to 4.6 billion. Subsidies to the sugar agroindustry in the  past three years come to 7.2 billion pesos. To this I would like  to add that only 30 percent of state enterprises are at the  present time (?profitable). The country must obviously reverse  this financial situation, the causes of which are well known to  our entire population. I am talking about both national and  international causes.    At this same assembly session we are talking about, our  commander in chief directed that our entire population be made  aware of this financial situation and actively participate in  the discussion and analysis, and make proposals with regard to  the group -- or as he put it, the arsenal -- of measures aimed  at restructuring [sanear] our economy. We think it is precisely  the CTC that has taken the first step in this direction, by  calling for, in the name of the parliament and at the work  centers, an interesting process of analyzing our financial  situation.    Ross, precisely how will this process of analysis take  place,  throughout Cuba?    [Ross] Well, Resillez, this way: Heeding the exhortation by  our commander in chief to first reflect with the workers, with  our entire people, before adopting the measures that were  discussed in our parliament, we have called for a process of  holding assemblies with all the nation's workers. This process  begins with preparing the union cadres, from the professional  cadres and the cadres at the national level, to the base-level  cadres. We have over 400,000 union leaders in Cuba, and this  process of preparing the union cadres [words indistinct] is  going to serve to get the union leaders' opinions on these  matters. It is not going to be a seminar in which the union  leaders are going to passively receive our suggestions. Rather,  it is going to be a dialogue, a discussion of all these matters  with union leaders: provincial- and municipal-level leaders,  leaders from work centers, (?from various sectors) -- however it  is most feasible to organize it.    We are going to discuss these subjects, placing at the  center  of the discussions the problems of the work centers -- that is,  what goes on there, what can be done at the work center --  because the basic solutions to our problems lie in the  efficiency we may be able to attain in the production process,  or in any services we may provide, or export. Therefore, the  center, the main aspect of this process, is going to be directed  toward that, toward analyzing how the workers at their work  centers can contribute to streamlining and revitalizing the  nation's economy, by working more efficiently, making better use  of material and human resources, increasing efficiency, and  improving the quality of work.    [Resillez] Pedro, but, at these assemblies, these meetings  with the union leaders, obviously the group of additional  measures -- which fall somewhere outside the framework of the  work center -- will also be broached.    [Ross] Indeed, but one must (?bear in mind the extent to  which) the subject has already been broached at the work center  -- which, I reiterate, is fundamental. So we are going to see  what ideas the union leaders have in this case, in this first  phase, about how to solve the problems we have with internal  finances; what measures can be applied to effect this  restructuring [saneamiento]. For example, subjects that appeared  in yesterday's editorial of the newspaper TRABAJADORES are going  to be discussed. The questions to which we want the workers to  provide answers during these upcoming discussions are there.    [Resillez] I see. Now Comrade Ross, parallel to this  process with the union leaders -- some 400,000 nationwide, as  you pointed out -- I know that direct assemblies are also being  held at the work centers. We were saying specifically at the  beginning of the program that you were at two work centers  involved in this activity in Pinar del Rio. What happened there,  at those work centers?    [Ross] Well, at those work centers, we tried to set up the  initial experiences because indeed as you say, in parallel, we  are to try this out at selected work centers throughout Cuba, so  that by the time we conclude the process with the union cadres,  we will have already had experience in making direct contact  with the workers.    The experience we had in Pinar del Rio was a very  interesting  one. There was a very rich, very broad, very open discussion of  problems specific to these two work centers. One was a food  industry center that produces for export. That center was,  precisely, a center that was profitable until 1992. In 1993, it  became unprofitable: that is, the cost per peso [value of goods  produced] rose to 1.24 pesos. We sought to learn the reason for  this from the workers at this center, which is a magnificent  work center.    They had well identified the reasons the cost per peso had  risen. Up to 1992, that cost had been 95 cents. What happened  was that the center had been sent a piece of equipment that the  workers had had to rebuild in order to get it operational. It  was a piece of machinery that had been discontinued. This caused  them to have to devote resources that had not been planned for  to rebuilding the piece of machinery. Because of this, a segment  of the production process was paralyzed, causing costs to rise  despite great effort by the workers.    Now I can tell you that already in the early days of January  1994, the cost per peso of production at this work center comes  out to 1.07; and they think they can bring production costs down  to below one peso during this current month of January. That was  La Primavera work center. A set of ideas as to how to reduce  costs, how to achieve this, emerged there. These ideas were well  defined and I am certain that that work group is going to  achieve it.    A very interesting thing: La Primavera is a work group  designed to consist of 111 people, but has been operating with  85 workers, 90 at most. They have reduced the indirect-labor  personnel. They recommended a continuing reduction of  indirect-labor personnel -- the CBP's [not further identified],  for example. There are four CBP's and a head of security for a  center with 90 workers. So it became clear, the centers' workers  and administration both realized, that this has to be further  reduced because it has a big effect. There were nine CBP slots  in the original personnel roster for that center, which was  originally for a total of 111.    [Resillez] Pedro, at these assemblies that were, as you say,  sort of pilot assemblies in Pinar del Rio, as well as at others  that are going to take place [words indistinct] also talk [word  or words indistinct] measures of another kind?    [Ross] Yes, of course. After the matter of what to do at  that  work center to increase efficiency, because it is a center that  has raw materials and everything guaranteed, the measures the  workers think should be adopted to streamline finances and to  move the economy forward were analyzed.    The problem of prices, of the cost-free status of certain  things, was discussed there. Proposals to see if the price of  electricity could be raised were made for the country to  analyze. Assessment was discussed -- charging for housing  according to assets and earnings. Charging for certain  entertainments that are currently cost-free, such as sports and  cultural events, was discussed. Also discussed was the  advisability of creating a "bond of the fatherland," of lending  the fatherland money, of our population making a loan to the  nation: bonds that could be bought without interest, to be  cashed in five or ten years; bonds that could be bought at a  certain below- market interest rate, to be cashed in five or ten  years; and bonds that citizens could buy with no intention of  cashing them in. That is, there would be... [rephrases] they  proposed various ways in which this could be done.    [Resillez] Yes.    [Ross] There were various proposals. For example, light was  cast there... [changes thought] because it seems there is the  idea, some people have gotten the idea that to change the  currency would be very costly and would not solve any problems.  Nevertheless, it was made clear, there, that, technically, that  there is the possibility of doing that without much cost. So,  what did the workers ask, based on that clarification? And what  will be... [rephrases] what kind of situation will those workers  with lower incomes find themselves in, because they also believe  that workers with lower incomes, who practically live from day  to day, could be hurt [words indistinct].    It was explained that that is not the way it is, that no one  [words indistinct] change, he who obtained his money in an  honorable way will have no problem whatsoever (?as regards) his  money.    There the workers came out in favor of mechanisms that will  permit recovery of the money that has been acquired dishonestly.  That was a very strong opinion at both assemblies.    The other assembly was at a fishing center, and this idea --  of how to block the path of wheeler-dealers [macetas] -- not  just how to recover the money, but how to avoid their  proliferation. [sentence as heard] We suggested that the way to  prevent action by these people, who make money off the needs of  our people, is to get out of this situation.    [Resillez] Pedro, let me tell you about an idea that I have  more or less been formulating as I listen to you. This massive  process of consultation on the measures to clean up our internal  financial situation reminds me to some extent of the process  that took place some time ago, when the call to the Fourth  Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba was issued. I remember  that back then, thousands of people, thousands of comrades,  thousands of Cubans, millions of us Cubans participated in  numerous assemblies, where the opinions we all wanted to be  taken before the Party Congress were collected. The CTC has  today undertaken a process I would say is, though not identical,  similar because of its scope and because of the way people want,  in keeping with the commander in chief's guidance, for all of us  to participate in understanding and to present our ideas in this  regard. I think that 400,000 workers with different union  responsibilities is a big number; moreover, I think the number  of comrades who are going to participate in the second phase is  far greater. Do we have any idea of how many comrades are going  to participate, through this process at the work centers, which  have come to be called "the parliament of the work centers," and  how many assemblies are to be held nationwide?    [Ross] Well, we calculate that over 80,000 assemblies will  be  held, and that over 3 million workers will participate in them.  It is not a process by which people will gather together in one  rushed meeting and raise their hands in support of a task. We  would like the workers to first think about the measures that  could be taken, about the significance of those measures; and we  also want them to assume responsibility for those measures,  because those measures also affect us all. All of us must make  some sacrifice if we want any of these measures to be adopted...  [changes thought] for example, at one of these centers, it was  suggested that the prices of certain articles that are today  subsidized should be increased. We explained that to do so meant  a burden for the workers themselves. They assimilated this. They  said there was no other way. This was much discussed.    Certain people suggested -- for example, there at the  fishing  center -- that the prices of all goods except bread and milk  should be raised. One worker said this. Another suggested...  [rephrases] a female worker stated that medical services should  be charged for. And we there seized the occasion to say that,  well, there are medical services that the immense majority of  the citizens cannot afford. Where is he who has a child who  needs heart surgery, or who needs kidney surgery or who needs a  transplant, going to get the U.S. $50,000 that any one of these  operations costs? And, are we going to let him die? So then they  said no.    So. Also, we have to preserve this as one of the achievments  our people have attained. But in order to preserve that  attainment, we have to solve other problems that will permit us  to preserve the achievement.    And then the comrade said: No, it is better to increase the  price of bread and milk, if need be, before charging for health  care, or for education.    Nevertheless, that was a reflection of the workers  themselves. Made very agreeably. And it was a very profound  reflection, too, because one can see that the workers are aware  of what is being dealt with.    Now they are beginning to become aware of the fact that  what is being dealt with is they themselves, and therefore they  take a stand. At these two work centers, the workers'sense of  patriotism got to running very high. Very high. Because the  proposals they made, aware of what it would mean to them, is  what we hope happens at all the nation's work centers.    [Resillez] Pedro, let me insist a bit on this thought that I  expressed to you regarding how this process reminds me of the  Fourth [Communist Party of Cuba] Congress, of the call to the  Fourth Congress.    Participation is, of course, important. It is requested.  People are directed to participate, and the participation of  many of us in these work meetings is desirable. But how are you  planning to gather these opinions and have them circulate -- I  mean, have them not just stay right there, at the assembly where  they are expressed?    [Ross] In the first place, there are many matters that are  brought up during this process that have to be answered -- for  the workers themselves, because they constitute questions, or  doubts, or confusions that people sometimes have regarding a  particular topic, or one thing or another. Erroneous  interpretations in connection with a problem are also cleared up  at these meetings. On the other hand, a document of what is put  forth is being drawn up -- of what is proposed, of what each one  of the workers brings up -- and all that is going to be summed  up.    Precisely, we are going to sum up this process with the  union  leaders on the 29th, at a plenum of the National Committee of  the CTC, where they will be able to give their opinions. We are  going to discuss the principal problems brought up during this  first part of the process, so that we will already have an  arsenal of ideas, an arsenal of how union leaders, all the way  down to base-level, think, with which to tackle the bulk of the  process, the remainder of the overall process.    [Resillez] Which would begin when, Pedro?    [Ross] It would begin right after the 29th, on the 30th.  Although we are holding these pilot assemblies now. For example,  tomorrow we are going to be at the La Corona Cigar Factory, here  in Havana. It is going to be the first such assembly in the City  of Havana and will serve as a model for the leaders who have to  tackle this task here in the capital. The La Corona is a  historic center, because it is there that Lazaro Pena worked and  carried out his union work. That is where he learned.    So, there will be answers for the workers. Whatever may be  set forth in the most remote corner of the nation will be heard  and taken into account. It will be taken into account.    [Resillez] Let me tell you, Pedro, that many viewers have  been calling in to ask questions. Some of these questions  coincide with these that we have been talking about here; other  questions from our television viewers stray, actually, from the  center of the informational dialogue that we have proposed to  hold with Comrade Ross. But I must say that this "Open Agenda"  program, as well as the entire informational system of Cuban  television, will discuss abundantly many of the aspects brought  up by our television viewers. Moreover, if any comrade wishes to  leave his name and address, as on other occasions, the CTC --  and Comrade Ross, personally -- are willing to provide the  answers necessary to satisfy the comrade's questions.    [Ross] Furthermore, we will be on [Radio] Progreso Saturday  [15 January], at 0700, which...    [Resillez, commenting while Ross is talking] The viewer can  obtain information there too.    [Ross] ...is on a topic broader than this one, not as  specific as this one.    [Resillez] Great! So then, Pedro, may I infer that the  process of consultations that is, in fact, already underway at  all work centers under the name "the parliament at the work  centers" is an element fundamental to arriving at the next  session of the assembly with a greater popular consensus -- a  special session that is to be called in order to take up the  matter of the nation's finances once again?    [Ross] Exactly. By the time we come to this next session of  the assembly, since the parliamentarians of the  provinces...[corrects himself] the comrade deputies of the  provinces where the process is going to be held are going to  participate actively in [words indistinct] they are going to be  able to participate, not just listen but also answer. They are  going to be able to exchange ideas with the workers. This will  be a way of giving continuity to the discussions that began in  our legislature.    [Resillez] At the end of December.    [Ross] At the end of December. Exactly.    [Resillez] On 28 January, the CTC celebrates its 55th  anniversary. I must say that, in the last few weeks, like almost  every Cuban who has had access to the newspaper TRABAJADORES, I  have read and reread a group of editorials I consider very  interesting, extremely interesting. These editorials set a  standard, I would say; they outline tactics and strategy for the  workers movement. I mean, for [words indistinct] in the present  and immediate future. [Words indistinct] 55th anniversary of the  CTC [words indistinct]. (?I ask you, as) secretary general of  the CTC: What are the basic elements that should characterize  the workers movement, at this historic moment in Cuba, on this  55th anniversary?    [Ross] We have sought to have the union movement occupy, on  this 55th anniversary, the place that befits it in this battle  our population is waging -- because what it is a matter of; what  is being defended, right now; what is at stake are the workers'  vital interests. Therefore, we want the workers to be focused on  defending those achievements that we have won throughout these  past 35 years; on preserving [words indistinct] and of the power  of the workers.    It is a matter of giving continuity to the work of the  Revolution. And in order to do that, we have to get out of this  situation, save the Revolution, as has been stated. And it is  the workers to whom the fundamental role falls, in that  connection. Therefore, the 55th anniversary will be (?marked)  [word indistinct] along that line. We are not going to celebrate  any festivities. We have to concentrate on this. This is our  fundamental task: to defend our present and to defend our  future, the future of our children. That is what this is all  about. And that is the discussion. The discussion also has to do  with having the workers become aware of that.    And I think that a very good ambience is being created at  the  work centers. The newspaper TRABAJADORES has contributed to this.    [Resillez] I am convinced this is true, Comrade Ross; and I  think that this process is also going to mark, like many another  of our working class's initiatives, an important moment in the  Revolution.    [Ross] Yes, Resillez. Something we notice, among the  workers,  is that the workers are very sure that the Revolution is not  going to abandon them, that the Revolution constitutes the  guarantee of their interests. They are confident that no one is  going to be left helpless in this country -- no one who needs  help.    [Resillez] Thank you very much, Comrade Ross, for your talk;  for having responded positively to our invitation despite the  short time between noon yesterday and today, and for this  information that we have provided for the entire country  regarding a topic that is truly hot. I must add that this topic  will continue to be discussed in future editions of "Open  Agenda," as well as in other spots in Cuban television's  informational system.    We would like to thank you, our viewers, for your attention,  and we will see you again next Tuesday on "Open Agenda." Good  night.</p>

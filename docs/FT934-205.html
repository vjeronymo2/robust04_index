			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Letter From New Delhi: United in poverty, divided by fear Rizwana Begum clutches the youngest of her five small children in her arms and says: 'My husband is dead. I must bring up the children alone. What else can I do?' Mrs Rizwana's husband was killed a year ago when a mob broke into their hut in Seelampur, a slum in north-east Delhi, and dragged him out. His throat was slashed and his body set alight. 'I saw him being pulled out,' says Mrs Rizwana. 'I did not see him alive again.' Mrs Rizwana, who is aged about 30, recalls the most frightening day of her life almost without emotion - even for her, time has done its work, easing the memory of her husband's death. So it is in much of the rest of Janata Colony, the poorest corner of Seelampur, where two-thirds of the residents are Moslems living in huts crammed into narrow lanes. A year ago, after the sacking of the mosque in far-off Ayodhya by Hindu militants, Hindu mobs went on the rampage in Seelampur burning and looting. Moslems fought back, but in vain, because, they claim, the mainly Hindu police sided with the rioters. All 23 dead were Moslems, as were 22 of 23 seriously injured. The bulk of the 300 homes and workshops destroyed belonged to Moslems. Today, like Mrs Rizwana, Moslems and Hindus alike try to carry on with life. Living cheek-by-jowl, sharing the same paths and the same water pumps, they can hardly do otherwise. Poverty unites them in a way that even the most enormous injustices cannot destroy. A few hundred people fled from their homes immediately after the riots; but almost all returned in a few days. They had nowhere else to go. Yet these are no longer people living at peace with each other - or with themselves. There is a fear, especially among Moslems, that the militants might return. Mr Anish Ahmed, a 37-year-old Moslem tailor, says: 'Right now things are fine. But every time a firecracker goes off we worry.' The Moslems say they are not scared of their Hindu neighbours, only of the outsiders who led the mob last time and could come back. Local Hindus also say that the trouble-makers were all strangers. They add that they did not see who they were or what they did. 'We went away to hide,' says Mr Tara Singh, a plasterer, and his Hindu friends nod their heads in agreement. Among the outsiders blamed for stirring trouble are activists from militant Hindu organisations led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, which has made great strides in popularity in the past decade. Mr B L Sharma, the BJP, MP from East Delhi, who has spent his life promoting Hindu militancy, denies that Hindus have been stirring trouble in Seelampur. Moslems suffered in the riots, he says, because they took to the streets against the police - a version of events rejected by local people, Hindus and Moslems alike. 'Moslems must learn to respect the sentiments of the Hindu majority. Then they can live in peace,' says Mr Sharma, resorting to the sophistry employed by his party's militants. Fortunately for peace in Seelampur, the BJP fared badly in the recent state-level elections in northern India. Mohammed Abid, a 20-year-old tailor, says: 'Here, even the Hindus voted against the BJP. How can we fight with Hindus when we are all neighbours.' Walking around Seelampur, it is difficult to make out which houses were damaged - new ones have gone up in their place and it does not take long to build a two-room hut. Also, the heat, sun and dust soon remove the veneer of newness from these rough-built homes. Even in the timber yard, scene of the worst damage a year ago, most burnt-out workshops have been rebuilt. In place of the smell of blackened timber there is the fresh scent of new-cut wood. Almost everywhere people are sitting in the street, working - tailors, embroiderers, carpenters, butchers and collectors of cow-dung - crammed into the narrow lanes. Some earn as little as Rs5 (Pounds 0.16p) a day - just enough to survive on bread, rice and vegetables. Poverty makes riot compensation a big issue. A handful of people whose close relatives were killed, including the widow Mrs Rizwana, have received one-off grants of up to Rs200,000. But those who suffered damage to property claim they received far less than they lost. A tailor with sewing and cutting machines in his workshop asks: 'What is Rs20,000 compensation for those who lost Rs2m?' The People's Movement for Secularism, a charity working in Seelampur, says just 35 of 386 claims made to the government have been settled. Those still waiting include the families of 12 of the dead - their claims are disputed because the victims were killed by police bullets. Such fatalities are classified as rioters and are ineligible for compensation - unless their innocence can be proved, a difficult challenge when few witnesses are ready to come forward. Mr J K Sharma, the district commissioner of police for Seelampur, says he wishes the government would settle the claims more quickly. 'The law-and-order situation now is fine,' he says. Autumn, with its many Hindu and Moslem religious festivals, passed without incident. 'If people were still angry we would have seen protests. But there weren't any.' Mr Abid, the Moslem tailor, says that no matter what the injustices, life has to go on. 'I've lived here 16 years. I'm staying and I will bring up my children here.' Mr Abid is captain of the local cricket team. He has five Hindus and seven Moslems in his squad. Some 200-300 spectators come to matches, Hindus and Moslems. There has never been any trouble, he says, and he hopes there never will be.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hsieh Chung-liang (6200 1813 5328)] </F>   [Text] The third stage of constitutional reform on Taiwan  is being enacted on the political stage during the first half of  this year. Inner circles of the Kuomintang (KMT) have already  begun their intense publicity campaign. Issues to be discussed,  following scholarly opinions sought by KMT elders, are taking  form--direct election of the president by popular vote, the  countersigning power of the premier as head of the Executive  Yuan, term limits for legislators, and a standing role for the  National Assembly. These issues will form the mainstay of  discussions by the National Assembly at its meeting from April  to August.    By comparison, the second stage of constitutional reform saw  politics drawn into the constitutional reform process because of  distinct differences between factions within the KMT. For the  third stage of constitutional reform, the inner structure of the  KMT seems to be simpler, and dissension during meetings seems to  have lessened. On the contrary, the focus has been on  theoretical differences and the system. This point alone shows  how much progress has been made in the KMT. According to higher  political circles, direct election of the president by popular  vote was already the focus of controversy at the third plenary  session of the 13th party congress. This time, weightier  elements who object to direct election of the president by  popular vote are not quite as adamant. Similarly, some members  of the mainstream faction that surfaced after the 14th Party  Congress had evoked the great disapproval of the non-mainstream  faction because they had repeatedly released trial balloons for  "moving forward the date for popular election of the president."  The non-mainstreamers had intended to attack and oppose this  stand vehemently. But after mediation by some neutral parties,  the mainstream faction abandoned their stand of "advancing the  date of presidential election," thereby making it possible for  the controversy to dissipate.    According to inner circles at the presidential office,  some people, before the 14th Party Congress, had suggested to Li  Teng-hui to move forward the date for popular election of the  president to avoid the "Yeltsin effect" which would follow the  popular election for governor. At the time, Li did not show any  clear indication one way or another, but said that this  suggestion was worth consideration. However, the clamor for  moving forward the date of the presidential election by popular  vote became greater after the 14th Party Congress. This clamor  actually posed a great threat to the non-mainstream group, for  this equated Li's quest for another presidential term with  advancing the date for presidential election by popular vote.    Proponents for advancing the date of direct presidential  election by popular vote have even made tentative plans to  change the date, much like an arrow set against the bow and  ready to shoot. However, faced with reaction from KMT insiders  and the fact that there was not enough time to revise related  legalities, and the task to make necessary constitutional  revisions was too big, this clamor subsided after a while.    It was pointed out that the idea of advancing the date of  presidential election by popular vote appeared first around the  time of the 3rd Plenary Session of the 13th Congress. Some  scholars pinpoint the controversy as originating during the  second stage of constitutional reform when the source and basis  of presidential power were questioned. For during the time that  the whole Hao P'ei-ts'un (6787 2672 2625) cabinet resigned, the  source of presidential power had again been challenged. For the  sake of political stability, the idea of advancing the date for  presidential election by direct popular vote gradually took  form. But after the 14th Party Congress, the calls for direct  popular election of the president came too late. Whether such an  election could take place the end of this year or early next  year, there was no way to coordinate the necessary measures.  Conducting it toward the end of 1995 had no practical meaning  with respect to political stability. On the contrary, outsiders  might think personal factors were involved in advancing the  election, adding to the puzzle. Furthermore, if Li Teng-hui  intend to succeed himself, why should he carry this unnecessary  baggage of suspicion, by advancing the election date by three  months? As a result, in this atmosphere of everything being in  place, there was no way for the mainstreamers and  non-mainstreamers to further ignite sparks over this controversy.    It is understood that the attitude of Hao P'ei-ts'un,  retired premier turned scholar studying the presidential office,  has changed substantially over a year's time toward the way the  president and vice-presidential positions are created. After  many sessions with specialists who analyzed and enlightened him  on the subject, Hao no longer insists on "selection by  appointment," but is receptive to "direct election by popular  vote" for the positions of president and vice-president. Because  of this change in Hao, it is possible to eliminate the greatest  unknown factor in this issue of "presidential election by direct  popular vote," which is part of the mainstay discussion during  the third stage of the constitution reform process conducted by  the KMT.    According to high political circles, after Hao had  resigned his premier post as head of the Executive Yuan, he  regularly invited different scholars in for discussions on  constitutional government. After listening to analyses by many  neutral parties, he has been less adamant in his opposition to  the issue of "direct presidential election by popular vote," as  long as the structure of constitutional government remains  unchanged. However way the positions for president and  vice-president are created, Ho can accept. This change in his  stand has been transmitted via available channels to Li  Teng-hui, and has allowed dissension on this issue, which was  created by interpersonal factors, to be eliminated completely  for the third stage of constitutional reform. Moreover, the  controversy between the "direct election faction" and the  "election by appointment faction" in the KMT that surfaced  during the second stage of constitutional reform is settled, at  least for the time being.    However, it is possible that another topic--the  countersigning power of the premier as head of the Executive  Yuan--may be replacing it for discussion.    As Hao P'ei-ts'un has had practical experience with this  subject, he has a deeper understanding of the countersigning  power of the premier as head of the Executive Yuan. Moreover,  some scholars also emphasize that the countersigning power is  proof that China's constitution tilts toward a cabinet system.  It is understood that Hao favors retaining the original  constitutional provision giving the countersigning power to the  premier, or eliminating this power only for his resigned  position as head of the Executive Yuan, but leaving it for the  rest of the cabinet members, as it is under the present setup.    Based on the larger controversy posed by the issue of "the  countersigning power of the premier as head of the Executive  Yuan," and the heated discussion generated during meeting of the  advisory unit supporting the Tactical Planning Group on  Constitutional Reform, a "unit studying special cases" was  established. It would provide further understanding of this  issue by making a complete analysis of the problem dealing with  the premier's countersigning power. Members of this study  group from the National Assembly include Chu Hsin-min [4281 2450  3046], Lin Ming-te [2651 6900 1795], Wang Fu-mou [3769 1381  5399], and Lin Hung-ch'ih [2651 7703 3069]; from the Legislative  Committee, Wei Yung [7614 6978], and Huang Chu-wen [7806 0031  2429]; and from the group of scholars, Hu Fu [5170 1765] and  Tung Hsiang [5516 5046 7378]. Composition of such a group  reflects the importance the KMT's core attaches to this topic  and the divergence of opinion inside the party.    Among those opposed to slashing the countersigning power  of the premier was the deputy minister of the Executive Yuan Hsu  Li-te [1776 4539 1795] who notes this power in action on the  inside. He feels the premier, as head of the Executive Yuan,  must be answerable to the National Assembly. The budget for the  five yuans and even the budget for the president's office are  all subject to questioning of the premier by the National  Assembly. To meet the rule that power and responsibility should  be one, the premier should keep his countersigning power,  especially if this power is one of form only, and he has to  shoulder real responsibility in front of the National Assembly.  Therefore, the countersigning power of the premier should not be  pared down to any great extent.    Those in support of a logical revision of the  countersigning power of the premier base their views on the  principle of the five yuans being coequals, and the premier  should not countersign on personnel and legal matters for the  other four, for countersigning amounts to interference in the  administration affairs of the other yuans. As to powers directly  exercised by the president, the premier should not countersign  either, for it is easy for such mutual interference of executive  powers to create political instability.    As an example of constitutional government, ever since the  constitution has been observed, the president has had real  power. Constitutional reform this time is reform on a small  scale. That is, based on examples from the past, the  constitution grants the president the inherent power to meet  present conditions. Under this premise, only some logical  revision needs to be made regarding the countersigning power of  the premier, limiting such power to personnel and legal matters  within the Executive Yuan. The countersigning power within the  other yuans should be assumed by their respective ministers,  thereby making the five yuans as coequals.    Among the views of these two factions, the most extreme  are those held by Taiwan University professor Hu Fu and Huang  Chu-wen, director of the KMT's central policy organization. Hu  Fu advocates the view that China's constitution is the framework  for the cabinet system, and the countersigning power of the  premier, as head of the Executive Yuan, should not be changed,  or it would be against the spirit and intent of the  constitution. But Huang Chu-wen advocates, without reservation,  that direct election of the president is the mainstay of  constitutional reform which means tilting in the direction of a  presidential system. It is only a small scale constitutional  reform of little consequence in a larger scale constitutional  reform. Therefore, under the premise of a presidential system,  the countersigning power of the premier, as head of the  Executive Yuan, should be discarded.    It is very possible that this issue on the countersigning  power of the head of the Executive Yuan, which lacks common  understanding within the KMT, may evolve into a factional  struggle. Two agenda items on "A Standing Role for the National  Assembly" and "Term Limits for the Legislators" may present two  conflicting problems dealing with the system for the National  Assembly.    From the standpoint of the KMT's central committee, the  National Assembly only has an "existence-abrogation" problem and  not what is called a "standing role" problem. However, judging  from the National Assembly's attitude, it wants to have a  regular standing role that allows it to oversee the operations  of the Legislative Yuan. Such thinking which is counter to  democratic government is the bad aftermath of factional  struggles that occurred during the first and second stages of  constitutional reform.    From the standpoint of democratic government, the National  Assembly represents the will of the people overseeing operations  of executive departments. But there are problems involving  control and supervision between the two. This situation cannot  be allowed to surface between two national bodies representing  the will of the people, whether it is the National Assembly  overseeing the Legislative Yuan, or it is the Legislative Yuan  reining in operations of the National Assembly. Such action goes  completely against the conduct of democratic government.    Deficiencies in design of such a system occurred during  the first and second stages of constitutional reform. When  political strife was introduced, that made problems which could  be resolved even more muddled. Particularly when the National  Assembly called for a role as an organ structure with regular  standing, that made the conflict more acute between two  political parties purporting to represent the will of the  people. While the struggle between the National Assembly and the  Legislative Yuan is limited to their roles, and different from  the power struggle between political factions, if this problem  is not resolved during the third stage of constitutional reform,  the problem of power struggle within the system will continue  forever, and become an incurable cancer on constitutional  government.    Among the four basic Issues to be covered during the third  stage of constitutional reform--direct election of the president  by popular vote, the countersigning power of the premier as head  of the Executive Yuan, a standing role for the National  Assembly, and term limits on legislators--resistance to direct  popular election of the president has been basically removed.  The countersigning power of the premier may be a problem and  lead to factional struggle within the KMT. Term limits for  legislators and a standing role for the National Assembly may  become a controversy about the system. The problem of the  countersigning power will be the immediate cause for lively  dissension during the third stage of constitution reform, but  the problem with a standing role for the National Assembly and  term limits for legislators will be the main reason for unending  strife in the future.</p>

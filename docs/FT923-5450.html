			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Arts: Strauss and Messiaen - Salzburg Festival IT IS always risky to set out to produce a masterpiece, especially if you are not sure what masterpiece it is going to be. That was more or less the position of Richard Strauss and Hugo von Hofmannsthal after their triumph with Der Rosenkavalier, 'their' Marriage of Figaro, when they decided to top it with a grandiose, edifying fairy-tale opera which would be 'their' Magic Flute. That was Die Frau ohne Schatten (The Woman without a Shadow), about which the first little problem was that nobody knew how the lighting-men were going to arrange for the fairy-Empress to cast no shadow during most of three long acts. In Gotz Friedrich's new Salzburg production, the soprano Cheryl Studer had to keep shrinking into dusky corners and huddling against the extreme sides of the Grosses Festspielhaus stage. Despite some lovely, fluttery singing in the first act and a brave show of spirit in the third, her character remained pallid, and no wonder. As for the other half of the charmed couple without responsibilities (shadowlessness equals childlessness), has any tenor since Jess Thomas made a creditable fist of the Emperor? Thomas Moser made a careful, intelligent attempt, but without beautiful tone in the high region where Strauss exercises him most, there was always a sense of uphill struggle. Of the complementary pair, though Robert Hale lent Barak the Dyer a sturdy presence and a big baritone, full of sap and character, without the lyrical smoothness and expansiveness to make the most of 'Mir anvertraut', the opera's best number. As his surly, dissatisfied Wife, Eva Marton was touching in mezzo-piano, but fiercely squally in forte: it was often doubtful which note she meant to deliver. It was left to Marjana Lipovsek as the malevolent Nurse - gorgeously sung, and enhanced by an earthy sense of comic mischief that Hofmannsthal probably never dreamed of - and Bryn Terfel's stentorian Spirit Messenger to fill out their roles completely. Rolf Glittenberg's attractive sets were spacious, uncluttered and old-fashioned enough at heart to answer to the authors' prescriptions; but despite some flashy light-storms I thought Friedrich simply failed to animate the action. Heaven knows, the story is forced and awkward as it stands, and if tamely walked through it makes a long and tedious narrative. Sir Georg Solti blew up a magnificent storm in the pit, certainly, and the Vienna Philharmonic must be the ideal orchestra for the piece (the many instrumental solos gave great pleasure). Yet one pondered glumly whether this overweening opera can really be revived: a few appealing tunes of 19th-century cut, an unconscionable quantity of fluent, polytonal note-spinning and a lot of raw theatrical noise, an ending protracted far beyond the point when nothing is happening any more . . . Olivier Messiaen's Saint Francois d'Assise was designed to be a masterpiece, and Messiaen and everybody else knew exactly what he would be doing: recycling all his familiar tropes on a grander scale than ever, as devotional hagiography. At Salzburg, with two intervals, his eight 'scenes franciscaines' took well over six hours. There is nothing much like plot, nor anything remotely like development. It would be bootless to argue whether or not St. Francois amounts to an 'opera'; it is a vast, unhurried aural spectacle, in which the solo voices - Francis and several Brethren, an Angel and a Leper - sing gently and deliberately in the interstices of the towering orchestral roars. The latter were produced by the Los Angeles Philharmonic under Esa-Pekka Salonen, with the utmost brilliance and panache. As the Saint, Jose van Dam's serene dignity and authority were beyond praise; and rather like Lipovsek with the Nurse in Die Frau, Dawn Upshaw brought a delectable sense of celestial mischief to her Angel - and floated her dewy soprano to perfection. Ronald Hamilton's Leper anguished robustly, and the contrasted Brethren were cast from international strength: notably young Urban Malmberg, Thomas Young and the evergreen Tom Krause. Messiaen specified in elaborate detail just how the characters should be dressed and behave. The director Peter Sellars wisely ignored most of that, and staged St. Francois like a gigantic pop concert. The show was visually dominated by a panoply of criss-crossing, multi-coloured neon bars, often conforming to Messiaen's prescribed hues: like Skryabin, the composer found deep significance in music-and-colour correspondences. He did not pretend to generate drama where there was none, but engineered a wealth of dazzling sights. The set was hung and stacked with some three dozen television sets, multiply showing images apparently filmed with a hand-held camera by a photographer with severe palsy. That was frequently distracting and irritating, though it did provide a lot of birds for St. Francis to preach to; in particular, recurrent twitchy views of a young man bearing a cross through rough terrain looked very Derek Jarman, very indulgent. Still, as a staging of a virtually unstageable 'opera', Sellars' work was a kind of quixotic triumph.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / International Company News: Canadian developer to bid for stake in stores group CADILLAC Fairview, the Toronto-based property developer, will bid for control of a troubled chain of Canadian clothing stores. The move reflects the ripple effect of the North American retailing slump on shopping mall owners. The bid will keep the 118-store Grafton-Fraser group in business, including 25 outlets which are key tenants in Cadillac Fairview shopping centres. CF and a senior Grafton-Fraser executive plan to buy a 90 per cent interest in the chain, which is operating under the protection of the Company Creditors Arrangement Act and has already shrunk to about half its previous size. CF and its partner will provide up to CDollars 6m (USDollars 5.45m) in bridge finance to Grafton-Fraser. Earlier this year, CF and a group of other shopping centre landlords threatened to put Grafton-Fraser into bankruptcy if they were not consulted about the company's restructuring plan. The developers feared Grafton and other troubled retailers were using the Creditors Arrangement Act, which is similar to Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code, to pick and choose which leases to maintain, based on the traffic through individual shopping malls. The mall developers are especially concerned about the viability of relatively new shopping centres in outlying suburban areas which were built in the latter stages of the last property boom. Many of these malls have high vacancy rates and remaining tenants are having difficulty paying the rents which they locked into three or four years ago.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: Backlash in golden state - After years of leading the green movement, Californians have had enough President Bush, who promised in 1988 to be America's 'environmental president,' has hardly mentioned the words during his current re-election campaign. Instead of proposing new environmental initiatives, the president now talks of balancing environmental protection measures with economic repercussions. This change of heart by Bush, and the apparent lack of enthusiasm for the subject among other presidential candidates, reflects a growing disenchantment with environmental regulation in the US. This is particularly evident in California, the state which led the environmental movement in the 1980s. There are now rumblings of a 'green backlash' as businesses and consumers count the costs of protecting the environment. Despite broad interest in environmental issues, Californians tend to resent government regulation, whether it comes from Washington or from Sacramento, the state capital. The more intrusive these regulations get, the stronger the feeling against them. California's rejection of 'Big Green', a sweeping environmental regulation initiative on the 1990 ballot, signalled the trend. Today, Californians are increasingly concerned that strict environmental codes will drive businesses out of the state, with a subsequent loss of jobs and slowing of economic growth; this at a time when the 'golden state' is taking the brunt of a nationwide economic recession. The northern spotted owl, a rare bird that makes its home in old-growth redwood forests, has become the symbol of debate over the environment versus the economy. Thousands of lumber jobs in the Pacific Northwest are threatened by logging limits imposed to protect the owl's habitat. Yet the spotted owl is only one example of how conservation rules can be at odds with the community. The livelihoods of West Coast commercial fishermen are now at stake as the state this month moved to limit fishing hauls all along the coast to protect the future of a dwindling salmon species. Then there is the case of the 'delta smelt', a little fish that swims in the waters of the San Jaoquin River in Northern California, a prime source of water for the state's central valley farmers and residents of the Los Angeles region. The delta smelt could soon be declared an endangered species, requiring expensive changes to the complex systems that shift water from Northern California to the south. To date the State Water Resources Board has struggled to satisfy legal requirements to protect fish and wildlife but has been reluctant to impose standards that thwart an economy fuelled by diversions of fresh water. Now California's governor, Pete Wilson, has intervened with proposed new regulations intended to keep the smelt and other species alive long enough to figure out how California can have its water and fauna too. But a proposed reservoir that would hold winter rain run-off and reduce the amount of water that is currently pumped from the San Jaoquin delta  - to the detriment of the smelt - has also run into a problem. The planned site turns out to be home to a single family of rare kit foxes. It is not only big state-funded projects that are stymied by environmental concerns. Home builders and commercial developers are increasingly faced with the discovery, often by anti-growth activists, of some rare animal or plant that throws up a legal brick wall in the path of planning permission. Endangered species are only part of the problem. Critics charge that environmental regulations designed to reduce California air pollution are wrapping businesses in red tape. Business executives claim that the cost of complying with some of the rules set by the Los Angeles South Coast Air Quality Management District far outweigh environmental benefits. For example, large employers in the region are required to persuade employees to use carpools or to find alternative non-polluting transport. But McDonnell Douglas, the aerospace company, estimates that it will have to spend Dollars 2.5m on incentive programmes to increase vehicle occupancy among company employees to an average of 1.5 to meet the SCAQMD's requirements. Worse, the company suspects that this expenditure will have no long-term effects. Last year, for example, McDonnell Douglas loaned new bicycles to employees willing to ride to work. Although the company provided more than 200 bikes, all but about 50 participants in the programme reverted to driving. The programme cost Dollars 100,000. However, small businesses are the most vociferous critics of air quality regulators. Dry cleaners, furniture manufacturers, car painters, restaurants and other businesses must meet strict environmental codes in California. But sometimes the rules backfire. Last year, the SCAQMD tried to impose its air pollution regulations on Los Angeles's 'rib joints', barbecue restaurants that are popular in many communities. The regulators' efforts to cut air pollution from rib joints got the kind of response that a sudden ban on 'chippies' might receive in the north of England. It was quickly dropped. There is also growing disillusionment in California with recycling. Although sorting waste, in the office and the home, into paper, glass, plastic and aluminium 'recyclables' has become habitual in many parts of the state, there is mounting evidence that this does little to protect the environment. Recycling programmes have produced a huge supply of paper, glass and plastic waste but there are few plants that can turn this rubbish into something useful. Aluminium is the only recyclable that pays its way - it is cheaper to produce new cans from old than to make them from scratch. Although manufacturers of many consumer products label packaging as 'recyclable', few use recycled materials themselves. Sorting rubbish into recycling bins is also becoming a chore. Before disposing of an empty jar of peanut butter, for example, it must be cleaned thoroughly, which requires copious amounts of hot water and soap. The label must also be scraped off. In addition, clear glass must be sorted from coloured glass. And it will only be truly 'recyclable' if everyone else on the street has been equally careful so that the load on the 'environmental truck' that collects weekly is not contaminated. That assumes that the waste disposal company can find a buyer. If that is not enough to dent the enthusiasm of would-be environmentalists, then last summer's call to ease air pollution by not lighting backyard barbecues - a staple of the California diet - certainly was. Marin County's talk of banning perfumes in public places also raised more publicity than action. The final straw came last December when San Francisco air quality regulators issued a call for residents to forego the traditional glow of burning logs in the grate over Christmas. But, like good environmentally-aware citizens, Californians 'recycled' their Christmas trees in January. It was, after all, the easiest way to dispose of them.</p>

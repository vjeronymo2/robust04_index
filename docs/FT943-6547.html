			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Cook urges tight control on loans Labour yesterday called for measures to protect people from 'exorbitant' interest rates as it unveiled the results of a survey showing that some moneylenders were offering loans with an annual interest rate of more than 200 per cent. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the Office of Fair Trading should 'actively monitor' and publicise the rates charged by licensed moneylenders. Saying that there were 'gaping holes' in laws intended to protect people from high interest rates, he urged ministers to review what encouragement could be given to alternative sources of borrowing for people on low incomes, such as credit unions. Mr Cook said Labour's telephone survey - which showed that some lenders were prepared to offer loans with an annual interest rate of more than 40 times the current base rate of 5.25 per cent - showed that consumers were likely to suffer if the government deregulated the credit market. He said: 'Rather than de-regulating this area of business, the government needs to tighten it up.' The government's planned deregulation of consumer credit would 'increase the burdens on the very poor by removing the few safeguards that they currently enjoy,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["M.P."-signed report: "Name Sign Scandal in Transylvania, </F> Too"]    [Text] On 21 June in Mures county, county police and road  maintenance workers knocked down and smashed bilingual  (Hungarian- Romanian) signs on the order of the prefect. Law  enforcement units entered the private territories where the  bilingual signs were located without the permission or agreement  of the owners.    The police removed signs in more than 20 localities in Mures  county. The statement of the county organization of the  Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [RMDSZ -- UDMR in  Romanian] published on 22 June condemns the anti-Hungarian  provocation in Mures county. The statement specially emphasizes  the Council of Europe documents and recommendations the Romanian  government undertook to observe and whose edicts are ignored by  the county prefect, the police, and the employees of other state  offices.</p>

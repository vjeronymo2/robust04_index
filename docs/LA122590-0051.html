			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Germ Warfare Alert Issued: The federal government wants to know if U.S.  companies making viruses or bacteria that could be used in germ warfare get any  unusual requests or evasive answers from prospective foreign buyers. These  companies "should be alert to . . . approaches by nationals of countries of  concern (e.g. Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Libya) to enroll as students or to be  engaged as research workers in courses or projects involving such technical  data," the Commerce Department advised.  </P> <P> It urged special caution when prospective buyers offer unusually generous  payments for advice, lie in their answers, ask for unusually strict  confidentiality or appear to have military links. A notice, published in the  Federal Register last week, asks companies to call the Commerce Department if  they run into one of these situations.  </P></p>

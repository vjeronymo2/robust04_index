			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / People: Mitchell moves out to join the Dowty diaspora Triplex Lloyd, the West Midlands engineer which has been reshaping its top management since the sudden death of chairman and chief executive Jim Dael last summer, has recruited Bob Mitchell from Dowty Aerospace as its new finance director. John Foley, the former finance director who was appointed group managing director in December has been fulfilling both roles since then. Mitchell, 40, who joined Dowty in November 1989, has stayed on as finance director of Dowty Aerospace after the takeover by TI. His boss Bruce Ralph, chief executive of Dowty until the acquisition, is now chief executive of Glynwed International. 'We were looking for international experience' says Foley, 36, who points out that there are, moreover, useful similarities - in terms of size and length of negotiations - between drawing up power generation and aerospace contracts. At the same time, Triplex's overall business is shifting towards the high-tech end of the castings business, an area in which Mitchell, with his aerospace background, should again feel at home. He moves, however, to a smaller operation; turnover at Triplex Lloyd is around Pounds 180m compared with Pounds 300m at Dowty Aerospace.</p>

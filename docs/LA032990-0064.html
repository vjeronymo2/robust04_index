			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMITH BEGINS BATTLE WITH AGENTS AT USC;  </P> <P> TROJANS: COACH BARS REPRESENTATIVES FROM PRACTICE IN AN ATTEMPT TO LIMIT THEIR  OPPORTUNITIES TO LURE PLAYERS TO ENTER NFL.  </P> <P> There was a time when USC's Larry Smith was concerned only with coaching his  football team. Now he has to be concerned with keeping it intact.  </P> <P> With the NFL's new policy of allowing juniors to be drafted, Smith and other  coaches have to look to the future -- and he doesn't necessarily like what he  sees.  </P> <P> Can he count on quarterback Todd Marinovich, a redshirt freshman last season,  remaining at USC for three more years? Or, for that matter, any other player  who emerges as a pro prospect?  </P> <P> "If Marinovich has a great year next year, he'll be approached very strongly  about coming out," Smith said. "Not by the NFL, but by agents."  </P> <P> So far the NFL, fearing lawsuits by college players, has opened its door only  to juniors. However, if a sophomore or even a freshman decides to make himself  available for the draft, it's believed that the NFL can't prevent his applying.  </P> <P> The exodus of college juniors into the draft this year -- 28 and counting -- is  not an isolated circumstance, according to Smith.  </P> <P> "There is another pending threat (to colleges)," Smith said. "The draft pool  for next year has been basically shrunk. Where are the extra 30 or 40 players  going to come from? I think they'll come from the juniors and sophomores.  </P> <P> "There is also another major factor that may be significant in a year or two.  Who is going to stop the two new spring leagues from recruiting sophomores and  freshmen for a year or two?  </P> <P> "The NFL has already acknowledged that they'll be used as minor leagues. Nobody  is panicking, but we have to get our head out of the sand. The NCAA and  American Football Coaches Assn. must come up with some sort of legislation to  make sure it isn't an open-floodgate type of thing."  </P> <P> So what can colleges do to keep their players from becoming pros prematurely?  </P> <P> "I think one thing you can do is make the letter of intent a four-year binding  scholarship for both parties," Smith said. "Right now the letter of intent and  scholarship is only renewable once every year through five years."  </P> <P> Such an arrangement, Smith said, would be a contract, presumably preventing an  undergraduate from turning pro.  </P> <P> With spring practice ending Friday, Smith has things on his mind other than  finding replacements for linebacker Junior Seau and strong safety Mark Carrier,  who plan to go through the NFL draft next month as juniors.  </P> <P> "We're going to have a workshop this spring for our whole football team," Smith  said. "It will be sponsored by the athletic department concerning professional  football, agents, contracts, salary structures and the whole bit.  </P> <P> "I know now that a lot of decisions (by players) are being made out of  indecision and fear," he said. "I know I have to tighten controls on who  watches my practices, who is on our campus and who is talking to my players.  </P> <P> "It has been an open-door policy before, but not anymore. The door is being  controlled."  </P> <P> Smith already has limited the days that NFL scouts can evaluate his players  with expired eligibility and has literally shut the practice field door to  agents.  </P> <P> "The first Wednesday of the workout for the pros about five agents came to the  gate and I threw them out," Smith said. "The next Wednesday a couple showed up  again and I said, 'If you want me to, I'll escort you off campus.' "  </P> <P> Smith said he has no quarrel with NFL personnel, but he has declared his own  war, of sorts, on agents.  </P> <P> The USC coach said it bothers him that a player, such as Seau, is leaving  before he can get his degree, or at least work substantially toward it.  </P> <P> "I really believe in a college education, even though a lot of people say I'm  just blowing smoke," Smith said.  </P> <P> Smith said that Carrier, who would have been a five-year player, is only two or  three classes short of getting his degree.  </P> <P> "But I feel badly about Junior Seau," he said. "Physically, he may be ready  (for the NFL), but I question whether he's ready mentally, and I question the  fact that he is leaving school a year early while working toward a degree.  </P> <P> "Those are two big negatives. The other negative is that he was sold a bad bill  of goods."  </P> <P> Smith contends that agents tend to paint pictures of money and conditions that  aren't necessarily accurate.  </P> <P> "Agents are playing both ends against the middle -- the NFL and us," he said.  "And they're not being taken to task for any of this."  </P> <P> In a curious development, Smith said that he may become an agent in deed, if  not name.  </P> <P> "There's an NCAA rule that says coaches can't act as agents for the players,  and I think it's a good rule," Smith said. "But what they're forcing us to do  is to be an agent of some sort when the players are sophomores and juniors to  make sure they're getting the right information."  </P> <P> A possible NFL salary cap on rookies has been cited as the main reason so many  underclassmen declared for the draft this year.  </P> <P> Smith discounts that suggestion, saying, "My sources say that's another year or  two away. It's a ploy by agents to try to scare kids into signing."  </P> <P> So Smith is conceiving other game plans nowadays, not for UCLA or Notre Dame,  but for agents, who are perceived as raiding his team.  </P> <P> Trojan Notes  </P> <P> Defensive lineman Don Gibson had surgery to repair a broken left ankle that he  suffered Saturday in a game-type scrimmage at the Coliseum. . . . Coach Larry  Smith said that free safety Lamont Hollinquest, who was expected to contend for  a starting position, has been suspended from the team because of academic  deficiencies.  </P></p>

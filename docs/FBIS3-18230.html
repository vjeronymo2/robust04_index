These four countries' membership negotiations yesterday  entered their decisive stage, whose deadline is midnight on 28  February; a time limit which enables the membership treaties to  be debated and approved in the European Parliament before the  June elections and the new partners to join 1 January 1995, if  the referendums in each of the countries produce favorable  results.  <H5>  Reservations </H5>   Westendorp's statements in favor of enlargement and the  scheduled timetable come at the very moment when Spain is  attracting the four applicants' greatest attention because of  its supposed obstructionist attitude to the membership process.  It is no secret that Spain is the country which has  reservations about the greatest number of areas in the  negotiations.    The Spanish Government has unsatisfied demands in the areas  of fisheries -- in which Norway does not wish to yield "even one  sardine" -- regional aid, the Community budget, the distribution  of votes in the Council of Ministers, and the quantification of  the convergence criteria for economic and monetary union.    In fact, Westendorp rejected the new proposal on regional  aid  presented by the Commission yesterday. This proposal is to  create a new classification for areas with a density of  population below 7 percent, so that the arctic and subarctic  regions can receive structural funds. These regions would be  classified as Objective 1A, instead of the previous proposal to  classify them as Objective 1, which includes the regions which  have incomes totaling 75 percent of the Union average.    Senior Spanish officials who took part in the membership  negotiations also complain with some bitterness about the  difference in treatment which the four new applicants and their  skeptical publics are receiving, as compared with that which  Spain received.    According to these views, Spain found itself forced to  adjust  many sectors to Community conditions and to accept transitional  periods for its fisheries and agriculture, while the four  applicants are negotiating advantageous positions in almost all  sectors, to the extent of endangering the very idea of the  Community's heritage. "It seems that it is we who are going to  join them -- not vice versa," a Spanish negotiator asserted.</p>

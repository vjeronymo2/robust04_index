From early morning  farmers cut national Highway 12 near the town of Capiovy, some  130 kilometres from Posadas, on the road which links Misiones  Province with the Brazilian border. The farmers, mostly yerba  mate growers, are classed by the DGI Tax Bureau as being  self-employed and are being pressed to pay pension arrears for  the past 10 years. The poor farmers say that they have been  severely hurt by the tax demands. The protesters, who had camped  by the roadside, stooped traffic until a judge ordered the  Border Guards to remove them. Three people were arrested and  will be appearing in court on Tuesday. The farmers are  demanding a fixed rather than market price for their crops.</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Sarajevo's big guns fall silent Serb and Moslem forces yesterday began handing over their heavy artillery to UN peacekeeping troops in Sarajevo, as a new ceasefire held for a day following intermittent shelling and sniper fire on Thursday night. The UN commander in Bosnia, Lt-General Sir Michael Rose, said he was 'reasonably satisfied' with the ceasefire, but accused 'renegade military units' of trying to sabotage it. 'A comparatively small number of rounds have been fired since the start of the ceasefire - as far as I can judge, as many out of the city as into the city,' Gen Rose said. Serb and Moslem forces blamed each other for the violations, but the UN said both sides were guilty. A UN spokesman said the Serb artillery would be collected at an army barracks close to Sarajevo airport before being transferred out of the city. The Moslem weapons, fewer in number, were being taken to another barracks in the city centre. The Bosnian Serb forces besieging Sarajevo agreed to place their heavy weapons under UN control, in response to a Nato threat of air strikes, provided their Bosnian Moslem antagonists did the same. Despite concern over whether the ceasefire would hold, following bursts of shelling on the city's outskirts, more UN troops yesterday took up positions between the Serb and Moslem-led Bosnian government forces in Sarajevo. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, who visited Sarajevo yesterday, said he believed the Bosnian Serbs took the threat of air strikes seriously. 'I think they are now conscious of the danger facing them,' he said. Lord Owen, the European Union's mediator at peace talks in Geneva between the three warring parties, was unusually optimistic in his assessment. 'You are seeing the demilitarisation of a 20 km exclusion zone in Sarajevo,' he said. 'You can then go on to discuss the details of UN administration and total demilitarisation of Sarajevo district.' However, Bosnian Serb forces yesterday stepped up the shelling of other Moslem enclaves in Bosnia under UN protection, according to local radio stations. There was heavy shelling of Bihac, in north-western Bosnia, while Serb tanks and artillery moved against nearby Cazin, causing heavy casualties, Bihac radio reported. Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva said that three international aid workers detained by Bosnian Serbs in Banja Luka were expected to be released today. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, in Geneva for the peace talks, has guaranteed the safety of aid workers. Bosnian Serb officials at their headquarters in Pale, near Sarajevo, played down suggestions that the aid workers were being held because of the threat of air strikes. President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia has remained silent on the Nato ultimatum while public opinion in Belgrade appears sceptical that the air strikes threat will be carried out. Mr Vuk Draskovic, leader of the main opposition coalition, said the ultimatum would not bring peace in Bosnia, but welcomed the withdrawal of heavy weapons from Sarajevo as 'the very least that should be done by both sides'.

			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by J.G.; "Christian Blanc: We Must Catch up With or </F> Outdo Lufthansa by 1997"; introductory paragraph in boldface as  published]    [Text] As far as the president of Air France is  concerned, this is the only real challenge that the airline must  absolutely meet if it does not want to be swept away.    Air France President Christian Blanc and his team met with  representatives of the company's union organizations early this  week to discuss the contents of a memo he had sent them the week  before.    Considered a "focusing document" and having the value of a  "framework," the 13-page document was intentionally left  incomplete so that it could easily be altered, if necessary, or  rounded out as a result of the talks held during the meetings.  Comprising four chapters--"Where Are We?" "How Did We Get  There?" "What Must the Spirit of Reform Be?" and "Air France's  Battles"--the document reviews the situation (estimated losses  of 7.5 billion francs in 1993 and indebtedness totaling some 36  billion francs) and sets forth the objectives to be achieved to  enable Air France to catch up with the leading airlines and  ensure its survival. The model chosen is Lufthansa because the  challenge in that case is a reasonable one. "The German airline  began to overhaul itself only a year ago, whereas British  Airways began stirring 10 years ago," and besides, any recovery  that might bring Air France up to the same level as American or  Asian airlines would result in the "social destruction" of the  French company, something that Christian Blanc rejects.    The president of Air France notes in the memo distributed to  union representatives that the company's announced losses for  1993 account for half the total losses reported by the IATA's  [International Air Transport Association's] 212 member airlines  for that year. He identified the following as being among the  factors contributing to those losses:    1. Insufficient earnings: the airline's current revenues do  not cover its current expenditures.    2. A poor commercial position: the company's market declined  by 7 percent in 1993, whereas the German and British markets  grew during that same period by 7 percent and 9 percent  respectively.    3. Air France's share of the international market declined  by  7 percent in 1993: 13 percent of all passengers chose the  state-owned airline in 1989, but that figure is now down to 11  percent.    4. Unprofitable routes: every 100 francs taken in is offset  by 117 francs in expenditures in North Atlantic traffic, 111  francs in South America, 110 francs in Europe, and 108 francs in  Asia. Only West Africa pays off: with a profit of 6 francs!    5. The fleet is too heterogeneous: there are 24 different  aircraft types (British Airways has 20) and 33 different cockpit  versions.    6. Productivity is much too low: a British Airways agent  produces 130 francs in revenues where an Air France agent  produces 100, but what makes it worse is that the British agent  costs 80 in wages and benefits, whereas the Air France agent  costs 100.    7. Inappropriate working methods: where Air France spends  100  francs to carry passengers and/or freight, Lufthansa spends 94  francs and British Airways spends 89 francs.    8. Organization and operating methods are too cumbersome,  complex, hierarchical, and centralized--in other words, too  costly.    9. The idea of customer service is insufficiently developed.    The objectives are set forth below. The meetings last Monday  and Tuesday were to result in a new consensus document. That  document will be submitted to all of the company's personnel,  who will then have two months in which to give their input. The  "plan for the company" that will emerge from this vast dialogue  next spring will then be used as a common reference point for  implementing the necessary actions.    The objective is to see to it that a significant portion of  Air France's capital will belong to the personnel within three  years if the necessary actions are successful.  <H5>  Main Objectives </H5>   1. To increase the company's economic efficiency by 30  percent within three years.    2. To achieve a 14-percent increase in revenues within three  years.    3. To achieve savings of 7 percent per year in all operating  expenses for three years. This means buying less and better.    4. To reduce personnel costs by 10 percent annually for  three  years.    5. To reduce financial costs by half over the next five  years. However, the state will not be able to inject more  capital unless a return to a sound position becomes apparent.  That is a necessary condition for getting the green light from  Brussels.    The target year is 1997, the reason being that 1997 will  mark  the start of the single European air transport market, and it  should also mark an end to the era of overcapacity in the  airlines.</p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / International Bonds: A cold shoulder for Latin American borrowers THE WARM reception which once awaited any Latin American equity or bond issuer is cooling. With a large queue of Latin American names waiting to tap the international bond markets over the next few months, foreign investors have turned cold at the prospect of oversupply. As a result, several Latin American borrowers have had to offer more attractive terms on their bond issues in order to raise the necessary funds, while yield spreads on existing issues have widened by as much as 100 basis points. The pressure in the Eurobond market is prompting borrowers to consider other means of raising finance. For example, Compania de Telefonos de Chile, the Chilean telecommunications company, is preparing to launch a convertible bond issue, and other borrowers may consider subordinated debt issues with convertibility rights, investment bankers have said. The cold-shouldering of Latin American bond issues follows an equally frosty response to international equity offerings from that part of the globe. International equity offerings from companies such as Banacci, the Mexican holding company which owns the country's biggest bank, and Grupo Synkro, the Mexican consumer goods company, were postponed earlier this year due to unfavourable stock market conditions. On the recent increase in bond yield spreads, Mr Paul Luke, an analyst at Morgan Grenfell, says: 'The Eurobond market has caught up with what happened in the domestic equities markets.' The trigger for the bond market has been concern about oversupply. Mr Stephen Dizard, head of trading in Salomon Brothers' emerging markets department in New York, shocked investors and bond market participants at a conference in early October with his estimate that a total of Dollars 20bn of Latin American bond issues was expected within the next 12 months, of which Dollars 4bn was due by the end of 1992. Mr Richard Watkins, chief executive of the LatInvest Group, an investment banking group, says: 'The implication was that the figures were so large, borrowers would have to pay a higher price in order to complete them.' And one bond dealer adds: 'It has come as a shock to the market that there was such a backlog of deals.' Yield spreads on Latin American bonds - particularly those from Mexican and Argentine borrowers - have shown a marked narrowing earlier in the year and some bond market participants claim that by the summer of 1992, deals from these countries were being launched at very aggressive prices. However, recent worry about oversupply has caused a reversal of this trend, and the yield spreads over US Treasuries have widened again. To take an example: Nafinsa, the Mexican state development bank, has a bond maturing in 2001 which traded at a yield spread over US Treasuries of 360 basis points at the start of the year. The spread narrowed to 200 basis points by the summer, but it now lies at around 310 basis points. Latin American borrowers have had to adjust the yield spreads on new issues accordingly. Dealers point out that oversupply concerns have added about 100 basis points to the yield spreads as a rough rule of thumb. One syndicate manager says: 'A few weeks ago we were talking with borrowers about yield spreads of 325 to 350 basis points over five-year Treasuries in the pre-marketing discussions: we then had to move towards 375 to 400 basis points, and eventually launched at 400 to 450 basis points.' The Republic of Argentina's Dollars 250m five-year issue, which was launched at the end of September at a yield spread of 300 basis points over Treasuries, is now at a bid-offer spread of 385 to 360 basis points, according to CSFB, the lead manager. Yield spreads on Argentine bonds widened further last week as Argentina's financial markets were troubled by rumours that Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, might resign, coupled with concern about the government's commitment to economic reform. Salomon Brothers' recent Dollars 150m five-year deal for Grupo Dina, Mexico's largest truck manufacturer, was originally supposed to be launched at a yield spread of 350 basis points. Eventually it was launched with a yield spread of 475 basis points, and the deal is now trading at 500 basis points over the Treasury. Goldman Sachs' recent Dollars 100m five-year issue for Gemex of Mexico was launched at a yield spread of 475 basis points, whereas in the early discussions with the borrower, the lead manager had suggested a spread of 350 basis points. Investment bankers cite a host of additional reasons why investors are rather less enthusiastic about Latin American issues today. These range from the scandal surrounding President Collor in Brazil, to political concerns in Venezuela, and worries about the size of the Mexican current account deficit. Furthermore, non-US investors have tended to focus more on the European bond markets, seeking safety in the D-Mark bloc, and have shown less interest in the US dollar markets because of the lower interest rates. Dealers believe that some Latin American borrowers will simply postpone their bond issues in the hope that yield spreads will narrow again. However, others may have to accept the new pricing levels. One syndicate manager says: 'Some deals simply have to be done because the companies need the funding at any price in order to pay off bridging loans and other commitments.' Mr Paul Luke believes it is unlikely that the market will see any narrowing of spreads given the impending supply. Lead managers admit that they are having problems promoting the issues. 'We are having to work hard to sell the credits' says one manager.</p>

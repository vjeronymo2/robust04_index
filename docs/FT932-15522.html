			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / People: SG Warburg's finance director off to Japan It is unusual for a London merchant bank to post one of its most senior men to Tokyo at the relatively mature age of 55, and even more unusual when the person in question is the group's finance director. However, SG Warburg stresses that Michael Gore's appointment as executive head of the Asia Pacific region reflects an upgrading of the importance of the area in the group's affairs, rather than a response to problems associated with undisclosed losses in Japan. Warburg, in common with several foreign brokers and investment banks, has found it difficult to make money in Japanese equities, but says that its Tokyo business has been doing much better over the past few months. Close to a fifth of the group's 5,200 staff are located in the region. Gore (right), who joined Warburg in 1964 and is one of the group's three vice-chairmen, has had board responsibility for the group's Asia Pacific strategy area for the past nine months. After the group's well publicised problems in Japan last year, it was reported that he intended to spend three months a year in Tokyo. Warburg's decision to put Gore's Tokyo posting on a more permanent footing means that he has had to give up being group finance director - a job he has held since 1986. The job will now be shared between Simon Leathes, 45, Warburg's chief financial officer, and John Trueman, 50, chairman of the group risk committee. They will both report to the chief executive. Gore is not the only Tokyo-bound merchant banker, however. Lord Trenchard, 42 (far right), president of Kleinwort Benson International, who has been named as KB's senior representative in Japan, is more than a dozen years younger and is an old Japan hand. He was the firm's chief representative in Japan between 1980 and 1985. He replaces Gregory Shenkman, 42, who is being seconded to the Department of Trade and Industry to assist with export promotion before returning to KB in mid-1994.</p>

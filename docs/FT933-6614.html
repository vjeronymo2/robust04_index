			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF in venture talks THOMSON-CSF, the French defence electronics group and Aerospatiale, the French aircraft manufacturer, are negotiating an alliance between their joint avionics operation and the commercial avionics business of Allied Signal of the US. A joint venture between Sextant Avionics and Allied Signal would create one of the world's largest aircraft electronics groups with annual sales of about Dollars 1bn. The restructuring of Sextant also involves a public offer for the 47.6 per cent of the shares not owned by Thomson-CSF and Aerospatiale. The two companies are offering minority shareholders FFr300 per share. Sextant's quotation was suspended two weeks ago when the share price was FFr250. Should the public offer be successful, Thomson-CSF would take 66.6 per cent of the shares in Sextant and the rest would be held by Aerospatiale. A spokesman for Thomson-CSF said that the restructuring of Sextant reflected the difficulties encountered by the group as a result of the depressed defence and commercial aviation markets. The avionics company has not paid a dividend for two years. Sextant said in a statement that a if joint venture was agreed with Allied Signal, it would be be finalised by the end of the year.</p>

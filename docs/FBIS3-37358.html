The 265 state farms remaining in the republic will adopt other  forms of economic operation.    Relays of "Ostankino" news have also been terminated. The  cap on broadcasts from Moscow is explained in Tashkent by the  fact that "Ostankino" chiefs have not signed an accord on  relaying their programs to Uzbekistan in 1994. The other  programs (with the exception of news) of the "Ostankino" channel  continue to be relayed to Uzbekistan in full.</p>

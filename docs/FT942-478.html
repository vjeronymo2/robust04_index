			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Dairy trade concerned at Milk Marque price rise The dairy trade yesterday expressed concern at an increase in prices being asked by Milk Marque, the dairy farmers' co-operative that will succeed the Milk Marketing Board when the industry is liberalised in November. Mr Andrew Dare, Milk Marque chief executive, announced that the group would initially seek an average price of 25p per litre from dairy companies, 3.8 per cent higher than the board's average for 1993-94. 'The eventual prices that Milk Marque will sell at will largely be determined by customers' bidding behaviour,' he said. 'We are asking how much milk they would like to buy from us at the prices we are quoting.' Dairy companies pointed out the percentage rise was much higher for butter and cheese manufacturers, compared with present prices. Mr John Price, director-general of the Dairy Trade Federation, said: 'They are very significant increases on current prices, which are based on the market. This is exactly why we expressed concern about Milk Marque's monopoly position in the first place.' Milk Marque's initial sale prices range from 23.4p a litre to 26.3p a litre. The lowest price is 11 per cent higher than the 21.1p that butter manufacturers are paying for their milk, and nearly 9 per cent above the price paid by Cheddar cheese makers. Among the leading processors is Dairy Crest, the Milk Marketing Board subsidiary which is to be floated on the stock market. Milk Marque said: 'We don't treat Dairy Crest any differently from any other company.' Mr Dare has argued that butter and cheese companies will be able to pay more in the free market because they will be able to operate at a higher capacity once they can secure the supplies they need.</p>

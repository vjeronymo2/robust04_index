			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS RAP BUSH ON BROKEN VOWS, TIMIDITY  </P> <P> Democratic leaders took the offensive today against President Bush's high  approval ratings, accusing the President of broken promises and timid  leadership and vowing to end his "free ride."  </P> <P> Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the vice presidential nominee on the party's  losing 1988 ticket, told the Democratic Leadership Council that Bush's campaign  pledge of no new taxes has become "pure Bushlips."  </P> <P> Bentsen said the Administration has proposed an array of "crypto-taxes" such as  user fees, surcharges and other levies. He also accused Bush of being too  worried about public opinion to help emerging democracies around the globe.  </P> <P> "Can you imagine Harry Truman hesitating to unveil the Truman Doctrine or the  Marshall Plan or the Berlin Airlift because he feared public opinion polls? Can  you imagine John Kennedy doing a poll before he dealt with the Cuban missile  crisis?" Bentsen asked.  </P> <P> The same theme was sounded by Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.)  </P> <P> "Precisely as our principles and values are prevailing throughout the world,  America's trumpet is sounding an uncertain note," Nunn said.  </P> <P> The often-fractious Democrats were trying to play down their differences today  as two major party groups met in separate cities to plot strategy for their  next attempt to recapture the White House.  </P> <P> While the leadership council, dominated by elected officials, met in New  Orleans, the Democratic National Committee was meeting in Indianapolis.  </P></p>

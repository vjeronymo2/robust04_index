			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 Jan (EFE) -- Concern over  conditions of human life and the consumption of earth resources  were the main subject in the conclusions of the 19th General  Assembly of the World Conservation Union [Union Internacional  para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza -- UICN], which closed  after 10 days of debate in Buenos Aires.    There was more interest in the sustained development of the  planet, that is for the conditions in which human life develops  and for the rational consumption of the earth resources, than in  the effort to preserve animal species and ecologic systems.    This attitude caused discomfort among some non-government  organizations which fear that the UICN may become a bureaucratic  entity similar to other international forums in its efforts to  establish a dialogue with industry and commerce.    The UICN considers the growing membership of indigenous,  agricultural, and cattle farmer groups favors strong action in  favor of the preservation of traditional resources and  development, which should be gauged according to the capability  of each region.    Experts say the industrialization process of developed  countries should not be repeated, given that they have  devastated most of their territories. Experts instead favor a  development method that will protect the resources of each area  and take advantage of the traditional knowledge of local  inhabitants.    Experts from the five continents nonetheless greeted the  unity shown by some national delegations in face of their need  to present their proposals before the UICN as well as the  capacity to unite like some regional blocs have done to  strengthen their position.    The resolutions were presented by government and  non-government members of the UICN. Of the 159 proposals, about  50 were withdrawn or dismissed.    The Spanish delegation managed to get its proposal to  establish the Mediterranean Regional Office headquarters in  Spain accepted. The coordination of activities in the  Mediterranean basin will thus be managed from the Iberian  peninsula.    The UICN groups together 600 Non-Governmental Organizations  (NGO), 100 governmental agencies, and 67 member states. For the  voting power to be balanced, NGO's and states are granted one  vote while agencies (on condition they do not represent a member  state) are given two votes.    Experts were of one mind about the importance of UICN  meetings in providing useful dialogue between governmental and  nongovernmental groups, since every motion before the assembly  must be passed by consensus following a debate.    The influence of the UICN over governments has enabled some  NGO's to successfully request UICN help to urge their countries'  authorities to abide by ecological regulations accepted by the  international community.    The European group, however, was somewhat reluctant to  discuss governmental issues that are deemed to fall under the  jurisdiction of the European Union (UE), like questions  pertaining to the GATT.    Biodiversity, the exportation of toxic waste, and  environmental education were among the subjects mooted at the  general assembly as well as internal issues, UICN actions before  some governments, sustainable development, the conservation of  different species, and the management of natural resources.    No agreement was reached on a resolution that sought to  regulate UICN's action over the World Bank and other  international financial organizations due to the amendments  introduced by a group of NGO's.    Following a heated debate on the law on the hunt of large  cetacea, two resolutions highlighting the ban on whaling were  passed.    The minutes and resolutions of the 19th UICN General  Assembly  will soon be published and distributed among its members.</p>

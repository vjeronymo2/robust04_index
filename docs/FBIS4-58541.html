			<p>BFN     [Text] At a Cabinet session today, a recent decision by the  committee for regulating the foreign currency market was raised,  which relates to the supply of foreign currency to those  importers who have registered or will be registering at the  Ministry of Commerce for imports in lieu of their exports. It  was decided that the banking system will follow the policy  diligently and that the companies and establishments owned by  the government or affiliated to it will avoid participation in  the foreign currency market.    Taking into consideration the readiness of the banking  system  to supply the foreign currency requirements of this group of  importers, the presence of state companies and those companies  affiliated to the government in the foreign currency market will  be deemed treason and offenders will be prosecuted.    According to a decision by the Cabinet, any negligence by  executive banks in carrying out the new decisions by the foreign  currency regulating committee will be deemed as collaboration  with saboteurs of the state currency and economic system.</p>

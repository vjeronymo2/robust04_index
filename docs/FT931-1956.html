			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Wilkinson Sword sold at a loss WARNER-LAMBERT, the US pharmaceuticals and consumer products manufacturer, yesterday agreed to buy Wilkinson Sword, the razor and toiletries company, from a consortium of international investors for Dollars 142m (Pounds 100m) in cash. The deal ends prolonged uncertainty about the future of Wilkinson, which has changed hands four times since 1980 and has been burdened by mounting debt. However, the sale price is substantially less than the total investments made in the business by its current owners. The sale should permit a settlement of the legal conflict between international anti-trust authorities and Gillette, the US leader in the world wet shaving market, which indirectly owns shares in Wilkinson and is one of its largest creditors. Warner-Lambert said the acquisition would expand its international sales of shaving and personal care products. Though the company's Schick brand is number two in the US razor market, it has only a limited presence in Europe. Wilkinson, which last year launched an advanced shaving system known as Protector, sells mostly in Germany and Britain and has a factory in each country. It had sales last year of Dollars 190m, on which it made a small trading profit, while Schick's worldwide sales totalled Dollars 316m. Wilkinson has been owned since 1988 by Eemland, a Dutch-registered holding company which purchased the business from Stora, the Swedish forest products group. Eemland's shareholders include several Scandinavian financial institutions and JP Morgan, the US bank. Gillette owns a 22 per cent non-voting stake in Eemland and has loaned it more than Dollars 100m. Eemland put Wilkinson up for sale last year after its Scandinavian shareholders decided they could not afford to inject further capital. In addition, Gillette has been ordered by the European Commission and anti-trust authorities in several countries to end its involvement in Eemland, on the grounds that it is anti-competitive. Warner-Lambert will not assume Eemland's debt of about Dollars 300m. The deal provides for a small additional payment if Wilkinson's Protector sales meet specified targets, it is understood the total proceeds will leave Eemland's shareholders with a loss of Dollars 200m.</p>

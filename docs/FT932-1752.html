			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rallies on higher bonds and dollar Wall Street US SHARE prices staged a modest rally yesterday as equities, aided by firmer bonds and a stronger dollar, rebounded from last Friday's futures and options-related losses, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 16.05 ahead at 3,510.82, near its peak for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 2.54 higher at 446.22, but the Nasdaq composite was down 0.85 at 688.74. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 223.6m shares and rises outnumbered declines by 1,124 to 818. Last week ended with a steep loss on the Dow, incurred because of selling linked to the monthly expiration of stock and stock index futures and options, an event known as 'triple-witching'. Consequently, prices bounced back at the opening yesterday in the traditional post-triple-witching rally, with the Dow gaining 16 points in the first few minutes of trading. Stocks, however, were unable to hold on to those gains and by early afternoon, prices were either unchanged or, in the case of secondary issues, firmly anchored in negative territory. Later in the day the market righted itself once again, supported by a solid rise in bond prices - the benchmark 30-year bond rose half a point, in the process pushing the yield down to 6.77 per cent. Bonds were cheered by positive remarks about inflation from a senior Federal Reserve official. The Dow was aided in its recovery by a sharp turnround in Caterpillar shares, which had fallen sharply in early trading, depressing the markets' leading average. In spite of yesterday's gains, some analysts believe the markets may have already settled into a narrow trading pattern for the summer, and a period of relatively subdued activity. Caterpillar initally fell more than Dollars 5 to Dollars 72 in hectic trading after the company warned that its non-US business was weakening. Later in the session, however, the price rallied to end a net Dollars 1 1/2 down at Dollars 75 3/4 on turnover of 1.1m shares. Tambrands jumped Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 46 1/4 in heavy trading on reports that the board is considering selling the company, which at the start of trading yesterday had a market value of about Dollars 1.6bn. One of the companies named as a possible buyer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, saw its shares slip Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 42 1/4 . Nike plunged Dollars 9 1/8 to Dollars 57 7/8 as investors got the first real chance to react to Friday's news, announced after the market had closed, that the sportswear maker expects its earnings for the year ending in May 1994 to fall significantly short of market expectations. The warning led to a series of ratings downgrades by Wall Street brokers, further pummelling the share price. Reebok, Nike's main rival in the competitive sports shoe market, dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 29 3/8 in sympathy. Canada TORONTO price movements were mixed after a fair turnover. The TSE 300 index ended 15.5 up at 3,922.4 but declines narrowly led advances by 358 to 351. Volume totalled 55.5m shares valued at CDollars 612m. Eleven of the 14 stock groups finished higher, the paper and forest products group leading with a rise of 1.55 per cent.</p>

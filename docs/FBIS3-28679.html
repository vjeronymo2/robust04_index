Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan  Federation of Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), said the  package should give a further impetus to the Japanese economy,  which he said is beginning to show signs of recovery.    Some executives, however, expressed doubts over the  confusion  in the coalition government following Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's announcement of a "national welfare tax."    He proposed last Thursday that the government introduce a  fresh 7 percent "national welfare tax" in April 1997 to finance  the tax reduction that will be retroactive to January 1. But in  the face of stiff opposition from the Social Democratic Party  [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the biggest contingent in his  seven-party coalition, he was forced to retract the scheme.    Yoshiaki Sakakura, chairman of the Japan Department Stores  Association, said he was perplexed when Hosokawa retracted the  tax cut proposal.    Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of  Corporate  Executives (Keizai Doyukai), said the SDPJ should have acted "in  a more responsible manner" as the No. 1 coalition partner.    Nagano also said the size of the tax cuts could have been  larger but added he had no objections to implementing tax cuts  without securing funds to finance them.    Osamu Uno, chairman of the Kansai Economic Federation  (Kankeiren) in western Japan, also said implementing tax cuts  without securing funds to make up for them was unavoidable  because Japan is in deep recession and Hosokawa faces a summit  with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday in Washington.</p>

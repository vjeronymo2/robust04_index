Writing in the Fabian Review, Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, says that the party needs a 'bold and radical identity', and must resist both those who believe 'one more heave' will win the party the next election, and those on the left of the party whose solutions offer a return to Labour's past.</p>

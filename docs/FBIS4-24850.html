			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, June 1 (XINHUA) -- The European Union (EU)  has further demonstrated its support for China's bid to rejoin  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Following three days of talks in Brussels between Chinese  trade representatives and the EU, Roderick Abbott, the Union's  director to the GATT, said that resumption of China's GATT  membership would be a significant move, especially for its  founding membership of a World Trade Organization to be set up  early next year.    The EU has backed measures for the completion of  negotiations  which could see China voted back into the trade group by the end  of this year.    Long Yongtu, head of the Chinese delegation, said "important  progress" was made in the talks, which ended today, and that the  two sides had reached understanding about most of the protocol  articles for China's reinstatement.    But he said there was still some differences such as easing  China's foreign trade restrictions. Talks will resume in a  month in a bid to solve these issues.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Campaign Against Drug Smugglers"] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has taken stern notice  of the increasing drug abuse in our country and has instructed  taking some steps against it. At the same time, she told the  relevant government agencies to become fully active in this  area. While chairing a high-level meeting of an antinarcotics  task force in Islamabad on 30 November, she approved plans for a  strong and effective operation against major smugglers and  smuggling in this country. On this occasion, Madam Bhutto said  that the drug smugglers must be arrested at any cost, and the  government will not accept political pressure of any kind in  this context so that this curse can be eradicated from our  country. While addressing this special meeting, the prime  minister instructed them to deal with the drug smugglers with an  iron hand.    The government cannot tolerate this ugly crime and curse  under any circumstance because this curse has ruined thousands  of people and their families. Who does not know that production  and smuggling of drugs in our country has caused innumerable  social and moral ills here and many people are losing their  health and lives. Not only this, members of their family, after  suffering from economic and social crisis, lead impoverished  lives.    If we briefly survey our recent past, we will learn that the  drug abuse epidemic that has spread all over our country did not  even exist 12-14 year ago. There was not even one heroin addict  in our whole country, and now they number in the hundreds of  thousands. The number is increasing rapidly. In addition, we are  getting a bad name abroad, and this is not a secret. Those who  have travelled abroad well know that every Pakistani is  considered to be a drug dealer in Western nations although most  of these nations suffer from this curse themselves.    It is our misfortune that many influential persons in our  country are involved or they are protecting these criminals who  are involved in this hated drug trade here or abroad. At times,  this involvement enters into our politics because it is not  possible to practice politics here without a lot of money, and  there is no easier way to collect a lot of money than this  trade. A review of the drug trade shows that it is destroying  our society here and giving our country a bad name abroad. The  previous governments had also announced plans of action against  drug smugglers, and the leaders had expressed their  determination to use an iron hand to arrest drug smugglers and  punish them in order to rid the country of this curse. However,  the spout continued to grow right there. The action of the  present government to rid society of the curse of drugs and to  take action against it is commendable. Still, we must study the  reasons for the failure of previous governments in this area.  Who are the people who protect these criminals? Why were not the  operations launched in the past successful? Until these basic  facts are analyzed, every campaign in this area will be  unsuccessful.</p>

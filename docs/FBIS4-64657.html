			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- Coordination of policies, including both  countries' claim to a seat on the UN Security Council, was among  the issues that Japan's Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata discussed  with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in Bonn on Thursday [5 May].  With this meeting the newly elected head of government started  off his political talks. During his 24-hour stay in Germany he  will also meet with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who will host a  dinner for Hata tonight.    The main topics to be discussed will be Japan's one-sided  foreign trade balance, and thus its relations with the European  Union, with which Hata will have talks in Brussels on Friday.  Before travelling to Bonn, Japan's head of government said in  Paris that his country's trade surplus is unhealthy. Japan is  the FRG's major trading partner in the Far East. The government  in Bonn is likely to draw Hata's attention to investment  opportunities in the new laender.</p>

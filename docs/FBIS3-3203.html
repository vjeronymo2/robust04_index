			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, March 17 (XINHUA) -- The Sino-American  Trade Development Council today urged all groups and firms  concerned to contribute to renewal of China's most favored  nation (MFN) trade status with the U.S.    At a press conference here this morning, council Chairman  Robert Goodman said urgent actions should be taken to bridge the  communications gap and to avert cancellation of China's MFN  status which would be equally detrimental to both countries.    That there are serious misunderstandings and misimpressions  in the U.S. as to what the real situation in China is and these  are endangering MFN renewal, he said.    "Americans need to hear about and appreciate the tremendous  advances that China has made in recent years on human rights and  to understand the improvements in the standard of living that  China has achieved for its citizens," he said.    China deserves to be given credit for their accomplishments  in these important areas, Goodman said, as it "has, after all,  managed to employ, feed and house one billion people."  furthermore, "no one could dispute that the booming Chinese  economy is providing unprecedented economic opportunities for  its citizens," Goodman added.    the council chairman argued that America has heard more  through the media about the small numbers of dissidents and not  from the millions of ordinary working people in China who are  satisfied with and enjoying the improved living standard.    "this silent majority also has a right to be heard," he  stressed.    he predicted the voice of the average Chinese workers, who  have a stake in the MFN issue, would be even more influential to  the U.S. Congressmen.    to facilitate this effort, Goodman suggested a special Sino-  American cultural exchange fellowship program, calling on all  groups and firms concerned to finance visits by ordinary Chinese  people to meet congressmen in Washington and broaden their  understanding.    "I am convinced that China is very much committed to  improving human rights, but would do so within the context of  their own social environment," he said.    Goodman said he was also impressed by China's commitment to  broaden and strengthen its relationship with the U.S. and to  promote bilateral trade opportunities.    His council would be recommending to President Bill Clinton  and the U.S. Congress to grant permanent renewal of MFN for  China, Goodman added.    The Sino-American Trade Development Council, founded in  early  1993, is a non-governmental organization which acts as a bridge  between China and the U.S. to promote trade contacts and  cultural understanding, especially for small businesses of the  two countries.</p>

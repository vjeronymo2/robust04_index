			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> LA. YOUTHS HELP ERASE NORTH-SOUTH BIAS  </P> <P> Rachel Thompson had never tasted shrimp in her native Louisiana, and Ronnie  Emonet had never heard the wind moan through the pines in the hill country of  his home state.  </P> <P> The two 16-year-olds represent the best hope for dismantling a wall of mistrust  built generations ago between two cultures, said Carole Andrepont of Opelousas,  who turned what started as a joke into a social experiment that worked.  </P> <P> Andrepont, a member of the Louisiana Tourism Board active in international  youth exchange programs, jokingly told a friend one day: "If you want to have a  real cultural exchange, have folks from north Louisiana come to south  Louisiana. It's like two different countries."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Full Cup of Life  </P> <P> An almost visible line across the center of Louisiana separates the staid  upstate Protestants from the Catholic Cajuns, who make time for work around a  busy schedule of enjoying the full cup of life.  </P> <P> The Cajuns, descendants of French exiles from Nova Scotia, make up a third of  the state's population. Those of different ancestry who also live in south  Louisiana have adopted the laid-back Cajun life style.  </P> <P> Former Gov. Edwin Edwards, the first French-speaking Catholic elected to the  state's highest office this century, says the division is more perception than  anything else, but that "perception can be real."  </P> <P> "The barrier exists in the minds of those who have not had the opportunity to  visit one end of the state or the other," he said, "but invariably, when they  do, they come away with an amazement of how much in common they have."  </P> <P> "The barrier is exaggerated but it's there," added Gov. Buddy Roemer, whose  family plantation is not far from the Arkansas border in north Louisiana.  </P> <P> "A real factor has been a lack of quality transportation. It's hard to get from  upstate Shreveport to New Orleans. In fact, it's easier to get from Shreveport  to Dallas."  </P> <P> Edwards and Roemer agree that an exchange program for Louisiana youths could  eventually close the perceived culture gap.  </P> <P> The idea gnawed at Andrepont, and she mentioned it to Linda Graham, her Ruston  counterpart, at a tourism meeting in Baton Rouge.  </P> <P> "I told her I had an idea about two cities having an exchange program, and the  more we looked at it, the more we liked it," she said. "We talked to our  mayors, school officials and civic leaders. Now, we've done it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Students Swap Hometowns  </P> <P> In a recently ended two-week program, about 20 Ruston high school students  spent a week in Opelousas and an equal number of the south Louisiana students  stayed in Ruston.  </P> <P> The students stayed in the homes of host families who treated them like their  own kids, Andrepont said.  </P> <P> The mayors and civic leaders also visited each other's cities. Like the kids,  they discovered that people everywhere are just folks and develop different  views, depending on personalities and surroundings.  </P> <P> "The people are more free, more open down here," said Rachel, who attends  Ruston High School. "Up north we're very polite, but down here. . . .  </P> <P> "I called my mom and said I was staying here another two weeks. She just  laughed."  </P> <P> "I like Ruston better than here," said Telameckus Anderson, a junior at  Opelousas High School. "They're so nice. The hills are beautiful!"  </P> <P> "The family I stayed with made me feel like we were related," said Emonet, a  junior at Opelousas Catholic High.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Language Barrier  </P> <P> Of the response to his Cajun accent, Emonet said: "The girls thought it was  cute. I laughed at their drawls. We laughed with each other."  </P> <P> Graham said she learned something important from her visit to southern  Louisiana:  </P> <P> "I need to go home and loosen up a bit. We're more conservative in Ruston, and  we are organized. I find myself regimented to the point where I get a little  bit irritated when everything doesn't go just like clockwork.  </P> <P> "I learned to relax. I need to come down here about once a month."  </P> <P> Andrepont, meanwhile, said that Cajuns can learn from other life styles, and  perhaps find a middle ground.  </P> <P> "Everything we do is almost overdone," she said. "When we eat, it's a lot, and  the best. If it's seasoned, it's highly seasoned. People who drink -- they  drink!"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Annual Exchange Planned  </P> <P> Graham and Andrepont said the two cities plan to make the exchange program an  annual event, and to encourage other communities to do the same.  </P> <P> "I think this is going to be a state program," Andrepont said. "We've got  Church Point interested in finding a north Louisiana city for an exchange  program. The governor is interested. We need to end the division in this state.  The 40 youngsters in this program don't have the old attitude anymore. It  works."  </P> <P> Roemer, the governor, said: "This is the first of several such programs that  will happen over the next year. One of the issues in my campaign was the need  for all of the state to pull together."  </P></p>

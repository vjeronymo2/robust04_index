			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / French jobless level rises by 1.5% FRANCE'S new conservative government yesterday faced a setback in its attempts to curb unemployment, with the news that the level of joblessness rose by 1.5 per cent last month to just below 11 per cent of the workforce, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. There were more than 45,600 job losses in France during April, according to the employment ministry, bringing the total number of unemployed to a record 3.11m. The depth of the economic downturn was highlighted yesterday when the LVMH luxury goods group announced it was shedding 89 employees at its Pommery champagne business. LVMH earlier made 245 redundancies at the Moet et Chandon and Mercier champagne houses, which sparked stormy protests earlier this week. The government itself yesterday came under fierce criticism from trade unions following Thursday's disclosure that it plans to reduce the number of civil servants at the rate of 1.5 per cent a year from the present tally of 2.1m.</p>

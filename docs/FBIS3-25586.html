Claassen] </F>   [Text] Postmasburg Feb 23 SAPA -- A black youth has been  arrested by security staff after pointing and firing a toy  pistol at President F W de Klerk's passing election motorcade.  He stood on a street corner in Postmasburg, went down on one  knee in a firing position, and pulled off several shots at the  motorcade as it passed.    Security men accompanying Mr de Klerk on his two-day  election  tour turned round and arrested him and confirmed to SAPA later  that he would be charged. "He is lucky our snipers were not on  that corner," a senior policemen said. "He could have been  killed before it was established it was a toy pistol."    Mr de Klerk addressed about 200 supporters outside  postmasburg city hall before a lunchtime address to a further  200 National Party guests inside.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Dutch bank head wants sharp cut in budget deficit THE Dutch central bank has called for the country's budget deficit to be cut to well below 3 per cent of gross domestic product, one of the main convergence criteria for creation of European monetary union later this decade. Mr Wim Duisenberg, central bank president, said the Dutch budget deficit should be kept below this European ceiling 'by a considerable margin', partly to help accelerate reduction of public debt. In 1992, the Dutch budget deficit was equivalent to roughly 3.8 per cent of GDP, while public debt stood at 80 per cent of GDP, well above the Emu target of 60 per cent. Speaking at the presentation of the bank's annual report, Mr Duisenberg said the government formed after next year's general election should aim to make a 'substantial further reduction' in the deficit during its four-year term in office. He noted that the Dutch government had so far managed to reduce the budget deficit in line with its annual targets, though this was sometimes achieved by raising taxes and social security premiums rather than cutting spending. 'However, it is with concern that the bank notes that in our country, too, discipline is in danger of slackening,' he said. Last week in Basle, Mr Duisenberg, who is chairman of the committee of European Community central bank governors, warned of the dangers of a widespread 'structural deterioration' in state finances around Europe. In its report, the Dutch bank cites population ageing as a reason why the Netherlands should try to cut the deficit below the Emu ceiling and so gain control over interest payments on the national debt, which now absorb 6 per cent of GDP. 'Through lower interest payments, deficit reduction to a level significantly below 3 per cent of GDP would provide some leeway to cope with this pressure on expenditure which will inevitably have to be faced in the future,' it said.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Hoesch falls, but maintains dividend HOESCH, the diversified German steel and engineering group, yesterday reported 1990 group operating profits down to DM440m (Dollars 258.8m) from DM517m in 1989, reflecting a DM100m drop in steel profits. The company, which has been the focus of uncertainty about its future leadership, is maintaining a dividend of DM10 for last year. Total consolidated turnover rose to DM16.1bn from DM15.8bn in 1989. Group net profits were given as DM103m; comparisons with 1989 were hindered by changes in accounting procedures bringing accounts on to a consolidated basis. Whereas steel profits in 1989 accounted for half the operating profit, last year's steel ratio fell to only 35 per cent. Mr Gunter Flohr, board member in charge of sales, said he believed the slide in steel prices would come to an end in the second quarter, leading to a price increase of DM20 to DM35 per tonne. Hoesch's supervisory board last month ended speculation by announcing that Mr Kajo Neukirchen, head of investment goods group Klockner Humboldt Deutz, would take over as chief executive.</p>

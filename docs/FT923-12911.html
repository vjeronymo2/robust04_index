			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Norway warned on whaling NORWAY might find it hard to join the EC unless it drops its plan to resume commercial whaling, a Community Commissioner warned yesterday. With the express intention of putting pressure on Norway, expected to apply for EC membership in November, the European Commission yesterday formally proposed the Community should become a member, in its own right, of the International Whaling Commission. Last month, Norway announced it would resume commercial whaling next spring, pre-empting an IWC verdict on whether this would be allowed. Announcing the proposal to seek a Community seat in the IWC, Mr Manuel Marin, EC fisheries commissioner, said such a move would make IWC rules and recommendations part of EC law. 'Any country wishing to join the Community would have to go along with that,' he said.</p>

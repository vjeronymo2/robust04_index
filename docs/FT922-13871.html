			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Banker may quit O&amp;Y debt role MR TOM JOHNSON, the banker brought in to spearhead the reorganisation of Olympia &amp; York's Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.6bn) debt, is expected to give up his role as chairman of O&amp;Y's committee in charge of negotiations with 200 banks just two weeks after being appointed. Mr Johnson is also likely to step down as president of O&amp;Y's main operating subsidiary, Olympia and York Developments. O&amp;Y is not expected to appoint a new president of O&amp;Y Developments. Mr Paul Reichmann, O&amp;Y's founder, will be left firmly in control of the property group. Mr Johnson's abrupt change of role has caused consternation among bankers. However, both Mr Johnson and Mr Reichmann have told sources close to the talks that there has not been 'a bust-up' between them. In 1991, Mr Johnson resigned as president of the New York bank, Manufacturers Hanover, when it agreed to merge with its local rival Chemical Bank. His original appointment at O&amp;Y was welcomed by bankers who have a high regard for him. Bankers in the core group, led by Canadian Imperial Banking Corporation, Citicorp and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Group, said yesterday they were anxious that banks outside the inner circle should not be unsettled by this change. Agreement has not yet been reached on the precise scope of Mr Johnson's new role, though O&amp;Y stressed that he will continue to be involved. However, a banker said yesterday that he would be 'taking a back seat'. The lead in formulating the reconstruction plan has, in practice, been taken by Mr Steve Miller, a partner in the investment bank, James D Wolfensohn. As a result, Mr Miller will replace Mr Johnson as chairman of the planning and finance committee. Mr Miller played a vital role in the financial reorganisation of Chrysler, the US automotive manufacturer, a decade ago. Around 300 bankers are due to meet in Toronto on Monday, a week later than originally planned, to hear details of O&amp;Y's debt rescheduling proposals. It is understood O&amp;Y will make an announcement about Mr Johnson's change of role before then.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA MISSES POINT; RULE SUITS KICKERS TO A TEE  </P> <P> Concerned that field goals were increasing scoring at an alarming rate in  college football, the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules makers decided  to do something about it this year.  </P> <P> We'll fix those soccer-style kickers, they said in essence. We'll take their  kicking tees away from them for field goals and extra points.  </P> <P> So the kickers were literally grounded.  </P> <P> However, in Division 1-A, the kickers are getting a big boot out of the new  rule.  </P> <P> In 78 games played so far, field goal kickers have made 191 of 272 attempts,  70.2%. The NCAA record for a season is 68.2%, set in 1984.  </P> <P> "We've really made an impact by taking the tee away," joked Davey Nelson of the  NCAA.  </P> <P> Nelson is the secretary-rules editor of the NCAA Football Rules Committee, who  pushed for the new kicking rule.  </P> <P> "I never figured (the success rate) would get better," he said.  </P> <P> Jim Van Valkenburg, director of statistics for the NCAA, had other figures that  showed that removing the kicking tee hasn't affected the kickers' accuracy, or  production.  </P> <P>  -- Last week, including a Thursday night game, field goal kickers had a 73.2%  accuracy rating. That's the third-highest in NCAA history, behind 76% on Nov.  5, 1988 and 74.1% on Oct. 6, 1984.  </P> <P>  -- Fewer field goals have been attempted from 40 yards or farther, Van  Valkenburg said. However, from the 40- to 49-yard range, accuracy is 61.6%,  compared to a record 57.5% for the 1984 season.  </P> <P>  -- Moreover, from 50 yards or farther, the nation's kickers have made 45%  (nine of 20). The season record for such long-distance kicks is 37.3% set in  1984.  </P> <P>  -- Total scoring is at 45.2% compared to a record 47.5% last year. Field goal  production has increased, even though overall scoring is down.  </P> <P> "So field goals are a bigger part of the game at the moment than they ever have  been," Van Valkenburg said.  </P> <P> He added, however, that the extra-point percentage is down, from 95.6% in 1988  to 94%.  </P> <P> "Davey Nelson once described the extra point as exciting as ice fishing and he  doesn't need to change his views there," Van Valkenburg said.  </P> <P> The reason that kickers are so proficient has nothing to do with the tees, Van  Valkenburg said.  </P> <P> "What Nelson is doing for the kickers is to prove how good they are," he said.  "That's my interpretation. So far (rules makers) have failed miserably, but  it's early. (The kickers) haven't run into any bad weather yet."  </P> <P> In adopting the rules change, Nelson noted that scoring has increased from an  average of 32 points a game in 1958 to 46.1 in 1987 because goal posts were  widened from 18 feet 6 inches to 23-4 and unlimited substitutions allowed.  </P> <P> Earlier, Nelson had said the major factor in the increase had been the huge  number of field goals.  </P> <P> Then he said, "Eliminating the tee should have an effect on the kicking game."  </P> <P> Kickers, of course, benefit from kicking off artificial surfaces, though some,  such as USC's Quin Rodriguez, kick off grass for home games.  </P> <P> Rodriguez made two 37-yard field goals in USC's 14-13 loss to Illinois Sept. 4  at the Coliseum.  </P> <P> Asked about the adjustment he had to make now that he doesn't use a tee,  Rodriguez said: "I'm glad that the rule happened. I have more control over the  ball. When I was kicking off the tee I had more room for error.  </P> <P> "There are more sweet spots on the ball kicking from the tee. You relax more  with the tee. But when you kick off the ground, you have to concentrate harder,  following through and having your foot turned just right.  </P> <P> "I think the NCAA rule has backfired."  </P> <P> The new rule certainly didn't hinder Arizona's Doug Pfaff, who tied a school  record with four field goals against Stanford Sept. 2.  </P> <P> "A lot of people get psyched out by kicking off the ground, but not me," he  said.  </P> <P> Kickers are flourishing under the new rule, with the possible exception of  Syracuse's John Biskup. He was carrying a heavy burden in Saturday's game  against Temple.  </P> <P> Syracuse kickers had made a record 260 consecutive extra points since the last  regular-season game of 1978.  </P> <P> Biskup made his first two against Temple, then blew the third one -- and the  record.  </P> <P> Kickers have become the leading scorers on most teams. In the Pacific 10  Conference, only one running back, USC's Marcus Allen, has led the league in  scoring in the 1980s.  </P> <P> Said Nelson: "When we went to two-platoon football, I said scoring would go  down because the better players would be on defense. But scoring for two teams  in a game went from an average of 30 points to 47 points."  </P> <P> Will Nelson present any more legislation to take some of the foot out of  football?  </P> <P> "Sure, bring back the tee," he joked. "Only make it three inches instead of the  two-inch tee it is now."  </P></p>

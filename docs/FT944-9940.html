			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Books: Confessions from the House - MPs with bewitching mistresses wearing the strip? FOOTBALL AND THE COMMONS PEOPLE edited by David Bull and Alastair Campbell Juma Printing and Publishing Pounds 9.95, 317 pages With Westminster knee-deep in sleaze allegations, you might think this was not the time for the minister responsible for the Child Support Agency to confess to having a mistress. Still less a 'bewitching' mistress. And the disclosure that she dresses in red and wears dark stockings will surely make eyes pop at many a Conservative constituency association. Happily, the mistress in question goes by the name of Manchester United and Alistair Burt is owning up merely to the occasional tryst at her Old Trafford love-nest. Readers may find it in themselves to forgive this lapse if they consider that Burt's first footballing love is lowly Bury. Burt's is one of the more entertaining contributions in an intriguing collection of football writing by 30 current and former MPs. The compilation  -a fund-raising exercise for the Child Poverty Action Group - consists mainly of the MPs, including three cabinet ministers, reminiscing about their favourite teams in unashamedly partisan terms. All the main parties are represented and there is a particularly strong Scottish contingent, with contributions covering soccer rivalries in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee. Issues like the Taylor report and the advent of football's premiership are recurrent themes. The collection was co-edited by Alastair Campbell, the Burnley-mad personal press spokesman to Tony Blair, the Labour leader. The quality is uneven but the volume contains some gems and could be a rich source for collectors of footballing-cum-political trivia. How many knew, for example, that chancellor Ken Clarke thought it a 'dreadful mistake' for Nottingham Forest to let Lee Chapman go? Or that home secretary Michael Howard's all-time favourite player was 'probably' Steve Heighway, the Liverpool winger of the 1970s? Hands up those who were aware that Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, received what he calls his 'introduction to market forces' trying to sell programmes outside Raith Rovers' ground in Kirkcaldy. And that Mike Gapes, Labour MP for Ilford South, used to deliver Geoff Hurst's, and sometimes Bobby Moore's, papers. Tantalisingly, he fails to tell us which titles the great men ordered. The chapters that work best are those with the vividest personal memories. Doug Henderson, Labour MP for Newcastle North, conveys a convincing sense of the addictiveness of fandom in his account of supporting Falkirk. 'My life sentence dates back to 1956-57,' he writes. 'The constant fear of the charge of betrayal keeps me hooked.' Peter Snape, Labour MP for West Bromwich East, writes of 'agonising' days as a railway worker at two signal boxes behind Stockport County's ground. 'From the No. 1 box I could see only half the pitch (invariably the wrong half), while No. 2 was immediately behind the pie stall and, although I could hear the roars, I could not see any of the action.' Roy Hattersley, former Labour deputy leader, describes singing away the Saturday afternoons at Sheffield Wednesday 'through mouthfuls of Nuttalls' Mintoes.' The Owls, he predicts, will always remain a different sort of big club: 'Scampi, the real sign of football stardom, will be kept to an absolute minimum.' On a less whimsical note, the Tory MP David Evans contributes an insightful account of his stint as a director of Luton Town - a period which saw the installation of an artificial surface at the club's ground and the imposition of a ban on away fans. An England youth international and former professional with Aston Villa, Evans turns out to be something of a prophet of doom. He predicts the re-emergence of hooliganism and suggests that the game is dying as a consequence of too many 'unsuitable' chairmen, 'poor' managers and 'greedy - very greedy' players. If this week's newspaper stories accusing a leading professional goalkeeper of accepting bribes to fix matches turn out to be true, more people may be inclined to agree with this gloomy prognosis. Deadly serious too is Alan Simpson's attack on what he calls 'Everton's lamentable record on black players.' 'A club cheats only itself and its fans when it cannot recognise such a rich seam of possibilities when the seam isn't white,' the Labour MP for Nottingham South writes. It will be interesting to hear what Simpson thinks of Everton's sacking this week of Mike Walker, the manager who enjoyed such success with Norwich City. I should end by declaring an interest: it was an inch-perfect Alistair Burt corner that led to me registering my first goal of the season in a match against the Conservative party last month. Unfortunately it was an own goal. Did this influence my decision to start this review with a reference to his 'mistress'? To borrow the catchphrase with which he ends his chapter: 'You may think so. I could not possibly comment.'</p>

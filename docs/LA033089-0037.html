			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Buildings in Belfast's business district were evacuated for several hours while  soldiers defused a 500-pound Irish Republican Army bomb, police said. The bomb  was discovered in a parked car one week after the Northern Ireland office of  the Confederation of Business Industry told its members of a police warning  that terrorists planned to target them to destabilize the province's economy.  The bomb was defused safely and no one was injured, a police spokesman said.  The homemade device was found after the outlawed IRA telephoned a warning to a  Belfast newspaper.  </P></p>

As the first signs were detected a few months ago, the  Veterinarian Institute warned about the dangers of transferring  pigs or pork within those affected areas. This institute has  also banned the unauthorized transfer of pigs from those  provinces to the rest of the country. The control must be  strengthened to quickly detect possible new cases and to  facilitate the vaccination of pigs in each zone, municipality,  or province, according to the planned program of priorities.</p>

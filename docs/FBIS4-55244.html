			<p>BFN     [Text] At approximately 2000 the Muslims attacked Brcko  again. Let us listen to what our correspondent Brane Bozic has  just reported:    [Begin Bozic recording] To be precise, the suburbs of this  town called Grcice were attacked. Several artillery shells,  most probably of large caliber as their explosion could be heard  very far away, landed there. The grenades were falling on  residential homes and in the vicinity of an electrical current  transformer which supplies this town with electricity. The town  remained in darkness while the residents rushed into cellars.    Ambulance vehicles and the fire brigade sped toward Grcice.  As of the time of this report, no further details are  ascertainable. Nobody is on the streets except for the police,  reporters, and the army. [end recording]</p>

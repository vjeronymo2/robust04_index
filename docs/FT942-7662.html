			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Airways steady Shares in British Airways firmed 1 1/2 to 379p, in trade of 6.3m, as the group reported full-year profits in line with market expectations and a better than expected earnings per share figure. Profits for the year to March 1994 rose by Pounds 116m to Pounds 301m and dealers were particularly relieved by the lack of what one trader called 'nasty shocks'. They were also encouraged by the upbeat results presentation and a bullish outlook to trading prospects. Mr Ian Wild at BZW was encouraged by the results especially because 'there were no surprises in the figures.' He is maintaining his current year profits forecast at Pounds 400m, although shaved his earnings per share estimate by 10 per cent to 28p due to the change in the tax charge. Water shares, heavily bought as the market closed last Friday, made further rapid progress yesterday as the market began to hunt for indications of the preliminary 'K factors' which were made known by Ofwat, the industry regulator, to the water companies last Friday. The water sector reporting season starts tomorrow with results from North West Water, which the market expects to deliver a dividend increase of around 8 per cent. North West shares added 5 at 510p. Among the other water stocks, Severn Trent moved up 7 to 507p, Thames put on 6 1/2 to 497 1/2 p and Anglian 3 to 496p. Yorkshire outpaced the rest of the sector climbing 15 to 513p. The electricity stocks rose strongly at the outset following a buy recommendation from Salomon Brothers, the US broker, but quickly ran out of steam to close with modest falls on the day. And there was plenty of stock around in the generators where PowerGen dropped 11 to 487p. Shares in Thorn EMI were weak ahead of today's finals, off 18 at 1096p, although turnover was thin. Profits are forecast at Pounds 330m-340m, compared with Pounds 286.3m last year. Granada slid 10 to 517p amid talk of problems being encountered in the merger with LWT. Profit-takers took the shine from Marks and Spencer ahead of its annual results today, the shares slipping 2 1/2 to 424 1/2 p. Analysts are forecasting a rise in profits of around 17 per cent to around Pounds 865m. However, Northern Foods, a supplier to M&amp;S, rose 5 to 221p on hopes of good figures from the stores group. Negative weekend press reports hit Signet, the former Ratners group, and the shares retreated 5 1/2 to 39p with turnover 7m. Home shopping group Betterware slipped 5 to 123p after a slight improvement in profits to Pounds 14.1m came in at the bottom end of market expectations. A positive trading statement from Lloyds Chemist helped the shares put on 2 to 327p. The company, which was making the announcement ahead of an analysts visit this week, reported sales ahead 15 per cent to over Pounds 800m in the 46 weeks to May 14. Tesco held steady at 223p, down just a half-penny, with dealers citing upgrades from UBS and Credit Lyonaise Laing. Argyll Group firmed 2 to 250p ahead of results tomorrow. Enterprise Oil drifted back 6 to 422p as the market continued to ponder the prospects of a cash alternative to the all-paper bid for Lasmo launched two weeks ago. Lasmo shares, however, held at 157p on the lowest turnover seen for many months. Reports that British Gas may float its domestic and business gas supply operation failed to trigger any big action in Gas shares which eased a penny to 285 1/2 p. Bargain hunters helped aerospace and automotive components group Lucas Industries bounce 5 to 180p, on volume of 4.5m. Fairey Group also gained to 754p, with James Capel reported to have recommended the stock. News that airports operator BAA was interested in acquiring some of Australia's main airports together with some concerns on the trading outlook for the group, left the shares trailing 16 to 964p. Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel slumped 20 to 355p, as the market braced itself for an Pounds 850m rights issue, higher than originally indicated by the company. Royal Bank of Scotland was one of the worst performers among the big UK banks, the shares sliding 12 to 418p on reasonable turnover of 1.8m, as the bank revealed it is expanding its business in the US. Dealers said the market jibbed at the news. 'any moves by UK banks in the US tend to worry analysts in the UK,' said one. Standard Chartered was another poor performer and also came in for some determined selling, the shares retreating 9 1/2 to 244p on 2.9m traded. Switching operations left Barclays 5 off at 541p and NatWest marginally firmer at 456p. There were good gains, however, for TSB, up 3 at 222p and Abbey National, 4 up at 409. SG Warburg, the only merchant bank in the FT-SE 100 index, eased 4 to 724p ahead of preliminary figures expected this week. Analysts are looking for a 14 per cent increase in the dividend total. Kleinwort Benson edged up 5 to 472p in the wake of switching out of Warburg. A big jump in profits at Domino Printing sent the shares racing forward 27 to 517p. First half profits rose from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 5.4m. Other statistics, Page 28</p>

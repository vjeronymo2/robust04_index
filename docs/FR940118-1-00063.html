The manual text for a recreational hybrid PFD must be printed verbatim and in the sequence set out in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, as applicable. The manual for a commercial hybrid PFD must meet the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section. Additional information, instructions, or illustrations may be included within the required text if there is no contradiction to the required information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Type I, II or III Recreation Hybrid PFD. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For a Type I, II, and III recreation hybrid PFD the manual contents must be as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The following text: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Hybrid Limitations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This PFD has limited inherent buoyancy which means YOU MAY HAVE TO INFLATE IT TO FLOAT, and the inflatable portion requires maintenance. In the event of an accident or fall overboard, the chance of any PFD aiding in your survival are greatly increased if it is worn. Wearing this PFD makes its limitation much less significant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is only one way to find out if you will float without inflation. That is to try this PFD in the water as explained in [insert reference to the section of the manual that discusses how to test the PFD]. If you have not tested this device in accordance with these guidelines, the Coast Guard does not recommend it use. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Instructions on use including instructions on donning, inflation, replenishing inflation mechanisms, and recommended practice operation; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Instructions on how to properly inspect and maintain the PFD, and recommendations concerning frequency of inspection; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Instructions on how to get the PFD repaired; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The text in UL 1517, Section 40, items B and D; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The following text: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Why Do You Need a PFD? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A PFD provides buoyancy to help keep your head above water and to help you stay face up. The average in-water-weight of an adult is only about 5 to 10 pounds. The buoyancy provided by most PFDs will support that weight in water. However, the hybrid Type I, II, or III PFD may be an exception. The uninflated buoyancy provided by this PFD may only float 90 percent of the boating public. This is because the inherent buoyancy has been reduced to make it more comfortable to wear. So, you may not float adequately without inflating the device. Once the device is inflated you will have a minimum of 22 lb of buoyancy for adult sizes, which is more than enough to float everyone. (See table above [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> below <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ] for the actual minimum buoyancy for different Types of hybrids.) Your body weight alone does not determine your in-water-weight. Since there is no simple method of determining your weight in water, you should try the device in the water in both it's deflated and inflated condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (7) The text in UL 1517, Section 40, item G; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) The following text: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Wear Your PFD <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Your PFD won't help you if you don't have it on. It is well-known that most boating accidents occur on calm water during a clear sunny day. It is also true that in approximately 80 percent of all boating accident fatalities, the victim did not use a PFD. Don't wait until it's too late. Non-swimmers and children especially should wear their PFD at all times when on or near the water. Hybrid Type I, II, III or V PFDs are not recommended for non-swimmers unless inflated enough to float the wearer. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (9) The text in UL 1517, Section 40, items I, J, K, and L; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Insert a table with the applicable PFD Type, size, and buoyancy values from Table 160.077&hyph;15(b)(14) or provide a reference to appropriate pamphlet table, if the pamphlet is combined with the manual. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Type V Recreational Hybrid PFD. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For a Type V recreational hybrid PFD the manual contents must be as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The text in UL 1517, Section 40, item A; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Instructions on use including instructions on donning, inflation, replenishing inflation mechanisms, and recommended practice operation; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Instructions on how to properly inspect and maintain the PFD, and recommendations concerning frequency of inspection; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Instructions on how to get the PFD repaired; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The text in UL 1517, section 40, that is not included under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sale with manual. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No person may sell or offer for sale a recreational hybrid PFD unless the manual required by this section is provided with it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, Zhirinovskiy's close </F> associate, by Wierd Duk in Moscow; date not given: "The Army Is  on our Side"]    [Excerpts] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is the civilized world's  terror. We do know him. But who are the people who surround  Zhirinovskiy in the Duma? What are the views the "liberal-  democratic" representatives are defending or opposing in this  chaotic Russian Lower House?    Their top man is Aleksandr Vengerovskiy (40). He is the  runner-up, the "shadow prime minister" of the Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP). Last week, he was elected vice-chairman of the  Duma. [passage omitted]    [Duk] Your political leader is not afraid of uttering  nuclear  threats.    [Vengerovskiy] You should not think that we are devising  plans in this office to drop nuclear bombs over the United  States or Germany. Russia never attacked or occupied any other  countries. The nations always appealed to us for protection.    [Duk] Then how should we interpret Zhirinovskiy's statements  on a "new Hiroshima?"    [Vengerovskiy] Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy is our  leader,  and he is responsible for his words. However, I stick to our  party program, which does not refer to any "Hiroshimas."    As far as international politics are concerned: We are no  government party, so our influence will be limited. However, we  will exert as much pressure as possible in Parliament through  the committees. Russia must resume its historic role as  defender of Europe. At the time, the Mongolian-Tatar hordes had  to be stopped, at present it is Muslim fundamentalism. Just  imagine what might happen if Russia would disintegrate and leave  a vacuum here.    [Duk] Your ideology is described as being "fascist."    [Vengerovskiy] This is typically Russian rhetoric. Former  communists who now claim to be democrats, refer to us, liberals,  as being fascists. This is nonsense, we are a normal, liberal  party which takes up a center position. Which means: Between  the revanchist communists who refuse to abandon the planned  economy, and the radicals of Russia's Choice, who have disrupted  our national economy and the entire society. We are opting for  a "third way," we are the only ones who can carry out this  program, because our society's elite has teamed up within the  LDP.    [Duk] What does this program look like?    [Vengerovskiy] Our first important proposal is a general  amnesty for political and economic crimes committed since the  early days of Perestroika. We must forgive and forget, the  capitals which have flowed abroad, must return to Russia. As  far as we are concerned, this amnesty also applies to the mob,  as long as their hands are clean.    We are in favor of protecting our national economy, and  against the shock therapy as proposed by the IMF. At present,  Russia is a dump for low-quality products from the rest of the  world, and at the same time a cheap market for natural resources  and beautiful girls. This is wrong. The LDP advocates  progressive reforms, and opposes a government which harms our  national interests, destroys the state sector, and makes our  country an extension of the United States. We are in favor of  privatization, but in the interest of the citizens, not in that  of the mob. The financial support to former Soviet Republics  must be stopped. All former Politburo members are now president  somewhere: Yeltsin, Kravchuk, Shevardnadze, etc. Yeltsin is  helping his comrades at the Russian people's expense. In the  meantime, the world is supporting the former communists, and we  are being branded as fascists. Does that make any sense to you?    [Duk] Will Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy become Russian  president in 1996?    [Vengerovskiy] There is not the slightest doubt in my mind.  He might even become president much sooner. The parliamentary  elections have shown that Snickers and cornflakes failed to  achieve their main objective. The Russian people has not lost  its own identity. Now is the time for new faces, for young,  physically strong people. These people can be found within the  LDP: Experts who speak several languages, who have been abroad,  and who are not afraid of communicating with the West. We are  the new political and cultural factor in Russia. A man like  Gaydar has thriven on his grandfather's name (a popular writer  of children's books, ed.). We made ourselves, we had to fight  for our success. Every day, I am sitting in the subway among  common people, and I know their worries. The present leaders  have no idea, and never had any idea. That is why they will  always lose.    [Duk] Do you anticipate a recurrence of the October events?    [Vengerovskiy] There will be no second "October." Indeed,  Zhirinovskiy has massive support from the army. So this  scenario is out of the question.</p>

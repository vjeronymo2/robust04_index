The two exchanged views on bilateral relations as well as  other issues of common concern.    Welcoming uteem as the first Mauritian president to visit  China, Jiang said that he is confident that the current visit by  Uteem will surely promote bilateral friendship.    Jiang expressed satisfaction over the development of  bilateral cooperative relations, saying that China appreciates  the Mauritian Government's stand of "one China" and establishing  no official relations with Taiwan.    Jiang pointed out that China and Mauritius enjoy traditional  friendship and that the friendly exchanges and economic  cooperation between the two countries have witnessed tremendous  progress.    China is willing to work with Mauritius to further  strengthen  such friendship and cooperation, Jiang added.    Jiang spoke highly of Mauritius' social stability, its  sustained economic development and the harmonious relations  between various nationalities in the country.    The Mauritian Government and people have made unremitting  efforts and achieved a lot in seeking peace and development,  Jiang said.    Noting that among African nations, Mauritius is the country  with the largest Chinese minority population, Jiang expressed  his hope that the Chinese with Mauritian citizenship will abide  by the laws of Mauritius, pay respect to the country's customs  and religion, get along well with the other nationalities, and  thus become a bridge linking friendship between China and  Mauritius.    Uteem said that China was one of the earliest countries for  Mauritius to set up diplomatic relations with, and that he  cherishes the traditional friendship between the two countries.    The president said that the Mauritian people regard the  Chinese people as their brothers and hoped to further strengthen  the friendly relations between them.    Uteem said that under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, great  changes have taken place in China and attracted worldwide  attention.    He said the Mauritian people are very happy to see that  China  is getting stronger and stronger.    To show the friendly feelings the Mauritian people have  toward the Chinese, Uteem, on behalf of the Mauritian  Government, donated 500,000 Mauritius rupees to flood-stricken  areas in south China. Jiang expressed his thanks.    Prior to the meeting, Jiang presided over a ceremony  welcoming President Uteem.</p>

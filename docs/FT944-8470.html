			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: Inside the pyramid game - The respectable name is multi-level marketing and the bait is unlimited income. But Bethan Hutton finds that dreams can be shattered all too easily The function room in a smart Kensington hotel is full of well-dressed, well-groomed people. The buzz of conversation dies down as the first speaker steps to the front. 'You are looking for people who are looking for something,' he says. Each person in the audience is urged to think about who might be recruited. Each is told to make a list of them - with at least 100 names on each list. 'Don't pre-judge anybody,' exhorts the speaker. 'Put them all down. Everyone you can think of.' It sounds like an an evangelical recruitment drive but the meeting was actually organised by a large international organisation called Amway (an abbreviation of the 'American way'). And, rather than being some hellfire gospel church, the talk is of presenting business opportunities, not saving souls. Neither does the speaker have the American twang you might expect. His name is Bris Bovill, he describes himself as a Warwickshire farmer, and his accent has the cut-glass tones of the English upper-class. Bovill and his wife, Kerry, joined Amway 3 1/2 years ago. They started selling cleaning products, toiletries and make-up to family and friends, taking a cut on the selling price while recruiting people to become Amway distributors themselves. With Amway's multi-level marketing system - also known as pyramid selling - the real money comes not from selling many products but from the commission you earn on sales made by people you recruit and those that they recruit, right down a long line. Now, Bris and Kerry have reached the highest level on the pyramid. They have become 'diamond distributors', people whose incomes can be well into six figures. They recruited about 30 people personally but there are hundreds more 'down-line' from them. A recent edition of Amway's company magazine, Amagram, celebrated the Bovills' achievements with glossy photographs of their farm in Warwickshire and elegant house full of antiques. But these are not the trappings of success with Amway; they were paid for with much older money. 'I didn't have any material goals,' says Bris. 'I think I had everything I wanted. But, without the business, I would still be sitting on my tractor, probably. I would have convinced myself I didn't want to travel.' Now, the farm work has been contracted out so that the Bovills can concentrate on Amway. Yet, their success is exceptional. While Amway has about 33,000 distributors in the UK, only a dozen are in the highest-earning 'diamond' class. For most, Amway provides a little extra cash - but not enough to live on. The unemployed or genuinely hard-up tend not to do well in multi-level marketing schemes like this, either. They are too obviously needy, lacking the panache and self-confidence to inspire others to join. Bovill's spiel at the Kensington hotel illustrates the kind of needs Amway aims to fulfil. 'What would you do with an extra Pounds 100 a month?' he asks. The suggestions come back: a night at a Park Lane hotel, a day out at the races followed by dinner, scuba-diving lessons, a new camera . . . What about Pounds 1,000 a month? More diving lessons, holidays, investments, a bigger house. One woman wants a horse to take eventing. These are not people trying to make ends meet; they want to fund the little luxuries in life - or, indeed, the larger ones. Amway people always keep their ears open for new recruits. They make a mental note of casual complaints at dinner parties about the size of school fees, or not being able to afford a skiing holiday. Talking business on social occasions is discouraged, but leads are followed up with a telephone call a day or two later. 'I heard what you said about school fees the other day, and I have an idea that may be of interest to you . . . ' Then, a meeting is arranged to demonstrate the Amway business plan - a complicated series of flip-charts with diagrams showing how you can build up a business paying Pounds 45,000 a year from an initial outlay of Pounds 70. Amway's is by no means the only business plan being demonstrated in living rooms across the country. Companies selling water filters, costume jewellery and security equipment are among those using very similar techniques. Becoming an Amway distributor seems to be a cross between becoming an Avon lady, a born-again Christian and a member of the Rotary Club. But all sorts of sensible, respectable people are doing it. Amagram is full of them: smiling couples - teachers, housewives, antique dealers, management consultants, dentists - who have achieved pearl or ruby distributor status. Yet, behind the happy faces in the company magazine lurk some less heart-warming stories. Friends of Amway converts say it can take over people's lives like a cult. Some become so obsessed that they eat, sleep and breathe nothing else. They spend every waking moment trying to recruit new people or working on their business plans. Their savings disappear on motivational books and tapes. Hints that perhaps Amway is taking up too much of their lives are met with hostility. A few put emotional pressure on friends and relatives to buy products or sign up as a distributor, just to help them meet this month's target. Eventually, exhaustion and repeated rejections tend to shatter the dream. 'This is not a get-rich-quick scheme,' Bovill tells his audience. Everyone at Amway repeats that message. But when, in the next breath, they mention unlimited potential income, people earning so much that they pay Pounds 150,000 a year in tax, trips to five-star hotels in Cyprus for top performers - it is, perhaps, hardly surprising that a few 'people who are looking for something' take it all too seriously.

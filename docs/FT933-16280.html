			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Buy-out activity increases after lull MANAGEMENT buy-out activity increased in the second quarter of the year after a lull in the preceding six months, KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, has reported. It says even more deals would have been completed if vendors, often companies disposing of non-essential subsidiaries, had not increased steeply the prices they were asking. Fourteen buy-outs of more than Pounds 10m were completed between April and June compared with nine in the first three months, 10 in the final quarter of 1992 and 13 in the second quarter last year. The value of the second-quarter deals was Pounds 710m compared with Pounds 460m in the first quarter, Pounds 800m in the fourth quarter of last year and Pounds 410m in the second quarter last year.</p>

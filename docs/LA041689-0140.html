			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HITLER'S HOMETOWN IN A QUANDARY OVER MARKING 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BIRTH  </P> <P> This pleasant town across the Inn River from the West German state of Bavaria  has decidely mixed feelings about a monument established to commemorate the  activities of its most famous native son.  </P> <P> The burghers are not quite sure how they want to commemorate, on Thursday, the  100th anniversary of the man who was born in the three-story house at No. 15  Salzburg Vorstadt -- Adolf Hitler.  </P> <P> Since the end of World War II, most Braunauers would just as soon forget that  Hitler was born here -- in effect subscribing to the adage that Austria has  managed to convince the world that German-born Beethoven was Austrian and  Hitler was German. None of the tourist brochures describing the attractive  community of 16,000 mentions the German dictator, who committed suicide in 1945  in his bunker in war-ravaged Berlin just 10 days after his 56th birthday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Moved Away as Infant  </P> <P> But Hitler did come from here and Mayor Gerhard Skiba, a Socialist, has chosen  to remind the world of that fact -- in a rather oblique way -- with a  three-foot chunk of stone outside the house.  </P> <P> An inscription chiseled on the granite from the quarry at the former Mauthausen  concentration camp mentions neither Hitler nor the house but reads:  </P> <P>  For Peace, Freedom and Democracy  </P> <P> Never Again Fascism  </P> <P> In Memory of the Millions of Dead.  </P> <P> Skiba said: "As mayor, I have decided to erect a monument and reminder in front  of Adolf Hitler's birthplace as a clear and open sign as to the way we in  Braunau think about the past and remember the victims of fascism.  </P> <P> "The 20th of April was in the past, and is in the present, a date which brings  with it a particular meaning for our city -- through no fault of the citizens  of Braunau."  </P> <P> Skiba said the text "serves as a reminder, as a declaration and call to work  against budding neo-Nazism and other obvious dangers to democracy."  </P> <P> But other citizens say that Skiba is calling undeserved attention to Braunau's  past, and they worry that the monument itself will attract neo-Nazis from  Austria and Germany. Harald Klinger, district commissioner for the Braunau  area, has received reports that neo-Nazis and others sympathetic to Hitler will  gather here on April 20 to demonstrate.  </P> <P> "We will have to reckon with violence," Klinger said. "We have to hope and pray  no one gets killed. This could well be the last big anniversary here, but if  there is a martyr we will have the same circus every year."  </P> <P> The stone memorial outside the house, which is now used as a craft school for  handicapped children, has become a magnet for snapshot-taking tourists, who  might otherwise not have noticed the building just 50 yards from the city's  main square.  </P> <P> The irony is that, according to historians, Hitler never much cared for his  birthplace. The family left when he was 3, first to Passau in 1892 and then in  1895 to Linz, which Hitler regarded as his hometown. Hitler on several  occasions said he remembered nothing about Braunau.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Returned Only Once  </P> <P> The dictator came back only once, with German troops who annexed Austria in  1938, and though the town staunchly supported the anschluss, or union, with  Germany and made him an honorary citizen, Hitler never returned.  </P> <P> Local historians point out that the name "Schicklgruber," which British leader  Winston Churchill, among others, used to call the Fuehrer, resulted because his  maternal grandmother, Maria Ann Schicklgruber, bore a child out of wedlock who  was later given a step-uncle's name and became Hitler's father, Alois  Schicklgruber.  </P> <P> Inside the buff-and-white building at No. 15, which could stand a coat of  paint, director Kurt Hell showed a visitor the brightly colored tapestries made  by the children and said he did not know when the house was built. But he  pointed out old wooden staircases and stone floors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attention a Nuisance  </P> <P> "Nobody seemed to notice us before -- just the occasional tourist -- but now  all the attention is getting to be a nuisance. We're trying to teach  handicapped children. Actually, nobody knows what room Hitler was born in  here," he said.  </P> <P> However, townspeople said that the owner of the house, who rents it out,  objected to a commemorative plaque being embedded in the wall -- and that is  why Skiba placed the stone monument on the city street, next to a row of angled  parking spaces.  </P> <P> Most of the nearby shopkeepers expressed indifference to the new stone marker,  but one worker said: "I just don't like the look of it. I think it's ugly."  </P> <P> A bookseller added: "All this is for the history books. I don't know why the  mayor thought a marker was necessary."  </P> <P> And another Braunauer commented, "Hitler was born an Austrian but he became a  German."  </P> <P> All around Braunau are reminders of the war, including a cemetery with World  War I and World War II dead just outside of town. And the crypt of St.  Stephen's Church, a 15th-Century building, bears the names of local residents  who died in both wars.  </P> <P> Hitler's name is missing, said Father Stefan Hofer, the parish priest, because  he was not inducted into the army from Braunau.  </P> <P> The priest said, "I think the inscription should have said, 'No more  dictatorship,' rather than referring only to fascism. I really don't think it  is fair to single out Braunau, since Hitler only lived here as an infant."  </P> <P> Would the Hitler reminder be good or bad for Braunau?  </P> <P> "We will see," said Father Hofer.  </P> <P> And provincial official Klinger, looking uneasily toward April 20, cautioned:  "The eyes of the world will be on us. The reputation of Austria is at stake."  </P></p>

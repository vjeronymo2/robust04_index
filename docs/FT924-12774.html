			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Letter: Banking settlement proposal reduces risk but creates illiquidity Sir, Regarding your editorial on the clearing and settlement procedure in operation in Chaps ('Well done, Chaps', October 7), your comment stresses only the dimension of risk in the payment mechanism and the gains from reducing risk. The present system of end-of-day net settlement is risky from the point of view of the central bank but has the property of providing a high degree of liquidity to the financial system. The proposed reform is one of continuous gross settlement with collateralised overdraft facility. While there is no denying that risk is virtually eliminated, the proposed solution goes to the other extreme in that it may make the system highly illiquid. The basic role of the banking system is to provide liquidity by making the market in liquid funds, ie bank reserves. This will reduce the competitiveness of British banks in the global market. The US domestic payment system (Fedwire) has recently instituted a pricing scheme for overdrafts, but overdrafts do not have to be collateralised (unlike the cross-border Chips system which has partial collateralisation). Full collateralisation will impose an immense burden on banks and their customers and this will impose an unduly 'excessive' tax on the banking system. While it is certainly important to reduce risk, it should not be done in a way so as to paralyse the basic banking functions. It would be more appropriate to have a system of net end-of-day settlement with explicit caps on the extent of intra-day overdrafts, combined with a pricing scheme for overdrafts. Collateralisation, if any, should be a very small proportion of the overdrafts so as not to tax the system. Indeed, as you point out, these issues are significant from the point of view of an integrated European payments system which is all the more reason to have a balanced view of the trade-off between risk and liquidity.

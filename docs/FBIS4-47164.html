Proskurov, SILSKI VISTI correspondent, </F> Zaporizhzhya Oblast: "They Are Patching Okhrim's Overcoat"]    [Text] The farmers of Zaporizhzhya Oblast have completed  sowing early grain crops and and other pulse crops on an area of  236,000 hectares. In addition, they had to resow winter crops on  168,000 hectares. But a great deal of work has yet to be done --  some 700,000 hectares of late crops still need to be sown. They  have already begun sowing feed and sugar beets in the southern  regions of the oblast, and the fields are being preapred for  planting corn.    "Before spring began, there was a great deal of panic that  the farms would not manage to sow their fields," said I.  Kostenko, the chairman of the Shevchenko Collective Farm in  Zaporizhzhya Rayon. "But these dire predictions have not come  true -- work in the fields is continuing. We even sowed our  early grain crops in two shifts, but the devil take such work.  We're short of the most essential things but cannot buy them.  Actually, the farm is doing quite well, but nonpayment by the  state has put it on file [i.e., left it in debt], and now the  bank takes every kopeck that is deposited in our account towards  paying off our debts. We recently received 60 million  karbovantsi for buying spare parts, but all we heard was the  rustle of this money disappearing at the bank. The state should  probably give some thought to arranging for this money to go  directly to suppliers rather than into the collective farm's  account."    That is not the only thing that the state needs to think  about. It has introduced a so-called commodities credit on goods  to be produced in 1994 and applies this credit to supply the  farms with fuel, fertilizer, and herbicides. This has helped the  farmers in the busy spring season. But while it provides  gasoline and diesel fuel, the state has completely forgotten to  include lubricants.    "You can howl in despair, for all the good it will do you,"  complains A. Klymenko, the chairman of the Druzhba Collective  Farm in Tokmak Rayon. "Right now, we don't have a problem with  fuel, but we can't take our equipment into the fields without  lubricants. Dealers are asking 30 million karbovantsi per metric  ton. And where are we to get the money when the processing  enterprises owe us one billion karbovantsi? A lack of funds is  preventing us from buying suger beet seed, and we did not stock  up on top quality spring grain seed. We are still waiting for  the mineral fertilizer promised us by contract."    Here, as at many other farms, spare parts are a problem.  According to A. Klymenko, the rayahropostach [rayon agricultural  supply center ?] has spare parts, but it requires advance  payment because it has received no directive from above to issue  spare parts on credit.    The farmers are doing whatever they can to solve their  problems. They are siphoning off lubricants from combine  engines. They remove working parts and assemblies from tractors  that are not needed in the fields at a given moment. In short,  they are patching Okhrim's overcoat. But how much longer can it  last?</p>

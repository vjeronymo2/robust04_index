			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Berisford calls for Pounds 14m to fund coffee-trading associate BERISFORD International, the commodities and property group, is raising Pounds 14m net of expenses through a rights issue of loan stock, which will have warrants to buy shares. Berisford shares fell 5 1/2 p to 20p yesterday. The proceeds will enable Berisford to provide finance to Rayner Coffee International, its loss-making, 45 per cent-owned coffee trading associate. Berisford guarantees up to Dollars 115m (Pounds 65.6m) of RCI's bank borrowings. The coffee market has been volatile since the collapse of the international coffee agreement in mid-1989. Mr Alan Bowkett, who joined Berisford as chief executive on January 29, said that since his appointment the coffee price had fallen from Pounds 570 to Pounds 470 a tonne. He said: 'In a deregulated market you have to have a wall of money to protect against the ups and downs.' Mr Bowkett said tackling RCI had been his first priority and he had made a detailed review of the business already. A second consideration in making the issue, Mr Bowkett said, was Berisford's desire to restructure its banking arrangements ahead of its plans to rebuild the company. Berisford had been near bankruptcy in 1990 with bank exposure totalling Pounds 1.4bn but sold assets to repay borrowings. At September 30 1991, its last year-end, it had net cash of Pounds 18.6m. It now plans to expand through acquisition in areas new to the group. Berisford said that during the first quarter of its current financial year it was close to breaking even, before taking a further Pounds 4.5m provision against its UK properties. These are revalued on a quarterly basis. The Pritzker family of the US, which owns 10.8 per cent of Berisford and has two non-executive seats on the board, is underwriting Pounds 10m of the issue of Pounds 14.8m gross of loan stock. Mr Bowkett, who bought 6m shares at 19p each when he joined Berisford, and the other directors are taking up their rights. Shareholders will be entitled to buy Pounds 1 of the loan stock for every 33.53 shares held. The stock, carrying a 10 per cent coupon, will be redeemed in 1995. Every Pounds 100 of the stock will carry 1,000 warrants, each giving the right to buy one new Berisford share at 10p until 2002. Full exercise of the warrants would result in the issue of 148m new shares, increasing the share capital by 29.8 per cent. The Pritzker family could end up with a holding of about 24 per cent, if it were to take up its full underwriting commitment and exercise all the warrants.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Time Warner net income falls to Dollars 7m in fourth term Time Warner, the US entertainment group, yesterday reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 7m, down from Dollars 68m in the same period of last year, although the group's operating results were modestly better. The results translated into earnings per share of 1 cent, compared with a loss of 25 cents in the same period of last year. Time Warner's results are complicated by two factors. First, the merger between Time and Warner Brothers which created the company in 1989 involved the assumption of a very high level of debt. As with many highly leveraged businesses, Time Warner encourages Wall Street to focus on its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) as a measure of its underlying performance. Second, the company has reported its entertainment operations - which include its film and cable interests - on a deconsolidated basis since September, when US West, the telephone group, took a large stake in this business. Time Warner said yesterday that in the fourth quarter combined Ebitda of the entertainment group and its other businesses totalled Dollars 760m, up 3 per cent from the Dollars 740m reported in the same period of last year, while revenues rose to Dollars 4.12bn from Dollars 3.76bn. The group's publishing interests saw earnings up to Dollars 146m from Dollars 132m, while its music operations made Dollars 215m, up from Dollars 196m a year ago. Within the entertainment group, earnings from films dipped to Dollars 96m from Dollars 101m, although the Warner Brothers studio posted a record quarter. The HBO cable channel saw earnings rise to Dollars 61m from Dollars 56m. However, the group's cable service business, the second largest in the US, saw earnings drop to Dollars 242m from Dollars 255m. The group blamed this on cable rate regulation instituted by Congress last year. Mr Gerald Levin, chairman, said: 'While our cable business will continue to be under pressure in 1994 from this regulation, we remain optimistic about its future growth and that of our copyright businesses.' For the full year, Time Warner reported a net loss of Dollars 221m, after taking a Dollars 70m special tax charge, against a profit of Dollars 86m in 1992. On a combined Ebitda basis, revenues rose to Dollars 14.54bn from Dollars 13.56bn, while earnings rose to Dollars 2.83bn from Dollars 2.62bn.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / International Company News: Fiat reduces construction exposure in three-way link Fiat, Italy's biggest private company, is cutting its exposure to the troubled building sector via a complex three-way merger. The deal will create the country's biggest construction concern. Fiat will merge its quoted Cogefar-Impresit subsidiary with Lodigiani and Girola, two large, privately-owned, building groups. The combined entity, with annual sales of about L2,800bn (Dollars 1.7bn), should be more competitive against larger rivals, such as Germany's Hochtief and Philipp Holzmann and Bouygues of France, for big international contracts. The multi-stage deal will begin with a rights issue by Cogefar-Impresit, 63 per cent-owned by Fiat, which will then merge with Impregilo. The latter is a long-standing joint venture between Cogefar-Impresit, Lodigiani and Girola, operating exclusively in big infrastructure contracts outside Italy. The merged company, to be called Impregilo, will then take over the industrial activities of Lodigiani and Girola in return for equity stakes. Fiat's stake in the 'new' Impregilo will fall to about 26.5 per cent when the deal is completed during the next 18 months. A similar proportion of the shares will be floating. The remainder will be split between Lodigiani (17 per cent), Girola (16.3 per cent), and five banks (15 per cent). 'The deal reflects an awareness that the companies concerned need to concentrate and rationalise,' said Mr Ugo Montevecchi, chief executive of Cogefar-Impresit. 'The existing Impregilo joint venture was the obvious point on which to focus.' Italy's big builders have been devasted this year by recession and the long-running political corruption scandal, which has led to a virtual freeze on public-sector contracts. Profits have crumbled at most large groups, while many smaller builders, which often act as subcontractors, have gone bankrupt. Mr Montevecchi said the Fiat-led reorganisation was dictated by market forces in the highly-fragmented Italian construction sector. Cogefar-Impresit, the country's leading builder, expects sales of about L1,600bn this year, while turnover at Lodigiani and Girola should be about L500bn and L300bn respectively.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1985, WHO published its revised Energy and Protein Requirement Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared by a Joint Expert Consultation of the FAO/WHO and United Nations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> University (UNU). This consultation revised amino acid pattern requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for humans into age groups of 2 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, and adult, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extensively reviewed the requirements based on amino acid scoring and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> digestibility. Of the three amino acid patterns established, the 2 to 5 year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> old child pattern has the highest individual and total requirements. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report stated that protein and diets containing essential amino acids that met  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the greater needs of young children were also adequate for older children and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adults, whereas the reverse may not be true. On this basis, the Joint FAO/WHO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Expert Consultation on Protein Evaluation (1989) concluded that no adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis existed for using different scoring patterns for different age groups,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the exception of infants, who have a much greater need for essential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amino acids. They recommended that the FAO/WHO/UNU amino acid scoring pattern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for preschool children should be used to evaluate protein quality for all age  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups, except infants. PDCAAS was recommended for calculating dietary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein intakes. Thus, precise human amino acid requirement patterns are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for all age groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both FNS and the FDA have recognized the applicability and usefulness of the PDCAAS method of measuring protein quality. The regulation governing the use of VPP in the Child Nutrition Programs, 7 CFR Parts 210, 225 and 226, Appendix A - Alternate Foods for Meals; Vegetable Protein Products, published January 7, 1983, allowed FNS to approve an alternate test for measuring the biological quality of protein for VPP. This provision was included in the regulation in anticipation of recognition by the scientific community and FDA of the PDCAAS. FNS has since accepted the PDCAAS method in addition to the PER method for determining protein quality of VPP. This acceptance was based on the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Evaluation (1989) and with FDA's concurrence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 19, 1990 (55 FR 29487 at 29499), FDA stated that their regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements to use PER ``inhibit(ed) flexibility in determining protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality by alternative methodologies.'' At that time, FDA proposed to continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of the PER, while also allowing use of alternative acceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> validated procedures as they become available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequently, in response to a petition from Protein Technologies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> International, Inc., FDA stated in the preamble to the nutrition labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal published on November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60366 at 60369), that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitting PDCAAS to be used as an alternative to PER had merit. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenting on that petition FDA quoted its earlier comments on the need for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexible approach to determining protein quality: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> As new methodologies and new information on amino acid requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various age groups become available, the agency believes it must become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more flexible in regard to permitted protein quality methodologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, while the PER method described in the Official Methods of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists may continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be used as one of the methods for assessing the protein quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foods, alternative acceptable validated procedures may be used as they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> become available. (55 FR 29487 at 29499). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, FDA later proposed to require the PDCAAS, stating in the preamble (56 FR 60366 at 60370) that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has reviewed the FAO/WHO report and tentatively accepts its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusion that the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method is more appropriate for assessing protein quality of foods than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animal assays and is preferable for regulatory purposes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In October, 1989, the Subcommittee on the 10th Edition of the Recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dietary Allowances published the revised Recommended Dietary Allowances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These new allowances confirm and accept the amino acid requirement pattern as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published by the WHO, 1985, and recognize PDCAAS as an appropriate method of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessing protein quality of human diets. The amino acid requirements for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2 to 5 year old suggested by both of these scientific bodies are identical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Codex Alimentarius Vegetable Protein Committee as well as the Codex  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee on Special Dietary Foods have also recommended amino acid scoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for evaluation of vegetable proteins and special dietary foods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PDCAAS was considered and accepted by the Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission which convened in Geneva, Switzerland during July 1989. An Expert Consultation convened at the request of the Codex Alimentarius Commission reviewed the amino acid scoring methodologies and recommended the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of the PDCAAS for measuring protein quality. After extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deliberation, resulting in a comprehensive report, it was reported that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``. . . the Consultation agreed that the Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Acid Score method was the most suitable approach for routine evaluation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein quality for humans, and recommended the adoption of this method as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> official method at the international level.'' (Joint FAO/WHO Expert  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consultation on Protein Evaluation, Codex Alimentarius, Washington, D.C.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1989). The Expert Consultation's report and recommendations were transmitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the FAO Secretariat in Rome for final review and dissemination to the Codex  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alimentarius Commission membership. The report of the Expert Consultation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains many findings and conclusions, most supportive of the PDCAAS. No  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusions adverse to this method were reported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

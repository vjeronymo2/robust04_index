The president of the Republic of Mozambique arrived  in Luanda at about 0800 aboard an Angolan Airlines aircraft.    Joaquim Chissano, who is coming from Portugal, was welcomed  by President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Prime  Minister Marcolino Moco and members of the government and the  president's office were also present at the 4 February  International Airport to welcome the Mozambican head of state.    After protocol formalities at the 4 February International  Airport, the two heads of state left in a motorcade to the  Futungo de Belas Palace, where they held official talks at the  highest level. The two delegations exchanged information on the  political and military situations in their respective countries.  Angola is facing a war that was caused by the National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], which lost the  first multiparty elections held in September 1992. Mozambique  is implementing the General Peace Accord signed between the  government and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] in  October 1992. Difficulties faced by the two sides in confining  troops have led to mutual accusations of the violation of the  accords. Elections are scheduled to take place in Mozambique in  October this year.    The two heads of state also took the opportunity to review  the general situation in southern Africa where their countries  are situated, particularly the development of events in South  Africa, where the first multiracial elections will take place in  April this year.    Almiro de Conceicao, spokesman for the president of the  Republic, briefed the press on the talks.    [Begin Conceicao recording] The meeting between the two  presidents was principally aimed at exchanging experience. They  examined the main issues facing the countries of the region in  the military, social, political, economic, and financial fields.  They also discussed some international issues. Evidently, the  Mozambican side wanted to know how the pacification process took  place in Angola with regard to the confinement and the formation  of the armed forces. It also wanted to know about the role  played by the United Nations in monitoring troops'  demobilization. Above all, it wanted to know how UNITA had the  capacity to resume armed conflict after elections. [end  recording]    This afternoon, President Joaquim Chissano met with Angolan  Prime Minister Marcolino Moco. Prime Minister Marcolino Moco  was accompanied by the government's economic team. They related  their experiences with the economic readjustment programs in  their respective countries. The Angolan Government is preparing  an economic program for 1994, and Mozambique's experience seems  to be useful. In turn, Mozambique is experiencing an atmosphere  of preelectoral campaigning, and the Angolan experience serves  as a barometer for the measures adopted by the Mozambican  Government. President Joaquim Chissano is presently being  honored with an official dinner given by President Jose Eduardo  dos Santos. The Mozambican head of state will give a news  conference before leaving Luanda tomorrow.</p>

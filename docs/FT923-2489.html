			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UN chief points to dangers in Balkan war MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, yesterday urged a wider international effort to deal with what he termed the horror of the conflict in Bosnia, warning that the unfolding Balkans crisis might lead others in similar situations to resort to war rather than negotiation. Presenting his first annual report to the UN general assembly, which began a new session on Tuesday, he stressed that even with 15,000 international troops in former Yugoslavia and over 5,000 more soldiers now authorised to join an existing 1,500 in Bosnia, the expectations placed on the world body exceeded the resources and the capacity of the UN protection force. He observed that the Yugoslav upheaval illustrated how the end of the cold war had opened a Pandora's Box of causes and conflicts. In past years, these would have been regarded as 'points of loss or gain in the calculations of the bipolar powers'. Without the cold war structure to deal with them, the UN must provide approaches and answers, he said. The Yugoslav conflict, with its international dimension, must lead those in similar conditions of instability and confrontation to accept that the only route for change was one that was legal, peaceful and contributed to international peace and security, he added.</p>

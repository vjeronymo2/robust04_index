			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: CWB pays Pounds 285m for Swedish flooring group CWB CAPITAL Partners, a London-based acquisition fund, is buying Tarkett, an international flooring company, for SKr3.4bn (Pounds 285m). The purchase, from Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, is another acquisition for CWB's North European Acquisition Fund, which focuses on large, international businesses based in the UK, Germany and Scandinavia. Mr Richard Hanson, who runs CWB's London office, has acquired European market leaders with an international spread of earnings. Earlier this year CWB bought B&amp;L, one of the world's leading suppliers of dosing pumps, industrial analysers and electronics for industrial weighting. In 1990 it bought Swedish-based ARJO Group, the world's largest supplier of hygiene, transport and lifting equipment for hospital patients. Mr Lars-Ake Helgesson, Stora's president, said the disposal reflected the group's desire to concentrate on its core forestry business and its wish to strengthen its balance sheet. He also described the sale as 'a good long term solution for Tarkett' as CWB is a 'financial buyer who will keep the company intact'. The disposal is expected to produce a capital gain of around SKr800m for Stora, and strengthen its equity/assets ratio from 29 per cent to 31 per cent. Tarkett was acquired by Stora in 1988 as part of a larger acquisition of the Swedish Match group. Last year Tarkett produced an operating income of SKr266m on turnover of SKr5.3bn. The company has manufacturing operations in Sweden, Germany, Ireland and the US, producing 100m square metres of flooring products a year. Mr Helgesson says this makes it one of the world's top three producers of flooring. The company's main markets are western Europe and the US, which account for 97 per cent of sales. It has 4,800 employees. Tarkett is expected to make a profit of SKr325m this year - which Stora will keep as part of the overall sale price - compared with SKr266m last year.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Accept our appraisal of the crop on the damaged acreage as production to count against the production guarantee for the damaged acreage, destroy the remaining crop on such acreage, and be eligible for any indemnity due under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8) and the Small Grains Crop Provisions (&sect;457.101). The appraisal will be considered production to count in determining any final indemnity on the unit and will be used to settle your claim as described in the provisions of section 11. (Settlement of Claim) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (&sect;457.101). You may use such acreage for any purpose, including planting and separately insuring any other crop. If you elect to utilize such acreage for the production of spring wheat, you must:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Plant the spring wheat in a manner which results in a clear and discernable break in the planting pattern at the boundary between it and any remaining winter wheat; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Store or market the production from such acreage in a manner which permits us to verify the amount of spring wheat production separately from any winter wheat production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us, the spring wheat acreage will be considered to be a part of the original winter wheat unit. If you elected to insure the spring wheat acreage as a separate optional unit, any premium amount for such acreage will be considered earned and payable to us.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;457.103  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Malting barley option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Malting Barley Option Provisions for the 1995 and succeeding crop years are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> United States Department of Agriculture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Crop Insurance Corporation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Small Grains Crop Insurance Malting Barley Endorsement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> (This is a continuous Endorsement.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, April 19 (TANJUG) -- Monday's attack on  the Yugoslav cultural centre in Paris is an act of vandalism and  the continuation of a yearslong anti-Serb and anti-Yugoslav  campaign in the French media and public, Yugoslav Education and  Culture Minister Slavko Gordic said on Tuesday [19 April]. We  were embittered by the reports that a group of French citizens  yesterday committed an unprecedented vandalistic and  anti-civilized act, Gordic told TANJUG commenting the raid by  Moslem extremists and their French friends on the Yugoslav  cultural centre and their day-long blockade carried out with the  tacit agreement of the French authorities.    `The aggressive and destructive conduct of the participants  in the attack on the Yugoslav cultural centre was received with  insufferable tolerance of the French authorities who stood by as  two of the staff were brutally harrassed and thrown out on the  street, and watched the hours-long demolishing of the facilities  and the destruction of the documentation and books,' he said.    The minister said that Paris, viewed by the Serb people as  the capital both of the French and world culture, has now shown  another side which mars its humanistic tradition. Gordic  described as specially depressing the fact that the group also  included French philosopher Bernard Henri-Levy who is well-known  for his numerous verbal attacks against the Serbs, Serbia and  Yugoslavia. Henri-Levy has sided with the attackers and thus  committed an act fundamentally contrary to all humanist  principles which has revealed all the misery of his unconcealed  biased political activities, Gordic said.    Serbian Information Minister Ratomir Vico also believes that  the raid on the French cultural centre in Paris, Yugoslavia's  only such representation in the world, is an act of vandalism,  unworthy of French democratic traditions and that the reaction  of the French authorities `has left a sickening impression  because it was inadequate and too late in coming.' Instead of  immediately condemning the incident as an act of terrorism, the  French authorities allowed the Moslem extremists and the French  advocates of Moslem interests to abuse the centre for anti-Serb  propoganda, Vico told TANJUG. Vico warned that the benignant  attitude of the French authorities and public is completely in  keeping with the anti-Serb public opinion in that country.    The French politicians have lost their neutrality regarding  the civil war in Yugoslavia, and a part of the intellectuals,  who were virtually unknown to the public prior to the war in the  Balkans, have now emerged to use their anti-Serb views to blame  the Serbs for all the tragic events in the territory of the  former Yugoslavia, Vico said. Vico recalled that the Yugoslav  cultural centre in Paris used authentic and objective  information in an attempt to introduce somewhat different views  to the French public. The centre responded to the demonization  of the Serbs, provided documented proof of their sufferring and  invited foreign newsmen to convince themselves on the spot that  the events in the Balkans are not only one-dimensional. The  cultural centre did not pay French intellectuals to speak the  `truth' but it reacted when the French media carried the  apparent untruths about the developments in the Yugoslav  territories, Vico said.</p>

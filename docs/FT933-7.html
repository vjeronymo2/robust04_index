			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (39): Seeds of conflict - A turbanned Robin Hood rallies the peasants of Karnataka DECKED out in green, from his fur hat to his shirt and traditional farmer's scarf, Mr MD Nanjundaswamy could be mistaken for a latter-day Robin Hood, writes SARA WEBB. That is not the only similarity. As leader of the Farmers' Association in Karnataka, a south Indian state, he sees himself as the protector of poor Indian farmers against rich foreign multinationals. Mr Nanjundaswamy and his farmer-followers are worried that the Dunkel Draft for the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will allow multinational companies to develop plant genetic material from countries such as India, then patent the resulting plant seeds and sell them back to farmers in the Third World at a much higher price. Supporters of Mr Nanjundaswamy's Farmers' Association (known as the KRRS) raided the offices of Cargill, the US seed company, in Bangalore last December in protest at the company's operations in India, and attacked Cargill's seed cleaning and packaging plant in Bellary, Karnataka, in July. 'Most of the farmers here are not aware of the Dunkel Draft and GATT,' says the village chief of Budigere, a village north of Bangalore. But, he adds, they are worried that a company such as Cargill could come into the market and dominate seed sales. Indian farmers usually set aside a small portion of their crop at the end of the harvest for sowing the next season. An estimated 85 per cent of seed production in the country is by farmers themselves, although there are large government-owned and private sector seed companies. Mr Nanjundaswamy, who represents the KRRS in the Karnataka state legislative assembly, has said his farmers will continue to target multinationals who want to plunder the Third World for genetic material which is then turned to commercial advantage for the companies concerned, rather than for the financial gain of the countries where they evolved. 'What the multinationals are doing is international piracy, and, in view of the mischief they do, we are justified in taking this action,' claims the bespectacled Mr Nanjundaswamy, who now divides his time between looking after the family farm in Mysore and political campaigning. A lawyer by training, he claims that his political beliefs are founded on 'Gandhian socialism' and advocates indigenous production, self-reliance and independence in agriculture. But the bouts of violence which his followers pursue appear to be losing him some of his popular appeal. 'We do not condone that kind of violence,' said the village head at Budigere. Indeed, plenty of farmers are flocking to buy Cargill's seeds because of their high yields and, in the case of sunflower, the higher oil content. 'The basic question is 'who has the intellectual property rights to these seeds?' Our stand is that there are common intellectual property rights,' says Mr Nanjundaswamy. Cargill denies any intention of patenting seeds in India and says the KRRS is misinforming farmers about the consequences of GATT and the whole issue of intellectual property rights. Mr John Hamilton, managing director of Cargill Seeds India (which is a joint venture with Tedco, an Indian commodities broker), says patenting makes no sense because of the speed with which crop yields can be raised. 'It only takes seed companies two to three years to develop better, higher-yielding varieties which overtake the old varieties in the field. And anyway, it would be impossible to police: patents would not be enforceable,' he says. However, he emphasises that Cargill is 'looking for some workable form of intellectual property rights - not to prevent a farmer from retaining seed but to prevent the plunder of our genetic developments by other seed companies'. In other words, if the farmer wanted to keep some of the harvest back for planting, or if he wanted to exchange seed with his neighbour, that would not be a violation of the intellectual property rights. Since July 1992, Cargill has launched two hybrids of sunflower and three hybrids of maize in the Indian market, following four years of research into various hybrid combinations to see which would be suitable for Indian farming conditions. Neither crop is indigenous to India, and Cargill claims that the tougher competition between the seed companies has served farmers well, bringing down seed prices by 50 per cent in five years.</p>

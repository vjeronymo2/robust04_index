			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / PC-based share dealing system to be tested A pilot project is to be launched early next year for an electronic share dealing system which enables anyone equipped with a personal computer and a modem to buy and sell shares Electronic Share Interchange hopes to go live by the middle of the year and create a UK-wide share-dealing market which will specialise in trading in small companies and the floating of new ones. Electronic Share Information, the Cambridge company which is developing the system, believes that using computer technology can dramatically reduce the cost of dealing in shares, enable more companies to raise money by issuing equities and attract more individual investors. The new market would not involve stockbrokers or other intermediaries, and companies coming to it would not need to be sponsored by a stockbroker. ESI would compete with the London Stock Exchange - in particular with AIM, the alternative investment market that the exchange hopes to launch next year to replace the Unlisted Securities Market. This week the company received an indication from the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, that although it was proposing a market without intermediaries, it would not be impossible for SIB to approve it as a recognised investment exchange. ESI has not yet made a formal application. ESI believes it could have a similar impact on share trading that Direct Line, the telephone-based insurance company, had on the selling of motor insurance. Settlement of payment for transactions would be electronic and payments transferred in seven seconds, using the services of a clearing bank. ESI is talking to Bank of Scotland about the provision of services for the pilot project, which is expected to start in February or March at the business school of Glasgow Caledonian university. Lecturers and students will trade in fictitious companies and respond to 'news' and financial information about them. ESI has been devised by a group of electronics specialists. The chairman is Mr Hermann Hauser, a founder of Acorn, the computer company which now belongs to Olivetti. The technical director is Mr Jack Lang, a computer specialist and entrepreneur. Software has been developed by TCAM Systems of Edinburgh. ESI may locate its computer operations in Scotland. It sees an initiative on business start-ups spearheaded by Scottish Enterprise as a promising base for trading in regional shares. The system is aimed at individual investors rather than institutions. Investors would pay Pounds 100 for computer software and a Pounds 15 a month subscription. They would buy shares by logging on via a modem, passing security procedures and striking a deal to buy packets of shares at a price quoted on ESI's public order board. The bank would immediately transfer payment from the account of the buyer to that of the seller. If a user wanted a better price than that offered on the board he would enter an offer anonymously. ESI would levy a charge of 0.1 per cent on each transaction on ESI stocks, with a minimum of Pounds 5. The low charges would enable bargains of as little as Pounds 200 to be struck. ESI's users could buy London-quoted shares, routed through a broker. The system would list existing quoted companies and encourage new ones with a turnover range between Pounds 1m and Pounds 20m. New entrants would not require a trading record, and sponsorship by a broker or other intermediary would be optional. They would, however, have to publish a prospectus, with directors legally responsible for its accuracy, and publish price-sensitive information. Quarterly trading results would be expected. ESI would make available as much information as possible about companies and their industrial sectors. Mr Lang believes the availability of accurate information is often more important to individual investors than the sponsorship of intermediaries in making investment decisions. He accepts that sponsorship is important to institutions. A possible flaw is that if institutions do not invest, it may discourage individuals from joining. ESI aroused considerable interest at a presentation in Glasgow this week. One banker said he saw it more as a way of encouraging more people to dabble in investing in shares than in helping companies raise money.</p>

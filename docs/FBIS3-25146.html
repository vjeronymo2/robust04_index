At the summit, which took  place on the sidelines of President Houphouet-Boigny's funeral,  the 13 African countries of the CFA zone deplored the  consequences of the devaluation of their currency. No measure  was announced after the mini-summit. Nevertheless, before his  flight, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur was eager to  reiterate France's solidarity with the African member countries  of the franc zone. Here is an extract of the statement of the  French head of government at Yamoussoukro.    [Begin Balladur recording] Twenty-six days after the  decision  of the African countries to devalue the CFA franc, the situation  is better than one could foresee. Certainly, there are multiple  difficulties here and there, relating for instance to the size  of the debt. This is the first category of problems which we  discussed.    The second category related to the situation of enterprises,  be it French enterprises in Africa or African enterprises. We  discussed how to help them in their transitional period and it  was observed that the development fund already had the necessary  means to cope with the situation, at least in the coming months.  The third problem discussed is the relations between  international institutions and these countries. As you know,  the director general of the IMF and the president of the World  Bank were invited to come and see me on 6 January. I pointed  out to them the major interest of the international institutions  in helping the African states if the latter took the decision to  devalue. I remember [IMF Director] Mr. Camdessus and [World  Bank President] Mr. Preston then made a proposal to me. This  undertaking was renewed with these countries when they met in  Dakar. Everyone agrees that there are measures that need to be  taken at the national level. At any rate, France has decided to  spare no trouble or effort. [end recording]</p>

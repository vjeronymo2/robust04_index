			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUENA PARK VS. FULLERTON;  </P> <P> DEBATE FIRES UP OVER AIRPORT AFTER CRASH  </P> <P> As investigators began trying to find out why a light plane crashed in a Buena  Park neighborhood after taking off from Fullerton Municipal Airport, Buena Park  officials on Thursday said the accident is an example of why the facility  should eventually be shut down.  </P> <P> "The area surrounding the airport has become urbanized, and it's going to  become more and more" so, Buena Park City Councilman Donald L. Bone said.  "Downstream, I would like to see the airport closed."  </P> <P> "This City Council believes the airport has outlived its usefulness," added  Buena Park City Manager Kevin O'Rourke.  </P> <P> In the last nine months, there have been three light plane crashes in Buena  Park. The latest accident happened Wednesday when a two-seat Cessna 152  carrying an instructor and a student pilot lost power about a minute after  takeoff and crashed at the intersection of Artesia Boulevard and Darlington  Street.  </P> <P> The student pilot, Moyra Pim, 29, was reported in critical but stable condition  Thursday at UCI Medical Center in Orange with second- and third-degree burns  over 50% of her body. Instructor Bradley Pearce, 28, of Garden Grove was  treated for arm burns and released.  </P> <P> Pim, from Great Britain, had been on vacation visiting her boyfriend, Mark  Fisher.  </P> <P> Fisher said she was resting Thursday night after "an agonizing day."  </P> <P> "She's not able to hear or reply," Fisher said, adding that her face is  completely bandaged. "It's still impossible for us to realize this happened to  such a beautiful girl. On a scale of 1 to 10, she was definitely a 10."  </P> <P> Fullerton airport statistics show an average of about two crashes a year during  the last five years, but Fullerton officials are satisfied with the facility's  operation. The airport, which is home to about 600 planes, handled 162,000  takeoffs and landings last year.  </P> <P> "I believe the airport is a very safe place," said Fullerton City Manager  William C. Winter. "The record of incidents does not reflect an alarming  situation."  </P> <P> Sylvia Paoli, chairwoman of Fullerton's Airport Users Task Force, chided Buena  Park officials for "overreacting" to Wednesday's crash.  </P> <P> "This is not to minimize the seriousness of any aircraft accident . . . but I  think people have got to be realistic," said Paoli, who has flown out of the  Fullerton airport for 20 years.  </P> <P> "We don't live in Utopia. I wish people would try to step out of themselves a  little bit and realize the airport is not unleashing an atom bomb on Buena  Park."  </P> <P> Winter also pointed out the economic benefits that the airport brings to both  Fullerton and Buena Park. A 1986 study estimated that next year, the airport  will have a direct economic impact of $30.1 million on the area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complaints About Noise  </P> <P> "Most of the benefit comes through companies who use private planes and enjoy  having the availability of the airport next to private businesses," Winter  said.  </P> <P> Fullerton officials acknowledge that they regularly receive complaints about  airplane noise. Fullerton has two citizen advisory committees to address  airport issues: the Noise and Safety Committee and the Airport Users Task  Force.  </P> <P> Several years ago, Fullerton bought sound-measuring devices that are used in  areas where residents complain of excessive noise. The devices have helped to  identify particularly noisy planes so that the pilot could correct the problem.  </P> <P> Paoli said that if the cause of Wednesday's crash ends up being linked to a  deficiency of the airport, officials would certainly make some changes. "We are  always looking for procedures to keep things quieter and safer," she added.  </P> <P> But across the board, the majority of airplane crashes are caused by pilot  error such as running out of fuel, Paoli said.  </P> <P> Buena Park Councilman Bone said that his City Council probably will write a  letter to the Federal Aviation Administration requesting a review of airport  procedures to see if more stringent maintenance and inspections are warranted  at the Fullerton airport.  </P> <P> "It's a difficult problem," Bone said. "By the grace of God, nobody was killed  this time, but how long will our luck hold?"  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Jim Wall of the National Transportation Safety Board said the  investigation of Wednesday's crash will probably take several weeks to  complete. The mangled aircraft has been taken to Long Beach Airport for further  inspection, he said.  </P> <P> "We're waiting until we get some time to look at the rest of the hardware,"  said Wall, adding that the delay is partly due to about 50 similar  investigations under way in the region.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Jeffrey A. Perlman and David Reyes contributed to this  report.  </P></p>

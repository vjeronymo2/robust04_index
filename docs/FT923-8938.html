			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Timmer acts to quell doubts in break with tradition PHILIPS, the beleaguered Dutch electronics group, yesterday deployed Mr Jan Timmer, the president, to quell doubts about the company's new consumer electronic products that have created the weakness which has beset its share price since early summer. Breaking with tradition, Mr Timmer presided over the company's quarterly press conference to clear up what he described as misunderstandings about the future prospects of the digital compact cassette (DCC), compact disc-interactive (CD-I) and high-definition television (HDTV). Mr Timmer, who normally addresses only the annual results presentation in February, vigorously denied a Dutch press report that the company would face financial problems if its HDTV standard, developed together with Thomson of France, did not prove successful. He said the importance of HDTV to Philips' financial well-being had been distorted and the effect of these worries on Philips's shares had been exaggerated. Mr Timmer said the future of HDTV lay with European Community finance ministers, who must decide later this year on whether to approve incentives to encourage broadcasters to produce programmes in D2-MAC. This is the standard developed by Philips, Thomson and other European companies, as an intermediary step to full HDTV. However, Mr Timmer said Philips was 'prepared for a large number of eventualities' if another solution was found. Investor worries about HDTV have been compounded by Philips' recent announcement that it was delaying its planned September launch of DCC until later in the year, as well as by doubts about the success of CD-I, a multi-media version of the popular CD player. Recalling the launch of the CD in 1982, Mr Timmer said: 'At the time, there were an unbelievable amount of Doomsday Charlies who said 'Don't do it because we have the cassette . . . and the LP'. If we had listened to them, the CD would never have been launched.' He said the delay in getting DCC to shops was small compared with the expected 25-year life span of the product. Mr Timmer acknowledged that 'we shot ourselves in the foot' by originally specifying a September launch rather than speaking of 'the autumn'. Mr Timmer, who once said he might resign if results did not improve by the end of 1992, stated that yesterday's figures 'are no reason for me personally to say 'I'm throwing in the towel''. After the press conference, Mr Timmer startled journalists in the press centre by making an impromptu walk-about. Commenting on yesterday's further decline of nearly a guilder in Philips' share price, he said: 'I didn't come here with the illusion that the share price would go up by five guilders.' Clearly, however, Mr Timmer's performance yesterday was designed to win back some of the confidence which his elevation to the top job at Philips generated back in July 1990.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Ex-Apple chief joins Spectrum Information MR JOHN Sculley, who resigned last week as chairman of Apple Computer, has joined Spectrum Information Technologies, a small New York company that has developed technology for the transmission of data on cellular telephone networks. For Mr Sculley, who earlier this year made a bid for the top job at International Business Machines and has been mentioned as a potential candidate to head Kodak, the move seems extraordinary. However, over the past year he has frequently mentioned his wish to form a high technology start-up company. Spectrum's computer-to-cellular linking technology is also central to Mr Sculley's interests in developing hand-held computer devices such as Apple's Newton. Mr Sculley will become chairman and chief executive of Spectrum. He was recruited by Mr Peter Caserta, the present chief executive, who will remain at the company as vice chairman and president. 'I am tremendously impressed with Peter Caserta and his vision and leadership in building Spectrum as a foundation for expansive growth,' said Mr Sculley. Spectrum Information Technologies claims to have developed the first commercially successful cellular modem, a device that will link portable computers to cellular telephone networks. In September the company announced that it had been awarded a patent on technology that simplifies computer-to-cellular connections. Spectrum has licensed its patented technology to several companies, including AT&amp;T and Rockwell International. These licensing agreements 'are indicative of the company's potential,' Mr Sculley said. Spectrum, formed in 1984, has reported losses for the past five years. For fiscal 1993, ending in March, it reported net losses of Dollars 9.9m on revenues of Dollars 98.7m.</p>

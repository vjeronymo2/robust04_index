			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar falls as franc rallies THE DOLLAR fell more than three pfennigs against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges yesterday as investors prepared themselves for a potentially poor set of US economic indicators this week, writes James Blitz. After a fortnight of turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism, trading in the major European currencies eased and dealers turned their attentions once again to the dollar. The French franc rallied to a close of FFr3.373 against the D-Mark, nearly 6 centimes above its floor. This suggested that the united stand of the Bundesbank and the Bank of France had avoided a humiliating devaluation. The Swedish central bank lowered its marginal lending rate to 40 per cent from 50 per cent as pressures on the Swedish crown eased, and the Belgian National Bank cut its key advances rate by 10 basis points to 9 per cent. By contrast, the dollar came under intense pressure as investors speculated on whether there will be another cut in US interest rates this week in response to poor economic data. The market's attention is fixed on Friday's figure for the September non-farm payroll, which is expected to reveal a sluggish underlying trend. As Mr Gerard Lyons of DKB International observes, 10 of the 13 US interest rate cuts that have been made since the beginning of last year happened either on or in the days following a non-farm payroll figure, while 2 were in the days before. The dollar closed more than 3 pfennigs down against the D-Mark at DM1.4510. Now that sterling is floating outside the ERM, the currency is even more sensitive to fluctuations in the dollar/D-Mark rate. Yesterday afternoon, it slumped to a historic low against the D-Mark in US trading of DM2.5080 from the previous low of DM2.5090. The pound has been further undermined by the lingering uncertainty over the course of UK economic policy and the contrasting calls on the European continent to consolidate the harder core of the ERM. The pound closed in London 3 1/2 pfennigs down on the day at DM2.51. Investors have tended to think that there could be another sharp fall in sterling if it breaches the DM2.50 level. The strength of the French franc and fears over a two-speed Europe weakened the higher-yielding currencies inside the ERM. The Irish central bank raised its short term facility rate to 13.75 per cent from 10.75 per cent after dealers reported that the Irish punt had touched its ERM floor against the D-Mark of DM2.6190. The Irish punt later closed against the D-Mark at DM2.6275. The Spanish peseta also weakened against the D-Mark, closing at Pta70.31, close to its ERM floor against the D-Mark of Pta72.62.</p>

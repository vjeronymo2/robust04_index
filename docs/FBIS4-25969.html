			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Wang Wei (3769 0251) and Fu Xianwei (0265 6343 </F> 0251)]    [Text] At a meeting held yesterday to introduce Pudong's  policy, Zhao Qizheng, vice mayor of Shanghai and chairman of the  New Pudong District Management Committee, reiterated: Despite  the fact that the state has carried out taxation reform, the  preferential taxation policy enjoyed by enterprises of various  ownerships in the New Pudong District remains unchanged in order  to maintain continuity of the Pudong development policy.  Investors from China and foreign countries can invest in Pudong  without reservations.    In response to questions on Pudong's taxation policy raised  by some people from home and abroad, a responsible person of the  taxation bureau of the New Pudong District explained yesterday:  After the taxation reform was carried out, the New Pudong  District made a clear-cut decision to continue implementing  various regulations on preferential taxation policy in the New  Pudong District. These regulations on preferential taxation  policy include a series of preferential taxation policies  intended for foreign-funded enterprises, domestic-funded  enterprises, and enterprises in the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone.  According to the principle of the separated taxes system,  implementation rules for relevant preferential taxation policies  were formulated for foreign-invested enterprises, retailing and  catering service enterprises in the main commercial area of  Pudong's market town, enterprises meant for placing people whose  land was taken by the government for other uses, private  enterprises, and enterprises participating in the production  material market of the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone.    People pay special attention to the preferential policy  intended for enterprises of the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone. Vice  Mayor Zhao Qizheng, who just came back from the national bonded  zone work forum held in Tianjin recently, brought home the  latest news: We should manage bonded zones according to  international norms. We should regard bonded zones as the  linking points between or the integration of international and  domestic markets and guide bonded zones enterprises toward the  large international market. Zhao Qizheng pointed out: Based on  the national bonded zone work forum guidelines, the Waigaoqiao  Bonded Zone will soon make its new regulations public to help  the bonded zone play a more effective role.    These reporters learned: From January to May this year,  Pudong approved 449 new foreign-invested projects, up 7.2  percent over the same period of last year. The contracted  foreign capital totaled $1.933 billion, up 61.1 percent over the  same period of last year. Of these, $1.462 billion were directly  invested in by foreign investors, up 93.4 percent over the same  period of last year. This fully shows that Pudong remains  popular among foreign investors.</p>

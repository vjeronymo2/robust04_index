			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Mubarak urges Middle East to jump aboard last peace train EGYPT believes that only 'small measures' are required from Israel for Middle East peace negotiations to resume on schedule in Washington on April 20. President Hosni Mubarak, speaking after weekend talks in Cairo with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, said that he would be contacting Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, after his talks next week with President Bill Clinton. Mr Mubarak also gave notice to the US that on the question of civil and military aid, Egypt expects to be treated no less well than Israel. Mr Rabin recently received an assurance from the US that there were no plans for any reduction in the Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2.1bn) that Israel receives annually. The US commitment to Egypt is for Dollars 2.1bn a year, a sum exceeded only by aid to Israel. On the peace process, Mr Mubarak said that Mr Rabin had already made clear that the deportation of 415 Palestinians in December - the issue blocking the resumption of negotiations - was an 'extraordinary' act. He praised the Israeli leader for taking 'some good steps' and added that his bilateral contacts with Mr Rabin were a key factor in getting talks restarted. He planned to contact Mr Rabin as soon as he returned from Washington. But Mr Mubarak, who has emerged this week as the key intermediary in efforts to revive the peace talks, warned that time was running out. 'We are anxious to help all the parties involved, with the co-operation of the US, to reach a comprehensive settlement.' He had discussed the issues preventing the resumption of talks at the weekend with President Assad and Mr Arafat and said 'there are still some clouds.' But he added: 'We are trying to solve the problem of the deportees. I do not want to miss the April 20 date because I think that the efforts now being made may be the last efforts for solving the Middle East problem. We don't want to miss this train. This is the last train for peace and I want to make sure all the passengers are on it.' Mr Mubarak believed it was vital for the Clinton administration to become a full partner in the peace process, not simply to put pressure on Israel but to 'help and mediate'. 'That does not mean we are going to neglect having the Americans put pressure on the Israelis. But the main thing is to have good contact with the Israelis. We are working hard with the Israelis in this sense.' He cautioned other Arab governments against over-reacting to recent statements by Israel and the US on strategic co-operation. 'There is nothing new in this,' he said. 'They have co-operation in so many ways. I have told them not be be nervous about this.' Mr Mubarak said he would also be discussing Iraq with President Clinton and warned that the break-up of that country would be very dangerous. 'All of us would suffer. It would be very dangerous for all for the whole area, including Europe. You may not realise it now. You would have three countries creating problems. What I shall be discussing with President Clinton is ways of helping the people of Iraq.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with &sect;960.4(b) of the Board's existing AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation, &sect;960.6(b) of the proposed rule provides that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank shall allocate comparable amounts of AHP subsidies for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP funding cycle during the year. See 12 CFR 960.4(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Specific Application and Scoring Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Application Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule does not mandate use of a uniform AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application form by all of the Banks. Rather, the Board believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, consistent with current practice under the AHP, each Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should continue to devise its own AHP application form, because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each Bank will have its own special information requirements as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of the specific priorities and scoring criteria adopted by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, as discussed further below, all AHP applications must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy certain threshold requirements in order to be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for scoring under the proposed rule. Thus, certain information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from applicants must be received by all Banks in order for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Banks to be able to determine whether the applications satisfy the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold requirements in the proposed rule and to score the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications under the scoring criteria. Accordingly, &sect;960.7(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed rule provides that each Bank shall require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicants for subsidized advances or direct subsidies under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP to submit to the Bank an application which, at a minimum,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains all of the information described below and any other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information which the Bank determines is necessary in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take action on such application, including the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A concise description of the purpose of the request and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed uses of the funds, and its relationship to the priorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified in proposed &sect;960.10(d), the targeting criterion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified in proposed &sect;960.10(e), and the other objectives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified in proposed &sect;960.10(f);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A statement of how the project will satisfy the authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uses and long-term requirements, including a description of legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanisms to be used to ensure compliance by the project with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such requirements, contained in proposed &sect;&sect;960.3 and 960.5;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A statement of how the project will comply with the fair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing law requirement contained in proposed &sect;960.9(b);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A statement of how the project will satisfy the feasibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement contained in proposed &sect;960.9(d);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) A statement of how the project's sponsor satisfies the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualification requirement contained in proposed &sect;960.9(e);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) A statement of whether a subsidized advance or direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidy has been requested and the amount of such funds requested;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

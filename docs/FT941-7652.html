			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Israeli pull-out 'by third week in May' Israel has sent word to Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman Yassir Arafat that it plans to complete its military pull-out from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area of the West Bank by the third week in May, government officials said yesterday. Earlier this week, the Israeli environment minister, Mr Yossi Sarid, said that, by late May, he expected Mr Arafat to relocate from Tunis to a new PLO headquarters in Jericho. The Israeli officials spoke as Israeli-PLO peace talks, bogged down in arguments over the minutiae of Palestinian self-rule, appeared to be moving into high gear. Israel's Prime Minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, said agreement had been reached on the size of the Palestinian police force, 'plus or minus 8,000 for the Gaza and Jericho stage.' Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, said he believed the original April 13 target date for completing the Israeli withdrawal would not be missed by more than two or three weeks. Sometime in the spring, he said, 'we'll be able to celebrate a task completed'. In Cairo, Israel and the PLO agreed to reconvene next week for further talks on the police force, other security arrangements and civil administration issues related to the transfer of power. The PLO's delegation head, Mr Nabil Sha'ath, and his Israeli counterpart, Maj-General Amnon Shahak, expressed satisfaction at progress made. The release of Palestinian prisoners remained under discussion. 'But only a little is left to do,' Mr Sha'ath stated. He believed agreement had been reached on rules of conduct and deployment of a Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho after Israeli withdrawal. He has spoken of a meeting between Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin as early as next weekend to wrap up final issues. Mr Beilin said such a meeting was 'not far off'. Talks in Paris on the economic aspects of Palestinian autonomy have stalled because of disputes over the future trading relationship between Israel and the areas under Palestinian self-rule. The Palestinians want their own currency and an independent foreign trade policy. Israel rejects the currency demand.</p>

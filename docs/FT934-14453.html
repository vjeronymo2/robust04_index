			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / International Company News: Foreign banks reject Ferruzzi proposals SOLUTION of the Ferruzzi-Montedison group's problems has been seriously delayed by the refusal of foreign bank creditors to accept a restructuring plan. The foreign banks' position contrasts starkly with the 21 large Italian banks, which account for 70 per cent of the group's total L25,000bn (Dollars 16bn) bank debt, and which have already endorsed the restructuring plan. The plan centres on four elements - a debt moratorium for 1993 costing the banks L1,800bn, subsequent consolidation of the debt costing L1,600bn, capital increases totalling L5,400bn and asset sales of L5,500bn. 'We are prepared to co-operate but the present proposals are unacceptable,' said a representative of one of the 110 foreign bank creditors. 'We are setting up a working group to make our own proposals, and we want an independent accountant's assessment.' Foreign bankers suggested yesterday this process could take them well into November. The next deadlines are November 30 and December 1 respectively for the special meetings to approve Ferfin and Montedison capital increases. The foreign banks' letter makes 11 points of primary concern on the restructuring plan drawn up by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank. The first and fundamental point is that 'an international restructuring should satisfy the interests of creditors first, and shareholders only thereafter'. Another important bone of contention is the need for independent assessment of financial information provided by accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche, plus adequate information about their current investigations. This is a reference to the possibility of holes still being found in operations of subsidiaries, which are lso being investigated by Ravenna and Milan magistrates. 'The creditors also require direct access to the group's auditors.' The letter also makes clear the demand for 'substantially' more assets to be sold 'in view of the inability of the group to meet its financial obligations'. The banks want far more guarantees of 'arm's-length' sales. On the question of a debt moratorium for 1993, the banks say the proposal 'violates creditors' rights, is inconsistent with acceptable restructuring principles and is completely unfeasible'. It appears that for the first half accounts, the Ferruzzi-Montedison administrators have written in the effects of only one month's debt service being withheld from the major Italian banks.</p>

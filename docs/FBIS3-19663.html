			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Rome, March 19 (AFP) -- Leaders of Italy's leftist  movements renewed accusations Saturday [19 March] that media  magnate Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing Forza Italia party is  encouraging the mafia to vote for it in forthcoming elections.    Leoluca Orlando, the anti-mafia mayor in the Sicilian city  of  Palermo, said several of Sicily's Forza Italy candidates for the  March 27-28 poll had obtained the backing of top mafiosi.    The leader of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS),  Achille  Occhetto, said Friday [18 March] evening during a campaign rally  that Berlusconi's party had "been pledged support by Don  Piromalli," the boss of the N'Drangheta mafia based in the  southern region of Calabria.    And Luciano Violante, the chairman of parliament's  anti-mafia  commission and a leftist candidate in the poll in a Sicily  constituency, told AFP that the "political entourage" of Forza  Italy was suspect.    There was "not necessarily" an agreement between the party  and the mafia, he said, but "it seems to me that Forza Italia  has not rejected support" proffered by leading figures of  Italy's corrupt institutional past "who are trying to make a  comeback."    Meanwhile Interior Minister Nicola Mancino, a Christian  Democrat, told the Neapolitan Daily Il Mattino Saturday that  "rumours" that the mafia was poised to pledge its support for  Forza Italia "must be verified."    Forza Italia's spokesman, Antonio Tajani, dismissed reported  mafia links as "pure defamation."    The election campaign has shaped up increasingly as a  two-horse race between Berlusconi and the PDS, with the latest  opinion poll Saturday crediting right-wing parties with 40.9  percent of the poll and parties of the left with 37.7 percent.</p>

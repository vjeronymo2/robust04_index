			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BAR FILES NEW CHARGES AGAINST MITCHELSON  </P> <P> The State Bar of California filed new disciplinary charges against attorney  Marvin Mitchelson Thursday -- charges his attorney says are without merit.  </P> <P> James A. Bascue, chief trial counsel of the bar, said in a news release that  the Century City attorney for five years mishandled his client trust account by  failing to segregate his personal funds from those of his clients, wrote checks  based on insufficient funds and failed to keep proper accounting records of  client funds.  </P> <P> Arthur Margolis, Mitchelson's attorney, said the allegations were without merit  and the release of the complaint violated the State Bar's own rules.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen the allegations, but the press was informed of the specific  charges," Margolis said.  </P> <P> The latest charges will be added to 13 earlier disciplinary charges handed down  against Mitchelson by the State Bar.  </P></p>

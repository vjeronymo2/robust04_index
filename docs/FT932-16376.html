			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Morgan Crucible ahead 27% - Shares dip 11% as analysts question acquisition provisions SHARES IN Morgan Crucible, the materials technology group, yesterday appeared to be the first casualty of possible revisions to the rules on acquisition accounting. The share price fell more than 11 per cent to 289p after the group released results for the year to January 3 1993 which led analysts to reappraise the group's repeated use of acquisition provisions. The Accounting Standards Board last week issued a discussion draft that suggested the cost of incorporating acquisitions should be taken directly in the profit and loss account and not via provisions set up at the time of acquisition that only affect the balance sheet. Morgan Crucible was reporting pre-tax profits of Pounds 61.3m, a 27 per cent increase over 1991 results adjusted down from Pounds 61m to bring them into line with new FRS 3 accounting rules. On this new basis, diluted earnings per share were up 38 per cent at 18.7p. Underlying earnings per share rose from 17.7p to 19p. The group further surprised analysts by setting up new provisions for acquisitions in its carbon division that took place nearly three years ago. Mr Bruce Farmer, chief executive, said delay in starting the reorganisation had resulted from a Federal Trade Commission study of Morgan Crucible's market share. The Dollars 6m cost of reorganising this division was now being included in Pounds 8.8m of new provisions for prior year acquisitions. However, the net increase was Pounds 4.8m after the group wrote back Pounds 4m of provisions no longer required. Mr Graham Swetman, finance director, said the share price fall had been overdone. Analysts had paid too much attention to the provisions and not enough to the results of a group that had done well compared with its competitors in a difficult recession, he said. Apart from the question of provisions, the actual results were broadly in line with expectations. The rise in gearing to 67 per cent was anticipated following the departure of sterling from the EMS last September. Interest during the year was 7.6 times covered. The total dividend is maintained at 12.6p with a proposed final of 6.85p. Operating profit margins fell to 10 per cent for the group as a whole. The carbon and thermal ceramics divisions both suffered lower operating profits. Carbon sales increased from Pounds 112m to Pounds 125m but profits fell from Pounds 17.2m to Pounds 15.6m. Thermal profits fell from Pounds 23.1m to Pounds 20.8m on sales of Pounds 208m. Speciality materials and technologies profits rose from Pounds 18.4m to Pounds 19.2m on sales of Pounds 190m, while technical ceramics improved from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 15.7m on sales of Pounds 157m. Mr Farmer said the best prospects for growth were in North America, south-east Asia, the Pacific rim and Australia, where the group has about 50 per cent of its sales. See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Urgent: U.S. Reiterates Its Position on Taiwan and Tibet" </F> -- XINHUA headline]    [Text] Washington, May 16 (XINHUA) -- The United States  government today reiterated its position on Tibet and Taiwan,  saying that it is "long-standing U.S. policy that Tibet is part  of China."    "Neither the U.S. nor any other state regards Tibet as a  sovereign nation. The U.S. does not recognize a Tibetan  government-in-exile," said a statement issued by the office of  U.S. State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry.    The statement was released following the recent adoption of  "The Foreign Relations Authorization Act" by the U.S. Congress.    The statement also said that the United States will continue  to follow a "one-China" policy.    On the issue of U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, the statement  said,  "we continue to honor our commitment to the August 17, 1982  Communique with respect to arms sales to Taiwan and regard it as  one of the three pillars supporting our bilateral relationship.  Nothing in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act will  interfere with our continuing to honor this commitment."    "The United States remains fully committed to the Three  Joint  Communiques between the P.R.C. (People's Republic of China) and  the U.S. as the framework of our China policy. Nothing in the  foreign relations authorization act changes this," the statement  added.</p>

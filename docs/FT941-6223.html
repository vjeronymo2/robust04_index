			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities hit hard by renewed setback in bonds - Market Report Another heavy sell-off in the bond markets yesterday wiped out the attempted recovery of confidence in UK equities. Late afternoon saw share prices tumbling on all sides as global bond markets reacted with heavy falls to a sharp rise in the February price index compiled by the US National Purchasing Managers Association (NPMA). The FT-SE 100 Index fell 57.5, or 1.7 per cent, to 3,270.6, the day's low, Selling increased as the market fell away but trading volume remained fairly moderate. With the pressure largely focused on the blue chip leaders, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index lost only 15.4 to 3,944.6. The NPMA report was the last straw for a stock market which has been firmly under the heel of the bond markets. An initial firming in equities was abruptly reversed by a downturn in European bonds on disappointment with the outcome of the variable repo tender in Germany. Then came the upward revision of the fourth-quarter US GDP figure, which gave the first hint of renewed inflation concern. But the Footsie was down only 19 points at that stage. It was the NPMA price index which turned the cold wind blowing through the markets into a hurricane. As on Thursday, share prices were at the mercy of bonds and, with stock index futures setting the pace, simply crumpled as both short and long-dated gilts plunged. Weakness in short-dated gilts implied negative views on base rate prospects, underlining the reversal of sentiment which lies beneath the market setback. A sizeable trading programme, weighted towards the sell side, had appeared in the market before the collapse began and probably had little effect. Share quotations were cut repeatedly by marketmakers strugging to avoid speculative sellers and fund managers trying to reduce exposure. At Kleinwort Benson Securities, the London merchant bank and securities house, Mr Albert Edwards pointed out that the NAPM index is linked to commodity prices, making it a significant indicator of inflationary pressures ahead in the US. London traders saw yesterday's fall in US bonds as a sign that prospects of further tightening in Federal Reserve policies had come several steps closer. The day's trading volume of 720.8m shares through the Seaq network compared with 705.2m on Monday, when retail business was worth Pounds 1.38bn. While there has been no heavy selling of equities, it has been noted by the strategists that there has been no sign that cash taken out of gilts is seeking a home in the stock market. Once again, the financial sectors suffered severely as investors reckoned the possible damage to the securities trading divisions of the fresh round of losses in global bond markets. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, down in the home market overnight, fell heavily in London as some analysts questioned the outlook at the Hang Seng Bank unit. There was little that equity strategists could say yesterday except to repeat the comments made last week. Many still see the setback as a buying opportunity, but warn that the market could be in for further shocks in the near term. The focus remains entirely on the bond markets, which are expected to remain nervous ahead of the German M3 money supply figures, due later this week, and, of course, to recurrent bouts of nervousness that the US Federal Reserve may be about to tighten credit policy again.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 15 Jun -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk  received Israel's Foreign Minister Shimon Peres during the  minister's visit to Ukraine.    "Ukraine attaches great importance to the development of  friendly bilateral relations with Israel," the Ukrainian  president stressed. "This visit opens a new stage in Ukraine's  relations with Israel."    Leonid Kravchuk spoke warmly about his visit to Israel in  January last year when he signed a memorandum on mutual  understanding and fundamental principles of cooperation between  the two countries. At the same time, Ukraine's and Israel's  foreign ministries signed a protocol on consultations. The two  countries also signed intergovernmental agreements on  cooperation in education, culture, science and technology,  agriculture, and air transportation.    "To us, Israel is and has been a sovereign state with which  we are keen to develop relations," the Ukrainian president said.  "We are neighbors, and many of our countrymen are now citizens  of Israel. They live there and they wish Ukraine to be happy.    "We have worked out a considerable legislative basis for the  development of our relations. The main thing is that the people  of Ukraine want to have friendly relations with Israel, and  there are no problems that we cannot solve."</p>

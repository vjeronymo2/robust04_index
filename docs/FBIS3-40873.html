			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Department of Manpower will evaluate all labor  regulations presently in effect to make sure that they are not  excessive. Plans are for the evaluation to end in January.    Yudo Swasono, temporary acting head of the Manpower Planning  and Development Board, made this statement to MERDEKA after  giving a presentation on Monday (20 December) in Jakarta at a  one-day seminar on the role of women in the economic sector.    In connection with this presentation, Yudo Swasono said that  a reexamination of the labor laws which regulate the problems of  female workers would also be carried out.    He explained that the labor regulations which regulate the  problems of a female worker's employment in a corporation have  been considered excessive. He was referring to the protection of  female workers. He believes that excessive protection will make  it difficult for female workers to compete with male workers in  the labor market.    Among the labor regulations about female workers to be  examined by the Department of Manpower are the problems of  menstrual leave, maternal leave, and so forth. "If we consider  it necessary to supplement them, we will supplement them; but if  they should be reduced, things which are not fitting will be  deleted," affirmed Yudo Swasono.    Yudo believes that a reevaluation of the regulations is very  important for the development of the female workers themselves.  What he means is that women should have the same work  opportunities as men. Up to now women have been discriminated  against.    For example, the field of manpower training is still largely  dominated by men. Even though they (the women) are being  trained, applying this training is difficult. Yudo believes that  this also affects the level of productivity of the corporation  concerned.    In answer to a question about female workers' productivity,  Yudo said that the level of productivity basically depends on  their level of education and training. At this point the level  of education of female workers is still considered low; "and  existing BLK's (vocational training halls) cannot yet guarantee  increased worker productivity," he stated.    For that reason, the minister of manpower is also going to  carry out a large-scale evaluation of the quality of existing  BLK's. One of the matters to be looked at is BKL membership,  which is still dominated by men. For that reason, one of the  future targets of this BLK evaluation is to develop female  worker productivity as a human resource.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Hala Boncompagni] </F>   [Text] Beirut, March 9 (AFP)--New tactics and weapons are  the secret to the Iranian-backed Hizballah's success in  inflicting heavier losses on Israeli and allied militiamen in  south Lebanon while suffering fewer casualties.    A month after killing four Israeli soldiers and wounding  five, Hizballah guerrillas on Monday [7 March] launched a series  of bomb attacks on the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA),  killing 10 militiamen and wounding 12.    A senior intelligence officer was among those killed, but  Hizballah reported no casualties on its side.    "Monday's operations were specifically aimed at eliminating  Israel's main intelligence agents," Shaykh Nabil Qawuq who is  among those in charge of Hizballah operations in south Lebanon,  told AFP on Tuesday.    "They are part of a series of operations to sow chaos among  SLA ranks," he said, adding that more than 100 SLA militiamen  had deserted over the past year.    Military experts and sources close to the Shiite Moslem  fundamentalists said Hizballah's operations in recent months  were more professional and homed in on specific Israeli or SLA  targets to avoid retaliation against civilians.    The guerrillas were also using more sophisticated weapons.    Their arsenal now includes Russian-made Sagger anti-tank  rockets known for their precision, which are increasingly being  used against moving targets, a western military source said.    Hizballah has had "very good results" with the rockets, said  the source, who declined to be named.    An SLA official said that Hizballah guerrillas were also  using a new type of roadside bomb that "is shaped like rocks and  painted in earthy colours."    He said the bombs were Iranian-made or upgraded by Iran and  that they were capable of jamming Israeli radars. Hizballah  also uses Katyusha rockets and mortars.    Sources close to the fundamentalists have said the new  tactics evolved two months ago with the arrival in Lebanon of a  new team of Iranian Revolutionary Guards to oversee and  coordinate the anti- Israeli operations.    They include a new head for the Revolutionary Guards and an  Iranian official known by his first name only, 'Abbas, who is  said to be in charge of Hizballah's military operations, the  sources said.    Around 200 Revolutionary Guards, clerics and social workers  are based in Lebanon's eastern al-Biqa' Valley, where they were  first deployed following Israel's 1982 invasion.    Hizballah has meanwhile transferred its military positions  out of the al-Biqa' city of Ba'labakk to areas closer to the  border with Syria and switched its activities in the region to  social work and construction.    Fundamentalist sources said these steps were part of a  campaign by Hizballah to improve its domestic image after  winning eight parliamentary seats in the 1992 elections.    "They are also focusing more and more on helping their  supporters to set up private businesses as part of an effort to  forge a new image for the movement," a reliable source said.    "Hizballah has become more diplomatic since the 1992  elections. They no longer terrorize people," the source added.    Hizballah leader Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah said last month his  organisation was "not only a military movement. We have popular  roots everywhere."</p>

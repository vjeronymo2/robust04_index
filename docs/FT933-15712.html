			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Firm pound and gilts boost shares ANOTHER strong performance from sterling and gilts, coupled with a better than expected opening by Wall Street and good gains across most European bourses, helped the recently bruised UK equity market stage a good recovery yesterday. The FT-SE 100 Index, having plummeted more than 60 points during the previous three trading sessions, stabilised and closed 9.6 better at 2,848.1, with dealers encouraged by a sharp increase in the volume of business going through the market after Monday's dismal turnover levels. Sterling's continuing strength and that of the gilts sector prompted talk around the City of London that a reduction in UK interest rates is not entirely out of the question, while there was also speculation in foreign exchange markets that a further cut by the Bundesbank is not beyond the realms of possibility. Dealers said worries that the recovery in the UK economy, so long in coming, could be fading had triggered the latest rate cut stories, although they stressed that there was no great conviction behind the latest speculation. Recent data on money supply and consumer credit has pointed to a slowing in the economy, while the latest survey from the Institute of Directors showed the first fall in business confidence since Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism last year. Another dampener for the market came with a Gallup opinion poll suggesting that manufacturers are adopting an increasingly gloomy outlook for exports as the rest of Europe moves into recession. There was also an element of uncertainty in markets ahead of the G7 meeting in Tokyo which commences today. London's stock market made a bright start to the day, led higher by a strong opening by the Footsie future. The latter was in positive territory all day, although traders spoke of miserably low levels of business in the derivatives areas of the market. Opening almost five points higher at 2,843, the FT-SE 100 moved progressively ahead, touching the day's best, 12.9 up at 2,851.4 in mid-morning, before easing off to finish at 2,848.1. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index delivered an equally good performance, ending the session 13.1 stronger at 3,232.1. Turnover in equities showed a welcome improvement from Monday's thoroughly depressed levels, when volume of 384m shares, among the lowest daily levels this year, was worth only Pounds 761.5m in customer business. The value of retail business has fallen below the Pounds 1bn on only a handful of occasions this year. Yesterday saw 554.3m shares traded, with non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounting for 380.4m shares, or 69 per cent of total turnover. Drug issues, which provided the FT-SE 100's three worst performing stocks last month in Wellcome, SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo, down 15 per cent, 9.9 per cent and 9.4 per cent respectively, according to Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, the stockbroker, were in the vanguard of the market's advance. Analysts said the stocks had been oversold and had been due for a rally. Enlivening a generally uninspiring trading session was a substantial bought deal engineered by Smith New Court, which bought and sold Sears' 25 per cent stake in Aspreys, the royal jewellers.</p>

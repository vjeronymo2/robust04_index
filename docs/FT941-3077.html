			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Being punished for prudence - Nordbanken's rivals say state aid was unfair This time last year, most of Sweden's banks were queueing up for government aid to rescue them from a loan-loss ducking that nearly sank them. Twelve months later, the state is under fire from the same banks for weighting its support too heavily towards just one institution, Nordbanken. The issue is set to be thrown into sharp relief next week when Nordbanken, now wholly state-owned, announces profits for 1993. These are likely to be well in excess of those of its rivals. It is a profit the bank could not possibly have achieved without a wholesale clean-up of its books last year. The operation involved an injection of taxpayers' funds of more than SKr50bn (Dollars 6.4bn), and the assumption by the state of Nordbanken bad loans worth SKr67bn. What is more, Nordbanken has meanwhile become the largest Swedish bank, by market share, through the takeover of Gota Bank. Gota was second only to Nordbanken in the scale of its loan-loss debacle and also was taken over by the state. That operation cost more than SKr27bn and involved the state purchase of bad assets worth SKr43bn. Nordbanken and Gota Bank were not the only banks to receive state aid. However, they did swallow the lion's share and the other banks, particularly Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken, are peeved. The two are leading commercial banks which survived the crisis without direct state assistance. SE-Banken and Handelsbanken both returned to profit in 1993 after huge losses in 1992 - respectively posting operating earnings of SKr357m and SKr1.8bn, due mainly to low interest rates and rising investment income. But they continued to be burdened by high loan losses - as was Swedbank, the largest in the Nordic region by asset values, and the smaller Foreningsbanken. Both remained in the red in 1993. The growing sense of unfair treatment among Nordbanken's rivals was given its strongest airing earlier this month in a protest from the Swedish Bankers' Association. Led by SE-Banken and Handelsbanken, the association complained that the extent of state aid to Nordbanken was excessive, and called on the government to claw back some of its support. 'The state support for Nordbanken has been comprised in a way that gives Nordbanken a clear competitive advantage over the other players in the payment and credit system,' the association said in a letter to the Bank Support Authority, the Riksbank, and the financial inspectors. Handelsbanken, in particular, would appear to have grounds for complaint. It was the least affected by loan losses - mostly accrued by its rivals through wildly-imprudent property lending - and was the only bank which did not apply for state aid. Yet its reward for solid management has been limited to an increase in market share, from around 14 per cent to 16 per cent and, in the words of a government official, the enhancement of its 'reputation and standing in the market'. The authorities, however, have shown little sympathy for the Bankers' Association protest. Mr Stefan Ingves, chief executive of the Bank Support Authority, says allowing Nordbanken and/or Gota Bank to collapse would have reduced, not enhanced, competition in the system - if, indeed, the system had survived the shock. He rejects a proposal by the Bankers' Association that Nordbanken should be penalised through the suspension of interest payments due on SKr30bn in assets held by Securum, the so-called bad bank into which the government placed Nordbanken's bad loans. Mr Ingves said although Nordbanken was not paying a formal price for Gota, it would have to spend around SKr3bn to bring Gota's capital adequacy ratio above the international requirement of 8 per cent. In addition, the BSA intended to 'disentangle' over the next year both Nordbanken from Securum and Gota from Retriva, the Gota 'bad bank'. However, the main concern of the authorities appears to be to achieve the best payback to the taxpayers when Nordbanken is re-privatised, rather than to placate the competitive jealousies of other banks. It was the perception that a merger with Nordbanken would enhance these returns that led the government not to sell Gota Bank as a stand-alone entity late last year. Mr Ingves insists the final reckoning of the government's bail-out of Nordbanken and Gota Bank should not be made until Nordbanken is sold off, probably some time next year.  -----------------------------------------      STATE SUPPORT FOR SWEDISH BANKS  ----------------------------------------- Swedbank                             8.0 Nordbanken                          16.2 Securum                             35.0 Foreningsbanken                      2.5 Gota Bank                           20.0 Equity for Retriva                   3.8 Guarantee for Retriva                3.5 Total                               89.0  -----------------------------------------</p>

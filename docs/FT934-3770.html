			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (13): The time has come - Cogeneration proliferates A century after Britain built its first combined heat and power plant, the concept is finally taking hold. Within the past 10 years the number of CHP, otherwise called co-generation, plants in the UK has increased more than fivefold to about 600, with about half of the growth coming in the last five years. About 2 to 3 per cent of electricity is generated through CHP plants. If government targets are reached, the 2000 megawatts of electricity generated will more than double to 5000MW by the year 2000. The appeal of CHPs is that unlike ordinary generators, they recapture the waste heat released during combustion, and use it to raise steam, hot water, heating, or more electricity. They can thus produce heat and electricity at once and are much more energy efficient than ordinary systems. Whereas conventional power stations have an efficiency of about 35 per cent, CHP plants are up to 90 per cent efficient. Their attraction is that they can reduce companies' electricity bills and contribute to improving the environment. According to the Combined Heat and Power Association each 1,000MW of cogeneration electricity displaces other forms of power generation and heat supply to save 1.25m tonnes of carbon emissions. It will also save on nitrogen emissions. Cogeneration's growth in the past decade owes a lot to the development of technology, much of it in the UK, which makes it affordable to relatively small electricity consumers. The cheapest units can be installed for less than Pounds 40,000. Most sites where CHP was installed in recent years use less than 1MW of electricity. There are about 400 schemes in this category, including hotel chains, leisure centres and hospitals. Expansion among larger industrial customers has been less impressive. The economics of CHP schemes make them less attractive for large industrial concerns. Larger schemes have more difficulty in finding a use for the heat, typically three times the amount of electricity in megawatts, and are subject to more red tape. There are about 150 industrial and commercial applications for CHPs in the 3MW to 50MW category in the UK as well as four urban schemes developed in conjunction with community heating. Industries which require large amounts of heat, such as paper and chemicals, are suitable participants. Thus Hydro-Electric, the Scottish utility which is among the most active of the electricity companies in cogeneration, recently concluded a deal with Dover Harbour Board and Arjo Wiggins, the paper maker, for a Pounds 7.25m plant in Dover. One of PowerGen's first forays into CHP was for the supply of 80MW of electricity and 200MW of steam to three paper factories in Kent. PowerGen has recently formed a CHP subsidiary to co-ordinate such projects and is committed to investing Pounds 60m in cogeneration. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, says that if it did not enter CHP projects others would and 'we would lose share in the generation market'. He says his company is interested in about 40 per cent of what it expects to be a much enlarged CHP market at the end of the century, almost all of it among large industrial companies. Hydro-Electric, meanwhile, sees cogeneration as a way of earning non-regulated income in England and Wales and has already set up three schemes and identified more than 20 other potential sites. While companies such as PowerGen, National Power, Scottish-Hydro and BP Energy are all competing in the market for relatively large industrial users, the regional power companies in England and Wales tend to specialise in smaller scale projects. Three of them, London Electricity, Norweb and Northern Electric, are involved in joint ventures with Combined Power Systems, a company which was involved in developing the technology which made the economics of cogeneration work for smaller sites. Most of the CHP operators, whether operating in large or small projects, operate schemes whereby they install and maintain the units. While all of this activity will in itself generate CHP growth, much of the proposed expansion will depend on factors outside the cogeneration industry's control. Future developments will be strongly influenced by the relationship between the price of electricity and gas. Many proposed CHP plants are awaiting the government's review of the gas industry. Most CHPs plants are gas-fired. Until industry can assess the likely effects of the gas industry changes on prices it will be reluctant to go ahead with proposed schemes. Ministers can also influence CHP growth through easing red tape and other restrictions surrounding their operation. 'Generating power is technically quite simple but to set one up you need an extraordinary amount of documentation,' says David Green, director of the Combined Heat and Power Association. 'The government's drive to reduce red tape through industry as a whole should help,' he says. Mr Michael Heseltine, industry secretary, showed readiness to oblige last month when he abolished restrictions on companies which generate their own electricity but consume less than 51 per cent of it. Previously they had to hold electricity supply licences which meant their sales were subject to the nuclear levy. From April 1 they will no longer have to. The House of Commons environment committee welcomed such initiatives when it reported last month on energy efficiency in buildings, but it suggested far more could and should be done. For example it wants the government to target 'easy pickings' such as hospitals, prisons and military bases for potential CHP sites, and set a target for CHP in government use. The committee suggested that ministers should be more ambitious about what could be achieved after the year 2000, noting that the government itself had identified an ultimate potential of 20,000MW of CHP, four times the present target for the end of the century.</p>

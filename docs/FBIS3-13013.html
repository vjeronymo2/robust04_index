Concurrence of the visits of these two major strategic  Asian countries' foreign ministers to Tehran has drawn attention  of the world's political circles to the tripartite talks among  Iran, India, and China. Significance of this matter lies in the  fact that, under the new global conditions, the concept of  security and power has undergone a change in qualitative terms.  The world is now about to enter the phase where political,  economic, and military regionalism will replace earlier  equations of polarized power in the Cold War era at  international level.    It is assumed the strategic location of the three  interrelated zones in geographical and historical terms--namely,  the Islamic zone and the zones of the Chinese and Indian  civilizations--under the new global conditions and in a  realistic survey, can turn India, Iran, and China into a  well-integrated group. Upon adding Pakistan to this group, one  can say that there will emerge a regional power pole. Such a  pole will have an undeniable impact in safeguarding regional and  world peace and in motivating national development in these  countries.    The Islamic Republic of Iran is the center of the Islamic  civilization. India, too, is the center of the Indian  civilization, while China enjoys a similar position in the  Confucian civilization. Growth of mutual cooperation in these  three zones of historic civilization can strengthen Asia's  independence in all aspects. The factor which can turn such an  alliance into a desirable group in the contemporary world  underlies that the group enjoys all resources for development in  terms of natural resources, work force, and technology.    Based on the vastness of the groups geographical  limits--ranging from the Middle East to the Indian subcontinent  and east Asia--and its population, which is nearly half of the  world, this point becomes clear. In the event of total  realization of these resources, not only the group will be able  to respond to all of its needs but will also become a model  encouraging the enhancement of cooperation in the entire Asian  continent.    Upon considering the triangle of power, comprising Tehran,  New Delhi, and Beijing as a well integrated group, one can say  without any doubt that the equation of international power will  come to face more diverse pressures from the Western world and  the new UN-sponsored world order. Such a situation will not  only increase this group's power to confront the covetous  designs of the West but will also boost the capacity of each of  the countries included in this power triangle for confrontation  in political and economic spheres.</p>

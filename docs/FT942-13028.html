			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / 148 more jobs go at Swan Hunter A further 148 employees of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder which is in receivership, are to be made redundant and 237 will be laid off while the company fights for more work, it was announced yesterday, Chris Tighe writes. The redundancies and lay-offs, to take effect late next month, have been caused by a gap in workload once the Type 23 frigate HMS Northumberland is handed over on May 24. Its departure leaves only one vessel at Swan Hunter. Union leaders regretted the new round of job cuts, but welcomed the decision of receivers Price Waterhouse to lay off, rather than make redundant, the majority of the 385 surplus employees. Those affected include manual, clerical, technical and managerial staff. Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, the French company negotiating to buy Swans, met defence ministry officials yesterday to provide information about its finances and structure.</p>

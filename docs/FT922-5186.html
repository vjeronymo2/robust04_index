			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / People: Dashing up Ladieswear retailer Alexon has promoted Peter Ridsdale, who joined the group last September, onto the main board. Ridsdale explains his job, as managing director of Alexon Brands, was essentially already a main board position, but that the company had no doubt wanted to 'wait and see that I was OK.' He came to Alexon as Ruth Henderson was made chief executive. 'It has been an interesting year from the rivalry point of view' he says, referring to the fact that he is a director of Leeds United football club whereas the chairman (Lawrence Snyder) is ' a fanatical Manchester United supporter'. However, it is the changes Ridsdale has been putting in train - including a sharper focusing on individual brands together with what he calls a drive for 'value for money' - that have earned him a place on the now four-strong board. At Burton, where he had been since 1985 before coming to Alexon, Ridsdale had latterly been managing director of Evans and the discount chain 'Is'. Earlier in his career he worked in personnel for Schering Plough and DelMonte International. ***** Alan Howard, deputy chairman of Etam, has died at the age of 54. He had been chairman of the fashion retailer since February 1979, stepping down to deputy chairman last December because of ill health.</p>

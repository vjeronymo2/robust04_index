			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / EEA links 17 nations in world's largest freetrade zone The European Economic Area, the world's largest free trade zone, comprising 17 countries and 372m people, starts what could be a short life today, a year behind schedule. The EEA treaty extends the European Union's single market to five of the seven members of the more loosely-grouped European Free Trade Association - Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Iceland. All of these countries except Iceland are deep in negotiations with the 12 on full membership of the EU by January 1995, raising questions about the long-term value of the EEA. By most criteria the EEA is a bigger free trade zone, and a much bigger force in world trade, than the North American Free Trade Agreement created between the US, Canada and Mexico, which also comes into force today. Efta figures for 1992 give combined EEA output at Dollars 7,501bn, (Pounds 5,068bn) against a combined gross domestic product of Dollars 6,770bn for Nafta countries. The EEA, creating a market from the Arctic to the Mediterranean, accounts for more than two-fifths of world trade. In 1992, the EEA nations logged exports of Dollars 1,616bn (Dollars 3,878 per capita) against imports of Dollars 1,680bn. The three Nafta partners by comparison had exports of Dollars 624bn (Dollars 1,683 a head) against imports of Dollars 715bn, according to Efta. Unlike Nafta, moreover, the EEA - bound by a 1,000-page treaty with 12,000 pages covering more than 1,400 EU laws appended to it - extends beyond unfettered trade in goods to include most services and the creation of a single labour market. In particular, the 'single passport' for financial services groups operating inside the EU will extend to the whole EEA. Banks and insurance companies will be able to operate and invest across the 17 nations. One Efta study predicted that more competition in financial services could produce consumer gains worth 1.3 per cent of combined EEA GDP, concentrated heavily in the small, more protected Efta economies. Capital and labour will, in theory, be able to circulate freely throughout the EEA, with some restrictions on direct investment in areas such as property and fisheries in the Efta countries. The Efta nations have as a result of the treaty adopted EU competition rules against monopolies, and on mergers and state aid. They also become part of a single market in public procurement, enhancing competition for government contracts throughout the area, estimated by Efta at more than Ecu600bn (Pounds 472bn) a year. The five nations have also aligned their legislation with EU company law, environment, research and development, and social policy. But the 12 and the five maintain separate agricultural regimes under the EEA, and some special provisions on fisheries, energy and transport. The mammoth negotiations leading to the EEA left these tricky latter issues as the main obstacles to Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway assuming full EU membership. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, originally conceived of the EEA as a halfway house designed to stave off enlargement until the EU had more fully integrated through the Maastricht treaty. But the realisation among Efta members that they were becoming subject to EU law without the political right to shape it prompted a rash of early membership applications. However, negotiators from the applicant countries still set store by the EEA as a building block towards full membership and a safety net if enlargement talks fail. This month and next, the most difficult negotiations have to be resolved for enlargement to go ahead in 1995. If the talks are concluded, applicant governments then face referendums, and have to persuade increasingly sceptical voters that they are not being dragooned into rule from Brussels. During this fraught period, the EEA could come into its own, as a rallying point for those wary of full membership, and as a fallback for governments which fail to sell to their electorates the charms of European Union.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputies Joseph Fignole Jean-Louis, Duckens Marc  Desrosiers, and Guerrier Compere have written to U.S. Ambassador  William Lacy Swing. Here is what their letter says:    We, deputies of the 45th Legislature and signers of this  letter, acknowledge receiving your invitation asking us to join  you at your residence on 29 March to commemorate the anniversary  of the Haitian Constitution, under which we were democratically  elected on 16 December 1990 and 20 January 1991 [date as heard]  and which we swore to respect and to enforce.    These deputies add: We formally acknowledge this initiative.  Unfortunately, we are sorry, but we are obliged to decline your  invitation for the following reasons: First, the tragic  conditions under which our people are struggling (?because of)  the daily violation of this Constitution and its basic rights do  not encourage us to party.    In addition to this, we would like to be in our respective  districts, with our voters on the occasion of 29 March. The  authors of the bloody 30 September 1991 coup d'etat, however,  block any and all steps in this direction with impunity and  leave the population no choice other than headlong flight by  thousands of boat people, turned back mercilessly regardless of  any international treaties; the wandering of hundreds of  thousands of refugees in desperate straits from the interior;  and the most complete lack of security, highlighted every day by  the bodies thrown to the animals, especially in the shantytowns  and working-class neighborhoods of our cities, write these  deputies.    On the other hand, we make it a point to assure you, Mr.  Ambassador, that any invitations that could result in a  worthwhile solution to the current crisis that has caused so  many disasters and so much mourning will be received eagerly and  with gratitude. While waiting for such a greatly desired  occasion to arise, we remain, yours truly, [signatures].    Such was the content of a letter written by Deputies Fignole  Jean-Louis of the Mirebalais district; Duckens Marc Desrosiers,  of Hinche; and Guerrier Compere, of Limonade, and sent to U.S.  Ambassador William Lacy Swing.    These are three National Front for Change and Democracy  parliamentarians who have declined the U.S. ambassador's  invitation to attend the anniversary of the Haitian Constitution  commemoration by the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince. It must  also be said that Alliance [for Parliamentary Cohesion] senators  have also declined Ambassador Swing's invitation in  Port-au-Prince.</p>

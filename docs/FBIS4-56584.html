			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico, Federal District, 4 May (EFE) -- Mexican  Judicial Police have seized 5.8 tons of marijuana worth $36  million, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office (PGR)  reported on Wednesday.    The operation was conducted in La Paz, capital of Baja  California Sur State, some 1,250 kms northeast of Mexico City.  According to the information available, the seizure was made at  a La Paz loading terminal during the inspection of a trailer  that had come from the port of Mazatlan, Sinaloa State, one of  the states with the highest incidence of narcotrafficking.  According to the driver, the truck was bound for the  California, (United States) border, where the drug would have a  commercial value of $36 million.

It has also begun investigating the prisoner's plan and  possible accomplices as well as the place of origin and the  destination of the stupefacient.</p>

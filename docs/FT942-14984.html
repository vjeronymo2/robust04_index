			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Observer: Gurria's career All those Wall Street houses assiduously courting Jose Angel Gurria, Mexico's chief debt negotiator through the 1980s, will have to call it a day  -for now. The flamboyant former finance ministry official, who has graced many a headhunter's list since he wrapped up the debt negotiations in 1990, has signalled that his considerable ambitions are currently focused on the domestic political scene. Over the weekend, he bowed out as head of the state development bank and joined the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party as secretary for international affairs. Battling along after the assassination of its presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI faces a plummeting stock market and rising interest rates. So there's no doubt it needs an effective spokesman to calm foreign concerns about Mexico's future. Fluent in at least four languages, the invariably good-humoured Gurria has charmed scores of financiers over the years. But even he, with his remarkable ability to sell a story in the worst circumstances, may be hard pushed to promote the PRI effectively. If he succeeds, and the party wins the August election, the prize should be a top job in the next administration. If not, the sirens of Wall Street will surely beckon once again.</p>

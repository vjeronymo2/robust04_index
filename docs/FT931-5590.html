			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Lloyd's prepares business plan LLOYD'S OF London is examining changes in five separate areas as part of a new business plan, Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, announced yesterday. The plan is being prepared by the new market board. Under consideration are: cost reductions and service improvement; new criteria for professional standards; measures to attract new capital; ways of developing sales in the United States, western Europe and the Far East; and ideas to deal with heavy claims arising on old insurance policies. Most of the working groups are headed by Lloyd's professionals, although Mr Paul Myners, chairman and chief executive of Gartmore, the fund manager, is leading the work on professional standards. It is expected that the plan, the first in Lloyd's 306-year history, will be complete by late April. It will advocate specific courses of action in some areas and a framework of possible options in others. Separately Mr Rowland said that the market's exposure to the bomb at the New York World Trade Centre last week would be less than Dollars 300m (Pounds 210m). Three policies - two covering property damage between Dollars 400m and Dollars 600m - and one covering liability claims between Dollars 4m and Dollars 104m - are lead by Lloyd's syndicates. London market companies also participate alongside Lloyd's syndicates on these policies.</p>

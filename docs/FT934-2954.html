			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (5): Pay first, save later - The single market and the road haulage industry Traditionally one of the most highly regulated transport sectors, the road haulage industry has undergone considerable liberalisation in recent years. The creation of the single European market, on January 1 1993, has created a new working environment, the full impact of which has still to be assessed. The removal of most border controls by customs has speeded up trans-European journey times but has also swept away a host of small freight-forwarders with their specialist skills in export documentation. The burden of handling VAT forms and compiling trade data has been passed back to the trader. Customs and Excise has estimated the cost to British business of adapting to the single market at Pounds 100m in the first year, with net annual savings of Pounds 135m likely to come through in later years. But it is not yet clear that many businesses are aware of the savings in both time and cost which can result from faster journeys. There have been complaints that hauliers have not passed on the savings that they have made and it is clear that this will come under closer scrutiny as an understanding of the new regime spreads. The advantages to the haulier of the changes are a reduction in waiting times at many borders, particularly in southern Europe, and a more efficient use of his vehicles and drivers' time. In northern Europe, though, where many countries had already streamlined their customs procedures, the savings will be less marked. One result of the formal creation of the single market has been the removal of restrictions on permits allowing hauliers to operate throughout the European Union. Many European countries had maintained highly restrictive regimes but from January 1 1993 hauliers have been issued with an authorisation which allows them to make as many international journeys as they want between member states. A second grievance which is also in the process of being alleviated relates to cabotage, the right of a haulier to pick up a load in another country and deliver to a destination in the same country. From January 1 1994, the number of cabotage authorisations available will go up from 18,530 to 30,000. This allocation will increase by 30 per cent a year from 1995, with the aim of achieving full liberalisation in July 1998. Hauliers' organisations welcome this move but say that it has been achieved only at the expense of allowing some European Union members to introduce special permits to use their motorways. Germany had refused to open its roads to outside competition until common charging had been agreed but its attempt to impose an annual DM9,000 (Pounds 3,000) on non-German trucks was outlawed as discriminatory in May 1992 by the European Court of Justice. In an agreement reached in June, the 20-year wrangle over cabotage was ended when member states gave approval for Germany and four other countries to introduce a common fee or vignette for trucks of 12 tonnes and over travelling on motorways. Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Luxembourg have said they will charge nearly Pounds 1,000 a year per vehicle for a permit to use their roads from January 1995. Operators with vehicles registered in one of these countries will have their excise duty reduced to cover all or part of the permits' cost. But operators based in other countries will get no such dispensation and so will be placed at a competitive disadvantage, the UK's Freight Transport Association (FTA) warns. By charging for permits, these north European countries will in effect be bringing themselves into line with France and Italy, where tolls are are a standard feature of motorways. And while Britain does not yet impose motorway tolls, Mr John MacGregor, transport minister, seems set on moving to charging motorists for the use of roads to help fund the government's Pounds 23bn road-building programme. The UK government favours a system of electronic tolling, probably requiring vehicles to carry a windscreen-mounted smart card which can be read at the tolling point. The Freight Transport Association says it has no objection in principle to plans for road tolls providing the funds raised are devoted to road construction. Road tolls would represent an additional cost to the haulier on top of the vehicle excise duty already paid. Duties vary sharply from country to country although the European Commission is making attempts to harmonise rates. A minimum rate of tax will apply to vehicles of 12 tonnes and over from January 1995 but the thresholds have been set so low as to have little real impact. The rate for a 38-tonne vehicle, for example, has been set at Ecu454 (Pounds 350), far below that currently levied in the UK so it will do little, if anything, to increase excise rates in the cheaper countries. The floor rates will be reviewed but that will not be until January 1988, when the transitional period ends. The UK government argued for a higher minimum threshold but says it regards the rates that have been set as a useful first stage. 'The agreement to establish floor rates marks a step towards ultimate harmonisation but only if the higher taxing states voluntarily peg back future increases,' the FTA says. Unfortunately for hauliers in countries which impose high levels of excise duty, no maximum figure has been imposed. Despite the move to liberalise the haulage industry in Europe, considerable cost differences remain between the different countries. The creation of the single market is intended to open up previously restricted local markets and road haulage is unlikely to escape this trend. The commercial pressures on the sector can only increase in the years ahead.</p>

The foreign secretary, Mr. Srinivasan, told a crowded press  conference in New Delhi today that India sought an early vote on  the resolution as it was confident that the resolution will be  defeated. While reaffirming India's readiness to continue  dialogue with Pakistan, he said there is no scope for Iran or  any other country to mediate on this issue. He said Pakistan  has failed in its third attempt to raise the issue in the  international fora. Mr. Srinivasan hoped that Islamabad will  now embark on a more constructive path of a bilateral dialogue  to settle the issues with India.    On the Iranian ambassador's suggestion at Geneva for sending  a group of ambassadors from Muslim countries to visit Kashmir,  the foreign secretary said it cannot be termed as an  international fact-finding mission. This facility is already  available as no prior permission is needed for all New  Delhi-based ambassadors except Pakistan and Libya. He pointed  out that a team of 10 ambassadors had been to Jammu and Kashmir.  They included four members of the Organization of Islamic  Countries. Mr. Srinivasan also said that there is automatic  deferment of the Pakistani resolution to the next session of the  UN Human Rights Commission as once the resolution is withdrawn,  it has to start the process anew. He said 15 countries  specifically asked Pakistan to withdraw its resolution after a  brief postponement of voting, and five of them wanted India and  Pakistan to continue their bilateral dialogue. He said the  Indian delegation had done a good job in Geneva. Replying to a  question, he said the time is not yet ripe for permitting  Amnesty International delegation to visit Kashmir as its report  on the Bombay blast was biased.    All the major political parties have expressed happiness and  satisfaction over the outcome of the Pakistani resolution in  Geneva yesterday. The Congess(I) spokesman, Mr. V.N. Gadgil,  described Islambad's withdrawal of the resolution as a  diplomatic success for India.    The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader, Mr. Murli Manohar  Joshi, congratulating the Indian delegation, urged the  government to take firm action to curb militancy in the valley.    The CPI-M [Communist Party of India-Marxist] General  Secretary, Mr. Harkishen Singh Surjeet, expressing satisfaction  over yesterday's happenings in Geneva, has called upon the  government to find a political solution to the Kashmir issue.    In a statement in New Delhi today, the National Executive of  the CPI has asked Pakistan to refrain from internationalizing  the Kashmir issue and make an honest effort to resolve it within  the framework of the Shimla Agreement.  *</p>

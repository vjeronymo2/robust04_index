			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sword-Brandishing by 'Civilian' Dictatorship"--KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  denounces the fascist suppression of patriotic students by the  Kim Yong-sam group in South Korea.    The analyst says:    Recently, the Kim Yong-sam group arrested students in  Kwangju  on charge of the violation of "the National Security Law", after  they opened photo exhibitions with several dozen pictures  showing the reality of the North at Chonnam and Choson campuses  in the period of the inaugural ceremony of the Kwangju-South  Cholla Provincial Federation of General Student Councils. This  was another fascist violence of the "civilian" dictators.    Their suppression of patriotic students who did a good thing  for national unity and reunification fully revealed their true  color of traitors who want neither unity nor reunification.    Photo exhibitions on the North had taken place even under  the  preceding military dictatorship in South Korea as part of "the  movement for gaining a correct knowledge of the North."    While talking about "reform" and "opening," the Kim Yong-sam  group is criminalizing the opening of such exhibitions. This  is, indeed, a self-contradiction.    The fact shows that "reform" and "opening" advertized by the  Kim Yong-sam group are nothing but a camouflage for deceiving  the people and that South Korea is a zone of most brutal human  rights violation and closed society of fascist dictatorship  without an equal in the world.    The Kim Yong-sam fascist group must clearly see the  situation, scrap "the National Security Law" and release the  illegally arrested patriotic students.</p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / HK re-opens inquiry into explosion HONG KONG'S attorney general has relaunched an inquiry into the explosion which killed two people at a Hong Kong power plant owned by China Light and Power (CLP) and Exxon, following accusations that the companies withheld information from the original investigation, writes Simon Davies in Hong Kong. The companies are currently facing a USDollars 125m (Pounds 83.8m) Texas court action by their former legal representative, Mr Michael Ford, who claims that he was dismissed during the original inquest after he discovered that vital evidence was being back. CLP has stated that Mr Ford's accusations are 'unfounded and wholly without merit' and has obtained an injunction in Hong Kong to prevent him from releasing information obtained during his employment by the group. However, allegations in a court petition in Alice, Texas, had put Mr Jeremy Mathews, Hong Kong's attorney general, under pressure to re-open the investigation. He yesterday issued a letter to the coroner, instructing him to act as though the initial inquiry had never been concluded.</p>

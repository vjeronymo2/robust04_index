			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Du Pont speeds up phase-out DU PONT, the US chemicals group, is accelerating the phase-out of chlorofluorocarbon production in developed countries by one year to the end of 1994, Reuter reports from Wilmington. Du Pont said in 1988 it would phase out CFC production as soon as possible. Since then, it said, alternative technologies had been developed, adequate supplies of alternatives were available, and atmospherics measurements continued to confirm that ozone losses will increase. Refrigeration and air conditioning account for almost half of CFC use. About 80 per cent of the refrigerants Du Pont sells are used to service existing equipment. Existing systems originally designed to use CFCs cannot use any known alternatives as a direct, drop-in replacement without modification or redesign. Du Pont said it expected there would be sufficient alternatives capacity worldwide for the transition.</p>

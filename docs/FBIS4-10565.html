			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hector Ordonez] </F>   [Text] General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, Armed Forces  chief, today ruled out the possibility the military will disrupt  the democratic process. Nevertheless, while Discua denies any  possibility of a coup d'etat, President Carlos Reina affirms the  report. Moreover, Discua said he would rather resign than  participate in an uprising.    The Reina administration was compelled to organize a news  conference to state its position on the prevailing fear among  U.S. human rights groups that the Armed Forces will seize power  to prevent the abolition of mandatory military service, the  privatization of Hondutel [Honduran Telecommunications  Enterprise], and the transfer of the Merchant Marine to  civilians. The curious thing is the president affirms this new  report and the alleged plot that reportedly was prepared against  him.    [Begin Reina recording] A white book must be published on  the two events, which I must interpret positively. The people  should have all the details about that unfortunate plan to end  the Honduran president's life. Second, I reassert it is a  report from human rights organizations, because, according to  those rumors, they see a threat to democratic government. [end  recording]    Other Liberal Party members have been more categorical; the  version deserves no credibility.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] We must not believe  it, much less encourage it. [end recording]    Referring to the alleged motives, the president said  Hondutel's privatization will be clear; his proposal for a  voluntary and educational military service will be presented to  Congress no later than next week; the Merchant Marine's transfer  to civilians is being discussed, and the Armed Forces have  offered no resistance.    [Begin Reina recording] I must state, however, with all the  chivalry of the world, I have had no problems with the military  in connection with strengthening of the authority the people  have delegated to the president of the Republic, who is also  commander general of the Armed Forces. [end recording]    Moments later the president and Discua attended a sports  event, and they appeared quite relaxed. The general was  categorical:    [Begin recording] [Discua] If at any moment Gen. Discua,  commander in chief of the Armed Forces, receives a proposal to  participate in this type of action, I would rather leave my post  than violate my pledge to the Constitution and the laws.    [Reina] That represents the new American military, a new  doctrine. The coups d'etat are a thing of the past. The new  military has faith in democracy, as the general has said, and  let there be no doubt he will honor that new model of a soldier.  [end recording]    Given the forceful statements by the president of the  Republic and the Armed Forces commander in chief, the  possibility the Armed Forces will obstruct the moral revolution  has been ruled out.</p>

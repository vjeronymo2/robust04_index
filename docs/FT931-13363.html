			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): An unkind cut WITHOUT any approach or warning whatsoever, my next door neighbour has informed me by letter that branches from my tree have caused damage to his garage roof and that he has had this repaired and cut my branches. He informed me that he would be sending me the bill for this work which he hoped I would pay promptly. I replied denying responsibility, saying that I had noticed for many years a tile missing from his garage roof, and that this had been caused by storm and I refused to pay. I also mentioned it would have been neighbourly for him to have spoken to me previously. Incidentally, the adjoining houses, including my accusing neighbour's, all have roof tiles missing now or have had replacements, because, I assume, of weather conditions. My neighbour has now sent me an account for Pounds 55 showing replacement of approximately seven tiles, securing six tiles and cutting my branches. My gardener says the branches would not have lifted off roof tiles or damaged them as they tend to grow away from the tiles. My neighbour also asks me to cut back branches overhanging his property at another part of our common boundary. What is your advice? Your tree will have caused both a trespass and a nuisance to the extent that branches have grown across the boundary with your neighbour. If your neighbour can prove that the damage of which he complains was caused by those branches, he is entitled to require you to pay for the repair. This is ultimately a question of fact. Your neighbour can require you to cut trespassing branches, and can cut them himself if he wishes; but he cannot charge you with the cost. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

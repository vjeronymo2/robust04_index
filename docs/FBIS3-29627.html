They will hold another  meeting of the council early next week.    At today's meeting, the LDP asserted that the public raising  of funds for political parties be limited to one-third the  amount of funds the political parties raised publicly a year  earlier and requirements for political parties raising the funds  publicly be stringently laid down. The ruling parties, however,  opposed the LDP's proposal, citing the disparities of revenues  among political parties and the impossibility of newly formed  political parties to raise the funds.    The LDP proposed at the meting of the Consultative Council  that both the ruling and opposition parties decide on the  demarcation of single-seat constituencies without entrusting all  matters to the Constituency Demarcation Deliberation Council  mandated to decide on the demarcation of single-seat  constituencies for the House of Representative and both ruling  and opposition parties decide on a bill on the demarcation of  the single-seat constituencies. In response, the ruling parties  agreed in principle to the LDP's proposal and the ruling and  opposition parties will hold another meeting of the council to  discuss ways to draft the bill.    The ruling and opposition parties also agreed to set up  subcommittees in the council and start full-fledged discussions  early next week.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The draft law on Russia's 1994 budget will  definitely be adopted in June, State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin  told Interfax on Monday. As we reported earlier, the discussion  of the draft budget had been scheduled for June 8.    To quote Rybkin, allocations will be increased by a total of  8 trillion rubles on research, military-conversion projects,  science, education, culture and social welfare.    Jointly with the government, the State Duma is looking for  additional sources of revenues, including arms exports.    Commenting on the Federation Council's recommendations to  increase military spending from 37 trillion to 55 trillion  rubles, Rybkin said: "Dreaming is no sin."    Asked about the reason behind his meeting with Yeltsin  scheduled for Tuesday, he said that it would be a routine  meeting held monthly on the first Tuesday to discuss the most  urgent issues.</p>

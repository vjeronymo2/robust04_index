Gaska: `The Winner Must Think About Future  Elections...'"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The reason for the interview  with Seimas [parliament] Deputy Kestutis Gaska was clear. He  decided not to register himself with the Lithuanian Democratic  Labor Party [LDDP] faction. This decision was a long time in  the making, and K. Gaska agreed willingly to explain the reasons  that prompted him to make this choice.    [Svirbutaviciute] To what faction do you belong now?    [Gaska] Formally, I still belong to the LDDP faction, but I  have said that I will not register with it. The question  whether I will belong to this faction in the future would be  more correct. No, I will not. Such is my inner principle -- I  can no longer stay in this faction.    [Svirbutaviciute] What are the reasons?    [Gaska] My principles, as a Seimas deputy elected from the  Varena region, do not comply with those of the LDDP faction.  The latter works in isolation. It cannot or does not want to  see anything else except the function of lawmaking. Almost all  faction members have come to the Seimas according to the list  and they do not have their constituents, with the exception of  A. Kuncinas and N. Germanas who have their own electorate. I  think that others, who do not have constant meetings with their  constituents, cannot or do not want to understand their  expectations. Their considerations are as follows: We have  been elected, we must engage in lawmaking, and that is that.  However, our constituents, who believe in the people they have  elected, do not live according to such a model. A party that  wins the elections must execute its program. Thus, the Seimas,  the government, and the constituents must make a closed circle.    [Svirbutaviciute] Would you explain the principle of  this "closed circle"...?    [Gaska] It is very simple. For example, I go to Varena and  listen to my constituents. I select their key problem that I  must raise in the Seimas, while the government must resolve it.  Unfortunately, many members of our faction do not want to hear  or know how these issues are settled. We must control the laws  and resolutions that we adopt.    [Svirbutaviciute] You work in the Seimas National  Security Committee. What are your achievements in implementing  the laws adopted by the Seimas?    [Gaska] The situation in the Lithuanian Army is really  catastrophic, due to both the lack of laws and the failure to  execute them. Gentlemen commanders ignore the law, inflict  psychological damage on young people, and cripple them. Where  are we living? Who is responsible for all of those casual and  senseless deaths? The Army is now conducting young people's  genocide. No normal mother wants her child into go to the  Lithuanian Army because it is ten times worse than the former  Soviet Army. What are we doing? Therefore, I think that my  position, as a Seimas deputy, is not adequate to the one that  prevails among the community. We are too quiet, nourished, and  pleased in the Seimas, while people see everything differently  and ask us when we will take power and begin to govern the  country. By the way, I am also interested in this. It is said  that the winner must get ready for future elections.    [Svirbutaviciute] How do you imagine the new elections  or preparations for them?    [Gaska] I think that our party leaders have secured seats  for  themselves. According to popularity ratings, there are constant  top ten activists of our party who will win seats in the next  elections as well.    I think that the LDDP will have the ensured 10 or 15 seats  always, or at least in the upcoming elections. And me? All  members of the LDDP faction council are confident that they may  be elected in the future.    [Svirbutaviciute] You were in the LDDP program group  which announced blatantly that it would work in a novel manner.  One can say today, however, that there was too much ado about  nothing....    [Gaska] Exactly. We shook LDDP's monolithic system and  exhausted ourselves. If one wants to create something, one must  reason about it. We will always be able to leave by slamming  the door loudly, but what of that? We neither ruined nor  achieved anything. The current decision of the Constitutional  Court on the free establishment of factions will enliven life in  the Seimas. The fears of the LDDP faction leaders about this  law were ungrounded. We went to the elections with one idea --  to rebuild a destroyed Lithuania. We will not run over to the  opponents' side or do everything differently. Adherence to the  principle of monolithic unity by the faction leadership is  unreasonable. Finally, internal criticism is more painful than  external criticism.... [passage omitted]    [Svirbutaviciute] Why have you chosen to work on the  National Security Committee? Why did its members in particular  begin to form the LDDP program group?    [Gaska] I wanted to work in the Foreign Affairs Committee  because I have strong family relations abroad. I am alone in  Lithuania, while two of my brothers and sisters, and my mother  live in the United States. The faction asked me not to join  this committee and choose another one. I picked the National  Security Committee, although I was also invited to the Budget  and Finance Committee. However, I chose such a virile committee  with many stormy, stubborn, and strong people. Thus, restless  people gathered in this committee. This might explain why the  LDDP program group emerged here. It is good because only  restless people can accomplish something positive. Sometimes B.  Genzelis used to reprimand me, saying: "You are restless  because you have not been appointed minister." Well, one can  say so. I really withdrew from the faction to avoid becoming a  minister. However, politics do not end here. Who knows who  will come to power in three years? K. Gaska might become  minister in the new government as well. Life does not end  today. Eventually, I had no aim to become minister. Our goal  was to disturb the quiet life of our faction. Thus, four of us  from this committee undertook this initiative.    [Svirbutaviciute] Unfortunately, you failed to  implement everything....    [Gaska] We may succeed in the future. I believe that there  are no less than 1 million people in Lithuania who will need a  left-wing party. Our goal is to fight for their votes.</p>

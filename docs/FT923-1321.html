			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / A hard act to follow: The Bundesbank is a model, but difficult to imitate 'The central bank is fully sovereign in its relationship with the government; it is responsible only to itself. We have a body which is responsible to no one, neither to a parliament, nor to a government' - Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, 1956. After the bruising, losing tussle against the D-Mark and the pound's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism, the British government is searching for a new economic nostrum. Can the German Bundesbank, the bogeyman of the sterling debacle, provide, after all, a source of salvation? In parliament, the press and the City, there is growing support for placing British monetary policy in the hands of a reformed Bank of England, geared to price stability, and guaranteed Bundesbank-style independence. This could be the centrepiece of what Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, calls, with deliberate emphasis, a new 'British' monetary policy. He wants to maintain a low inflation rate - but above all, as yesterday's 1 percentage point interest rate cut showed, Mr Lamont wants to end the recession. Britain and other countries can certainly learn from the experience of a central bank which has vitally contributed to post-war German stability and prosperity. As the institution which sets the direction of interest rates throughout Europe, the Bundesbank has influence that runs well beyond Germany's enlarged borders. However, even if the government adopted the goal of an independent central bank, building a British Bundesbank on the clay of Threadneedle Street would be a daunting - perhaps impossible - task. A combination of the Bundesbank's legal statutes and a succession of tough-minded presidents has given the Bundesbank a unique reputation for standing up to governments at home and abroad. It has shown craft, professionalism and pragmatism in pursuing its statutory aim - the same as that of the 1939 Reichsbank - of 'safeguarding the currency'. All this has contributed to the bank's own powerful mythology - an important reinforcement of its credibility on financial markets. Venerated for its orthodoxy, vilified for its obstinacy, the Bundesbank is deity and demon combined. Last week's hints of a sterling devaluation by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, have made him - in the eyes of Whitehall, as well as the British tabloid press - the villain of the currency drama. Mr Schlesinger has been undiplomatic, but he has also been doing his job. Under the 1957 Bundesbank Law, the bank has to guard the value of Germany's currency - not that of anyone else's. The Bundesbank is a product of German history: of this century's tortuous cycle, twice played out, of war and defeat, inflation and recovery. Drawing on traditions and personnel of the Reichsbank, the post-war central bank was established in 1948 by the western allies as the Bank deutscher Lander. It was independent from the German government primarily because, in 1948, there was no German government. In 1951, work started on transforming the Bank deutscher Lander into the Bundesbank. After several years of tortuous deliberations, the 1957 Bundesbank Law centralised some aspects of the bank's decision-making. But today's federal structure - above all, the regional make-up of the 18-man policy-making council - is the basic result of post-war US efforts to break up the centrally controlled apparatus of Nazi power. The Bundesbank's anti-inflation track record makes it a model for many nations. Yet the conditions which have fostered the Bundesbank cannot easily be reproduced elsewhere. Even in Germany, the decision 35 years ago to make money creation the responsibility of an independent institution caused a political battle. Chancellor Adenauer, who once summoned the Bank deutscher Lander council to Bonn to try to forestall an interest rate rise, opposed the bank's independence. The Bundestag, however, passed the law because the German people had twice seen - in the 1923 hyperinflation, and again in 1945-48 - how utterly politicians could wipe out the value of money. The UK's experience of currency debauchery, by contrast, has been more gradual. Perhaps only a country which has weathered Germany's traumatic experiences can maintain a public consensus permitting unpopular monetary policies to be run by unelected officials. For Britain, the chastening lesson of the past two years of ERM membership is that the post-war German consensus in favour of fiscal orthodoxy has broken down under the financial strain of reunification. Yet the Bundesbank's monetary orthodoxy - if anything, buttressed after the bank's disagreements with the government over German monetary union two years ago - remains as strong as ever. The clash between large German public deficits and the Bundesbank's anti-inflation rectitude accounts for high D-Mark interest rates over the past two years, and hence Britain's ERM exit. Even if the Bank of England were made independent, a future governor would need considerable time before he could equal the stature of a Bundesbank president. When he speaks, a German central banker combines the moral authority of a high priest with the fire-power of a general. 'There can be no hard currency without hard measures,' warned Mr Karl Blessing, the Bundesbank's first president. Both Mr Schlesinger and Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank's president between 1980 and 1991, have done their best to play down the Bundesbank's power. Recalling how the most celebrated of his predecessors, Mr Hjalmar Schacht, twice president of the pre-war Reichsbank, carried greater weight than many German chancellors, Mr Pohl would remark: 'The Bundesbank is not a shadow government.' Mr Schlesinger says, with justification, 'Our independence depends on our ability not to overstep our limits.' The Bundesbank's power is indeed limited, in legal terms, to its ability to raise and lower interest rates without taking 'instructions' from Bonn. In other matters - including the fixing of exchange rates, where the Bundesbank thought the D-Mark conversion terms in German monetary union were far too generous - it can be overruled by the government. The main reason for Mr Pohl's resignation last year was, indeed, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's failure to heed his advice on German monetary unification. In the mainstream monetary policy area, the Bundesbank has defended its ground with determination. The Reichsbank, by contrast (particularly after 1939), was almost totally subservient to Hitler. Independence, however, has never been seen as a panacea. When the Reichsbank was made autonomous from the German government in 1922, Mr Rudolf Havenstein, the hapless Reichsbank president, wrote presciently: 'For limiting inflation, today's autonomy of the Reichsbank is but a very small expedient.' Next year, the consumer price index rose nearly 2,000 billion-fold. In 1933, when Hitler took power, the Reichsbank was still nominally independent. The Fuhrer brought in a man of his choice, Mr Schacht, as president - paying off Mr Hans Luther, the incumbent, with the ambassadorship to Washington. Bloodied by political in-fighting though it may occasionally be, the Bundesbank is an organism which governments fight at their peril. Three chancellors - Mr Ludwig Erhard, Mr Kurt Georg Kiesinger and Mr Helmut Schmidt - owe their downfall to the Bundesbank's stern monetary policies. One example was the role of Mr Blessing in the 1966 eclipse of Chancellor Erhard. A former Reichsbanker and Nazi party member who under Mr Schacht was in charge of monetary union with Austria in the 1938 Anschluss, Mr Blessing quickly found his feet - like many former Reichsbank functionaries - in the new democracy. After the Bundesbank's high interest rates helped topple Mr Erhard - a man who had helped to foster Mr Blessing's post-war career - the one-time protege admitted he had used 'brute force to put things in order'. Although ensconced on Europe's monetary throne, the Bundesbank is not without rivals who seek to pull it down. The EC's plan for economic and monetary union (Emu) is not, as Lord Ridley, then UK secretary of state for industry, remarked in 1990 with grandiose failure of perception, 'a German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe'. Rather, it is an attempt, led by France and Italy, to emasculate the Bundesbank by subsuming the D-Mark into a single European currency. The Bundesbank has long mounted a campaign to sabotage the plan. If, as a large majority of German voters now appears to want, Emu does not happen, the Bundesbank will not weep. 'We can very well live with the status quo,' was Mr Pohl's laconic comment in 1989. Mr Schlesinger said frankly in 1990 that his country would have neither the time nor the energy to carry out simultaneously German and European monetary union. By the time that the 125th anniversary of the Reichsbank is commemorated in the year 2000, the Bundesbank will surely be there to join in the celebrations.

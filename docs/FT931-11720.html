			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bank of East Asia exceeds expectations BANK of East Asia, Hong Kong's third-largest listed banking group, has announced a 36 per cent increase in net profits to HKDollars 685.3m (USDollars 89m) for 1992, up from HKDollars 504.4m a year earlier. The profit figure, after transfers to the bank's inner reserves, was above market expectations due to unexpectedly high non-banking earnings. The bank operations reported a 28 per cent increase in profits, aided by unusually wide interest rate margins and a higher rate of growth in both deposits and loans. Bank of East Asia is the first of Hong Kong's banks to announce its 1992 results, and analysts are anticipating a sector average of close to 30 per cent growth in net profit. Mr David Li, chief executive, predicted an improved performance from the banks in 1993. The sector has been hit by a government-imposed ceiling of 70 per cent on mortgage financing, but this is expected to be revoked as a result of lower property prices. Bank of East Asia proposed a final dividend of 52.5 cents a share, making a full-year pay-out of 80 cents a share in 1992, compared with 62.5 cents in the previous year. Malayan Banking (Maybank), Malaysia's biggest bank, has announced pre-tax profits in the six months to December 31 1992 of MDollars 346.53m (USDollars 138.6m), a 27 per cent rise on the MDollars 272.1m reported for the corresponding period in 1991, Kieran Cooke reports from Kuala Lumpur. Mr Ahmad Mohamad Don, managing director, said the bank expected to maintain its profitability in the second half, even though the Malaysian economy was showing signs of slowing down. Total customer deposits stood at MDollars 35.2bn at the end of the reporting period, a 28 per cent increase over the 1991 figure. Loans and advances stood at MDollars 33.8bn, a 10 per cent increase on 1991.</p>

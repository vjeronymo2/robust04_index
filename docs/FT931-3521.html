			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Cutting support for consultancy - In a Nutshell The government is to cut subsidies for the Enterprise Initiative Consultancy Scheme, which provides consultancy help in fields such as marketing, quality and design, Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said. Support will be reduced from two-thirds to half of the cost to businesses in assisted and urban programme areas and from half to one third of the cost elsewhere, with effect from March 24. When the consultancy scheme ends, as planned, in March 1994, it will be replaced with a programme delivered locally through 'one-stop shops' and Training and Enterprise Councils, Heseltine said last week in a written answer to a parliamentary question. The new programme will consist of a diagnostic service, a consultancy brokerage and continuation 'in some form' of consultancy support and technology-related advice.</p>

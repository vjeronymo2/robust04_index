			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Northwest Airlines drops first-class seats Northwest Airlines, the fourth biggest US carrier, and its European partner KLM Royal Dutch Airlines yesterday joined the growing number of international airlines to abolish first-class travel. Passengers using the two airlines will now have a choice between only two classes of service: economy class, and a premium service called world business class, an upgraded version of the old business class service. The main feature of the service will be a seat pitch (the distance between seats) of 48 inches, giving passengers about 25 per cent more legroom than other airlines offer in conventional business class cabins. The usual business class seat pitch is 38 - 40 inches. The only airlines offering more room to business class passengers will be those that have already abolished first-class travel - Virgin Atlantic of the UK and Continental Airlines of the US, both of which have seat pitches of 55 inches. Airlines are moving towards the abolition of first-class accommodation because of the proportion of fare-paying passengers using it has declined in the cost-conscious 1990s. Many people occupying first-class seats are airline employees or passengers enjoying complimentary upgrades. Carriers believe they can make more money from their aircraft by merging first class with business class and filling the space with passengers attracted by higher levels of comfort and service.</p>

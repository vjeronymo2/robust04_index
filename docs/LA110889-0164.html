			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUDD RETURNS TO BRITAIN, WON'T COMPETE AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL  </P> <P> Zola Budd returned to Britain today for the first time since fleeing to South  Africa at the point of anti-apartheid protests and said it is good to be back  under much different circumstances.  </P> <P> She also said she could never run for Britain again because of political  pressures.  </P> <P> "I don't see myself competing at the international level again, and certainly  not for Britain," Budd said. "The political situation and pressure involved  would make it impossible for me to even think of running for Britain again. It  would be out of the question.  </P> <P> "The political situation is changing in South Africa, but I think it will be a  long time before it affects sport."  </P> <P> Budd, described as an emotional wreck when she left her suburban home for her  native Bloemfontein in May, 1988, looked relaxed and cheerful as she arrived to  promote her autobiography, "Zola."  </P> <P> "It's nice to come back without feeling under pressure," Budd said.  </P></p>

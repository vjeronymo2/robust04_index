			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Lilley takes shine off City bonuses City firms accustomed to paying high-flying dealers with diamonds or cases of Chateau Lafite to avoid National Insurance contributions will now have to search for even more imaginative loopholes in the law. From midnight last night, gemstones and a range of alcoholic drinks will be treated as payments of earnings, liable for National Insurance contributions, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, announced yesterday. This could include favourites such as Chateau Lafite 1990 retailing at about Pounds 700 a case or, perhaps, Chateau Pichon la Lande, which sells for Pounds 400 a case, according to one wine broker who has supplied wine for city bonuses. The move, expected to save the exchequer about Pounds 50m a year, is the latest attempt to close loopholes which have enabled mostly large City firms to avoid paying the 10.2 per cent employers' contributions on bonus payments. It follows action by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in the last Budget to prevent gold bars and other tradeable commodities being used to avoid contributions, saving an estimated Pounds 70m a year. The government has previously acted to prevent gilts and shares in other companies being paid to avoid tax. Mr Lilley said yesterday: 'Companies and their accountant advisers who devise ways of paying earnings which avoid their liability for National Insurance contributions will find it increasingly unattractive to produce and operate such schemes. 'These regulations are clear evidence of the government's intention to act speedily to close National Insurance loopholes.' Officials are thought to have uncovered about 50 schemes involving diamonds or fine wines. These escaped the budget measures because they were not traded on a recognised exchange. The Royal Bank of Canada has assisted customers making diamond-backed payments by enabling gems to be bought and sold without leaving Switzerland, thus avoiding the payment of value added tax. It said yesterday: 'The operation, which was only a very small part of our business will no longer apply.' Accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which advises clients on how to limit tax bills, said: 'These schemes were attractive mainly to City firms paying large bonuses to individual staff, rather than the run-of-mill bonus schemes.'</p>

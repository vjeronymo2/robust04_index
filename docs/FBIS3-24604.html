Analysis of the plasmid profiles indicated an absence of  plasmids 45-54 TPN in size in several mutants. From studying  these mutants, the authors were able to identify the plasmids  containing the genes for lactose, sucrose, and fructose  fermentation in these microorganisms. Two strains, L.  lactis lactis 90 and L. lactis cremoris ROM,  were identified in which the mutants, deficient in lactose  utilization, experienced phage resistance spectrum changes; in  both cases, the changes consisted of the appearance of phage  sensitivity with respect to various phages. In L. lactis  lactis 90, the genes corresponding to lactose utilization  and the genes participating in phage resistance control were  apparently located on the 53.7 TPN plasmid. This work was  completed, in part, with resources supplied by the Russian State  Scientific and Technical Program ``Priority Directions in  Genetics.''

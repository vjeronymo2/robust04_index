			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 1 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu said here on Friday that the just-adopted  statement of the U.N. Security Council president constitutes a  strong message to North Korea over the nuclear question.    In a press conference at the Watergate Hotel where he was  staying, Han said the statement would be a "tremendous pressure"  on North Korea especially because China is supposed to take part  in next-phase steps set to be taken if North Korea does not heed  the message.    "The statement is highly significant in that it was  unanimously approved by the whole 15 member nations of the  Security Council," Han said. He was on a visit here to discuss  nuclear-related follow-up steps with Washington officials.    On the deadline for North Korea's acceptance of additional  inspections, Han said the statement did not give it but Hans  Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA), reported that there should be additional IAEA  inspections within six months.    Discussing the background that led China to change its  initial stand and agree to include a clause on additional steps  in the statement, Han said President Kim Yong-sam's talks with  the Chinese leadership during his recent visit to Beijing, had  paid off.    "There were communications between South Korea and China  during the Security Council meeting, too," Minister Han said.    China, Han said, gave word that it would play a role in  support of Korean peninsula's denuclearization and peace and  stability on the peninsula.    "China expressly showed it (through deeds) by supporting the  statement," Minister Han said.</p>

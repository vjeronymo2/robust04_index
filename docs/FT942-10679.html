			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Estonian protest at 'invasion threat' Mr Juri Luik, the Estonian foreign minister, yesterday accused Russia of threatening to invade his country by issuing veiled warnings that the former Soviet garrison in the Baltic republic might be reinforced. Speaking at a meeting of the Western European Union (WEU) in Luxembourg, he called the Russian statements 'unacceptable if not ludicrous' and said they should be denounced by the international community as open intimidation. He was referring to a statement last Friday by General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, that Moscow could 'provide reliable security' for its bases in Estonia if political circumstances changed. Estonia was one of nine nations from the former eastern bloc admitted yesterday as 'associate partners' in the WEU, the loosely-knit defence grouping which is gradually acquiring strength. The new status will give the ex-communist countries consultation rights at the WEU but no defence guarantees. It marks an important step for the European Union as it tries to strengthen its political and military ties with eastern Europe and the Baltic states without alienating Russia. All six states - including the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania - as well as the Baltic trio are being treated as future EU members. Talks between Russia and Estonia about withdrawing the 2,600-strong garrison broke down last week and Moscow said it would not name a date for renewing them until the Baltic republic came up with more 'constructive' proposals. The main sticking point has been the rights of 'retired' Russian officers in Estonia, seen by the Baltic republic as a potential cover for the retention of a covert military and intelligence presence.</p>

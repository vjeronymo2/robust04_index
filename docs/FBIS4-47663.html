			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Rwandan Patriotic Front  [RPF] secretary general, Major Theogene Rudasingwa, has appealed  to the UN to send a replacement for Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh,  the UN representative to Rwanda. Dr. Rudasingwa told the Voice  of America radio reporter that Dr. Roger Booh-Booh did not have  the capacity to handle the political crisis in Rwanda. Just  before the war, Roger Booh-Booh openly advocated the inclusion  of CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic] in the  broad-based transitional assembly, knowing very well that the  CDR was aiming and had the intention of exterminating the Tutsi  people and all those who did not support the then government of  Habyarimana.</p>

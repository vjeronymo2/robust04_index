			<p>CSO     [Text] Munich (Reuter). Three leading electronics  companies--Siemens AG of Germany, Toshiba of Japan, and IBM of  the United States--are notably expanding their cooperation in  the development of computer storage chips. Siemens of Munich  reports that the three companies want to begin immediately to  develop the second generation 64-MB chips jointly. The three  companies have been working together since 1992 on the current  developmental step--the 256-MB chip. The same companies have  been cooperating in other electronics fields for a long time.    The dynamic 64-MB read/write memory is to be developed in  the  IBM laboratories in East Fishkill, New York, and in Essex  Junction, Vermont. The participating companies will share in the  costs. A Siemens spokesman indicates that the costs will  probably come to several hundred million German marks [DM]. The  experience gained in the ongoing cooperative work on the 256-Mb  chip will enrich the new cooperative venture.    Siemens reports further that a first working model of the  new  64-MB chip is to be ready as early as 1996. The chip can be  expected to appear on the market in 1997. Its storage capacity  will be able to hold the text content of more than 2,000 typed  pages. Currently, the computer market is still dominated by the  two-generations older 4-MB chip.    Siemens and Toshiba have been working together since their  joint development of the 1-MB chip, standard cells, and the  so-called "gate arrays." IBM is involved in a joint venture with  Toshiba in Japan on the production of flat color screens. The  same two companies are also cooperating in flash-storage  technology. To date, cooperation between the three companies has  been limited to the development of the 256-MB chip.    IBM and Siemens are also jointly developing the first  generation 64-MB chip, the first working model of which was  shown last autumn. The only cooperative production venture  between IBM and Siemens is in the case of the 16-MB chip.  According to Siemens, further cooperation in semiconductor  production has only been discussed in general terms, with no  specific projects named.</p>

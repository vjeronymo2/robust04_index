			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Tension over the future of Hong Kong deepens: UK-China documents show difficult negotiations THE TENSION between Britain and China over the future of Hong Kong deepened yesterday with the publication by both governments of previously secret diplomatic exchanges on the development of democracy in the colony. Britain took the unusual step of publishing messages which passed in 1990 between Chinese officials and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, to back up its denial that Britain had broken a secret agreement, as was alleged in an angry outburst from Beijing last week. China released the documents after hearing London would. Official news agency Xinhua said they showed Mr Patten's proposals on elections to be held in 1995 'run counter to the understanding reached by the Chinese and British sides through diplomatic consultations'. The documents concern arrangements for Hong Kong's political structure as China neared completion of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution. They provide an insight into the difficult negotiations on Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Mr Hurd's attempts to win an increase in the number of directly elected seats to the Legislative Council, the colony's parliament, were met with frosty replies from Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister - couched in the language of diplomacy. Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, said: 'What they make abundantly plain is that there was no secret deal on the future political development of Hong Kong between the British government and the Chinese government.' Beijing has warned of turmoil in Hong Kong if Mr Patten pushes ahead with his proposal that a committee, due to appoint 10 members of the Legislative Council in 1995, should itself be popularly elected. Mr Patten proposes broadening the voting base for other indirectly elected seats, but has not sought more directly elected seats. It was on the composition of the election committee that Lu Ping, the senior Beijing official responsible for Hong Kong affairs, alleged a secret understanding. He threatened to reverse the measures and said they contravene the Basic Law. In one message, Mr Hurd says: 'I agree in principle with the arrangements for an electoral committee, which could be established in 1995.' British officials said the committee's composition was a side issue, that the Basic Law did not include understandings on the subject as Britain had hoped, and that the question of 1995 electoral arrangements remained open after the exchanges. The focus was on directly elected seats. To a request from Mr Hurd on an increase in these, Qian said 'the Chinese side cannot bring itself to agree to the foreign secretary's proposal.' Mr Hurd said if changes were not made, there would be resignations from the executive and legislative councils. China's claim of secret HK deal, Page 4</p>

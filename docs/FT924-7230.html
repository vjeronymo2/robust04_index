			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Elections postponed in Kenya THE Kenyan authorities yesterday formally postponed the first multi-party elections in 26 years from December 7 until December 29, Reuter reports from Nairobi. The delay follows a High Court ruling last week upholding an appeal by opposition groups for more time to nominate candidates to challenge President Daniel arap Moi's 13-year-rule. The new date was announced in a terse statement by the Electoral Commission, which has been accused by opposition groups of bending the rules to favour Mr Moi.</p>

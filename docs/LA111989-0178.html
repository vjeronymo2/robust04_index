			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> REDSKINS' 5-FOOT-8 CORNERS WON'T ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE SOLD SHORT  </P> <P> The Washington Redskins' brand-new starting pair of pint-sized cornerbacks  survived Randall Cunningham last Sunday.Few thought they'd survive training  camp, so their ascension to first string is truly surprising.  </P> <P> One of them, 5-foot-8 Anthony Johnson, is a particularly bold rookie. Regular  starter Darrell Green used to gather the secondary in a semicircle before every  practice and deliver a pep talk or entertaining story, and naturally the  get-together was canceled the day after Green dislocated his wrist. But  22-year-old Johnson jutted out his chest the second day and said, "Come on,  come on. Everybody up, everybody up."  </P> <P> Nobody budged. "He thinks he's Vince Lombardi," said free safety Todd Bowles.  "But no one pays him any mind."  </P> <P> The other cornerback, 5-8 Martin Mayhew, used to telephone his broker during  lulls in training camp. Mayhew successfully partnered Deion Sanders in the  Florida State secondary two years ago, but lasted through the 10th round of the  1988 draft because some teams thought he preferred banking to football. The son  of a school principal, he actually prefers law. "I'm really thinking about  going to law school," he said. "But, hey, I want to play as long as I can."  </P> <P> Few felt these two would be administering bump-and-run technique for the  Redskins in November, but a series of circumstances has left them starters with  Denver's John Elway looming Monday night. Green and Brian Davis began the year  at the corners, but Green's injury against Tampa Bay -- coupled with Johnson's  tender ankle -- left Barry Wilburn starting opposite Davis.  </P> <P> Wilburn then went inactive two weeks ago after sources said he had tested  positive for cocaine. That elevated Johnson, and Mayhew was then promoted over  a struggling Davis last week. "I wouldn't have predicted this," secondary coach  Emmitt Thomas said.  </P> <P> The most amazing fact is that the Redskins were the NFL's 26th-rated secondary  before all-pro Green went down, and now rank 17th. Thomas and others say a lot  has to do with Washington's improved pass rush (Manley had three sacks Sunday).  Moreover, the secondary has operated the last three weeks against ineffective  quarterbacks -- the Raiders' Jay Schroeder (after Steve Beuerlein burned them  early), Dallas's Steve Walsh and Philadelphia's Cunningham.  </P> <P> Cunningham, a threat to pass and run, is certainly no lightweight, and Johnson  and Mayhew's coverage was sticky enough. But without dangerous wide receiver  Mike Quick, Cunningham throws more to his running backs, and the Redskins'  offense kept the defense fresh by possessing the ball 37 minutes.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, it was Johnson's second league start and Mayhew's first, and it  seems incomprehensible that they helped hold Cunningham to 177 yards passing  considering he threw for 447 against the unit including Green and Davis in Week  2.  </P> <P> Davis may yet have his day. First he was losing jump balls to receivers (New  York's Odessa Turner, notably) and then he was burned by pinpoint passes (to  Phoenix's J.T. Smith, prominently). Only Green is faster, only Green can  anticipate better, but Davis was benched last week for Mayhew.  </P> <P> Redskins coaches will continue to deploy Davis in a nickel-back role with the  hope that an interception or two will improve his confidence.  </P> <P> That's not a problem with Johnson, who's garrulous and unafraid. On one Eagles  run play Sunday, he decked Keith Byars at the line and asked defensive  signal-caller Bowles to let him take on more runners. "He wanted more force  calls, and Todd didn't give him any," Mayhew said.  </P> <P> Said Bowles: "Like his 100 pounds against Byars would work every time. You just  had to laugh. He's a clown. He reminds me of Darrell Green a little bit, the  way he acts. He's always saying something funny. It's his first year, and he's  starting, and he keeps it fun for me."  </P> <P> With a little more seniority, Johnson could be accepted as a leader, given his  tendencies. While playing at Southwest Texas State, he and a teammate were  lined up on the right side to block a field goal but Johnson saw the opponents  were a man short on the left side, so he dragged his partner to the other side  and blocked the kick from over there. "Good to hear," Redskins special-teams  coach Wayne Sevier said.  </P> <P> Mayhew is 24, but silent and thoughtful. After studying his Redskins playbook,  he crams for the Law School Admissions Test he'll take in January. His goal,  besides starting these last six games, is a career in corporate law.  </P> <P> Drafted last year by Buffalo, he fractured a wrist and spent the entire season  on injured reserve. The Bills left him unprotected following the season, but he  said they begged him to stay. Being a finance major, he took Washington's  generous offer of a $65,000 signing bonus instead.  </P> <P> With the money, he said he did the following: bought a three-month certificate  of deposit and three months later turned it into a land purchase with his  father in Fort Lauderdale; bought two mutual funds; bought a stereo; bought his  mother a car after hers caught fire; put the rest in a money-market account.  </P> <P> He's good with numbers, and fortunately he curtailed wide receiver Ron  Johnson's totals on Sunday. He was beaten on one fly pattern by Carlos Carson,  mistiming his leap for the ball, but escaped when Carson dropped it. Cunningham  completed a total of three passes on him.  </P> <P> A native of Tallahassee, he was not widely known in high school. At Florida  State, Sanders got by on speed, Mayhew on never-ending work. Their only loss in  1987 was to Miami when Michael Irvin raced by Mayhew for a key touchdown, but  the introspective Mayhew never pouted. "There probably aren't two people in the  world who thought he could play pro ball," his Seminoles secondary coach,  Mickey Andrews, said. "There probably aren't two that thought he could play  college. But Martin was one of them."  </P> <P> The greatest challenge for loud Johnson and quiet Mayhew is now Elway on Monday  night. "We'll know better this week," Thomas said.  </P></p>

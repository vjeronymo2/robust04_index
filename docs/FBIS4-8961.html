			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Tomislav Ivanovski: "Athens Sets Fire to the </F> Balkans"]    [Text] After two successive incidents on the  Albanian-Greek border, there appears to be a fine and precise  plan for kindling a fire, slowly but surely, under the  militarily, politically, and economically fragile and insecure  situation in this part of Europe, which threatens to ignite the  Balkan barrel of gunpowder. The two incursions by Greek  commandos into Albanian territory, in which several Albanian  soldiers were killed or injured, will not change the borders  between the two states or liberate "Northern Epirus." They  simply reveal the policy of Athens' socialist government of  PASOK [Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement] and Papandreou,  demonstrate the social and political climate in the Greek state,  and heat up the overall situation in the region, in which a war  has been waged on the territories of former Yugoslavia for over  two years.    In its recognizably arrogant and cynical style, official  Athens refused to accept the Albanian reactions, accusing Tirana  of "creating unnecessary tension in bilateral relations"! The  Athens Government is blaming a certain "Northern Epirus Front"  (that is how Athens describes southern Albania) for carrying out  the entire operation out of revenge for the "bad position" of  the Greek minority in Albania, and also because that piece of  the Balkans is in Albania and not Greece! In some Athens  newspapers this "Front" is still threatening new operations.    This should now serve as an alibi for Papandreou's state  and,  according to its loudspeakers, the whole affair should stop  here. For its part, official Tirana has threatened to use its  right to "employ the same measures," and has asked the Security  Council to condemn Athens for the incident. No matter how  understandable the Albanian reaction is, the whole case is also  a kind of warning to Athens. It has been noted that Albania,  under the pretext of taking care of "its brothers," is  interfering in the internal affairs and issues of neighboring  countries, unreservedly accepting the positions of "its  brothers," and not those of the authorities of the countries  where they live as a minority. Tirana's direct interference in  the affairs of [the Party of Democratic Prosperity] the party of  the Albanians in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM], and particularly its involvement in the  arms affair in which some of its members were implicated can  easily produce similar situations and cause bloody incidents  with even more terrifying consequences.    The tragic incident on the Albanian-Greek border, however,  cannot and must not be put to the sidelines, because it forces  the question that has been hanging in the air for some time --  where will this behavior of Athens politicians lead, and what  else can be expected? Ultimately, even if we accept Athens'  claim that the government has nothing to do with the commandos'  actions, it is still responsible for the creation of a climate  of nationalism, chauvinism, hatred, and revenge, together with  the desire to occupy foreign territories. That is the new  reality that amazes all those who, until just recently, naively  believed that there is democracy today in the place that gave  birth to the word democracy.    By making dangerous provocations in its surroundings (except  for the Former Yugoslav Republic [FYR] of Serbia, which will be  probably left for the final phase), Athens is creating hotbeds  of crisis by setting the Balkan peninsula on fire, which has  been made particularly explicit after the old, capricious, and  extremely vain Papandreou resumed his seat on the prime  minister's chair. Within a very short time he had succeeded in  heating up his state with the imposition of the "Macedonian  question" as promoted by the previous government after the  proclamation of the independence of the Republic of Macedonia  and after the report of the Badinter Commission. By deceiving  the electorate last October by saying that the world would not  accept the "new state" in the Balkans without the agreement of  Athens, that he would easily change its name, and that all  "Greece's friends" were on his side, Papandreou easily won the  elections. Nevertheless, in the disturbed Greek economy,  sustained by European Community money, instead of enthusiasm he  has introduced nationalism and chauvinism, and instead of  getting his citizens back to work, he sends them to meetings  where they hysterically threaten to protect their allegedly  imperiled hellenism even by force.    Nonetheless, the world and Europe, which never tried to hide  its feeling of dissatisfaction after PASOK and Papandreou  returned to power, have no understanding of Greek nationalism,  and they have not only recognized, but also started to help the  Republic of Macedonia. The response of the narcissistic prime  minister and his family was to introduce the embargo against  Macedonia and to threaten the Balkans, Europe, and the whole  world that he would do his best to destroy the state on his  northern border if it refused to give in to his blackmail.  According to the plan, Macedonia should be economically  destroyed, which would cause a range of social disruptions and  the destabilization of the present authorities. These would then  be replaced by an extreme nationalist group, which would cause a  conflict between the Macedonians and the Albanians resulting in  the destruction of the state and the subsequent division of the  country between Greece and the Serbia, and later, perhaps,  between others in the Balkans. The Athens politicians thus want  to close the Macedonian file forever and bury the Macedonian  national question once and for all on their territory.    Milosevic's state was the first to be caught in this trap,  because it wished to settle some old accounts, but there are  also others who, although elevated to pluralists and democrats  overnight, still cannot stop dreaming of the past and unrealized  dreams. Sofia, for instance, is constantly being offered a  return to the good old days of the late 1970's, when Zhivkov and  Papandreou had monthly meetings, and as compensation it is being  offered the construction of a road across Pirin Macedonia to the  FYR Serbia and Romania. On the other hand, Bucharest is being  offered "support and understanding" for its serious problems  with the large Hungarian (and Catholic) minority, by promoting a  new Orthodox brotherhood. At the same time, they are all scared  of the "Albanian question" and Kosovo, of the Muslim world and  Turkey, accused of planning to reconstruct the Ottoman Empire,  although it is Athens that insists that the Aegean is a "Greek  sea," and that the whole of Cyprus is a part of hellenism!    Living constantly in an atmosphere of extreme nationalist  feelings, it is no wonder that a group of "crazies" has  appeared, demanding justice and corrections to "historical  errors" on the territory of a foreign state, and murdering  foreign citizens. That is why the irresponsible reactions of  Athens irritate, because it does not even want to dissociate  itself from the deed, let alone condemn it. What will happen if  such "crazy" groups enter Macedonia, Bulgaria, or Turkey, and  what if they respond with the same measures as Tirana is now  threatening to do?    Apparently, Papandreou does not care about that. The main  thing is that he has finally shown his partners in Europe and  NATO that he can do whatever he likes, and that they can do  practically nothing. He is sending the army to the northern  borders to intimidate Macedonia and make a mockery of Europe.  He recommends to the Greek lobby in the United States and  Canada that Greek terrorist actions in Australia, where  Macedonian houses of culture and churches were torched, may also  take place in their countries. It seems as though Papandreou  does not want to change his image as a tough nationalist, and so  nothing more can be expected of him. The way that he is, and  the way that he is pushing his state and the Balkans into a  crisis more dangerous than the one 82 years ago will not change  even if Macedonia accepts his ultimatums. At a certain moment  he will probably satisfy his vanity, but the next moment he will  think of something else to keep his neighborhood in constant  tension. Unfortunately, that is the essence of his Balkan  policy.</p>

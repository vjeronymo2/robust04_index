			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / International Company News: Stora turns in steep profits fall STORA, Europe's largest paper and pulp group, yesterday announced a steep fall in profits for the first four months of 1992 following a drop in sales from SKr18.3bn (Dollars 3.18bn) to SKr16.2bn. Profits after net financial items for the four months were SKr3m compared with SKr901m for the same period of 1991. The company warned it would suffer a loss in the second four-month period but it added that a continuation of Stora's rationalisation programme to cut costs combined with an improved market should enable profits to improve for the final four months of 1992. Stora said it hopes the full impact of its cutbacks would be apparent by the latter part of this year with estimated savings of around SKr2bn, mainly due to a 6,000 cut in the company's 45,000 workforce. The company blamed three factors for the sharp fall in sales and profits. Firstly, there were sharp price cuts in most forestry industry related products, the result of severe competition in a depressed market which had produced a loss of SKr1.2bn. Secondly, construction-related revenues fell SKr300m due to the slump in the building industry with resulting falls in volume sales and price cutting. Thirdly, there was a decline in the company's net financial items as a result of lower interest differentials caused by the linking of the Swedish kroner to the European currency unit (Ecu) in May 1991. In its analysis of current markets, Stora said there was continued favourable growth in its forest industries sector with a 2.5 per cent increase in deliveries during the first four months of pulp, paper and board, while deliveries of sawn timber rose by 28 per cent. The company made actual operating losses in the first four months of SKr149m in pulp and SKr119m in printing papers, compared with profits of SKr56m and SKr226m respectively. Stora's operating profit for packaging board and paper was SKr465m, against SKr470m. Discussing its financial position, the company said its total interest-bearing net debt fell by SKr555m to SKr24.2bn by the end of April. Esselte, the office equipment group, has reported a steep increase in profits for the first four months of 1992, despite reduced turnover. After net financial items, profits jumped to SKr140m from SKr63m a year ago. Sales were SKr4.49bn, against SKr5.31bn. Esselte expects to achieve profits after net financial items of SKr350m for the full year. Hit by heavy restructuring costs the group made a loss of SKr416m last time.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Swiss Justice Ministry has confirmed that it  will not be helping the United States in its inquiries on  suspected American spy Aldrich Ames. The Ministry rejected a  request from the United States for judicial cooperation, but it  did block three Swiss bank accounts held by Ames. This decision  raised certain hopes in Washington which, as it turned out, were  largely unfounded. A report from SRI's [Swiss Radio  International] Michel Walter, voiced by Peter Capella:    [Passage omitted] Washington approached Switzerland in the  course of its investigations because a part of the suspected  $2.5 million in pay-offs to Ames was deposited by Moscow in  Swiss bank accounts. The United States is applauding the  freezing of the accounts in question, as well as the release of  transaction details and confiscation of the deposited sums.  However, Switzerland reiterated that its judicial cooperation  treaty with the United States excludes all political matters,  and notably espionage.    Nonetheless, Switzerland did freeze the relevant accounts  and  at the time it appeared that Switzerland would help the  Americans out after all. Some newspapers wondered whether the  authorities were even prepared to give this judicial help  because Ames used Switzerland for illicit money-laundering. But  the Swiss Justice Ministry maintains this was simply wild  speculation. It said the move to block Ames' bank account was  initiated purely within the context of a Swiss inquiry, which  wanted to establish whether or not Ames's activities had  violated Switzerland's penal code on espionage. The Ministry  says that issue is, however, quite separate from the American  request for judicial cooperation, which was turned down less  than two weeks ago.</p>

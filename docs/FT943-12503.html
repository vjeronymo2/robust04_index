			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Steps to meet product safety obligations Sir, Stephen Sidkin and Nigel Miller ('Stay Secure on Safety', July 19) rightly point to changes in the law on product safety which affect all in the supply chain. They stop short of advice on how to meet the new obligations imposed by the general product safety regulations, however. The UK has an excellent record of product safety. Manufacturers have taken great care to meet and to exceed safety requirements. Part of the reason for this impressive record is our commitment to safety standards and to product marking showing that standards have been met. The British Standards Institution (BSI), established by the engineering profession and industry, was the world's first national standards body. The BSI kitemark, well known to consumers, has been around since the 1920s and provides our independent assurance of a product's conformity with standards. They point to the one defence under the legislation. A producer who took 'all reasonable steps and exercised due diligence' could demonstrate his care to avoid the offence. The surest way for manufacturers is to: Have the products 'type tested'. This will tell whether the design is safe. Manufacture under a quality management system to ensure that specifications will be consistently met. This helps ensure that each individual product meets the same criteria as the original design. Such a system also involves the keeping of records which assist in answering questions which may arise. Ensure that the criteria for any legal marking requirements are satisfied. Consider using a product certification scheme, such as the kitemark to give purchasers confidence. It is also essential for the future that the UK continues to make a full input to European and international standards. These will increasingly be used as benchmarks of best practice by the courts. Industry must make its views known on all relevant standards, through participation in BSI's work as the UK representative in European and international forums. With the Local Authorities Co-ordinating Body for Food and Trading Standards, BSI is holding a conference in October on the role of standards in assuring product safety. I hope that many of your readers - and your contributors - will be interested in participating.

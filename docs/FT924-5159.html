			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Chief chosen by 3i lobby COMPANIES in which 3i, the venture capital group, has an investment yesterday established an organisation, which has not yet been given a name, to represent their collective interests. Representatives from about 88 companies gathered at a private meeting in Birmingham and decided unanimously to found the organisation. A further 120 companies have made commitments to join. Mr Barry Baldwin, managing director of AE Poeton, metal finishers, will be the first chairman. The decision to found an organisation was prompted by concern over the future of individual companies once 3i is floated on the stock exchange. There have been fears that, to maintain dividend payments to its new shareholders, 3i might take a short-term view of its risk capital investments. The biggest venture capital group in the UK, 3i has investments in over 4,000 UK companies. It is owned by the Bank of England and the clearing banks, with Barclays and National Westminster as its biggest shareholders. A Stock Exchange flotation, which would have valued 3i at more than Pounds 1bn, was planned for this year but has been delayed. Before the Birmingham meeting, there were complaints from some of 3i's client companies about a lack of communication and a lack of interest from 3i. There were proposals that client companies should have representation on the 3i board and have preferential treatment in any 3i share issue. But after the meeting, members of the seven-strong committee set up to run the new organisation were anxious to distance themselves from both such proposals and any criticism of 3i. They stressed the need for communication with 3i. 'As far as I am concerned, we are starting with a clean page. We just want to talk,' said Mr Baldwin. Mr Alan Wheatley, chairman of 3i, told colleagues he would be glad to meet Mr Baldwin to discuss new ideas. The new organisation is the brainchild of Mr John Garrod, chairman of Rite-Vent, a Tyne and Wear engineering company, which sponsored yesterday's meeting. Rite-Vent has issued a writ against 3i, alleging negligence. To avoid a conflict of interest, Mr Garrod declined to stand for election to the new organisation's committee.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Yamaha plunges 58.7% to Y2.8bn YAMAHA, the world's largest maker of musical instruments, yesterday reported a 58.7 per cent plunge to Y2.8bn (Dollars 25m) in pre-tax profits, prompting the victors in a recent boardroom coup to intensify a restructuring programme. Sales during the year ending in March fell 14 per cent to Y330bn. However, the company estimated that the fall was only 3.9 per cent if the transfer of its housing equipment division to a subsidiary was taken into account. However, sales of most mainstream products, including pianos, electronic instruments, and sports equipment, were lower, and the company said the fall in interest rates during the period reduced financial income. Three generations of family rule at Yamaha ended in March when Mr Hiroshi Kawakami, the grandson of the founder, was removed from the board after the company's union demanded that executives took responsibility for deteriorating profits. Profits have slipped for three successive years, and the company is expecting the fall to continue this year, forecasting a pre-tax profit of Y2.5bn, down 10 per cent, on sales of Y336bn, a slim 1.6 per cent higher. The company's labour union may have played an important role in ending the reign of the Kawakami family, but one of the new leadership's most pressing tasks is to cut the workforce. Aiwa, the audio equipment maker, reported a 33 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y2.9bn, in spite of an 11 per cent increase in operating profit, with the difference due to exchange rate losses and reduced financial income. Sales rose 6.8 per cent to Y161.6bn, including a 3.5 per cent increase in audio equipment and a 25 per cent rise in video equipment, which accounted for about 17 per cent of total sales. Domestic sales fell by almost 5 per cent, but exports were 10 per cent higher, due to strong demand from east Asian countries. For the current year, Aiwa forecast a pre-tax profit almost unchanged at Y3bn on sales of Y170bn, a 5 per cent increase on last year.</p>

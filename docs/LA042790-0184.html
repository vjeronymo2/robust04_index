			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> JOEL'S PRIDE IN YANKEE STADIUM  </P> <P> Billy Joel says he can't wait to play Yankee Stadium -- he'll be playing music  and a little baseball on the field where Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio,  Mickey Mantle and other greats once performed.  </P> <P> Two popes and several heavyweight fights have sold out the stadium, but Yankees  officials say the native New Yorker and five-time Grammy winner will be the  first rocker to headline a show there when he appears June 22.  </P> <P> Other bands have played there following Yankee games.  </P> <P> "It's the House that Ruth Built, man. It's a magic place," Joel said in a  telephone interview from Chicago. "The day we set up, I'm going to walk out to  the mound and do a little pitching, maybe shag a few flies."  </P> <P> His piano will be set up in left-center field.  </P></p>

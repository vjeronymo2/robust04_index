			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Unilever set to exploit Rao's liberalisations HINDUSTAN Lever, the Indian affiliate of the Anglo-Dutch combine Unilever, is taking control of Tata Oil Mills Company (Tomco), a member of Tata, India's largest industrial grouping. It is one of the country's largest corporate deals. The companies describe the move as a merger, but management of the combined group will rest with Hindustan Lever, a local market leader in soaps and detergents in which Unilever holds a 51 per cent stake. The deal will permit Lever to bolster its position as it faces growing competition from multinationals entering the Indian market in the wake of the economic liberalisation out by Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister. Last December, Godrej, another leading local group, signed a joint venture with Proctor and Gamble, Unilever's international rival. .Mr Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Sons, the group's central company, believes Tata needs to focus on core businesses such as steel, vehicles, chemicals and computers.</p>

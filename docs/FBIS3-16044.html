			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Rimvydas Mintautas, chairman of the </F> Lithuanian Riflemen's Union, by Ona Mickeviciute; place and date  not given: "The Lithuanian Riflemen's Union Would Like To Be  Independent" -- questions published in boldface]    [Excerpts] [Mickeviciute]Recently, the press has  reported extensively on the Volunteer National Defense Service  [SKAT], while the Riflemen's Union has remained in the shadows.  Are your modest activities or the evasion of publicity  responsible for this?    [Mintautas] Yes, the press has devoted too little attention  to us. I think this is because we are not a state-run  organization, like the national defense system or SKAT. As any  family, however, we also have some naughty children, but we do  not have such problems as the military or volunteers.    [Mickeviciute] What are your union's relations with  military and volunteer organizations?    [Mintautas] Our ties with the national defense system have  never been ideal. They have been this way since the time when  Mr. Butkevicius became head the National Defense Department.    The National Defense Ministry [KAM] has long been persuading  us to join it. However, our principle is to be independent.  True, I do not envision riflemen without firearms, and an armed  organization should be subject to some structure. No government  would like to have independent armed men. However, we do not  want to engage only in marching and playing brass nicely.    Moreover, the national defense system has many people whom  the riflemen do not trust. These are former high-ranking Soviet  Army officers. We have met with them and we know what they are  like.    Our cooperation with the SKAT is traditional and sincere,  because the latter actually originated from the Riflemen's Union.    Having regained some of their prewar facilities, the  riflemen  are sharing them with SKAT and using its training bases.  [passage omitted]    [Mickeviciute]What was your attitude toward the  volunteer mutiny headed by Maskvytis in the woods near  Kaunas?    [Mintautas] We did not make any statements during that  mutiny. We thought later that we could have assumed a  conciliatory function.    [Mickeviciute]The community thinks that the Riflemen's  Union is in opposition to the elected government. Is this  opinion grounded? If there is any confrontation, what are its  reasons, and how can they be removed?    [Mintautas] I expected such a question. The members of our  organization are really dissatisfied with the current Seimas  [parliament] majority. This is natural, because most of us come  from the other side of the barricades. The Riflemen's Union  supported, supports, and will support Lithuania's right-wing  forces. However, this should not evoke any dangerous  confrontation. I have always claimed that the Lithuanian  Government was not brought on tanks from Warsaw, Moscow, or  Berlin, and we must get on with it. There are no reasons that  should be removed. However, we are unlikely to have good  contacts with the current authorities.    One cannot shout in a silly manner that everything is bad.  For example, a good resolution allowing citizens to keep  firearms has already been adopted, which is particularly  important to us, the riflemen. [passage omitted]    [Mickeviciute]What problems do you have?    [Mintautas] We appealed to all our governments for some  guarantees. Our members offered their services in guarding the  Russian Army while it was here. We would like to contribute to  the enforcement of public order, but the police do not want such  support. They do not want to grant us even such powers as  civilian militia supporters used to have.    The police do not forbid us from assisting them, but we  ourselves will be responsible for the consequences.    We have knocked on many doors concerning these and other  similar issues. We have received replies from the ministers of  national defense and justice, saying that our request for arms  and guarantees should make us subordinate to the KAM or the  Interior Ministry. There have been suggestions to draft a new  statute because the old one was registered by Mrs. K. Prunskiene  [first prime minister of independent Lithuania]. The current  draft statute was prepared very quickly, indicating that the  Riflemen's Union operates under the KAM. It was presented back  in December to Defense Minister L. Linkevicius, who replied that  he would like to meet and talk with us.    After we draft the new statute, we will hold a congress and  decide whether to remain with the KAM or remain independent.    We have received a proposal to become a police reserve, but  this would mean the end of such organization as the Riflemen's  Union.... Our people would not like this.... [passage omitted]    [Mickeviciute]Tell us briefly about the Lithuanian  Riflemen's Union. What are the number and age of your members?  What are your rules of admission?    [Mintautas] The union has about 7,000 members, including a  small number of former professional USSR officers. We have 15  divisions comprising 150 territorial units. We do not admit  former communists to our union. We had not had such a principle  before we adopted it at our first congress in 1990. Some of  former Communist Party members became our members, took an oath  of allegiance, and are now in the ranks of our union. Such was  former SKAT chief Colonel J. Gecas.    The Riflemen's Union also operates among Lithuanian emigres,  and we maintain good contacts with them. Actually we live on  financial support from riflemen emigres.    Young people between 30 and 35, mostly workers, account for  almost 40 percent of our members. We would also like to attract  intellectuals to our ranks.    Women also belong to our organization, but their number in  different divisions is uneven: Kaunas and Utena divisions have  30 females each, while Vilnius -- only 10.    Our divisions are rather autonomous. Each division commander  is a member of the union's Executive Council.    [Mickeviciute] What are your immediate plans?    [Mintautas] First of all, I will meet with the national  defense minister. Many issues must be discussed and made clear.  We do not intend to ask for a single cent from the KAM budget.  I do not know why the press reported so. [passage omitted]</p>

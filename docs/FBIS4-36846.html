			<p>BFN     [Text] Private credit institutions will be established soon  and the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran will  guarantee their activities. These establishments will be able  to receive deposits and can participate in production and  economic activities nationwide.    Central Bank Governor Adeli today explained the activities  of  the private credit institutions. He told our correspondent that  a set of rules and regulations has been prepared allowing those  who wish to establish such credit institutions to hand over  their application forms to the Central Bank next week.  Conditional on approval by the Money and Credit Council, such  persons will be able to begin their activities.    The Central Bank governor added: Such institutions will be  able to receive deposits and open all kinds of deposit accounts  apart from the Qarz ol-Hasaneh current accounts [goodwill loans]  which only banks may deal with.    Also, the initial capital for the establishment of such  institutions should amount to at least five billion riyals and a  part of the capital should be held in cash in the institution's  own safe. A part of the deposit should be held at the Central  Bank. Mr. Adeli said: The highest loan paid out by such  institutions will be 15 times the deposited capital.    According to Mr. Adeli, in this way the Central Bank will be  able to precisely supervise the activities of the private credit  institutions and therefore guarantee them.    On the rate of profit paid by such institutions he said:  They  can expect to pay one percent more profit than the current rate  paid by [ordinary] credit institutions for the facilities  provided; and they can determine their own rates for their  deposit accounts. He stressed that the private credit  institutions are not allowed to engage in usury transactions and  will operate according to the law on usury.    The Central Bank governor added: The rules and regulations  for the establishment of such institutions have been approved by  the Cabinet and by the Money and Credit Council; and following a  request made by the Central Bank, the Guardians Council  announced that the action is not against the Constitution or the  religious laws.</p>

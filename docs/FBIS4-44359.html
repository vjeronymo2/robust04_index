			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] French, German, and Italian press  commentaries on the European Parliament (EP) elections held on 9  and 12 June viewed the results primarily as a reflection of  national concerns which could also lead to changes in direction  within the European Union (EU).  <H5>  Germany: Subdued Interest, Modest Expectations </H5>   German press interest in the 12 June EP elections was  diverted by the local contests in seven laender and in Munich,  held on the same day. As noted in a 14 June commentary by  Heribert Prantl in the Munich daily SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: "On  the day before the election and on the day following, Europe was  mentioned as infrequently as in the entire German election  campaign; the EP election in Germany was a test election for the  federal parliament, with a new European Parliament as a  byproduct."    An article in the 14 June daily FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE  observed that "...the voters in Europe have decided the  composition of the European Parliament, but interest was  centered not on European political concerns, but on domestic  ones." Eberhard Wisdorff's article in the 14 June Duesseldorf  HANDELSBLATT noted that "even if the European election cannot be  a test case in anticipation of the Bundestag election, it  certainly was determined by domestic politics. That can be seen  most clearly in the example of the FDP [Free Democratic Party],  which will not be returning to the European Parliament." Hans  Joerg Sottorf's commentary in the same HANDELSBLATT issue termed  the EP election "in Germany, obviously a Kohl election."  However uncertain the 0ctober election predictions may be, the  EP election has made one thing clear: "the Republikaner remain a  marginal party on the right. For democracy in all of Germany,  that is the best message from the European election".    A report in the 14 June HANDELSBLATT cautioned that  Europeans  have once again "not primarily voiced an opinion for or against  the European unification process. In practically all national  arenas, it was mainly an interim summing up of domestic  politics." An editorial by Guenther Nonnenmacher in the 14 June  FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE noted that there are no European parties  toward which a barely identifiable "European public" might  gravitate. The two large blocs, Socialists and Social Democrats  on one side, Christian Democrats and conservatives on the other,  have been dominant in the EP for years. Nonnenmacher maintained  that this situation will persist, "a sign that Europe, despite  much agitation in national affairs, is marked by a high measure  of stability when viewed overall."  <H5>  France: Warnings for Future Noted </H5>   An editorial in the 14 June Paris daily LE MONDE questioned  whether today's European leaders will be able to maintain the  ideals of the EU founding fathers, now that the major challenges  of the past have been overcome. The results of the EP elections  provided no clear indication of the EU's ability to meet new  challenges such as resisting the revival of nationalism and  avoiding marginalization as the world's "center of gravity"  moves towards Asia.    On one hand, the paper said, the elections had a positive  result for the EU in that, except for Italy, the pro-European  groups did well. On the other, the new Parliament will be "less  European" because voter turnout was low, a sign of "growing  indifference to the EU." France was an example of this, as the  electorate expressed its doubts and confusion in voting for the  "nationalist far Right," the "fundamentalist Right," and the  "demagogic Left." The editorial asserted that political figures  must learn from these "alarming signals." Politicians on both  sides should act on their principles rather than their  ambitions, before next year's presidential election.  <H5>  Italy: Failure for Federalism Seen </H5>   In a commentary in the Milan daily IL SOLE--24 ORE of 14  June, Maurizio Ferrera wrote that the EP elections did not  confirm any tendency by Europeans to proceed towards a United  States of Europe. The new EP should bear this in mind, Ferrera  warned, to avoid the futility and risk of setting off in the  wrong direction.    Except in very few instances, the campaigns were run  entirely  on national issues, with little space given to the EU agenda,  Ferrera wrote, citing the Italian campaigns. "Did anyone hear  Forza Italia or the PDS [Democratic Party of Left] state their  position on the institutional future of Europe?" Ferrera asked.  In countries in which the EU was mentioned during the  campaign--such as Denmark, France, or Great Britain--it was only  by political groups critical or hostile to the EU. In no  country was there serious discussion on the essential themes of  the EU, such as enlargement, federalism, and the timeframe for  these. This is a sign, Ferrera concluded, that the candidates  did not believe these topics were useful when it came to  garnering votes.    The low voter turnout was also another negative sign,  Ferrera  wrote, and two implications can be drawn from it: First, the  legitimacy of the new EP has a small base--far from the  "plebescite" for a stronger EP and a federal constitution hoped  for by many outgoing deputies. Second, the Eurofederalists'  claim of a "democratic deficit" in the EU was met by voter  indifference. This is backed up by recent polls that show a  general cooling of the voters towards integration. People are  beginning to blame the EU for unemployment, higher taxes, and  budget cuts, Ferrera wrote. In view of these negative signals,  Ferrera continued, it would not be opportune for the new EP to  strive immediately for federalism, full codecisionmaking powers,  or a federal constitution, all measures set out by the outgoing  parliament.    Former PCI (Italian Communist Party) deputy Aldo Rizzo in a  commentary in the Turin daily LA STAMPA of 13 June noted that  the best news for Europe came from Austria, a majority of whose  electorate voted to join the EU. With Finland, Norway, and  Sweden possibly joining before the end of the year and many  other countries knocking on the door, Rizzo maintained, the EU  remains a highly attractive option.    The election results did not show a move to the Right or the  Left, said Rizzo; the Socialists and the center-right won in  some countries and lost in others. The next parliament will not  be "dominated by a political-ideological tendency. Were this  ever to happen, it will mean that Europe has really become one  state, a real political entity... Europe is questioning itself  and enlarging simulataneously; it is at the same time strong and  weak. The course it will follow will depend on the EP, but also  to a great extent on individual member state governments," Rizzo  concluded.</p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Employers warned on job-loss selection EMPLOYERS whose redundancy programmes focus on part-time workers may risk a legal challenge, according to a report by Industrial Relations Services, the pay research group. It said a breach of the law might arise because part-time workers were more likely to be women than men. Their dismissal might therefore contravene sex discrimination laws. Industrial Relations Services found in a survey of 120 employers that in the past two years about a fifth of organisations had altered the way they decided which employees to dismiss. Most had moved to procedures concentrating on employee performance. Some had changed to move away from the principle of last-in-first-out (Lifo), under which employees with the shortest service are first to go. Lifo was the main criteria for redundancy selection in less than a third of the 120 organisations surveyed. The main reason among other companies for not using it was that it did not allow them to retain their most valued employees. Manufacturing companies are more likely to use Lifo than others. Some 38 per cent of manufacturers used it while the proportion among the rest was 22 per cent. About 20 per cent of employers said performance made little difference to redundancy decisions.

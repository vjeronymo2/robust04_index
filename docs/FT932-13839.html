			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / World Trade News: UK ferry group defies Spain CENARGO, the UK marine group, said yesterday it would defy the Spanish authorities and launch a ferry service next week between the Moroccan port of Nador and Almeria in south-east Spain. The decision brings to a head a dispute between Spain's merchant marine authorities and Cenargo that tests the European Community's single market deregulation of cabotage between Community members and third nations. The issue has been complicated by Madrid's fears that a Nador-Almeria link will undermine the economy of Melilla, a Spanish-controlled enclave in Morocco close to Nador, which has so far monopolised sea communications between Morocco's eastern Mediterranean region and mainland Spain. The ferry service between Melilla and Spain that Madrid wants to protect is run by Transmediterranea, a state-owned shipping line in the process of being sold to Banco Central Hispano, BCH, one of Spain's leading banks. Mr Michael Hendry, Cenargo's chairman, said he intended to start a regular daily ferry service between the Moroccan and the Spanish ports on April 26 'despite the continued opposition of the Spanish authorities'. Mr Hendry said his Pta1.5bn (Pounds 8.4m) investment had the backing of the British government and was in accordance with the EC's Single Market directives. A spokesman for the merchant marine secretariat in Madrid said that should the Cenargo ferry, Scirocco, owned by the group's UK registered subsidiary Ferrimaroc, sail to Almeria from Nador next week it would either be prevented from entering the Spanish port or arrested on arrival. The Madrid authorities are claiming that they have yet to amend a 1979 agreement signed with the Rabat government that shares out ferry services between Spain and Morocco between the countries.</p>

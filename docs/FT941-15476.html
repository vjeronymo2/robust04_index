			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Soros may join Forte in Ciga bid Forte, the hotels and restaurants group, is discussing a possible joint bid with Mr George Soros, the international financier, for the Italian-based Ciga hotel chain. The group has joined forces with Quantum Fund, Mr Soros's investment vehicle, to make a revised offer to Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank that has overseen the restructuring of the highly indebted Italian company. Mr Richard Power, communications director at Forte, said the UK hotel group wanted to alter its initial agreement with Mediobanca to acquire Ciga. Under its original offer, it would have paid Pounds 33m in cash and inserted some luxury hotels worth Pounds 125m (Dollars 185m) into an Italian operating company, in which it would have had a majority interest. Ciga's debt would have been transferred to separate property holding company. The agreement would have given Forte control of 35 Ciga hotels in Italy, Austria, France, the Netherlands and Spain. However, Forte is thought to have been forced to look for a partner with substantial investment interests following demands from Ciga creditors that a bid package should include some property assets. 'We hope the Quantum Fund will be our partner. It has been represented at our recent discussions with Mediobanca,' said Mr Power. The rescue package for Ciga, controlled by a financial holding company owned by the Aga Khan, was put together after Mediobanca began restructuring the group's L1,000bn (Dollars 590m) net debts last year.</p>

The NEZAVISMAYA  GAZETA newspaper notes that legislators voted down Shushkevich  because they blamed him for splitting "the democratic movement  in the republic".    He has not created either his party or a group in parliament  over 18 months' work as speaker, which would have supported him  unconditionally. This has resulted in the present logical end,"  [no opening quotation marks as received] the newspaper notes.    Speaking of Shushkevich's activities as parliament speaker,  the newspaper writes that he "tried to keep at least illusory  balance in relations with Russia, on which the Belarusian ruling  elite now seeks to impose the main responsibility for  maintaining the economic status quo".    The TRUD newspaper has a different opinion on this event. It  called the decision taken by the Belarusian legislature "a  political drama of Stanislav Shushkevich". The newspaper  reminds its readers in an article printed on the front page that  "the formally proclaimed sovereignty of Belarus started assuming  more real outlines" after Shushkevich became parliament speaker.    "The main event of that time for Belarus was to lend the  declaration on state sovereignty the status of a constitutinal  law which clearly recorded the republic's desire to become a  law-governed democratic state with a developed market economy as  well as a nuclear-free and neutral state," TRUD says.    However, TRUD continues, it became clear in the recent past  that "the law was nothing but a political set in the performed  play with sovereignty for the pro-communist parliamentary  majority and bureaucracy which grabbed executive power at all  levels".    Shushkevich's resignation took place "under the evident  influence of changes in Russian politics, feeding the Belarusian  political establishment with hopes for conservation of its own  power," claims the newspaper.    TRUD predicts that the resignation will trigger a deeper  political crisis in the republic and tougher administrative  measures in the domestic policy, which will lead to "a drastic  review of the course defined by the above declaration on state  sovereignty".    The IZVESTIYA newspaper headlines its article on this event  as follows: "Shushkevich's resignation is a revenge of opponents  of reforms in Belarus and a gift to Yeltsin's opponents in  Russia".    The newspaper quotes a statement by prominent writer Vasil  Bykov who spoke about an onslaught of pro-Communist forces,  while leader of the Belarusian People's Front Zenon Poznyak  describes parliament's position as treacherous towards  Belarusian national interests.    Claiming that the event was preceded by well-orchestrated  preparations, Poznyak predicts the establishment of an  authoritarian regime in Minsk.    Writing on the same event, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper  notes that the latest developments in Belarus are logical, and  the reasons for the resignation were caused, above all, by  confrontation in the Belarusian parliament.    According to the newspaper, "the national democratic  opposition which is in minority and supports Shushkevich, lost  to the parliamentary majority backing Kebich who pursues a  resolute course for rapprochement with Russia and represents  pragmatists who are ready to waive some elements of illusory  sovereignty for the sake of saving the republican economy".    The newspaper also publishes a refutation by Mikhail  Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed  Forces, of an article in a Japanese weekly saying that Russia  allegedly contributed to the implementation of North Korean  missile-nuclear plans.    Kolesnikov said that the article was a crude fabrication.    Commenting on the appointment of Sergey Dubinin as acting  finance minister, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA suggests that people may  now "expect an improvement in the results of the ministry's  work, since Dubinin will bring conceptual issues to cabinet  meetings instead of newspaper articles".    The same newspaper features an article by Yuriy Skokov,  chairman of the Russian Federation of Manufacturers (the  federation includes the league of assistance to munitions  factories, the Russian union of industrialists and  entrepreneurs, the agrarian union, the union of work  collectives, the Russian chamber of commerce and industry and  the union of oil producers).    Asked by the newspaper about reasons for the recent drop in  the rouble's rate, he said that "many financial problems have  now become not a subject for professional solutions but a theme  for speechifying politicos".    Besides, Skokov said, "we have no normal foreign political  activities and do not have a clear understanding of what our  currency is worth".</p>

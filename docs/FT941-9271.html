			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Farmers add air strikes to their list of worries In the cafe at Kumzin, a village close to Serbia's border with Bosnia, the threat of Nato air strikes is not just a talking point on a day too frosty for ploughing. Kumzin lies a few kilometres from a ramshackle bridge over the Sava river, used as a main supply route for the Bosnian Serb army. Buses, petrol tankers and trucks loaded with food cross the bridge before arriving at a checkpoint manned by police from the self-styled Serb republic in Bosnia. 'It's obvious the bridge would be a target for Nato planes if they start attacking the Bosnian Serbs. And what happens if they miss?' said Drasko Christic, an agricultural science student. So far, the farming communities along the Sava have had little to do with the war in Bosnia. Many villagers of military age manage to avoid conscription, although some were called up to fight against Croatia when the Yugoslav federation began to break up in 1991. However, if the conflict escalates as a result of Nato involvement, 'I don't think I and my friends have any choice about going to fight with the Bosnian Serbs,' Mr Christic said. Though Kumzin is less than 100km from Belgrade, newspapers no longer arrive there. With private radio and television stations unable to relay much beyond the capital, the 5,000 villagers rely on state-controlled television, which carries limited coverage of the situation in Bosnia. 'I doubt we'd get much warning if the American planes decided to head this way,' said an elderly villager working his way through a large flask of plum brandy. With an unannounced power cut underlining the resigned tone, the cafe's gloomy consensus was that Nato intervention was likely to prolong rather than end the war in Bosnia. Yet several older farmers claimed they were more concerned about UN sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia than the possibility of air strikes. 'I've got a thousand worries, and there's nothing I can do about bombs falling down the road from here next week,' said Mr Petar Campric, the cafe owner. 'It's the future that matters. What's my son going to do when he finishes school, for instance, if Serbia is still isolated?' Twenty months of sanctions have affected output in Kumzin, which grows wheat, maize and sugar beet. There is little fuel available for tractors and fertiliser is in short supply. Farmers cut their livestock holdings because of the high cost of feed, keeping only a few pigs for their own use and to supply meat to family members living in the capital. Mr Campric rented his seven hectares of land to another farmer because 'it's too difficult trying to run a cafe and a farm when you have to chase up petrol on the black market and organise selling the crop to a private middleman because the state prices are so low.' The villagers said they had stopped using the bank branch in Kumzin and returned to hoarding hard currency at home. It is needed to deal with the black market suppliers. Many Kumzin farmers registered their frustration at last December's elections by switching support from the Socialist party of President Slobodan Milosevic to Depos, the coalition of democratic parties headed by Mr Vuk Draskovic. Mr Branko Todoskovic, a Depos supporter, said: 'Things were looking good in 1990 when I got back some land confiscated from my family under communism. Now I don't know when I'll be able to afford a new tractor to handle the extra work.'</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RAP ON RAP MUSIC  </P> <P> It's both curious and unfortunate that Robert Hilburn ("Ice Cube Keeps Cool . .  . Chills Clash," March 25) continues his almost childlike adoration of rap  bands that write nursery rhymes (which frequently don't rhyme at all)  glorifying behavior that results in the drive-by shootings of inner-city  children. And yet he scorns metal bands (yes, even Guns N' Roses when they were  new) for their focus on partying and sex.  </P> <P> As Ice Cube said in the review, he'd be writing about different things if he  had grown up in Beverly Hills. So why does Mr. Hilburn go out of his way to  condemn and disdain the reality of teen-age suburban America while he naively  celebrates the forbidden (to him) world of gang warfare and dope dealing?  </P> <P> TOM WERMAN  </P> <P> Studio City  </P> <P> Werman, an independent record producer, has worked with Motley Crue, Poison and  other metal bands.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / International Company News: New year, old problems at Olivetti - A return to profit depends on more cost-cutting THIS time last year, earnest discussions were under way at Olivetti aimed at tackling the one-off restructuring charges which loomed over the computer group's 1991 earnings. Eventually, it was decided to ascribe the entire cost of redundancies and factory closures to the 1991 accounts, a move that contributed substantially to the L459.8bn (Dollars 321.8m) group loss for the year. By biting the bullet in this way, Olivetti hoped to prepare the way for a return to profits - or at least break even - in 1992. Now, it appears that a similar discussion will be replayed when senior managers open their next round of budget meetings in January. The continuing crisis in the information technology industry means the process of rationalisation and restructuring has, for Olivetti and many other leading computer makers, not been a one-off affair. Although some parts of its business are performing much better, thanks to previous bouts of cost-cutting and reorganisation, others are still depressing earnings. Mr Corrado Passera, the most trusted of Mr Carlo De Benedetti's lieutenants, who was posted into Olivetti as joint managing director three months ago, has indicated how severe matters have become. Prices of personal computers, one of the products for which Olivetti is best known, have plummeted by 40 per cent a year over the past two years as a result of overcapacity and cut-throat competition. The collapse in prices, along with a sharp cut in production at Olivetti's Triumph Adler subsidiary in Germany, largely accounted for this year's L700bn fall in group sales to around L8,000bn, he said. Other areas are performing somewhat better. Mr Passera said the company was already making 'significant' earnings in services, while its systems and projects arm, which accounts for around a third of group sales, was expanding and 'not far from profit'. In recent months, Olivetti has notched up a series of deals in both sectors. In October it signed a contract to service all British Telecom's computer equipment in continental Europe. Soon after, it sealed an important servicing deal for the domestic branches of Barclays Bank, one of its biggest customers. Earlier in the year, another breakthrough came with the selection of Olivetti as one of the approved suppliers of computer workstations to the US franchises of the McDonald's fast-food group. The performance testifies to Olivetti's continuing shift away from low value-added items, such as personal computers and office equipment, to more profitable lines such as software and services, which now account for around a third of turnover. But, in spite of the shift in its priorities, Olivetti has no intention of pulling out of the lower value-added sector, according to Mr Passera. The group is Europe's largest maker of PCs, providing potential economies of scale, while its 4,000 distribution outlets gives it strong retail coverage for office equipment and visibility in the market place. However, it is with such 'commodity' items that further improvements to competitiveness are required. Stressing that some production would be maintained in Italy, in spite of relatively high costs, Mr Passera called on union leaders to show 'understanding and co-operation' with the company's as yet undisclosed plans to reduce costs further. Winning such support will be just one of the problems facing the group in 1993. For Olivetti's hopes to break even by December and return to profit in 1994 will depend as much on the market as on continuing efforts to cut costs and yet more internal reorganisations. The group will have to pursue its strategy of alliances with other companies in specific product areas and technologies. It will also have to work on its relationship with Digital Equipment of the US, which last June bought a 4 per cent stake and could go up to 10 per cent by the end of 1994.</p>

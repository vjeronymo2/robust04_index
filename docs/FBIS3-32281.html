Government Minister Marcelo Santos has  not rejected the possibility of the government using a  mobilization decree in the case of public disorder during the  strike.    The government minister called on the United Workers Front  [FUT] to execute the strike peacefully to avoid endangering the  people's safety. Santos said the national strike is absurd, and  he noted that it does not affect the government but the  country's production sectors and the workers.    Two government spokesmen have reported there is no going  back  on the price measures. Regarding the unconstitutionality suits  filed with the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal by several  political parties, the government minister said he will defend  the gasoline price hike within the extent of the law. He said  the government will not derogate the price hike decree just  because there are people demonstrating in the streets.    Finance Minister Cesar Robalino has stated it is not  possible  to modify the fuel price increase, and if someone in the  government suggests it, he will oppose the motion.    Labor Minister Alfredo Corrales has said the government is  studying the possibility of increasing workers' salaries in  general.    National Congress President Samuel Bellettini announced that  the National Congress will call on the economic front to explain  the legal basis for the fuel price hike.    Meanwhile, FUT leader Juan Andrango said today's preventive  strike has gained strength because it demands cutting back the  gasoline price increase. Andrango told Radio Quito this morning  that the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal must suspend the  fuel price increase, and he warned that if it does not, the  strike will be maintained indefinitely. He said there will be an  empty pots-and-pans march next week and an Indian demonstration  demanding higher salaries. Labor, Indian, peasant, and student  organizations representatives met and formed a grand front to  coordinate the preventive strike. Today's strike will be  followed by bigger protests of indefinite length, including  another Indian uprising.    Luis Macas, president of the Confederation of Indian  Nationalities of Ecuador, said this criminal and reckless  measure has harmed everyone. He urged all sectors to join the  struggle as the only remaining alternative.    Yesterday, there were street demonstrations throughout the  country. Demonstrations cause extensive traffic jams, trouble  for the people, and property damage. The police arrested 16  adults and 53 minors in different parts of the country.    Chambers of commerce have appealed for peace and talks as  valid alternatives to overcoming the problem. The industrialists  regret that the government's failure to put public finances in  order has resulted in the adoption of measures that negatively  affect the various economic sectors.    This morning, Quito Chamber of Commerce President (Nicanor  Calixto) told Radio Quito that the private sector is worried  about the high cost of fuel because this negatively affects the  national economy.    (Calixto) criticized the president of Congress for calling  for protests throughout the country and favored Finance Minister  Cesar Robalino going to Congress to explain why the government  has implemented this measure.    Meanwhile, Social Christian Party Deputy Heinz Moeller  thinks  the strike is a valid method for protesting the exorbitant fuel  price increase decreed by the Duran-Ballen administration. He  criticized the labor minister for saying there is an environment  of unruliness in the country.</p>

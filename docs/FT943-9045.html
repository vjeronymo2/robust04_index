			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / International Company News: Caterpillar set for record quarter Caterpillar, the international heavy equipment and engine producer, which is in the middle of a prolonged strike, reported yesterday that its July sales were up 20 per cent. Thus the company was on target for a projected record third quarter. A Caterpillar spokesman declined to specify which of its divisions were experiencing the strongest sales growth. The company has said that if the strike continued through the third quarter, some sales might be shifted into the fourth quarter. Members of the United Autoworkers Union walked out at Caterpillar on June 21 in a dispute over working conditions. The union has, however, been sparring with the company since November, 1991, when workers who were seeking new contract terms conducted an unsuccessful five-month walkout. With no talks on the latest dispute planned, there have been rumours that Caterpillar's production schedules would be curtailed. But yesterday it maintained that it 'continues to believe the labour situation will have minimal impact on sales and profit for the full-year 1994 even it the current strike continues'. Caterpillar says it has been able to meet planned production schedules, despite the dispute, a point that has been confirmed by some of its major customers. The strike hit just as the company's two main industries - engine assembly and heavy equipment manufacturing - were enjoying a robust rebound. US diesel engine production was up 40 per cent in the first half of the year, while production of construction equipment rose 16 per cent.</p>

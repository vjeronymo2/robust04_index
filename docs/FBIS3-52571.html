Addressing them, he commended the meetings held among Armed  Forces commanders in both Sanaa and Aden to discuss the  situation of the Armed Forces in light of the ongoing crisis in  the homeland in order to avert the use of the Armed Forces in  the political conflicts that threaten the homeland's sovereignty  and undermine the accomplishments of the revolution and people,  namely, unity and democracy. He said that this crisis has  gravely harmed the national economy as well as the citizens'  living conditions, thanks to the price hikes and high cost of  living it has caused. The crisis has also affected our military  units and combatants, although combatants are well aware,  probably more than others, of the tragedies and calamities  brought about by fragmentation. Similarly, they are aware of  the consequences of conflicts and disputes, he argued.    The brother Presidential Council chairman noted that the  Armed Forces are a shield for the homeland and unity, rather  than a tool to be used to protect persons, parties, or  organizations. They must be kept away from any political  conflicts or partisan differences, because this would jeopardize  the homeland's sovereignty as well as its territorial integrity.    The brother Presidential Council chairman said that  differences among political forces are a natural development and  can be resolved through responsible national dialogue. However,  he said that differences within the Armed Forces are  unjustifiable, because they could bring catastrophes and  tragedies to the people, homeland, and future generations. Past  events are a testimony to what I am saying, he added. He  pointed out that the Armed Forces personnel, thanks to unity,  have become brothers and comrades in arms. Their mission right  now, he said, is to safeguard this great accomplishment scored  by dear sacrifices. He urged the Armed Forces personnel to  confront the advocates of division, fragmentation, and  secession; those who foment sedition; as well as all those who  are attempting to make our people relive the times of division  and conflict, to take them backward, or to push them into the  abyss. The homeland, he said, is the property of neither 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, nor 'Ali Salim al-Bid, or others, for that  matter. The homeland belongs to all Yemenis, he said. All  zealous citizens must oppose falsehood without fear. Likewise,  they must confront the enemies of the homeland and its unity.    The Presidential Council chairman touched on the economic  situation, which has been adversely affected by the political  crisis, its repercussions, as well as its impact on the  citizens' living conditions and their peace of mind. He  affirmed the need for the government to shoulder its  responsibilities to ease the citizens' burdens, remedy the  economic situation, halt increasing price hikes and speculation  on the national currency. He affirmed his confidence that our  people's sons, headed by the Armed Forces personnel who forged a  matchless glory on 22 May 1990, will not abandon this great  accomplishment. They are willing to make every conceivable dear  sacrifice to protect this accomplishment, he concluded.</p>

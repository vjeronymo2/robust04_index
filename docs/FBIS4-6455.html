			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai today chaired a meeting  of the National Security Council (NSC) during which the  Cambodian problem was discussed. The prime minister questioned  officials concerned about the accusations that Thailand supports  the Khmer Rouge. Representatives of the Armed Forces reaffirmed  that the Armed Forces has a policy of not giving any support to  the Khmer Rouge. Investigations showed that the accusations were  relayed by AFP in Phnom Penh, which often carries news against  Thailand. The prime minister said that the Thai Government's  policy toward Cambodia remains unchanged and Thailand will  continue to provide humanitarian aid for Cambodia. Thailand,  however, will explain all the facts to the UN.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Will we  inform  the UN about Thailand's difficult position?    [Chuan] If they cause us damage, the Foreign Ministry will  be  instructed to collect information and give an explanation to the  UN. [end recording]    General Charan Kunlawanit, secretary general of the National  Security Council, said that it is strange that the Cambodian  Government made accusations against Thailand without first  seeking clarification since both governments maintain good  relations. General Charan is also not sure whether the  accusations were really made by the Cambodian prime minister.  He said that the limit for the Thai Government's patience is  determined by the people and the mass media.</p>

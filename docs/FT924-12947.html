			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Books: Shades of Lear - Stephen Amidon on a novel unafraid to be derivative A THOUSAND ACRES by Jane Smiley Flamingo, Pounds 5.99, 384 pages JANE SMILEY'S remarkable new novel is a grim and utterly enthralling tale of the poisonous effect long buried secrets can have when unearthed. Set on an Iowa farm in the late 1970s, A Thousand Acres tells the story of an ageing farmer, Larry Cole, who decides to divide his land among his three daughters. The two eldest, Ginny and Rose, have lived their entire lives on the farm and are all too willing to take control from the old man, while the youngest, Caroline, a lawyer who has long since moved away, questions Larry's judgment. She is summarily disowned by him, beginning a family feud that ends in a harvest of tragedy. If the story sounds familiar, that's because it is - Smiley has boldly adapted King Lear into a work that lives and breathes on its own merits. Like a Shakespearian tragedy, the story begins slowly, with a carefully drawn portrait of the stifling customs, tedious work and suppressed passions of a farming clan. From without, the Coles seem to be the salt of the Midwestern earth, just what Republicans have in mind when they speak about 'family values'. Ginny, who narrates the tale, appears to be a simple, honest woman whose willingness to take over control of the farm stems from the most selfless of motives. Likewise with her amiably caustic sister Rose and their hardworking husbands. All is not as it seems in Zebulon County, however. It soon becomes apparent that both of the sisters' marriages are fraught with violence, misunderstanding and frustration. Their father is anything but the steady farmer he seems to be, turning out to be an abusive, drunken tyrant. Given this, it is hardly surprising that what starts out as an amicable inheritance soon turns sour, the bitterness coming to a head when, true to Shakespeare, the daughters effectively turn the crazed old man out into a violent prairie storm. From that moment the plot kicks into high gear, with adultery, blindness, incest, attempted murder and accidental death following hard upon one another in a manner which manages to be both shocking and utterly natural. What began as an almanac of honest American values ends an epic catalogue of betrayal and loss. The immense power of the novel stems not just from its grand scale and pitched emotions, but also from its simple, relentless style, a voice that reinforces the book's timeless themes and locations. It is refreshing to read a writer who is not afraid to use such supposedly old fashioned devices as foreshadowing to move her story along. She also manages to adhere to her Shakespearian source in a subtle, unobtrusive way, providing the reader with sparks of recognition without taking her eye off the plot's flow. Smiley's strongest skill is a keen authorial balance which, perversely, keeps us off-balance for most of the book. The reader must continually reassess his view of characters and events. The attractive Jess, a New Age draft dodger who becomes the love interest of the elder sisters, turns out to be somewhat less romantic than first pictured, while Rose's husband Jack winds up far more complex than first thought. This dark irony reaches right down into the Iowa soil itself, seemingly fertile ground that has in fact been poisoned by years of chemical treatment, a legacy which may very well have caused the cancer that eats away at Rose and prevents Ginny from bringing a pregnancy to term. The most telling realignment in the novel comes with Ginny herself, a confused and bitter woman who starts the story something of a saint yet soon finds herself driven to attempted murder as she faces the most horrific of demons. Indeed, it is by telling the story from the point of view of one of Shakespeare's 'bad' sisters that Smiley is able to add a new perspective to the Lear myth, showing what it must be like to be the daughter of a tyrant, to live in a household where 'the unbroken surface of the unsaid' hides a well of corruption and betrayal.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salah 'Azazi] </F>   [Text] PLO Executive Committee Member Jamal al-Surani has  said that the entire Palestinian people are calling for breaking  off the negotiations with Israel. He held the United States  responsible for the Zionist massacre in Hebron. There is no  point continuing the negotiated settlement until the U.S.  position becomes clear, he said.    Al-Surani assailed demands by Clinton and Warren Christopher  that the two sides demonstrate self-restraint, as though  Palestine was the aggressor against Israel. He said: I pray  God to remove the scales from the eyes of those who imagine  something good will come of the U.S. position. It is the United  States that provides weapons, aid, and all forms of support for  Israel.    Al-Surani said the settlement option leads nowhere with the  racist usurpers who are embraced by the United States. He  called for a prompt meeting by the Arab foreign ministers, or  else the Arabs will be colluding against each other. An Arab  summit to react to the massacre must be held, he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Over 500 miners at nine pits in the Karaganda Coal  Mining Area in North Kazakhstan refused to go underground on  Wednesday [18 May]. The strike is staged at the call of the  Independent Mine Workers' Union, which demands that the  Karaganda Coal administration sign an agreement to guarantee  better social conditions, such as the timely payment of the  wages, social, and medical insurance and the allocation of  credits for the purchase of housing.    The administration refuses to sign such an agreement with  the  union on the grounds that an agreement on tariffs has already  been signed with the official unions.    On the eve of the strike the Director General of Karaganda  Coal, Grigoriy Present, sent a cable to the mines, qualifying  the action of protest as illegal. It will be regarded as  absenteeism, he said.    The official unions of mine workers did not support the  strike either, viewing it as illegal and untimely.</p>

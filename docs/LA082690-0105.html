			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> CONSERVATIONISTS TOUGHEN DEMANDS ON TWO CANDIDATES  </P> <P> California's key environmental political action organization is dangling its  endorsement before Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Pete Wilson by  demanding still stronger commitments from the gubernatorial candidates.  </P> <P> The 32,000-member League of Conservation Voters, which describes itself as the  political arm of the environmental community, also has asked Feinstein and  Wilson to devote a televised debate to the environment and to further explain  their positions on a variety of issues.  </P> <P> "The candidates will undoubtedly tell you that we ask too much," said Lucy  Blake, league president. In fact, neither campaign wished to risk offending the  league publicly. But privately, the organization's new requests elicited  frustration within both camps.  </P> <P> With opinion polls showing strong interest in environmental protection, the  league's official support could give either candidate a boost with an important  bloc of voters.  </P> <P> California voters have never been presented with two major party nominees for  governor who boast such strong records and campaign positions on the  environment. But in appearances in opposite ends of the state last week, each  candidate ran into the potential pitfalls that come with pleasing both  environmentalists and other potential supporters.  </P> <P> Feinstein was received with stony silence by state water developers in La Jolla  on Thursday when she unequivocally opposed any construction that would expedite  the flow of Northern California water through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta  to Southern California.  </P> <P> Even without a Peripheral Canal or through-delta channels, a Feinstein  Administration would not allow additional water exports to the South until  strong standards for protection of water quality in the delta and San Francisco  Bay are established, she told the California Water Resources Assn.  </P> <P> Feinstein said California could make up a growing, chronic deficit through more  efficient use of water, the cleanup of polluted aquifers, the encouragement of  water transfers from farming interests to urban areas, the reclamation of  treated effluent and the construction of off-stream or underground reservoirs  for storage of runoff in wet years.  </P> <P> She offered a sweeping vision of a California 50 years from now in which "we  still have free-flowing rivers . . . we will have new river parkways . . .  fisheries will have been restored . . . and (Lake) Tahoe will still be blue."  Farms, homes and industry will operate on the most efficient and modern of  water supplies, she said.  </P> <P> But Carl Boronkay of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California,  described Feinstein's rejection of any new delta water transfer facility as "a  real bomb."  </P> <P> On the same day in Redding, Wilson walked a tightrope between his record as an  environmentalist and threats to the economy of Northern California in an  address to Rotary clubs, whose membership includes many timber industry  officials. Timber interests are outraged over a federal decision that threatens  to ban tree cutting in vast tracts of national forest land in order to protect  the habitat of the Northern spotted owl.  </P> <P> "I am not a biologist," Wilson said. "I have no idea whether the findings are  sound. There obviously is a need for the kind of balancing" between  environmental protection and a healthy state economy.  </P> <P> Wilson has asked federal officials to study whether the threat to the spotted  owl may be less serious in California than in Oregon and Washington because of  differences in geography and climate. If so, Wilson could argue for  less-extensive forest protection and, perhaps, soothe the timber industry.  </P> <P> Some timber officials said privately that they wished they could bend Wilson  more to their view, but there was no public criticism.  </P> <P> The new League of Conservation Voters requests were made Friday as Blake  released a 12-page statement examining the environmental campaign commitments  made by Feinstein and Wilson so far.  </P> <P> While the league did not attempt to rank the candidates, an earlier report gave  Wilson stronger marks on more subjects. But Feinstein has vigorously wooed the  environmental community by endorsing Proposition 128, the sweeping  environmental measure that is the league's top priority. She has also promised  in recent weeks to support most of the environmentalists' agenda.  </P> <P> Wilson has declined to back Proposition 128, primarily on the grounds that it  would establish the statewide elected office of environmental advocate. Because  of that opposition, most observers believe Wilson has little or no chance of  getting the endorsement.  </P> <P> But Blake said that was not necessarily so. "Literally every option is open,"  Blake said, including the possibility of no endorsement.  </P> <P> The new league assessment credited both candidates with strong positions on  coastal protection and air quality. However, it called on them to give more  specific statements on growth management, energy policy, logging and pesticide  controls.  </P> <P> In sum, the league gives Wilson the edge on past records and Feinstein the  advantage on pledges of actions she would take if elected. Blake said the most  important factor is a candidate's willingness and ability to stand up to the  strong interests that profit from the exploitation of natural resources.  </P> <P> "They've got a 24-year record of performance on the environment, a detailed  platform," said Otto Bos, Wilson's campaign director.  </P> <P> Dee Dee Myers, Feinstein's press secretary, said the league's report "reflects  that Dianne's position is obviously more developed in their minds now." She  said the Feinstein campaign would attempt to answer any further questions the  league has.  </P></p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Observer: Patten patter As a cure for post-cabinet blues, John Patten flew to the pages of The Daily Telegraph yesterday in an altogether admirable effort to shift the Conservative party off its collective hind quarters. Observer was pretty impressed by the Patten prose too. How elegantly was the 'prize at the end of the perpetual political rainbow' juxtaposed with the 'seachange' that 'will take 30 years or more to see through'. How forcibly did the author convey the desirability of 'encouraging the little battalions to be our social warp and weft'. Should his words be doled out to GCSE English language students to study and reflect upon? The former education secretary mentions in passing how in 1979 he 'swapped life in the intellectual theme park for life in the political one'. One can but hope his journey 15 years later into the theme park of scribblers will be equally smooth.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GRANDY ASSAILS HELMS' ARTS STANCE  </P> <P> Former actor Fred Grandy, now a Republican representing Iowa in the U.S. House  of Representatives, said today that the National Endowment for the Arts is  being "held hostage by some extremist groups."  </P> <P> Grandy, who appeared in the TV series "The Love Boat," said it is "ridiculous"  that Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) is blocking passage of the NEA reauthorization  bill on censorship in the arts.  </P> <P> He said Helms will "be opposed by members of his own party in the Senate."  </P> <P> Helms added language to the NEA appropriation bill that prohibits funding works  that depict a variety of named sexual activities and are deemed to have no  redeeming social value.  </P> <P> Grant recipients would be required to declare that they would comply with the  restrictions.  </P> <P> Grandy was interviewed on the "Fox Morning News."  </P></p>

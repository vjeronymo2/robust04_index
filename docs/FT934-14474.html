			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: New issues float on wave of market confidence - The recent flotations have been welcomed in the City, but some doubts remain INVESTORS rifling through documents for the second wave of flotations this year are still bathed in the warm afterglow of the first, from which almost all buyers have so far made money. Issues which looked finely priced, if not expensive, such as Carpetright, the retail chain, and Devro International, the sausage casings maker, have performed well so far, albeit in a rising market. Even RJB Mining, the coal company which saw its shares open at a discount is now trading at a premium. Court Cavendish, the nursing home operator, which also saw its shares slip, remains a disappointment. There is still quality stock emerging, however, with the likes of Roxboro, the electronics components maker, and Gartmore, the fund manager. Mr David Barclay, deputy managing director of NatWest Markets Corporate Finance, says: 'I think people have rediscovered new issues as a way of apparently making rapid returns. Fortunately, the majority of issues we have seen to date have justified their values, levels of enthusiasm are running much higher than six months ago and certainly higher than a year ago.' New issues are increasingly oversubscribed with retail demand quietly approaching levels last seen in the 1980s. Today's market, which has risen substantially, is anchored, however, by low interest rates, which is one reason no one expects a repeat of 1987's stock market crash. However, the nagging fear remains that the market is discounting a sharp recovery in earnings which may be a more distant prospect than it knows. 'A few of the recent and forthcoming flotations could be risky if the recovery falters,' says one banker. This worry is fuelled by fears that today's buoyant market is over valuing some smaller companies, particularly those in high technology sectors or dependent on a single product. 'We are seeing some things coming out that perhaps in a more cynical market you would have hesitated to float. There is no reason to expect the boom to stop tomorrow; on the other hand history will tell you that sooner or later people get carried away,' says the director of a merchant bank sponsoring several of the current batch of new issues. Other City sceptics point out that for venture capitalists seeking even a partial exit from management buy-outs the market is currently prepared to pay more for a percentage of the equity than trade buyers can afford or will stump up for outright ownership. One banker says: 'At some point that cycle will reverse. No one actually believes there's going to be a crash, or even a mini-crash, but people ought to be discriminating.' Investors should be especially wary, he adds, of those managements which know that the higher their issue is priced the bigger their own holdings will grow under so-called ratchet agreements. 'If I were an institution I would be looking quite carefully at the psychology of the management. The danger is some will squeeze every last drop of juice out of the price which means less upside for new subscribers.' Others argue that MBO floats are of the highest quality, already tested by venture capital backers themselves and proven survivors of both recession and financial stringency born of high debt. The sheer volume of new issues means investors are likely anyway to become more selective. Another banker, arranging a placing for a recent issue, said he approached 30 institutions where he would normally contact 20, just because of the number of new issues around. In addition, institutions are subjecting new stock to a more rigorous analysis. 'In the late 1980s we would rent a room somewhere, and have 40 institutions to meet the company. This meant there was scarcely any scope for individual questions,' says another banker. He contrasts this approach with today's one-to-one interviews: 'We go round to them and they have a really in-depth hour of those people really grilling our clients.' For the moment the market is comfortable with the generally sensible prices, but confidence is fragile. 'What usually happens is that some idiot overprices something and it all gets left with the underwriters and then people start being more careful', he says.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SCHEDULED NEW ISSUES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Name                         Activity               Type of offer  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1 BSM Group                    Driving school         Intermediary                                                        offer/placing  2 Johnson Fry 2nd Utilities    Investment trust       tba  3 Canadian Pizza               Pizzas                 Placing/offer  4 CLM                          Lloyd's inv trust      Placing/offer  5 Finsbury Underwriting        Lloyd's inv trust      placing/int                                                        offer  6 Hozelock                     Garden hose equipment  Placing/int                                                        offer  7 Cementone                   Building materials      Placing/offer  8 LS Holdings                 Printer products        Placing/offer  9 Roxboro                     Electronic components   Placing/offer                                maker 10 Syndicate Capital Trust     Lloyd's inv trust       Placing/offer 11 Wigmore Property Trust      Property                Placing/offer 12 Singer &amp; Friedlander        Capital growth          Launch    Tai Pan Fund                from Far East 13 Badgerline                  Bus operator            tba 14 Gartmore                    Fund manager            Placing/offer 15 Towry Law                   Financial adviser       Placing 16 Premium Trust               Lloyd's inv trust       tba 17 Poulter Communications      Electronic publisher    Placing 18 Charles Sidney              Car dealer              Placing/offer 19 Kleinwort 2nd Endowment     Endowment policy        Placing/offer    Policy Trust                inv trust 20 DFS Furniture               Furniture retailer      Placing/offer 21 Royal Doulton               Fine china              Demerger 22 Independent Insurance       Insurance               Placing/offer 23 Biotrace                    Biotech                 Placing 24 Cantab                      Biotech                 Placing 25 Allders                     Retailer                Placing/offer  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Name                               Est market          Proposed                                        cap (Pds)      closing date  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1 BSM Group                                 47m         21 Oct 93  2 Johnson Fry 2nd Utilities                 40m            Oct 93  3 Canadian Pizza                            40m         Next week  4 CLM                                      200m               n/a  5 Finsbury Underwriting                     30m               n/a  6 Hozelock                                  50m            Nov 93  7 Cementone                                 40m         Autumn 93  8 LS Holdings                           50m-60m         Autumn 93  9 Roxboro                                   80m         Autumn 93 10 Syndicate Capital Trust                   38m            Nov 93 11 Wigmore Property Trust                      -            Nov 93 12 Singer &amp; Friedlander Tai Pan Fund           -            Nov 93 13 Badgerline                               100m            Nov 93 14 Gartmore                            250m-300m            Nov 93 15 Towry Law                                 25m            Nov 93 16 Premium Trust                             30m            Nov 93 17 Poulter Communications                    12m            Nov 93 18 Charles Sidney                            50m            Nov 93 19 Kleinwort 2nd Endowment Policy Trust        -            Dec 93 20 DFS Furniture                            200m           Late 93 21 Royal Doulton                               -           Late 93 22 Independent Insurance                     80m         Next week 23 Biotrace                                    -               tba 24 Cantab                                    50m         Next week 25 Allders                                  200m            Nov 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: ShareLink  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

In his statement to reporters at Surcin airport, Papoulias  said the Bosnian crisis would be the first problem to be  discussed at an informal EU meeting on 26 and 27 March.    He did not specify whether he brought any proposals to  Belgrade, but said: "I am here to make a contribution to the  peace process in the capacity of the chairman of the European  Council, but also as foreign minister of Greece, which is  directly interested in the Balkan problem."    Asked what was happening with the EU proposal after the  Washington agreement had been signed, Papoulias did not give a  direct answer, but replied that the latest EU activities had  been discussed at the latest session of the EU Council of  Ministers.    "I would like to convince you that the EU will be actively  present in the upcoming developments," he said. Asked whether  the EU was upset about the United States having monopolized the  issue, Papoulias said "we are not upset, but in any case, we  want to remain present at the scene, together with powers such  as the United States and Russia."    According to him, nobody "must forget the EU's contribution  so far and the ideas of the EU's program of activities, which  remain the most significant ideas at present," he stressed.    Asked about possible deployment of Turkish troops in Bosnia,  Papoulias said that all Balkan countries were interested in the  problem, since they had said in the past that no forces from any  of the Balkan countries must be sent into former Yugoslavia.    Papoulias said if Turkey sends its units, Greece would also  consider sending its forces.</p>

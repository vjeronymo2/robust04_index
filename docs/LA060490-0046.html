			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER'S HARDBALL: WHAT ABOUT YELTSIN?;  </P> <P> THE MEDIA: STUNNED SILENCE, THEN NERVOUS LAUGHTER FOLLOW SOVIET JOURNALIST'S  QUESTION ABOUT GORBACHEV'S NEMESIS.  </P> <P> In the newspaper game, the guy from Izvestia pitched a fast one right down the  middle.  </P> <P> Where Sam Donaldson once stood, trying his best to stump Ronald Reagan on  prime-time television, Stanislav Kondrashev faced down "Comrade Gorbachev"  Sunday morning. The political commentator for the Soviet government newspaper  Izvestia told the Communist Party chief and Soviet president that this  perestroika business and buddy-buddy summit with George Bush were all well and  good, but what about Yeltsin?  </P> <P> The stunned silence, particularly among U.S. reporters, gave way to nervous  laughter. There, in the elegant East Room of the White House, the drama of  Mikhail S. Gorbachev's glasnost was played out live for all to see, including a  nationwide audience in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> It was the first time the White House had been the setting for a joint press  conference featuring the President of the United States and the leader of the  Soviet Union. The two sat side by side for an hour, answering questions from  the White House press corps, traveling Moscow reporters and the international  media assembled in Washington for the four-day summit.  </P> <P> As for the hardball question on Boris N. Yeltsin, Gorbachev's maverick nemesis  who was elected president of the Soviet Union's Russian republic last Tuesday,  the Soviet president told his questioner: "I don't think you have chosen the  best place for clarifying our internal problems, but c'est la vie, as they  say."  </P> <P> With that, he proceeded into a characteristically lengthy response. Gorbachev,  it seems, has not learned to just say nyet to a microphone.  </P> <P> Nor has he mastered the art of sound bites -- those pithy phrases that invite  television network headlines. In fact, brevity of any kind is not his forte. At  the start of the news conference, Bush delivered an opening statement of about  470 words. Gorbachev stretched his out to 1,250.  </P> <P> There was nothing in the demeanor of the two presidents that indicated this  East Room press conference was unprecedented. If anything, they displayed the  ease of all-stars who have opposed each other in the past and may very well do  so in the future, but who for this game find themselves on the same team.  </P> <P> They sat at a heavy wooden table, with pairs of U.S. and Soviet flags standing  to each side. They tossed their answers back and forth, first one, then the  other.  </P> <P> After Bush had tackled a question and follow-up, Gorbachev took the first crack  at the next question, addressed to both of them. "Let me begin first, in order  to let President Bush have a little rest," he said playfully.  </P> <P> The questions came in English and Russian -- English from the American  reporters seated in front of Bush and Russian from the reporters from Izvestia;  Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, and the New Times weekly Soviet  magazine. Each president wore a cup-like earpiece through which he received a  simultaneous translation of the questions and answers.  </P> <P> An attempt at Russian by the Moscow correspondent of The Guardian, the British  newspaper, led Gorbachev to fiddle with his earpiece, as if in a struggle to  determine just what language he was hearing.  </P> <P> With the exception of the question about Yeltsin, there were few surprises in  the topics raised.  </P> <P> A news agency reporter who frequently asks about the Middle East wanted to  know: "Why is it that President Gorbachev has shown so much human sympathy for  the Palestinians while the U.S. vetoes even a U.N. look at their plight under  military siege?"  </P> <P> Gorbachev initially deferred to Bush on that one but then followed Bush's  answer by saying: "Just a moment, I'd like to respond too."  </P> <P> He went on to drop a minor bombshell, saying that the Soviet Union may once  again bar Jews from emigrating unless Israel provides guarantees that the new  arrivals will not be settled in the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Other questions dealt with whether differences over the future of a united  Germany had been narrowed -- Bush said that he wasn't sure they had been -- and  with the just-signed U.S.-Soviet trade agreement, among other topics.  </P> <P> The two men wore the sober news conference uniform -- dark business suits --  and each put on metal-frame glasses to read his opening statement. Bush took  notes while Gorbachev spoke.  </P> <P> When the hour had passed, both stood as if to leave but lingered a minute or so  to answer more questions before retreating down the red carpet of the White  House's long first-floor hallway.  </P></p>

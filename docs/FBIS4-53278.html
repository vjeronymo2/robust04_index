			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [King Norodom Sihanouk's 17 May statement in French </F> proposing roundtable talks in Pyongyang without preliminary  cease-fire read to the 18 May session of the National Assembly  and translated into Cambodian by an unidentified MP -- recorded]    [Text] Statement of Norodom Sihanouk, King of Cambodia;  Phnom Penh, 17 May 1994:    The Kingdom of Cambodia and its unfortunate people are  sinking deeper everyday into the abyss of national annihilation.  In the face of so much misery befalling my motherland and to an  increasing number of Cambodians in our provinces, I cannot give  up my work to restore peace with national reconciliation. As  the cease-fire that I have proposed is not realizable for the  time being, I have the honor now of announcing roundtable talks  without a preliminary cease-fire at my Chhanghsu-on residence  near Pyongyang, the DPRK, within 10 days -- that is, on Friday  27 May 1994. This roundtable, if nececssary, can be extended  until Tuesday 31 May 1994.    I most respectfully invite to this roundtable His Excellency  Samdech Chea Sim, His Royal Highness Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh, His Excellency Samdech Hun Sen, and His Excellency  Mr. Khieu Samphan, as well as their respective entourages.</p>

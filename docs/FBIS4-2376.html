SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama made the remarks when he met  reporters shortly after Hosokawa announced he was resigning.    The SDP differs from Shinseito, another powerful group  within  the seven-party coalition, over major policies including defense  and tax.    However, asked what the SDP would do if Shinseito leader and  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is picked up as new premier,  murayama said if the coalition parties reach an agreement on it,  "we will cooperate with the agreement."    A meeting of representatives from the ruling coalition  partners is currently under way to discuss who will succeed  Hosokawa.    Murayama also said the coalition government should not  change  its present seven-party structure.</p>

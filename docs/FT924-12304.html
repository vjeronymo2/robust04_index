			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of European Business Locations (2): Hot banana preferred - The factors affecting choice THE decision on where best to locate a European-based business to achieve maximum commercial benefit is one which many companies have never had to make. They, like Topsy, 'just growed' where they began. But the shifting patterns of political and economic development within an EC market intended to be barrier-free in a few weeks' time means that the location of a factory, warehouse or office is critically important. As new arrivals into the European arena weigh up the respective advantages and drawbacks of individual nations, regions and cities before making their choice, so countless numbers of well-established European companies are reappraising their location strategy. A process of relocation and consolidation which pays little heed to a company's original, European roots may well follow. Each company will have different priorities and requirements and, as consultants Plant Location International stress, 'to generalise is the biggest mistake which can be he potential investor in a new location is confronted with a bewildering mix of statistics and impressions. Glasgow offers excellent value for money in office floorspace, Lisbon provides low staffing costs, Stockholm is relatively pollution-free and Munich scores high when it comes to quality of life. A new survey conducted among leading businessmen in nine EC countries by the Harris Research Centre for Healey &amp; Baker, the chartered surveyors, contains few surprises in terms of the most popular business locations. London again emerges as the favourite, given its access to markets, telecommunications and the generally supportive business climate. Paris is second and Frankfurt third. Perhaps more interesting are those cities viewed by the business community as most likely to make an impact in the next five years. Leipzig, in the former east Germany, comes first, followed by the German cities of Stuttgart and Dresden. The same survey suggests near unanimity in the belief that Germany will inevitably become the centre of Europe. Wherever companies chose to locate, there remain several broad categories of criteria which any business will need to consider before making a decision. High on the list is the accessibility of the marketplace to be served, implying that Europe's peripheral regions will generally tend to be less attractive candidates. However, any disadvantage of this nature may be offset by other factors, such as availability of low-cost labour, less congestion and quality of life issues. The regions with greatest market access are located in the so-called 'hot banana', which stretches from south-east Britain through the Benelux countries, northern France, the Rhine and Rhur, Switzerland and northern Italy. According to Ernst &amp; Young Corporate Location, the 'hot banana' accounts for only 10 per cent of the surface area of the European Economic Area (EC and EFTA nations combined) but for more than 40 per cent of its total output. At the other extreme, the most peripheral areas include the Scandinavian countries, Greece, southern Italy, Spain, Ireland and Scotland. With 60 per cent of the EEA land area, they account for only 20 per cent of total output. Apart from market accessibility, the Harris Research Centre study highlights several other key factors in the decision-making process, including good transport links, modern telecommunications, a range of cost issues and, less specifically, the creation of a climate which is generally supportive of the business community. Effective, efficient transport links are universally regarded as essential and while huge investment projects are under way around the EC - the channel tunnel, the Rhine-Danube canal and a community-wide network of high-speed trains - there remain big impediments to the movement of people and goods. A recent study showed that flight times within Europe have increased because of increasing congestion while restrictions on the movement of heavy goods vehicles in some nations is hindering the flow of traffic to others. According to Ernst &amp; Young: 'While some of these difficulties will eventually be overcome, congestion on all forms of transport is likely to become an increasing problem.' Also high on the list in any decision on preferred locations is the question of availability of labour. For companies with labour-intensive activities, the regions of southern Europe offer the most plentiful source of manpower, as well as the lowest wages, though local skills levels, labour laws and the climate of industrial relations may not prove so advantageous. The UK is generally deemed to have the most relaxed employment laws, with few restrictions on working hours, overtime and holidays - a position likely to persist as long as the British government withholds its support for the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. In contrast, dismissal and redundancy can be a lengthy and difficult affair in Spain, Portugal and Italy. Another critical factor involves national systems of corporate taxation, which are often highly complex and which vary widely across the community. Ernst &amp; Young calculates that Germany, Norway and Sweden impose the lowest tax burden while Spain, France and Portugal impose the highest. Underlying the list of variables which companies must consider lies the potential availability of financial incentives on offer to companies from government agencies and from the EC, particularly in those areas attempting to reverse industrial decline. Although the criteria for financial assistance vary, the level of help normally rests on the applicants' ability to show that the investment will have a beneficial impact on factors such as jobs and local suppliers. But, according to Dr Wilfried Vossen, of Plant Location International - part of Price Waterhouse - 'the availability of incentives can play a crucial role when all the other technical and financial considerations have been evaluated. But, in themselves, they can never be decisive'.</p>

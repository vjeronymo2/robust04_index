			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TAX FOR ROADS LOSES; ANTI-GAY FORCES WIN;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: THE PROPOSED SALES-TAX INCREASE LOST BY 14,000 VOTES IN A  HIGHER-THAN-USUAL TURNOUT FOR AN OFF-YEAR ELECTION.  </P> <P> In an election that shattered dreams of a streamlined freeway system in this  century, Orange County voters decisively rejected a transportation sales-tax  increase Tuesday.  </P> <P> Measure M, the half-cent sales-tax boost for traffic improvements, lost by  about 14,000 votes -- or 53% to 47%. It was the second time in five years that  Orange County voters had rejected a sales tax-transportation measure, although  this time the outcome was a lot closer.  </P> <P> Its supporters were disconsolate.  </P> <P> "You have to be disappointed. Measure M would have allowed Orange County to  begin to see its way out of the congestion that's there right now," said former  county supervisor Bruce Nestande, chairman of Citizens for Yes on M.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, voters in Laguna Niguel handily endorsed a move to become the  county's 29th city.  </P> <P> In Irvine, anti-gay activists successfully repealed a portion of a new city  ordinance that offered human-rights protections to homosexuals. Irvine's  Measure N won by 52.6% to 47.4%.  </P> <P> In another local race that tested the strength of proponents of "traditional  values," however, candidates backed by religious fundamentalists and  conservatives lost by a near 2-to-1 margin in an effort to win seats on the  Newport-Mesa Unified School District Board of Trustees.  </P> <P> And voters in Fountain Valley recalled Councilman Fred Voss, who was arrested  last January for soliciting sex from an undercover officer on Harbor Boulevard.  </P> <P> Countywide turnout was 22%, Registrar of Voters Don Tanney said, a county  record for an off-year election that topped the previous high of 13% in 1987.  There was also a record use of absentee ballots -- more than 34,000 compared to  10,856 in 1987.  </P> <P> "For an off-year election, this is an excellent turnout. Normally an election  like this would be 12% but the presence of Measure M and the emphasis on  absentee balloting by Measure M folks accounts for the difference," Tanney  added.  </P> <P> Voter turnout for recent off-year elections has been averaging about 12%.  </P> <P> While Measure M was losing in Orange County, sales-tax increases were being  approved by voters in five other counties, including San Bernardino.  </P> <P> "Measure M had more going for it and a wider coalition than probably you can  get for any measure," said Tom Rogers, a San Juan Capistrano rancher who  switched sides and backed Measure M after opposing a similar, 1-cent tax hike  in 1984. "I doubt very much that there will be any possibility of putting a tax  increase on the ballot in the future."  </P> <P> Jerry Yudelson, one of the leaders of the campaign against Measure M, said its  defeat shows "you cannot take a bad plan and sell it to the voters, even with  $2 million. . . . We won a classic David-versus-Goliath struggle."  </P> <P> The half-cent sales tax increase was the only countywide issue on Tuesday's  ballot, with the election battle reflecting sharp divisions among Orange County  residents about remedying traffic congestion, the county's No. 1 problem,  according to public opinion surveys.  </P> <P> Measure M would have earmarked $1.325 billion for freeway improvements,  including $550 million to widen the Santa Ana Freeway from six to 12 lanes  about 15 years ahead of schedule. The fixed, 20-year plan also would have set  aside $1 billion for regional and local street projects, plus $775 million for  commuter rail and other transit programs, including subsidized bus fares for  the elderly and handicapped.  </P> <P> Fearing a replay of June, 1984, when a proposed 1% sales tax increase was  crushed, 70% to 30%, proponents of Measure M mounted a $2.4-million campaign  that included slick, flashy mail, thousands of telephone calls, and precinct  walks emphasizing that there was something for everyone in this year's measure:  growth controls; a citizen's oversight committee, and a broad mix of projects  to appeal to partisans of freeways, commuter trains and neighborhood  thoroughfares.  </P> <P> Most of the campaign dollars came from developers and the construction  industry, out of concern that ever-worsening traffic congestion would hurt  business, lead to economic stagnation and prompt a decline in Orange County's  quality of life.  </P> <P> The opponents, a ragtag assortment of anti-tax and slow-growth activists, were  able to raise little more than $10,000, mostly from individuals, for a few  thousand letters and a few hundred telephone calls. Borrowing a page from the  playbook used successfully by opponents of last year's countywide slow-growth  initiative, Measure M's critics tried to pit North County against South County  by telling residents of each area that the other one would benefit most from  the sales tax increase, which was expected to cost each Orange County resident  an estimated $50 to $75 a year.  </P> <P> But opponents also disagreed among themselves about what was wrong with Measure  M. Some argued against any tax hike. Several claimed that Measure M would  promote new growth. Others argued that Measure M's growth controls interfered  with developers' rights. Still others argued that some of the proposed traffic  improvements, such as adding car-pool lanes to freeways, lack merit.  </P> <P> Irvine's Measure N, meanwhile, was aimed at repealing a part of the city's  15-month-old Human Rights Ordinance that banned discrimination based on sexual  orientation in housing and employment.  </P> <P> In South Orange County, political attention centered on Laguna Niguel, which  was seeking to become the county's 29th city in balloting Tuesday. The  community of 40,000 is one of the last large unincorporated areas in South  County, where communities increasingly are seeking cityhood.  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel activists had battled for three years to bring the cityhood vote  to a ballot. During that time, Laguna Niguel lost a 1.5-mile coastal strip,  Monarch Beach, to Dana Point when that community incorporated last fall.  </P> <P> Laguna Hills, which borders Laguna Niguel to the north, narrowly lost cityhood  last June. Opposition was centered in Leisure World, where a majority of  residents opposed incorporation.  </P> <P> By contrast, no major opponent surfaced in this fall's cityhood campaign for  Laguna Niguel. A small group called Stop Cityhood did raise questions about  whether Laguna Niguel could afford to become a city. But Stop Cityhood leaders  switched sides last week and joined the pro-cityhood movement because a fiscal  analysis in October had convinced them that Laguna Niguel could operate  soundly.  </P> <P> Twenty-three candidates competed for five seats on the proposed city council  for Laguna Niguel. The winning candidates would take office and the city would  become official on Dec. 1.  </P> <P> In the hotly contested race for the Newport-Mesa Unified School Board, two  challengers campaigned as so-called Christian candidates seeking to emphasize  abstinence in sex education. The incumbents countered that the challengers were  extremists who might censor courses and withhold badly needed information about  contraception and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases.  </P> <P> And in the Orange Unified School District, voters swept three incumbents out of  office and elected five newcomers.  </P> <P> The Fountain Valley voters who recalled Voss were reacting to his arrest early  this year for soliciting sex from an undercover police officer in Santa Ana.  </P></p>

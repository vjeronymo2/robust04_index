			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Dorrell claims rising support for oil tax reform GOVERNMENT proposals to reform North Sea oil taxation are winning increasing support from the oil industry and its supply companies, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday. He was speaking as Shell, the largest North Sea operator, indicated a shift from a neutral to a mildly positive view of the tax changes, which have provoked widespread criticism. The Treasury minister said he had received many representations from the oil industry but none contained any points that the government had not already considered. He had no plans to alter the changes proposed in the Budget. He said there was growing acceptance that the new tax regime would result 'in a more rational use of resources'. Mr Dorrell also saw no need to amend the Budget's transitional arrangements. Although oil companies have complained that these will radically alter the tax treatment of legally binding commitments, Mr Dorrell said the companies should look at their obligations on a pre-tax basis. Backbenchers have tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill to try and cushion the effect of the tax changes. The bill is being debated next week. Shell UK, however, said that the life of large North Sea oilfields could be extended by up to 10 years because of the changes. The company had previously suggested the tax changes would lead to a reduction in exploration activity. Mr Chris Fay, managing director of exploration and production, said yesterday this would be more than offset by increased development work. The changes encourage companies to continue producing oil from the largest North Sea fields since they reduce the tax rate from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish tax for new fields. But exploration companies have argued that the changes will affect exploration by abolishing tax relief. Mr Fay said the estimate of 10,000 job losses from the proposals was 'wholly overstated'. Jobs will also be created by the additional development work, he said. Esso launched a new generation of cleaner diesel fuel yesterday that aims to cut smoke emissions, improve operating efficiency and even smell better than existing diesels. The fuel contains an anti-foaming agent and a deodorant.</p>

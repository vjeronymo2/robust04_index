			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HATE CRIMES IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS  </P> <P> We commend The Times for its front-page coverage (Oct. 26) of the Los Angeles  County Human Relations Commission's survey on hate crimes in the county's  schools. Public awareness of this pressing issue is a very important step in  developing appropriate response mechanisms to address it effectively.  </P> <P> While the survey is important in counting and publicizing hate incidents, it  did not -- could not -- gauge the increase in racial prejudice and interracial  tensions that underlie the incidents. Indeed, these attitudes are nearly  impossible to measure in a scientific manner, such as incidents and behavior  are.  </P> <P> Our own programmatic efforts to reduce prejudice and interracial tensions are  conducted in response to "felt needs" expressed by campus administration,  faculty and, sometimes, students. The school campuses with which we work in our  human relations camps and on-campus Project Brotherhood/Sisterhood all report  tensions between individuals and all racial and ethnic groups. The point is  that intergroup tensions may well be even deeper and more widespread than even  the report documents.  </P> <P> Proactive programs to reduce prejudice and intergroup tensions must be put at  the forefront of our public policy agenda and not just on school campuses.  </P> <P> Must we wait for Los Angeles to experience its own Bensonhursts before our  community and its public policy-makers see that racial tensions must be  addressed in a systematic proactive manner?  </P> <P> JERRY FREEDMAN HABUSH  </P> <P> National Conference of Christians  </P> <P> and Jews, Los Angeles  </P></p>

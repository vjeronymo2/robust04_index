			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Letter: Real reason for going wigless Sir, I do not know Louis Blom-Cooper, but as his neighbour for many years I have passed him on the stairs both with and without his wig. On balance, I should say his features are improved by it, for the wig is a handsome piece of design ('Dear Lord Chancellor. . .', June 29). Anachronism is a dangerous word to use out of the context of art and literature. I do not see how the recognised badge of the barrister, worn daily by thousands of people here and by many court officials in countries as far away as Africa can be called anachronistic. If it is, so is the collar and tie or any garment which was worn as long ago as last week. Nor is it fair to class the protagonists as rationalists and traditionalists. Some of the anti-wiggers' arguments are fatuous. Who ever was intimidated by a wig? Traditionalism is rational, and it is natural that in a legal system substantially based, like the constitution, upon precedent, lawyers should wear the ancient badge of their trade. Others do. Why has this campaign against the wig started now? Partly, I suspect, because the 1960s generation has grown up into high office but is still bent on chucking away our past. I fear a more sinister, if unconscious, motive. For years, British Rail's solution to falling standards has been an advertising campaign and a new image, in the belief that the public can be tricked. The legal profession has never before faced such a collapse in public confidence. The solution? Abolish the wig. While they are at it, why not start referring to clients as 'my customer'?

			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> 'FRIDAY 13TH' VIRUS FELLS COMPUTERS  </P> <P> 'Friday the 13th" computer virus struck personal computers in Britain today,  wiping out program files and annoying businesses.  </P> <P> Hundreds of personal computer users found the virus was programmed to delete  files on Friday the 13th, said Alan Solomon, managing director of S &amp; S  Enterprises, a data recovery center in Chesham. The virus, which might be a new  species, has been slowing down computers made by IBM and compatible models,  Solomon said. Telephone lines to the center were busy with calls for help from  businesses and individuals whose computers were struck by the virus, he said.  "It has been frisky and hundreds of people, including a large firm with over  400 computers, have telephoned with their problems," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Fleet upbeat on profits at failed BNE FLEET/NORSTAR Financial Group, the new proprietor of the bankrupt Bank of New England, is forecasting that BNE will generate annual earnings from operations of about Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m between 1993 and 1995. The prediction comes less than four months after BNE was declared insolvent and seized by federal regulators in one of the biggest bank failures in US history. Fleet, the Rhode Island-based bank, tempered yesterday's optimism with the warning that it expects BNE to post a loss of Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m in the first six months after the acquisition and to break even for the first 12 months. Fleet, in partnership with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the New York buy-out investment boutique which is one of the most powerful takeover players in the US, was awarded BNE's assets on Monday. Fleet will pay the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Dollars 125m as a premium, made up of Dollars 100m in preferred stock and Dollars 25m in cash. It will also inject Dollars 500m capital into the failed bank. In exchange, Fleet will take control of three BNE 'bridge banks', with combined assets of about Dollars 15bn. To finance the deal, Fleet will raise Dollars 683m of new capital, including Dollars 283m to be provided by investors advised by KKR. The FDIC said Fleet's offer was the least costly to the federal bank insurance fund. However, the FDIC will absorb most of the risk associated with the commercial property loan losses which drove BNE into liquidation. The FDIC will assume about Dollars 5.5bn of BNE's problem assets. Fleet will also be able to turn any additional problem assets over to the FDIC with minimal penalties during the next three years. Mr William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, yesterday said the agency plans to borrow between Dollars 5bn and Dollars 5.5bn from the US Treasury's Federal Financing Bank (FFB) as a result of resolving the BNE collapse. This is the first time that the FDIC has taken advantage of changes last year, authorising it to borrow working capital from the FFB. Mr Seidman said about Dollars 3bn will be repaid from the sale of assets and about Dollars 2bn will be losses. The FDIC has taken great pains to stress KKR's distance from the deal. It described KKR's involvement as 'a passive investor'. But this one of the first times that a group which is not a bank has been allowed to make a significant capital infusion into a leading US bank. KKR has been thwarted before in its attempts to invest in financial institutions, including its 1989 bid for the failed Texas banks of MCorp. In the case of the Bank of New England, KKR has already met political opposition from Representative John Dingell, the formidable chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr Dingell warned regulators that a joint KKR-Fleet bid might violate laws which prohibit commercial companies from owning banks. Under the terms of the Fleet deal, KKR investors will buy Dollars 283m of dual convertible preferred stock. This will be convertible into 16.03m common shares of Fleet/Norstar at Dollars 17.65 a share in no less than three years. In addition, KKR has warrants to buy 6.5m Fleet common shares. On a fully-diluted basis after Fleet's common offering, KKR's investors will have about 16 per cent of Fleet's non-voting stock. A KKR spokesman said the firm was attracted to the BNE bid by the strength of Fleet/Norstar's management. Fleet, which was founded 200 years ago and has assets of Dollars 32.6bn excluding BNE, is considered one of the best-run New England banks. The BNE acquisition will transform it into the biggest player in the region. Analysts said the FDIC's choice of Fleet against competing bids from BankAmerica and Bank of Boston was a compromise decision, which would have the least ramifications for the US banking industry.</p>

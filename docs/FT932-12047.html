			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / World Trade News: Chinese pledge reforms to join Gatt CHINA and the EC yesterday agreed further steps to expand trade and economic relations, with a senior Beijing official outlining an ambitious programme to liberalise the Chinese economy to prepare for membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner responsible for external economic relations, said the talks had been 'frank but fruitful'. He stressed that the pace of normalisation of EC-China relations would depend on Beijing improving its record on human rights, and expressed concern about Chinese violations of the 1987 international convention on torture. Sir Leon was speaking at the end of two days of talks in Brussels between senior EC officials and a Chinese delegation led by Mrs Wu Yi, Chinese minister for foreign trade - the first official visit by a Chinese trade minister in four years. The Chinese offered a polite rebuff to Sir Leon's pressure on human rights on the grounds that these matters were not part of the trade agenda. Sir Leon said this was expected, adding later: 'I don't expect the process (of normalisation) to be slowed down or stopped.' The most concrete result of the talks is the establishment of a permanent bilateral trade and economic working group which is likely to meet before the end of July. Tasks will include resolving differences over trade statistics, pinning down Chinese plans for liberalisation, and how they link with future relations with Taiwan and Hong Kong. The talks also produced an agreement to upgrade the current EC-China management development programme into a business school, to be based in Shanghai. During the talks, Sir Leon pressed China to open its market to EC imports and end discrimination against European car-parts, intellectual property, veterinary standards and joint vehicle production. He urged China to overhaul its restrictive regime on imports and help cut China's Ecu10bn (Pounds 7.9bn) trade surplus which is likely to rise this year. This was necessary for the EC to go beyond support 'in principle' for China's request to join Gatt, Sir Leon suggested. In response, Mrs Yi said China was willing to negotiate on vehicle joint ventures and offered a 'promising' answer on intellectual property. Last month, the EC took action to protect Community bicycle makers from alleged 'dumping' by Chinese producers.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Housing market falters as new mortgages fall THE RECOVERY in the housing market is faltering, according to figures for mortgage lending released yesterday by the Bank of England. The news will increase pressure on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, not to restrict further the scope or availability of mortgage interest relief in the Budget, because of the likely impact on the housing market. Figures for the third quarter of the year show that the number and value of new loans approved fell around 10 per cent compared with the previous three months. Some Pounds 13.5bn in 257,000 new loans was approved in the third quarter, compared with Pounds 15bn in 281,000 new loans from April through to the end of June. The figures also underline the message in other recently published statistics, that the banks are increasing their share of the mortgage market against the building societies. While the building societies had higher gross lending than the banks - Pounds 8.4bn against Pounds 5.9bn - their amount of net lending was Pounds 2.8bn while the banks' net lending was Pounds 3.2bn. The difference between the two sets of figures represents the extent to which mortgages have been cancelled. 'The figures suggest that building societies are not holding on to customers as well as they might do,' one industry expert said. The weakening of the market compared with the more optimistic signs earlier in the year comes despite continuing low interest rates. Last week the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents building societies and centralised lenders such as banks, warned Mr Clarke that the housing market was on a knife-edge. 'Consumers remain wary of committing themselves to house purchase ahead of the Budget,' Mr Adrian Coles, the Council's director-general, said yesterday. Lord Inchrya, the director-general of the British Bankers' Association, said that the reason for the banks' success in raising their market share was the popularity of fixed-rate mortgages, which accounted for 60 per cent of the lending. Total mortgage advances for the third quarter were Pounds 14.9bn compared with Pounds 14.4bn in the second quarter. Net lending rose to Pounds 5.5bn, up from Pounds 4.6bn in the second quarter. While the figures for the third quarter are higher than those for the same period last year, 1992 figures were affected by the drop in activity after the mid-August end to the holiday from stamp duty.</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'RODGERS' RETURNS TO BROADWAY  </P> <P> Dorothy Rodgers, the widow of Richard Rodgers, welcomed the renaming of a  Broadway theater for the composer of such musicals as "Oklahoma!" "South  Pacific," "The King and I" and "The Sound of Music."  </P> <P> "It's such a great day for Dick," she said Tuesday at the renaming of the 46th  Street Theater.  </P> <P> The Richard Rodgers Theater, built in 1924, has been home to some of Broadway's  biggest musical hits, including "Guys and Dolls," "Damn Yankees" and "How To  Succeed in Business Without Really Trying."  </P> <P> The theater now contains a permanent exhibit of Rodgers' sheet music, theater  posters and photographs.  </P> <P> During the ceremony, the composer, who died in 1979, was celebrated in song by  such performers as Rosemary Clooney, Debby Boone, George Hearn and Karen Akers.  </P> <P> "To name just one theater after Richard Rodgers isn't enough," said Rupert  Holmes, whose new play, "Accomplice," will begin preview performances at the  theater April 6.  </P></p>

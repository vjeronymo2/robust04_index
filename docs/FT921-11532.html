			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / The only way to go is up: President George Bush is pinning his re-election hopes on an upturn in the economy Mr George Bush offered a timely reminder this week of the powers of an incumbent president. No matter that his State of the Union address to Congress promised more than it delivered. By combining proposals for fresh reductions in long-range nuclear missiles with a mild fiscal stimulus to the US economy, Mr Bush showed how easily the White House can shape the debate before the presidential election in November. The initial judgment is that Mr Bush has read the public mood correctly. His response to a recession which has endured longer than any downturn since the 1930s may be modest, but it suggests strongly that the president is gambling on a recovery by early summer. The risk is that Mr Bush waited too long, and produced too little. If so, he may be destined to follow Herbert Hoover as the Republican president who sat on his hands and lost his bid for re-election against Franklin Roosevelt in 1932, ushering 20 years of activist Democrat presidents. In his fiscal 1993 budget submission to Congress, Mr Bush demonstrated beyond doubt that he believes that government intervention at this stage in the economic cycle would do more harm than good. This no doubt comforts Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who warned Congress again this week to avoid an election-year bidding war on tax cuts; but it also underlines that the White House has stuck to its view that one ingredient alone will haul the economy out of recession: confidence. This view has remained unchanged, in spite of the clamour among conservative Republicans, liberal Democrats and Democratic presidential candidates over the past four months for dramatic action, such as an immediate, across-the-board tax cut. What was striking about Mr Bush's State of the Union address on Tuesday night was the degree to which the president dwelt on the 'crisis of confidence' theme. 'There is a mood among us. People are worried, there has been talk of decline. Someone even said our workers were lazy and uninspired,' said the president, in a sly reference to recent criticism coming out of Japan. In the next breath, Mr Bush invoked Neil Armstrong's moon landing, the mid-west farmers whose granaries feed the world, and the men and women of Desert Storm. He concluded, to thunderous applause: 'Moods come and go, but greatness endures.' Appeals to American identity are as old as the republic itself; but Mr Bush's address suggests that the White House accepts the argument, prominent among certain commentators - mainly of the conservative persuasion - that Americans have temporarily suffered a collective loss of nerve following the end of the Cold War. The Democrat diagnosis is different. According to presidential candidates such as Mr Jerry Brown of California and, to an extent, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Americans are disillusioned with their political institutions, unsure about their job prospects, uncertain about the future. Others such as Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early front-runner when he is not seeking to escape old rumours of extramarital affairs, makes an even more explicit pitch to middle-class Americans whose living-standards, he says, have been squeezed during the Reagan and Bush administrations. In real terms, median family income has in fact remained stagnant since 1973. The difference today is that more Americans, particularly the 70 per cent of the population who earn between Dollars 20,000 and Dollars 90,000 a year, are worried about problems such as job security, foreign competition, poor education and, above all, the future direction of the country. Mr Bush addressed some of these fears in Tuesday's speech, focusing first on triumphs past and present: the American victory in the Cold War and the Gulf war. At times, he came within a whisker of jingoism - 'a world once divided into two armed camps now recognises one pre-eminent power, the United States of America' - but he ended with a clear message: 'Now we can stop making the sacrifices we had to make when we had an avowed enemy that was a superpower. Now we can look homeward even more, and move what needs to be set right.' These words - faintly evocative of Mr George McGovern's 'Come Home America' slogan in the 1972 presidential campaign during the Vietnam war - should not be misread: Mr Bush is no born-again isolationist. But it does mean that he is ready to accelerate reductions in defence spending which has seen hundreds of billions of dollars devoured over the past 40 years in pursuit of the arms race against the former Soviet Union. This week, Mr Bush ordered Dollars 50bn in defence cuts, beyond those already contemplated in the Pentagon's plan to reduce the US armed forces by 25 per cent over the next five years. Congress seems certain to push for heftier cuts of up to Dollars 100bn; but Mr Bush noted that by 1997, he would have cut defence spending by 30 per cent since taking office. 'This deep, and no deeper,' he warned. At the same time, Mr Bush announced further reductions in the US land- and sea-based nuclear deterrent, using a combination of unilateral and negotiable proposals. The reductions elicited an immediately favourable counter-offer from Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, who announced that he had ceased production of several long-range weapons systems. Further talks are planned today at the United Nations Security Council in New York and at President Bush's Camp David retreat; prospects for an early deal eliminating multi-warhead, intercontinental missiles, the most destabilising first-strike weapons, are good, according to US officials. The surprising thing was how little impact Mr Bush's nuclear proposals created at home. This may change if the president drives home his message that the end of the Cold War means an end to the nuclear terror and a new security to Americans; but the fact that the president's fiscal 1993 budget submission to Congress took precedence underlines how preoccupied Americans have become with their domestic troubles. Economic insecurity has become Public Enemy Number One. The striking lesson from this year's budget submission to Congress is how limited is the number of tools that Mr Bush has at his disposal for tackling these fears. This is underscored by the substantial deterioration in the outlook for the Federal budget deficit, both in the short and long-run. This year's deficit is expected to reach a record Dollars 400bn, compared with a projection of Dollars 281bn this time last year, and recent estimates of Dollars 350bn. More seriously, the administration has abandoned hope of achieving a balanced budget in the medium term: the deficit is not expected to fall significantly below Dollars 200bn (about 3 per cent of gross domestic product) over the next five years, according to Mr Richard Darman, budget director. These deficits - a substantial portion of which were run up in the 1980s under the Reagan/Bush administration - are a crippling legacy to future generations. They also help to explain why Mr Bush's own 'growth package' is so modest. Mr Bush has confined himself to proposing a few short-term measures, including a temporary tax credit for first-time home buyers of up to Dollars 5,000; a temporary 15 per cent investment tax allowance; an increase in the personal exemption by Dollars 500 for each child; a cut in the capital gains tax cut, now 28 per cent, to 15.4 per cent; and an executive order to employers to withhold less in federal taxes from workers' pay-cheques - a move that will give the average family Dollars 350 per worker, but that will be clawed back by the government next year. Just before Christmas, optimistic souls at the White House hinted that Mr Bush might be ready to support conservative Republican calls for income tax cuts as part of a Dollars 60bn Keynesian-style reflation. The price would have been breaking the Dollars 500bn budget deficit reduction agreement with Congress struck in 1990; but the potential political benefit would have been a dramatic Republican initiative to pull the economy out of recession. In the event, the president accepted his advisers' warning that busting the budget agreement would so unnerve the financial markets that interest rates would rise, countering the Fed's policy of using progressive reductions in the discount rate to lower the cost of borrowing. And so began Mr Bush's waiting game, tempered by judicious leaks of the growth package aimed at creating the impression of a caring, activist president. This delay may hurt Mr Bush next month when he faces a crucial first primary election in New Hampshire, one of the states hit hardest by the recession. But the reality is that the president has handed economic policy to Mr Greenspan at the Fed. Populist Democrats and Republicans may rail against an unelected Fed running the country; but it does allow several tactical advantages from Mr Bush's standpoint. First, the president can cast the Democrats as the big spenders, a tactic which has worked in three successive presidential elections. The administration has not, as feared, lifted the discipline of the budget agreement: caps on discretionary spending programmes remain in place (although Mr Bush is willing to amend the act to allow defence funds to be used as an offset if Congress objects to other cuts needed to finance the child tax exemption). Second, Mr Bush will play the tax-cut card with all the fervour of his predecessor, Mr Ronald Reagan. His appeal for a cut in capital gains often sounds hollow; he knows that the Democratic price is a tax on the wealthy which he is not prepared to accept. Third, the White House wants to avoid specifics, particularly on controversial issues such as health care. 'It's the black box strategy,' says Mr James Thurber, head of Congressional Studies at American University in Washington DC. 'The idea is to avoid showing your hand and make Congress deal with the detail. If things go wrong, Congress gets the blame.' Democrats will counter that Mr Bush's rhetoric far exceeds what he has delivered in his three years in office. Mr Bush, who calls himself the 'environment president' and 'education president' has almost as many titles as residences in the US. Democrats, who believe that the 20 years of scepticism about government's ability to solve problems is over, call him a 'do nothing' president. Mr Clinton has shown himself well capable of challenging Mr Bush on his home record, particularly on education. By contrast, Mr Patrick Buchanan, the pugnacious conservative Republican who is standing against Mr Bush in the New Hampshire primary on February 18, has his own retort: 'Are you better off than you were four years ago?' This is the question that Mr Reagan used so effectively against President Carter in 1980. Knowing that the answer is a firm negative, Mr Bush will play to his strengths as commander in chief of Desert Storm, the decisive leader who still towers above his democratic rivals. Yet the truth is that Mr Bush has staked his political future on early signs of economic growth. Like the economy, he has only one way to go; upwards.</p>

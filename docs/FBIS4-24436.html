			<p>Success'   <F P=102>   OW3005065294 Beijing XINHUA in English 0631 GMT 30 May 94 </F> <F P=103> OW3005065294 </F> <F P=104>  Beijing XINHUA </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] Zhengzhou, May 30 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank  financed resettlement project has proved to be a stunning  success as the first group of more than 10,000 residents have  moved to a new settlement area to make way for a large scaled  water control project at Xiaolangdi on the middle reaches of the  Yellow River.    The 570 million U.S. dollar resettlement project should be  held up as an example to follow in future resettlement, said a  World Bank official, after an on-the-spot investigation of the  resettlement area.    The first group of resettlers have moved into 12 new  villages  where water and electricity supply is available.    "We used to live in cave dwellings," a local peasant Tu told  the World Bank official. "Now the conditions are much better.  [no closing quotation mark as received]    Persisting in the principle of resettlement through  development, the local government has built houses totaling  220,000 square meters and created a dozen hectares of new land.  The 12 new villages are accessible by roads. In addition, more  than 800 local peasants have been given jobs in more than 30 old  and new industrial enterprises.    The 300 households from the Xiaolangdi village of Mengjin  County, Henan Province, have moved into new detachment houses  [as received]. The village has also built a primary school and  a kindergarten. Last year the village invested three million  yuan in a new steel rolling mill which may produce 40-million  yuan worth of products a year.    Located 40 km north of Luoyang city, in central China's  Henan  Province, the Xiaolangdi water control project, China's second  largest after the Three Gorges Dam on the middle reaches of the  Chang Jiang, will play an important role in diverting the Yellow  River, handling floods, generating power and controlling  sediment, according to experts.    The project will displace 180,000 rural people of 190  villages in eight counties of Henan and Shanxi Provinces.    In addition, five million sq. m. [square meters] of houses  and cave dwellings, and seats of 11 township governments, 250  factories and enterprises will have to be moved.    The officials in charge of resettlement of Xiaolangdi water  control project said the relocation of residents from the  construction area completed so far was only a very small part of  the entire resettlement work for Xiaolangdi Dam, and greater  efforts should be made to relocate the remaining 170,000 rural  population from the dam area.    According to the resettlement plan, 154,000 more rural  residents will have to be relocated by the turn of this century,  while the remaining 17,000 will be relocated during the second  phase during 2010-2011 period.    The local officials added that supervised management system  will be introduced in resettlement work of Xiaolangdi water  control dam, which means that specially-assigned engineers will  carry out an overall supervised management on relocation of  resettlers, and social and economic appraisal organizations are  also supposed to give an objective and fair assessment of the  resettlement, in a bid to protect the legitimate rights of  resettlers.</p>

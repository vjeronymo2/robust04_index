			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Reservation System Breaks Down: The computerized reservation system for  American Airlines failed for nearly 12 hours, hindering flight scheduling for  the airline's passengers around the world. John Hotard, a spokesman for the Ft.  Worth-based airline, said the Sabre II computer reservation network went down  shortly after midnight and was reactivated just before noon Friday. The  computer network, based in an underground bunker in Tulsa, Okla., drives  American Airlines' computerized reservations system worldwide and provides  services to more than 14,000 other entities, including car rental companies,  hotels and a third of all U.S. travel agencies. There was no immediate  explanation for the failure.  </P></p>

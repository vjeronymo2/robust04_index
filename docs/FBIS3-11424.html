			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate of the  ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA], hoped the left  will reflect in the face of his undisputed victory and decline  to participate in a runoff election to prevent further  polarization in the country. In many countries--and this is no  secret--other forces decline to concede to the majority party,  Calderon Sol stated during a news conference this evening at a  Salvadoran hotel. The ARENA candidate insisted, however, he is  still awaiting the official results of the Supreme Electoral  Tribunal [TSE] on Sunday's general elections, in which he  claimed he received 300,000 votes more than his opponent, Ruben  Zamora of the leftist coalition. Calderon Sol also affirmed  ARENA has won over 200 municipalities out of the country's 262  and the majority in the 84-seat assembly. The former San  Salvador mayor said the Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front and its allies, the Democratic Convergence and the  National Revolutionary Movement, have an electoral ceiling of 25  percent. After describing the coalition as a leftist potpourri  of all tastes and flavors, he acknowledged it represents a  segment of society; in this respect, he said, this coalition  will play a role, have the right to participate, and can be a  democratic opposition. We hope it can.    He described as a crass plot the reports by certain sectors  of his alleged ties with death squads, which he vowed to fight  when he consolidates himself as the winner of the elections and  takes office. He added he will support the inquiries on the  groups the Joint Group has been conducting since last May and  that he will request the cooperation of the Spanish police, the  Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Scotland Yard.    Commenting on the elections, he termed it a wonderful civic  holiday, adding if there is a runoff election, the TSE must  resolve the irregularities that took place in the electoral  registry and the organization of the elections. If we have a  runoff, we have to demand the TSE better organize the elections,  as the TSE must assess the problems that arose and ensure a  large voter turnout.    According to the UN Observers for El Salvador, Onusal, close  to 25,000 Salvadorans were unable to vote, because their names  did not appear on the electoral lists. It also reported there  were other minor incidents.</p>

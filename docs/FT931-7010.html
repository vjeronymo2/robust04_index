			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / In-car guidance system could help Scots beat traffic jams CENTRAL SCOTLAND could be-come the first place in Britain where cars will be equipped with guidance systems to direct motorists along the best route to their destination and provide an instant warning of traffic jams. Cars would be fitted with devices loaded with electronic maps using technology similar to that of a cruise missile. Drivers would type in their destination and receive route instructions by voice simulator or display. The in-car device would suggest alternative routes when traffic jams were reported and would follow the creation of an integrated traffic management system. The system would monitor main roads in the greater Glasgow area and those north and south of the Forth estuary including Edinburgh. Lord James Douglas Hamilton, the Scottish Office roads minister, is expected today to name the four companies which have been shortlisted to bid for the upgrading and expansion of the two existing traffic management systems in these areas. The four, pre-selected from 20 applicants to tender for the project, are thought likely to include GEC, which has developed traffic management and in-car guidance systems, and Siemens. The first stage will cost about Pounds 12m and the traffic management project will eventually total Pounds 33m. The new system will use electronic detectors under roads to measure traffic flows more accurately than the present systems. The data will be fed to a central computer and information about unexpected hold-ups, and alternative routes, will be displayed on new roadside indicator boards. It will also be fed to local radio stations for instant broadcast to cars with radios fitted to receive dedicated traffic information. Many newer car radios have an RDS (radio data system) button to receive traffic messages. Once the new traffic management system is in place, probably by 1995, the central computer can be used to support in-car guidance systems which would be introduced on a commercial basis. The Scottish Office will issue a consultation document today on how this could be done. The existence of the central computer reduces the entry costs for potential commercial operators of in-car guidance systems, and therefore the Scottish Office wants to find a way of financing the entire project which recognises the advantages to both the public and private sector. It is considering leasing the traffic management system to the company which installs it and allowing that company to operate it under contract. In last November's Autumn Statement, the government eased the rules on mixing public and private finance in infrastructure projects. Although a small pilot scheme for in-car guidance is likely to be launched in a part of London next year, the Glasgow and Edinburgh areas could be the first in Britain to have a comprehensive in-car guidance system. A system named Trafficmaster, which informs drivers of the location of hold-ups, already operates around the M25 and is spreading to other motorways.</p>

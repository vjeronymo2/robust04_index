			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (5): Small engine for growth - Industrial workshop profile, JenLaser JenLaser is one of those tiny Handwerk businesses, or industrial workshops, which economists believe will slowly help to drive the the east German economy towards recovery. Already, more than 1m people are employed in eastern Germany's Handwerk sector. It consists of 138,500 businesses which vary in size from four (the number who work at JenLaser) to 200. Total turnover for this sector in the eastern states increased last year by 15 per cent to DM72.4bn last year compared with the previous year. The Central Association for Germany's Crafts and Trades reckons it already accounts for 10 per cent of gross domestic product. JenLaser's small workshop is in the small village of Schloben situated in the forests of Thuringia. It was the brainchild of Mr Dieter Schumann and two former colleagues from the Carl Zeiss optics enterprise in Jena. Mr Schumann, 42, had worked there as a physicist until 1991. But instead of waiting with thousands of others for the inevitable redundancy pay-off, he left willingly, because, he said, 'the longer I stayed, the more opportunities I would miss'. He and his colleagues, Mr Stephan Zenkar and Mr Volker Kurze, raised DM50,000, the minimum required to set up a limited company. Mr Schumann, unlike many other east Germans, had decided not to spend his savings on a new car. His loyal old Wartburg station wagon is an integral part of the business. 'It's our delivery car,' said Mr Schumann. The three then approached the banks with their plan - 'we wanted to set up a laser cutting business which would provide high quality cut steel to enterprises,' explained Mr Schumann. 'We needed a loan of DM500,000 to buy new equipment,' he said, taking out a photo of his large house which he had offered as security. His subsequent dealings with the banks were his foretaste of western capitalism. An official at the local Dresdner bank in Jena told the trio that the project was a waste of time. An official at the Bayerische Vereinbank said they should invest in second hand machinery but that a loan would take a few months. Finally, the Commerzbank offered the loan in 14 days. 'We were on our way,' said Mr Schumann. They rented a couple of farm sheds from a west German who had bought part of a former LPG, or state farm, and then set to work - 'we were working 12-14 hours a day throughout 1992 and paying ourselves about DM1,500 per month. It was tough going. We had to find a niche.' At first they considered tapping into the machine building industry in Stuttgart - 'but we soon realised that after 40 years, these managers had built up very close contacts with suppliers and their customers.' Instead, they used old contacts built up with Carl Zeiss, combed the eastern states of Thuringia and Saxony, and secured nearly 100 customers. Then came the need for more capital and a fourth employee. 'We needed another credit line of about DM750,00. This time, the local Sparkasse helped and, with cheaper interest rates backed by the European Union's Regional Development Fund, they bought new laser cutting equipment from a Japanese company. By the end of last year, JenLaser had a turnover of DM1m, and had paid off nearly 75 per cent of the first loan. This year, Mr Schumann reckons turnover will be between DM1.2m and DM1.4m. 'We are making a profit,' he said (without saying how much) adding that JenLaser's two-pronged strategy of reasonably close markets and competitive costs was paying off. 'Our markets are within 200 km radius - and all in eastern Germany. Our advantage is that we have a fast turnaround - a matter of two days. We deliver the products ourselves.' They had also managed to keep costs and overheads down. 'Our prices are between 60 per cent and 80 per cent of west German prices,' said Mr Schumann. Now that the capital investments have been made, the company of four people believes it has secured a niche in providing high quality laser cut steel products. 'We are operating at nearly 100 per cent capacity,' said Mr Schumann. 'The biggest challenge facing us is finding ways to keep costs down.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Shulman] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- Azerbaijan wants to have  "transparent" borders with Russia and is concerned over border  posts which are now being constructed on the frontier between  the two former Soviet republics.    The concern was voiced by Azerbaijani parliament speaker  Rasul Guliyev who had a meeting with Russian State Duma speaker  Ivan Rybkin on Tuesday.    Guliyev recalled that earlier it had been planned to create  a  free trade zone on the Russian-Azerbaijani border.    The speaker also called for a greater Russian role in ending  the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. He said much in this respect  depends on the Russian peace-keeping efforts.    "We greatly want that Russia says its important word in this  respect", Guliyev stressed.    Political stabilisation in both countries can be promoted  through better economic ties, according to him. "We count on the  understanding of Russian partners" in this respect, he added.</p>

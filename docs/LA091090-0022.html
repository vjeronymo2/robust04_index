			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> AN EXHIBIT UNITES ARTISTIC HERITAGE;  </P> <P> IDEAS: AQUI Y ALLA PROVIDES DISPLAYS AND HAS ARTISTS MEET THIS MONTH AND DURING  OCTOBER TO DISCUSS CONTEMPORARY CHICANO ART.  </P> <P> When Los Angeles artist Francesco Siqueiros visited colleagues in Mexico City,  he discovered something exceptional.  </P> <P> "I was taken by their group projects and by the discussions they held every  week," Siqueiros says. "It was stimulating talking about art issues."  </P> <P> He was so moved by their group sharing and cooperation that he wanted to tell  the world about it. Or at least Southern California. "How could I bring these  artists to Los Angeles?" he asked himself.  </P> <P> Siqueiros pictured the two art communities meeting each other and opening the  lines of communication through an exhibition and art workshop. He proposed the  idea to Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions in 1988 but he says he "got a lot  of bureaucratic run-around from them. They didn't know what to do with this  project.  </P> <P> "It was more than putting together a show just for viewing. I wanted something  with the intellectual friction and historical tension that exists between the  two countries," Siqueiros says.  </P> <P> Mentioning his idea to friends at a party, Siqueiros was told to go to Edward  Leffingwell, then the new director at Barnsdall's Municipal Art Gallery in  Hollywood. Leffingwell, Siqueiros learned, had been exploring a similar idea.  </P> <P> Yet, it was Siqueiros' vision of getting together onto the same stage Mexican  as well as Mexican-American artists that won Leffingwell's interest. He  extended the city's support through the auspices of the Los Angeles Cultural  Affairs Department, with additional financing from the Los Angeles Festival.  </P> <P> What Siqueiros and Leffingwell, along with co-curator Gabriela Cortines, have  assembled is Aqui y Alla (translation: Here and Over There), an exhibition of  contemporary works by Nahum Zenil, Diego Toledo, Eloy Tarcisio, Ruben Rosas,  Mario Rangel Faz, Ruben Ortiz Torres, Monica Castillo of Mexico City and Victor  Estrada, Yreina Cervantez, Anthony Zepeda, Margaret Garcia, John Valadez, Frank  Romero and Patssi Valdez of Los Angeles. The exhibit will run through Nov. 4 at  the Barnsdall Park Arts Center. In addition, the artists will meet this month  and next in several panel discussions on contemporary Chicano art.  </P> <P> The exhibit will also be shown in Tijuana and Mexico City.  </P> <P> Leffingwell promises that the exhibit "will be about ideas."  </P> <P> Like those of Patssi Valdez of East L.A., a painter who now deals extensively  with on-site installations.  </P> <P> "I like to work with chance," she says. "Life is chance. We never know what's  going to come in life."  </P> <P> Chance is not an element of Yreina Cervantez's art. The daughter of farm  workers, she paints images of her inner pain and conflicts.  </P> <P> "My work uses personal symbolism and cultural symbolism," the Los Angeles  artist says, "but it gets back to identity, which is so important.  </P> <P> "We have to be open up to our experiences. We're all very different, but there  are basic truths. Art manifests changes in the community. As artists, we have  responsibilities. We are visionaries."  </P> <P> Facing the past and placing it into perspective, as Cervantez has done on a  personal level, is what the Chicano art movement is about, she says.  </P> <P> However, Victor Estrada of Los Angeles warns against any temptation to  categorize the Chicano art movement as solely political. To do so, he says,  implies that Chicano artists cannot do anything else.  </P> <P> "What happens to the ability to express one's self? The social issues are going  to come out in the work anyway," he says defending his abstract style. "Some  artists make their art specific, and in other's the issues just come out.  </P> <P> "The more room there is for difference, the greater power art has. If you try  to control culture, it's another form of facism. Artistically, people have to  assume their right to exist. Freedom is not given, it's taken."  </P> <P> But master printer Anthony Zepeda of Los Angeles says he could never be  political with his work.  </P> <P> "My art is more like poetry," he says. "It's the only way I know how to express  myself."  </P> <P> Zepeda says he views the Aqui y Alla exhibition as an expression of ethnic and  artistic pride.  </P> <P> "I'm interested in this particular show because I want my father to come see  it," he says of his father who migrated to the United States in 1905 during the  Mexican Revolution. "He's essentially more Mexican than me. I want him to be  happy that it's happening."  </P> <P> Information: (213) 485-4581.  </P></p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Arts: Feelgood movies give way to darker themes - As easy targets such as right and left-wing tyrannies collapse, British cinema has found a new villain / Political correctness - Cinema in 1993 Many a job has its own occupational dangers, many of them readily insurable. They can range from errant factory machinery to collapsible coalfaces, from tennis elbow to housemaid's knee to athlete's foot. Film critics, though, are a disadvantaged group. Once or twice a year they are set upon, violently and uninsurably, by friends or colleagues who cry 'Why did you send me to such-and-such a film?' or 'I took my entire family to see Bloodbath At The Abattoir on the strength of your review' or 'About that small, subtitled Armenian film, Nigel, that you recommended at the ICA . . .' There is no insurance against people who go ape after taking your advice. All one can point out helpfully and unapologetically - I do so now in response to those FT colleagues who have recently fulminated at me about The Piano - is that film reviewing is not an Exact Science. A critic can be secure in his own opinion; he can shore it up with arguments and even cite the international prizes a film has won. But still people will bear down with murder in their eyes, asking why they were sent to a film with a heroine who does not speak, a back-end-of-nowhere setting (turn-of-century New Zealand bush) and a whole lot of rampant sex and violence. We will return to The Piano shortly, round about Ten Best time. But this was a year, to console the aggrieved, in which many films had a built-in Feelgood Factor. Among them: Much Ado About Nothing, The Wedding Banquet, Sleepless In Seattle and even that feminism-made-easy British costume extravaganza, Orlando. Feelgood Movies are not to be sniffed at - or rather, if they are good, they are to be sniffed at. The finest FMs are Kleenex-intensive charmers which push the viewer through a forest of readily recognisable emotional problems (love, birth, bereavement) before reaching the clearing of the Happy Ending. Feelgood films, as the above list shows, need not be empty-headed. They can be essays in sharp-eyed sentiment, in mirth-as-therapy and in multiple resolution, as secure in their own genre tradition as Shakespearean comedy. Comedy - broad comedy - was something we wanted more of in 1993. But it was not the year's mood. The highlights were Robin Williams running amok as the voice of Aladdin's genie, Bill Murray refuting the truth that 'tomorrow is another day' in the time-warp comedy Groundhog Day, Billy Crystal as a stand-up comic breaking them up in the Borscht Belt in the underpraised Mr Saturday Night, and - well, that was about it. Next year already looks stronger, with Woody Allen's best comedy in years coming in January, Manhattan Murder Mystery, and Wayne's World 2 arriving to rescue WW1 withdrawal-symptom sufferers. But in 1993 darker waters from deeper wellsprings kept gurgling to the surface. The year began with horror and serial killing: from a bloodier-than-usual Dracula to rabies-inducing modern fables like Reservoir Dogs and Man Bites Dog. And later, our overworked censor was tested by three British films high on sexual anarchy and political or moral incorrectness: Mike Leigh's Naked (rape, misogyny), Peter Greenaway's The Baby Of Macon (multiple rape, multiple misogyny, plus murder and mutilation) and Andrew Birkin's The Cement Garden (masturbation in glorious colour). What ever is British cinema up to? Responding, I suspect, as much world cinema is today, to an age in which new complex despotisms are replacing the old simple ones. Easy targets like right-wing tyranny (South Africa) and left-wing tyranny (Soviet Union) are collapsing all around us, so where does freedom of thought and action look for a threat to itself? To the new villain: liberal-humanist dogma, aka political correctness. All three UK movies come to the rescue of a world they see being hijacked by the gung-ho puritanism of the PC crowd, and/or by the refusal of today's trendy opinion-makers to incorporate Real Human Nature into their calculations about Proper Human Behaviour. The attack on political correctness is a good cause. But of course good causes do not always make good movies. Of these three British films one was an overblown dirge (Greenaway's), one an underblown mess (Leigh's) and only the third (Birkin's), strengthened by the vertebra of an Ian McEwan story, had a wit and insight to go with its gleeful iconoclastic impulse. Ironically, just to prove that There Are No Rules, the year's best British feature had more than a touch of the PCs itself: Ken Loach's Raining Stones, a tale of salt-of-the-earth Northerners battling for survival with honour in post-Thatcher England. But oddball humanity ended up beating down prescriptive humanism. Ironically, too, the British year ended, at once consolingly and chillingly, with the perfect elegance of a James Ivory film, The Remains Of The Day. No political controversy here, except about 60-year-old pre-war appeasement matters. And the film brought with it the assurance that when all else fails in British movies - and it often will - Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson will always be there to bale us out. Oscars, luvvies? Two low-budget British films which will not feature in any Oscars ceremony, and which also climbed clear of the PC debate - were Derek Jarman's Wittgenstein and Blue. The first was the year's most playful bio-pic, the second a miracle of mind over lack-of-matter. What can you do, Jarman seemed to ask, with nothing but a few noises on a soundtrack and 76 minutes of solid-blue screen? Answer (if you are Jarman): everything. A quick sweep around the rest of the world must suffice as an antidote to UK parochialism. The best continental European film was Krzystof Kieslowski's Three Colours Blue: a character study of bereavement as intense as a surgical probe. The best low-budget Central American movie was Robert Rodriguez's El Mariachi from Mexico: a monstrously inventive and funny mock-Western. Best Canadian film: Guy Maddin's Alpine-Gothic pastoral pastiche, Careful. Best Far-Eastern films: Zhang Yimou's The Story Of Qiu Ju and Ang Lee's The Wedding Banquet, two delicately finger-painted films from countries more used to the florid action gesture. Best southern hemisphere movie: yes, you knew we would get back to it - The Piano. Casual nudity, not-so-casual violence and a ringingly horrible amputation scene. No wonder my work colleagues give me funny looks. These are all things that do not happen in Victorian costume films: except that they do now, after Jane Campion's. If this cinema round-up has been obsessed with one film more than any other, it is because The Piano is the movie of 1993 that points most fiercely, most convincingly towards the year 2000. It is a 'feminist' film that flies beyond arid rhetoric into pulsing romanticism. It is a costume film that dares to see what lies beneath the costumes. It is a movie that takes the 'international' casting of the modern musical-chairs movie world - Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel as Victorian Scots in New Zealand? - and makes it work triumphantly. Above all, The Piano dissolves all the old outworn enmities between 'art cinema' and 'entertainment cinema'. It marries a passionately compelling story to a symbolist landscape and psychological vision as detailed and richly-worked as anything in Bergman. You say you did not like it? Then see it again. Ten Best Films of 1993: The Piano (Jane Campion) Blue (Derek Jarman) Three Colours Blue (Krsyzstof Kieslowski) Raining Stones (Ken Loach) Reservoir Dogs (Quentin Tarantino) The Wedding Banquet (Ang Lee) Dracula (Francis Coppola) Careful (Guy Maddin) Groundhog Day (Harold Ramis) The Cement Garden (Andrew Birkin)</p>

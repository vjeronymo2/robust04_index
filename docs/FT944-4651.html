			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Exxon finalises Indonesian gas field pact Exxon, the US energy group, has finalised details of its Dollars 40bn agreement with Indonesia to develop the giant Natuna natural gas field. Mr Fritz Voight, vice president for gas, this week dismissed industry rumours that key details of the deal signed last month in Jakarta with Pertamina, the Indonesian state energy company, still need to be resolved. He said Exxon considered the agreement complete, and 'there is no need for further negotiation'. A formal signing of the contract will take place after January 1. The preliminary agreement did not include full details because Exxon was waiting for beneficial changes to Indonesia's tax laws which only come into force next month, he said. Natuna, which has been the subject of negotiations since 1980, will be Exxon's first big foray into the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market in Asia. The field, located in the Natuna Sea about 1,250km north of Jakarta, is the largest undeveloped hydrocarbon resource in south-east Asia. It is equivalent in size to the Norway's Troll gas field, the largest in western Europe. The timing of the Natuna deal has surprised many industry executives. They say the persistence of relatively low oil prices undermines the economic viability of such long-term, capital intensive projects. Demand forecasts for LNG vary widely. In addition, a number of existing LNG plants, which supply Japan and the other main Asian markets, plan to expand capacity, while Middle-Eastern producers, such as Qatar, have also embarked on large-scale LNG projects targeted at Asia. Mr Voight agrees there is little need for additional LNG supplies in Asia up to the end of the decade and that Exxon's demand forecasts for Japan are 'slightly more optimistic' than those of the Tokyo government. But he denies there is a danger of an LNG surplus. Exxon believes there will be a 'significant need' for Japan to increase its LNG imports for power generation between 2000 and 2010, the period in which Natuna is due to come on stream. It also predicts demand will grow in Taiwan and South Korea. Mr Voight said China was likely to be an attractive market for Natuna gas. He said it was impossible to give a start-up date for the project until Pertamina signs up an initial buyer. Exxon estimates it will take eight years to complete the first phase of the project from the time the first sales agreement is reached.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Complete" news conference by Bosnian President Alija </F> Izetbegovic with unidentified correspondents in Sarajevo on 11  June -- recorded]    [Text] [Izetbegovic] The main motive for my tour was to see  army commanders at a military base in central Bosnia. I saw all  corps commanders, except, of course, Army Brigadier Dudakovic,  who is in Bihac [words indistinct] their military situation.  There are two possible developments: that there is a cease-fire  [words indistinct] in Geneva; and that there is no cease-fire.  We discussed both possibilities, and we are ready to face both  possibilities. I can say that I am glad and satisfied that we  were ready for the continuation of fighting and for the  cessation of fighting -- temporary, as it was concluded.    This lull could be very handy both for the Serbs and for us.  We will use this lull to prepare ourselves for any possibility.  We are not sure that Karadzic's Serbs are ready for a just  peace. I think that at the moment there are no signs of them  being ready for it. So, I am not a great optimist, although I  really hope that we will restore peace, to avoid further  bloodshed and suffering. I must admit that I am not optimistic  that there will be peace. But, miracles have happened. This  would be a miracle, but our army will be ready not only to  defend, but also to gradually liberate land.    [Question indistinct on lifting of arms embargo]    [Izetbegovic] Yes, a lot of attention has focused on that  issue and with good reason -- especially (?in principle). It  only remains for us to see what this will mean in practical  terms. It will be very difficult to implement such a thing, and  we are aware of that. We analyzed how it could be possible  that, for example, American weapons really could arrive in  Bosnia one day. There are many difficulties -- of a procedural  nature and of a technical nature. Of course, the difficulties  are mainly of a procedural nature because I do not think that  America will go for a unilateral lifting of the embargo.  Therefore, they will probably have to go through the UN  Security Council, where they will have to encounter Russia,  Great Britain and so on -- great enemies of the lifting of the  embargo. It is possible that a repeated vote could result in a  binding decision, but I think that in that case there would be  different difficulties on the Russia-America line. There will  certainly be many difficulties and our people should not take  this for granted.    However, despite all that, this decision is of great  importance. Above all, it is a major political victory for us,  and also -- if this is of any importance at all -- a victory for  a certain principle of justice, that is, the right to  self-defense. In practical terms, the importance of the  decision will be -- if not in the direct supply of arms to  Bosnia-Herzegovina -- that it will be possible to use the  decision as leverage for achieving other things. I think that in  this respect the decision will be very important. For example,  the decision could be leverage which could provide, not for the  supply of arms to the Bosnian Army, but for the impounding of  the arms from the other, aggressor's army. This is a proposal  which we have been upholding for a long time, and which is known  as our theory of balance. The problem of arms here is in fact  not whether we will be given weapons. The problem is in  establishing balance.    We have had a complete imbalance in armaments for three  years. I say three years because it is just coming to three  years since the war began. People forget that it did not begin  two, but three years ago with a campaign in Slovenia; then it  was continued in Croatia and so on. Silajdzic said again  yesterday that a medicine which had not worked for three years  must be the wrong one.    They stubbornly continue saying that the medicine [words  indistinct]. The embargo retains an imbalance in armaments and  encourages (?the other side), due to its technical superiority,  not to be interested in joining serious negotiations. Therefore  there are no serious negotiations, and consequently no peace.  We say: Alright, let us take a different approach. Take the  arms from them, so that there is a balance in armaments and  serious negotiations and, ultimately, peace.    Therefore, this decision by the American Congress could have  an impact on adopting this second approach -- to impound the  arms from the aggressor's army. After all, such a proposal is  included in UN Security Council Resolution [number indistinct].  The only problem is implementing it.    I said this recently in talks with American senators. I  will use this opportunity to explain that idea of mine because  it has been misinterpreted. I said -- as we have succeeded in  establishing a 20-kilometer zone without Serbian arms in  Sarajevo -- we could have a zone of 200 kilometers, that is,  100-km in radius with a center on some other location in Bosnia,  such as Zenica [words indistinct]. Bosnia would be completely  covered. In that zone the aggressor's side would be ordered to  withdraw its weapons and threatened with air strikes if it fails  to comply.    This does not require the deployment of soldiers, which has  met with wide-spread feeling of opposition in the West anyway.  We are not asking for that, but it would be very effective  [words indistinct] and lead to peace. Finally, with the help of  this decision, there are ways of preventing Serbia and  Montenegro from further supplying the aggressor's army in  Bosnia-Herzegovina with weapons. Our diplomacy is working on  all that.    [Question indistinct]    [Izetbegovic] It gains in importance every day. First of  all, Islamic countries are not great military powers, but they  have now become involved in this conflict because they have sent  soldiers to join UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. But their  main role has been in providing humanitarian aid to  Bosnia-Herzegovina, of course, primarily political assistance  and support, moral support. That is not unimportant and it  should not be underestimated, although it does not yield  material results immediately. The Islamic countries have also  provided great humanitarian aid.    However, there is one weapon which we have not used yet and  we will probably use it. The awareness of the following is  growing in Islamic countries: Bosnia is becoming a test of the  West's attitude towards Islamic countries. No Western country  which fails to display a fair stance in this critical phase of  the Bosnian crisis -- either in respect of the continuation of  the war or a just peace -- no Western country can count on the  friendship of Muslim countries and Muslim nations. On the other  hand, I believe that Muslim countries and Muslim nations will  consider as hostile any Western country which in these  circumstances fails to adopt a fair stance on the Bosnian  crisis. Not only because what is at issue here is the defense  of democracy in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but because this is  primarily an attempt to destroy the Muslim people here. This is  clear to Islamic countries.    I will personally do everything I can [words indistinct] use  all my influence to make every Muslim and every Muslim leader,  every nation, realize that what is going on here is the war  against Muslim people. Therefore, they should make it clear to  the governments in the West, they should tell them: We will act  towards you in the same way you act in this crucial phase of the  denouement in Bosnia.    [Question indistinct]    [Izetbegovic] Yes, I had the opportunity to be a witness of  that difficult haggling in Geneva. I was happy when I heard the  outcome, and I saw it as a great diplomatic victory for us. I  would also like to congratulate our delegation, headed by Mr.  Ejup Ganic.    First of all, we managed to rid Gorazde of chetniks, owing  to  our perseverance and our refusal to negotiate before they  withdraw. That is a big achievement because they had no  intention of leaving the area. We have correspondence proving  that those on the right bank of the river Drina claimed they  would never leave. They were forced to withdraw.    That is one thing, and the other thing is that, as you know,  our attitude to this issue was respected. There were two basic  issues we defended in Geneva: The cease-fire can be temporary,  not four months, but four weeks long. That was accepted. The  second issue was that there should be no deployment of UN  protection forces between the lines, which would freeze the  lines. We said that we would do everything and take good care  not to freeze the lines. As you know, that has not happened.  The Serbs had to accept only routine control by UN forces, no  deployment. We all know what the deployment of UNPROFOR between  us and them could mean -- a final political solution. As you  can see, we did not make this mistake, and I think that this  round of talks [sentence ends; after a few seconds of silence,  station carries music]</p>

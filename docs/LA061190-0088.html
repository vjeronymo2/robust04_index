			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIT-AND-RUN ACCIDENTS SOAR TO RECORD LEVEL  </P> <P> Kenny Ly, a cherubic 4-year-old who could count to 100 and recite his ABCs,  never saw the speeding blue-green sedan as he stepped off the curb last April  onto a quiet San Gabriel side street.  </P> <P> The front bumper of the car ripped Kenny from his mother's hand, and hurled him  68 feet. The driver sped off, leaving behind only a shattered headlight and a  few specks of paint embedded in the boy's jeans. Kenny was dead.  </P> <P> Since then, detectives have spent dozens of hours staking out the crime scene,  searching the neighborhood and even debating whether hypnosis might help  Kenny's parents recall more about the accident.  </P> <P>  Los Angeles Times  </P></p>

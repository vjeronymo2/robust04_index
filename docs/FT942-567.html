			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (15): Intuition has been rewarded - Supplier profile - Alan Cane charts the progress of an expanding and unusual networking company / Madge Networks Cisco, SynOptics, 3Com and Cabletron; the communications revolution has thrown up a raft of fast-growing, ambitious companies listed on America's Nasdaq stock market. Among them is Madge Networks, perhaps the most unusual networking company to have emerged in recent years. Founded in 1986 by Robert Madge, a British architectural journalist and entrepreneur with no technical background but a sharp appreciation of the potential of computer networking, it is now registered as a Dutch company with research and development in the UK and substantial marketing offices in San Jose, California, and Tokyo. The company was listed on Nasdaq, the world's largest over-the-counter market, last August through an initial public offering which raised Dollars 30m in cash net of expenses. Madge says the aim of the Ipo was not to raise money but to raise the status of the company - 'we didn't have a need for cash; it was more a natural progression.' There was also the problem that the company was becoming uncomfortably large and if the offer had been left much longer, it could have been a difficult proposition for Nasdaq, which specialises in start-up companies, to digest. Why Nasdaq, rather than London? Madge says it was a matter of conforming to the norms of the electronics industry - 'no specialist networking company is listed outside the US. It was the natural place to be. We started with a disadvantage because we missed out on the two or three-year period during which the US venture capital community promotes new issues, so we had more talking to do. Now Madge Networks is reasonably well understood by investors. US investors are very knowledgeable in this area.' And the transformation into a Dutch company? Convenience: listing as a UK company would have thrown up tax and share complexities. Madge specialises in token-ring networking, the technology championed by International Business Machines for local area networking. It develops and markets a range of hardware including network adapters, hub and router adapters and FDDI adapters. Token Ring and Ethernet are the two key LAN technologies. Ethernet depends on a collision detection mechanism to ensure transmissions pass securely through the network; on a token network, the right to transmit depends on possession of a software 'token.' Token ring technology, Madge says, is well suited to large organisations with widely dispersed groups of users - 'it was a new business area in 1986,' Madge says. 'We built a position as a second source to IBM in token ring. We believed the technology would give us opportunities that others were avoiding, afraid of the power of IBM.' His intuition was rewarded. Revenues of Dollars 10m in 1990 grew to Dollars 145m by 1993; in the first quarter of the current year revenues were Dollars 45m, up from Dollars 29.7m in the same period the previous year. The company was capitalised earlier this year at over Dollars 400m and Madge has become one of the UK's richest men. The challenge for successful young companies, especially those in the high technology arena, is to maintain growth and profitability and keep on top of technological developments. Madge points to heavy investment in research and development amounting to almost Dollars 11m in 1993 and a close relationship with customers - 'we realised that customers needed more than technology so we have been developing customer service; we take an interest in solving their problems. 'It is not the kind of consultancy for which we charge. Virtually all our revenues come from product sales together with licensing fees from other vendors. We don't have to sell consultancy; we are able to command premium prices because of the quality of our technology.' In 1989, for example, Madge was one of the first companies to add intelligence to its adapters which enabled them, for example, to handle the processing necessary to communicate between different kinds of equipment - 'we created this concept and it has become the biggest sector of our business,' Madge says. Although the company remains wedded to token ring technology, it is now looking beyond it to the technologies of choice for the future. It is putting resources into Asynchrononous Transfer Mode, a telecommunications technique which both telecommunications companies and computer companies are exploiting with a view to providing multimedia services. 'ATM will be the core technology in a few years time,' according to Mr Madge. 'We know some things about the direction in which the technology is evolving and we know what we can do with that technology. Our customers can tell us what they think they are going to want to do about technology. We can arrange the marriage of the two when the products are available.' How does the company want to be assessed by the business world? 'We measure ourselves not only in financial success but in terms of our reputation. We want people to think highly of us,' Madge says.</p>

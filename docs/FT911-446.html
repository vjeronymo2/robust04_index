			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Menem reopens corruption probe Argentina's President Carlos Menem, under fire again for corruption in his government, has ordered the reopening of investigations into the first of a series of corruption scandals that have rocked his government all year, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires. Inquiries were halted last week for 'lack of evidence'. Mr Menem ordered an independent watchdog agency to reopen the case of Swift-Armour SA, an American-owned meatpacker. In January, the press published a letter from the American embassy protesting that an unnamed official had asked Swift for a bribe.</p>

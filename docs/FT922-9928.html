			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Leaders in Bonn reject talk of grand coalition TALK of a grand coalition between Christian Democrats and Social Democrats to tackle Germany's daunting unification problems is spreading through Bonn, in spite of denials from all the key party leaders that they want anything of the kind. Mr Gerhard Schroder, Social Democrat (SPD) prime minister of Lower Saxony and one of the party's leading state 'barons', called yesterday for just such a solution on the grounds that the current Christian Democrat (CDU)-Free Democrat (FDP) coalition of Chancellor Helmut Kohl was no longer capable of running the country. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister and leader of the Bavarian-based Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party of the CDU, said in an interview with Stern magazine that the coalition partners must solve their differences before the summer break, or they might fall apart. And Mr Wolfgang Kubicki, state leader of the FDP in Schleswig-Holstein, gave them less: just six weeks to decide common policies on the key questions of budget cuts, dealing with asylum seekers, financing old-age care, and fighting crime, or face collapse. Without the FDP, the CDU and CSU would lack a working majority in the Bundestag by 13 votes: they currently have 319 seats in the 662-seat lower house of parliament. The SPD could not put together a rival government without at least two partners, the FDP and the Progressive Democrats, the successor-party to the Communists in East Germany. The SPD has 239 seats, the FDP 79, the PDS 17 and the Greens just eight. The only obvious alternative solution would be a grand coalition of CDU/CSU and SPD, as was formed in 1966. It is a solution so far flatly rejected by both Mr Kohl and the entire national leadership of the SPD, which heard Mr Schroder's proposal yesterday and rejected it. The one sign of action, however, is that the SPD leadership has agreed to meet the government partners for cross-party talks on May 27  - to discuss the financial burden-sharing between the central government and the states, and probably other key differences which might require a constitutional change to resolve: asylum and ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union.</p>

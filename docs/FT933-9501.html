			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / US to track Somali attackers GENERAL Colin Powell, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said yesterday American forces would pursue those responsible for the deaths of four US soldiers in Mogadishu over the weekend, Reuter reports from Washington. 'Obviously we are interested in going after any of those responsible for the incident if we can find out who they are,' Gen Powell told reporters. On Sunday President Bill Clinton vowed to take 'appropriate action' after Somali gunmen ambushed a UN peacekeepers' convoy and killed four Americans - the heaviest loss of US life since American troops landed in Somalia in December. A faction loyal to fugitive warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed, blamed by UN special envoy Jonthan Howe for recent 'terrorist attacks', has denied responsibility for the US deaths. Gen Powell said he had no announcement of any new US policy in Somalia but said security would be tightened by US forces. About 4,000 US troops remain in Somalia, down from about 22,000 earlier this year.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DODO LIVES  </P> <P> Jon Carroll's review of Christian Vaisse's "Living in Mauritius" (Nov. 25) has  a curious error.  </P> <P> Former (not now) President (Leopold) Senghor of Senegal is described as  President of Mauritius. Actually, he has never even visited Mauritius, where  there are very few black Africans.  </P> <P> The island, once the home of the extinct dodo bird, is overwhelmingly Indian  with a Hindu majority, along with a minority of white people of French  extraction.  </P> <P> To its credit, Mauritius is the only member of the Organization of African  Unity which has twice voted a government out of office and then let the new  opposition come to power.  </P> <P> NED MUNGER  </P> <P> Professor of African Politics  </P> <P> Caltech  </P> <P> PASADENA  </P></p>

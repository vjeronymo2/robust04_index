			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOSE WILD AND WONDERFUL SPORTSCASTERS  </P> <P> The point about TV sportcasters in Los Angeles is not whether the new, yuppie  wiseguys are better or worse than the old-style, straight-news types: It's that  all the sportscasters are inconceivably bad ("Send In the Clowns" by Steve  Weinstein, Jan. 22).  </P> <P> The Jim Hill/Stu Nahan types are dull, and they indulge in ex-jock cronyism  with endless marshmallow interviews with their buddies. Plus they never ask the  tough questions.  </P> <P> The yuppie wiseguys such as Fred Roggin and Keith Olbermann never ask the tough  questions either. Instead we get bad jokes and, in Olbermann's case, a snide,  ugly, superior attitude we all remember from our undergraduate days.  </P> <P> Roggin is basically a Roy Firestone clone with his interminable "humorous"  video clips.  </P> <P> Yet none of these guys presents a threat to local TV news departments. Their  clowning is harmless, because nobody takes L.A.'s happy-news,  personality-driven news teams seriously anyway.  </P> <P> CHARLES CHICCOA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Interfax is in possession of a copy of the amended  draft of a Yeltsin-proposed civic accord to be discussed at a  Friday meeting between the president and leaders of various  factions. IF Note: Yeltsin himself told regional leaders on  Wednesday that the Friday conference would be a final one before  the signing ceremony takes place on April 28.    The compilers of the draft have now renamed the paper into  Civic Accord and deleted any reference to the 1991 and 1993  events as a cause for a possible social confrontation.    However, they retained the clause binding the signatories to  refrain from any destabilizing constitutional amendments though  allowing possible amendments in following directions: human  rights guarantees, improved power sharing, local self-  management and federalization. The clause banning campaigns in  favor of early general or presidential elections is also kept  intact.    Unlike its original version, the new draft sets down in  detail the obligations that the federal authorities will  undertake in political and economic areas.    The Federal Assembly is expected soon to adopt legislation  on  elections, referendums, political parties, the citizens' right  to form associations and hold demonstrations and marches or take  other social or political actions. The two houses of parliament  are also to be responsible for creating a legal groundwork to  overcome the country's social and economic crisis and adopting  statutes on the government and budget, land code and other acts.    For its part, the government is committed to curb inflation  and ensure financial stabilization in 1994: secure higher  investment and set conditions for economic growth: ensure the  implementation of social partnership principles and so on.    The section of the paper dealing with national security  matters has been enlarged. The draft now provides for Speakers  of the two houses to be involved in national security council  meetings and for appropriate committee heads to take part in the  proceedings by interdepartmental council commissions.    The original version authorized a conciliatory commission to  raise the question of expulsion of an offending party from the  list of signatories for violation of the accord and bring  proposals on the accountability of an offender little short of a  job dismissal or withdrawal of a parliamentary mandate.  However, the new one says the conciliatory commission to made  up of representatives of the president, government, the two  houses of parliament, Yeltsin's public chamber and Russian trade  unions is called "to monitor the observance of provisions laid  down in the accord".    The draft's new section on a signing ceremony indicates that  would be signatories include the president, parliamentary  speakers, prime minister, regional leaders and official  representatives of parliamentary factions, Yeltsin's public  chamber and Russian trade unions with other parties to follow.    Head of the compilers' team Dr Boris Topornin of the Russian  Academy of Sciences said the softening of a wording on the  compliance with the accord was one of the main amendments. He  said the authors had rejected a proposal to set up a monitoring  body to be vested with almost legal powers to punish the  offender.    "The main guarantee is not legal or political responsibility  but the electorate's attitude. If the public accepts the  accord, the signatories could hardly risk their reputation,  rating or authority by reneging on their commitments", Topornin  believes.    He stressed that none of the representatives of  parliamentary  groups had raised any objection to the paper as a whole while it  was being drawn up. Topornin referred in particular to a  Communist Party representative and quoted him as saying that  "when scrutinized, the latest draft can serve as a basis for  further work".    At the same time, Topornin thinks the Communists are most  likely to give a negative response to the paper. On  preconditions set by leaders of the Communist Party and other  groups, he said "these have no bearing to the accord as such. I  am used to those accusations and reprimands prompted by one off  political considerations rather than by the quality of the paper  itself".    In a speech to the lower house of parliament on Thursday,  Topornin described the paper as being the result of a compromise  and non-partisan approach reflecting the interests of the  mainstream public sections.    For his part, presidential aide Georgiy Satarov says the  document provides for mechanisms of ensuring internal stability  and enabling to defuse confrontation between the government and  parties at an early stage.    Leader of the Agrarian Party Mikhail Lapshin said his party  would not sign the accord because of finding it unacceptable.  He said the accord was leading away from the constitution  because of denying the possibility of constitutional amendments  or early elections. He likened the paper to a stranglehold on  political parties.    The mere signing of the paper can hardly result in civic  accord, one of the leaders of the Republican Party Vyacheslav  Shostokovskiy said speaking on behalf of the Yavlinskiy-led  alliance. He said the proposed paper was intended to divert the  legislators and government form genuine politics and genuine  reforms. However, Shostokovsky denied his faction was opposed  to any accord as such pledging commitment to seek it in  day-to-day business and law making.    Leader of the Russia's Choice Party Yegor Gaydar said his  alliance would sign the paper. However he and his associates  "are well aware of the slim chance of reaching comprise with  those who want to re-issue ration cards and build up the world's  longest queues or drag the country back to the cold war period".    In his view, the accord is intended to bind signatories to  act within the framework of the constitution and existing laws  but not to resort to violence or confrontation.    Aleksey Leushkin of the Democratic Party of Russia which is  opposed to the draft said his party would shape up its stand  after a national congress on Saturday. He lashed out against  the draft on the grounds it failed to provide answers to crying  issues. This also includes a question whether economic problems  are to be resolved by a review of the budget or government  reshuffle. Leushkin likened the paper to a trap since both the  president and government who were unable to lead the country out  of crisis wanted to shift the responsibility on others.    There was also a negative reaction to the accord from LDP  [Liberal Democratic Party] and Communist Party leaders Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy and Gennady Zyuganov. IF Note: In a speech to  regional leaders on Wednesday, President Boris Yeltsin said the  number of those who opposed the accord was insignificant. "We  will not insist they sign the accord but will make their names  known to the public at large as people who care least about  Russians and Russia's revival", he said.    His spokesman Vyachelslav Kostikov told a news briefing on  Thursday that the president was "optimistic about the chances of  the accord being signed". He said Yeltsin was "aware that not  everyone will sign the paper but is confident that  representatives of the mainstream groups will approve it". On  some misunderstanding about the signing procedure, Kostikov made  it clear that April 28 must be seen as the date of both signing  and implementing the paper. In the meantime, it will be open  for signing by all parties concerned, he said.</p>

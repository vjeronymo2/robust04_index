			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Neil Darbyshire, crime correspondent: </F> "Amphetamine Seizures Rise by Over 300 Per Cent"]    [Text] Almost a tonne of amphetamine tablets and powder  were seized by police and customs last year, according to the  National Criminal Intelligence Service.    At least half the total of 995 kilos was seized by customs  officers, an increase of 342 per cent on 1992. But the majority  of the 5,000 individual seizures were made by police inside the  country.    Although 90 per cent of the drugs were manufactured in  Continental Europe, particularly Holland, illicit amphetamine  "laboratories" were uncovered in Britain.    It is now estimated that one in 10 people aged 16-29 has  tried amphetamines at least once.    While amphetamines and cannabis remain the most frequently  misused drugs, crack cocaine is the one most closely associated  with extreme violence.    Crack users and dealers committed 10 murders and 21  attempted  murders in London alone last year, according to an NCIS survey.    Police are also concerned about the increasing use of  injected steroids. While not illegal, there were many examples  of users committing rape, extreme domestic violence and other  forms of serious assault.    Other seizure figures were:    Cannabis customs officers seized 53,145  kilogrammes of cannabis, up 19 per cent on 1992, while police  discovered 5,600 kilogrammes, a rise of 21 per cent.    A relatively new and highly potent form of cannabis known as  "skunk" is becoming much more widely available, police said. It  is up to 30 times as powerful as normal cannabis resin and  produces a strong hallucinogenic reaction.    Cocaine seizures fell sharply. This was largely  due to the statistically distorting effect of two extra large  seizures in 1992. Demand was not thought to have dropped.    Customs officers seized a total of 750 kilos, a fall of  nearly 70 per cent from the 2,250 kilos recorded during 1992  which included two of about a ton each. Police seized about 20  kilos, a rise of 28 per cent on 1992.    Crack seizures are becoming more widespread  outside London, making up about 50 per cent of the seizures at  street level. The weight of seizures rose by more than 90 per  cent to 2.8 kilos, a new record.    Heroin seizures rose by a quarter to 560  kilogrammes, another 120 kilogrammes was seized on the streets,  an 88 per cent rise largely influenced by a single seizure of 37  kilogrammes in London.    The average street purity was about 28 per cent, with the  most common cutting agents being paracetamol and caffeine. The  latest figures for addiction related to 1992.    They show an increase of 19 per cent on the previous year  with a total of 24,703 registered addicts, of whom 9,663 were  newly notified. Twelve per cent were addicted to cocaine.    LSD seizures fell by 11 per cent. But the total  still amounted to 275,000 doses.</p>

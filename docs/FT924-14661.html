			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria (8): In a class by himself - Eric Frey examines the political talents of Mr Jorg Haider AMONG Europe's new crop of right-wing populists, Austria's Mr Jorg Haider is in a class by himself. Better than any Franz Schoenhuber in Germany or Jean-Marie Le Pen in France, the leader of the Austrian Freedom Party (FPO) has managed to spread his xenophobic and anti-establishment message and still stay in the political mainstream and maintain respectability. By tapping adroitly into Austrians' growing frustration with the blatant patronage practised by the two main political parties, the Social Democratic Party (SPO) and the conservative Austrian People's Party (OVP), Mr Haider has brought the FPO's share of the vote from about 5 per cent six years ago to nearly 20 per cent - and made his party the leading force on the right in Carinthia and in Vienna. With his endless attacks on established institutions and personalities, he dominates Austrian politics and forces the other parties on to the defensive. The press is constantly analysing, criticising or commending Mr Haider's statements, offering him a steady flow of publicity. Even his enemies admit that Mr Haider is a unique political talent. Full of boyish charm and eloquence, the 42-year-old lawyer seems to find the appropriate words for almost every audience. At times he hints at an affinity to some Nazi ideas and policies, especially in Carinthia where nationalist feelings are strong. Last year he referred to deserters of the Wehrmacht as national traitors. But he emphasises his party's liberal programme in front of the national audience. The inconsistencies in his statements are reported in the press, but do not seem to bother the voters. Even his recent vacillating on the question of Austria joining the EC appeared not to have dented his popularity. After calling for years for a quick entry into the EC, Mr Haider jumped on the growing anti-Maastricht bandwagon in August and suddenly declared his opposition to the Community. In a lecture series in several German towns, in front of cheering, mostly right-wing crowds, he warned of the Brussels juggernaut and the 'European standard man.' When grumbling in his own party about this volte-face become too loud to ignore, he changed course again and reaffirmed his commitment to the EC. Some political analysts, seizing on his remark that Austria is 'an ideological abomination,' wonder if he is a true Germanic nationalist or just an opportunist playing with nationalist sentiments still prevalent in Austria. While the FPO chairman often condemns the crimes of the Third Reich, in spontaneous remarks he veers dangerously close to Nazi rhetoric, which has tended to hurt his political career. His praise for the 'proper employment policies of the Third Reich' during a heated debate in the Carinthian assembly in June 1991 was clearly provoked and instantly rescinded. But it gave his coalition partners the opportunity to force him out of the governor's chair where, by all accounts, he had been extremely effective. Political analysts are also uncomfortable with his use of aggressive phrases, such as 'eradication of venom'. Since taking over the party leadership in an internal coup d'etat in 1986, he has ruthlessly purged the party of opponents or independent thinkers. Following a policy confrontation in February, the party chairman, Mr Norbert Guggerbauer, and the deputy leader, Mr Georg Mautner-Markhof, resigned. Last month, Mr Ludwig Rader, the party's leader in Steyrmark, was expelled after criticising Mr Haider's behaviour. Mr Haider has tried, unsuccessfully so far, to lure the conservative OVP away from its uneasy coalition with the Social Democrats. But his party is still gaining new voters, mostly among workers and small shopkeepers. The influx of refugees from Eastern Europe and former Yugoslavia has given it new momentum. The established parties have found no effective recipe against his appeal. Mr Haider repeatedly asserts that he will be chancellor within six years. And if any of Europe's populist right-wingers have a chance to come to power, it looks as if it could be him.</p>

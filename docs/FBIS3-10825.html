			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 13 Mar (DPA) -- The Colombian  Government described today's legislative elections as a  "success," stating the voting signified the triumph of peace and  democracy over the violence perpetrated by those who sought to  curtail citizens' rights.    According to Government (Interior) Minister Fabio Villegas,  "the Colombian people's civic-mindedness triumphed in the face  of a minority which, hopefully, has heard the majority's  repudiation of their violent practices."    The official referred to in this regard the actions of  communist guerrilla groups that in the past weeks increased  attacks to sabotage the elections.    Villegas said the subversives perpetrated several attacks,  which all the people repudiated. He referred to especially the  kidnapping of 32 electoral authorities in the eastern Department  of Santander, which caused the suspension of the elections in  the small town of Carcasi.    A little more than 17 million people over 18 years of age  were eligible to vote, but the small turnout at the polls, a  habit of Colombians that this time increased due to intense  rain, raises the fear of increased abstentionism.    There was a 45-percent abstentionism in the legislative  elections held in 1990. This figure increased to 70 percent in  1991 when a new Congress was elected, after the National  Constituent Assembly, which promulgated another Constitution  that year, promoted the dissolution of the legislative body.    The voters elected Ernesto Samper as the presidential  candidate of the ruling Liberal Party, because, according to  unofficial reports aired on radio networks, he obtained at least  46.3 percent of the votes.    The Liberal Party elected its candidate in an internal  "Popular Referendum" availing itself of the infrastructure of  the elections. If the results are confirmed, as it is taken for  granted, Samper will be the Liberal Party presidential candidate  who will run against Conservative Party presidential hopeful  Andres Pastrana in the May elections.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: TWA's finance director quits to join Atlas Air Trans World Airlines, the US carrier that has run into a series of setbacks since emerging from bankruptcy last November, suffered another blow yesterday when its chief financial officer unexpectedly quit. Mr Richard Shuyler is the fourth top executive to have left the carrier this year. In the last few months the company has also lost a chairman, a vice-chairman and a senior vice-president. TWA said Mr Shuyler had accepted a similar position at Atlas Air, a cargo airline based in Golden, Colorado. His departure leaves the company without a chief financial officer because he left without waiting for a successor to be appointed. The latest development comes soon after the launch of a cost-cutting programme at TWA aimed at offsetting a decline in revenues. Mr Shuyler, who was in charge of the programme, had asked all departments to cut their budgets by 10 per cent in an effort to cut Dollars 100m from costs. The plan is expected to involve heavy job cuts  - a difficult proposition to sell to employees since they own 45 per cent of the company's shares.</p>

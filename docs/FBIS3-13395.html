Palestinian sources  told our correspondent Moti Amir that this date was proposed to  Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin by U.S. officials.    The sources believe that agreement was reached on this  issue.  The talks will resume in Washington and in Paris. The sources  told our correspondent that the PLO's agreement to renew the  negotiations was made conditional on the Security Council's  resolution regarding the Hebron massacre, and was given after  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin promised the Americans that the  negotiations, as well as Israel's redeployment in the Gaza Strip  and Jericho, would be completed before 14 April.</p>

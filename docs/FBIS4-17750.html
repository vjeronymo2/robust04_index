			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Armed conflicts near  Russia's borders, which in some places are threatening to spread  onto its territory, represent a direct threat to the country.  In this connection, Russia's President Boris Yeltsin stressed  today at a meeting with the heads and employees of the Foreign  Intelligence Service [FIS], that the Russian intelligence  service must reveal, in good time, the moving forces behind each  conflict and the opportunities for settling it by political  means and by compromise.    Speaking about the intelligence service's tasks in  guaranteeing the Russian Federation's national security, the  president noted that the country's leaders need in-depth and  accurate assessments of foreign states' approaches toward Russia  and the processes occurring there. "It is important to uncover  and skilfully frustrate outside attempts to influence the  situation in our country," Boris Yeltsin stressed.    The president considers that the intelligence service can  also make a weighty contribution toward securing Russia's  economic security. In its economic interests, he continued, it  is much more important to guarantee free access to other  countries' markets for goods and other Russian output. Boris  Yeltsin is convinced that the resolution of this problem is an  important task both for foreign policy and for the intelligence  service.    Russia's president also named the uncovering of organized  crime links with European and American criminal clans as an  important task for the FIS. Partnership links with foreign  secret services may play a useful role in combating  international organized crime. The FIS, Boris Yeltsin stated,  "has such powers and is able to use them, as we know."</p>

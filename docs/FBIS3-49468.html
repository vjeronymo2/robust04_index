			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Horn, Hungarian Socialist Party </F> chairman and former foreign minister, by Jan Zizka in  Bratislava; date not given: "We Want To Reach an Historic  Settlement With Our Neighbors"]    [Text] [Zizka] Improving relations with neighboring  countries is one of the key issues in your party's foreign  policy concept. Does this mean you are dissatisfied with the  policy adopted by the present Hungarian Government toward your  neighbors?    [Horn] Close relations with Western integrative groupings  is, of course, a priority of our foreign policy concept.  Considerable progress has already been made here. We have been  a member of the Council of Europe for more than two years and we  have observer status in the Western European Union. On the  other hand, there are a number of problems in the economic  sphere. Many of the Western companies that enter our market,  unfortunately, suspend production in a number of branches  instead of concentrating on restructuring outdated capacities.  We receive second- or third-rate technology from the West. In  some cases, this technology represents a risk to the  environment. On the other hand, the opportunities we have for  gaining access to Western markets are somewhat limited. This,  however, makes no difference to our priorities. Improving  relations with its neighbors is another key issue for Hungary  and its security. Our main objective is to achieve a historic  settlement. We have to agree that the issue of the borders and  the historic peace treaties is closed for us. Nevertheless, we  desire -- or request -- that the rights of the Hungarian  minorities in neighboring countries be respected. There can  only be a real improvement in relations if these two aspects are  combined. Apart from this, we should not allow economic  cooperation to be limited hereafter to neighboring countries,  although, following the collapse of CEMA [Council for Mutual  Economic Assistance] and the Warsaw Pact, this is -- to a  certain extent -- a natural phenomenon.    [Zizka] Do you also regard the Czech Republic as a neighbor?    [Horn] Yes, it is an indirect neighbor; there are  significant traditions here from the era of the former  Czechoslovakia. In view of the difficulties in cooperation with  the West, we should pay more attention to the economic  integration of Central Europe. The first step should be the  establishment of joint banks, joint enterprises, and the  expansion of mutual trade. Whether the specific form of  expanding trade is considered modern or not is not so important.  If possible, it is necessary to implement a form of barter. It  is important to find a market for our products. If our party  assumes responsibility for the government after the next  elections, it will definitely pursue a very active policy toward  our neighbors.    [Zizka] Nevertheless, if you are talking about improving  relations with your neighbors, then -- obviously -- you are not  happy with current government policy.    [Horn] Two sides bear responsibility for the current  situation -- not only Hungary. Understandably, some of our  representatives should avoid making speeches that offend our  neighbors. However, the representatives of neighboring states  should also somewhat alter their stance toward us. As a  representative of one of the left-wing parties in Hungary, I  would like to point out that the Socialist International has  incorporated into its program a item on guaranteeing collective  rights for minorities. Guaranteeing linguistic and cultural  autonomy and self-administration still does not automatically  mean separatism.    [Zizka] What, then, is the difference between your party and  the government in the minority issue?    [Horn] In principle, there are no major differences here. I  think our policy would be imprinted with greater activity. It  is essential to approach mutual talks more actively and to  initiate specific proposals for improving relations. That would  probably be the main difference.    [Zizka] What is your party's view regarding the initiative  by local organs in south Slovakia to establish an autonomous  Hungarian region?    [Horn] It is necessary to specify exactly what comes under  the demand for autonomy. In my opinion, this would mean that  they could really make decisions on the issues that concern  them. The majority of people in this region are Hungarians. It  is logical, therefore, that they are demanding something that is  already standard in Europe.    [Zizka] You said you regard the Czech Republic as an  indirect  neighbor. Not long ago, however, you proposed that a regional  group be established comprising Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, and  Austria -- but not the Czech Republic.    [Horn] For some time I have been of the opinion that the  Czech Republic is not very interested in the Visegrad Group.  This was perhaps due to the fact that your representatives  wanted to distance themselves a little from our region. I  understand this; there are many conflicts here and perhaps it is  better for the Czech Republic not to be here. Maybe Czech  representatives feel that, if they do not enter into the initial  stages of integration with us, they will be able to integrate  themselves more quickly into West Europe. Your Prime Minister  Klaus has made a number of statements in this regard. On the  other hand, however, we bear in mind the fact that you signed  the free trade zone agreement in Krakow.    [Zizka] The opinion prevails in Prague that the original  aims of the Visegrad Group have already been fulfilled.  President Havel has also said this.    [Horn] In my opinion, it is impossible to describe any aim  as  fulfilled. Economic cooperation has just begun and we still  have far to go before this aim is fulfilled. It is necessary to  maintain and further develop the Visegrad Group's activity. It  would be desirable to include other countries -- Slovenia and  Croatia, especially if the war there comes to an end. The  participation of Austria is very important. The issue involves  cooperation throughout the entire Central European region.    [Zizka] You proposed recently that the Hungarian parliament  begin discussing the issue of entry into NATO. At the same  time, however, you emphasize that this must be decided in a  referendum.    [Horn] I suggested this because many people doubt that  joining NATO would be beneficial to our country and even  consider it to be a bad move. It is not true that there would  be a nationwide consensus on this issue. I was intent on making  sure that parliament considers this issue. It does not only  depend on the people understanding what NATO membership will  mean. It is such a serious matter that it is impossible for any  government to request admission without the prior agreement of  parliament. As far as a definitive, official request for  admission is concerned, in my opinion, it has to be preceded by  a referendum.    [Zizka] What is your party's view on possible entry?    [Horn] I, for example, am definitely in favor. As foreign  minister, I made a statement at the beginning of 1990 in which I  called for closer relations with NATO, relations that would  result in membership. This met with great opposition from many  people. In the end, the right wing also added its support to  entry. I think many people do not realize what NATO membership  actually means. It is necessary to clarify this in  parliamentary discussions and to consider the commitments and  rights arising from it.    [Zizka] The Americans have come up with the "Partnership for  Peace" security initiative. What do you think of it?    [Horn] I have reservations about it. This proposal is in  fact a temporary solution. It is intended to show us the  workings of NATO, how we could restructure our armed forces, and  the kind of commitments arising for us from mutual cooperation.  I am not explicitly opposed to it, but I have no illusions in  this context. It is -- sui generis -- a manifestation of the  fact that the NATO countries also do not know what to do with  Central and Eastern Europe. On the one hand, they are aware of  the great pressure from our countries and of the request for  security guarantees. On the other hand, they are hesitating;  they do not want to provoke Moscow. They will be even more  cautious following the recent events in Russia. It will be a  long time before we have real security guarantees in our region.    [Zizka] You said that you do not rule out the possibility  that your party will enter into government after the elections.  Are you anticipating this?    [Horn] Everything depends on the election results. This is  the key issue for us. If we achieve a result entitling us to  participate in the government, we will assume the  responsibility. It will also depend on whether we reach an  agreement on the main policy issues with a potential coalition  partner.    [Zizka] Are there potential coalition partners?    [Horn] Of course. Those who are now in the opposition --  the Union of Free Democrats and the Union of Young Democrats,  FIDESZ. Smaller opposition parties, for example, the Republican  Party, the Agrarian Union, and so on are also being taken into  consideration. That is, those who give priority to pragmatism  and resolving specific problems over ideology.    [Zizka] However, FIDESZ representatives are not displaying  much willingness about entering into a coalition with you.    [Horn] They have not issued any such statement. They have  merely said that they do not want to form a preelection  coalition with us. This is understandable; we also do not want  this. A government coalition is something else, however. It is  a matter for the future.</p>

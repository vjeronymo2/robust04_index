			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Hungary to launch convertible bonds HUNGARY plans to launch convertible bonds on the back of its privatisation programme, according to the official news agency. The bonds could be used to buy shares in some of the companies in Hungary's First Privatisation Programme, Mr Frigyes Harshegyi, deputy president of the central bank, told the MTI wire service. The dollar bond issue would take place after companies had been introduced to the stock exchange. About 15 of the 20 companies included in the First Privatisation Programme may be floated on the stock exchange from the middle of the year, according to officials. They include Hungarhotels, Pannonia and Danubius, Hungary's three largest hotel companies, Richter Gedeon, the largest pharmaceuticals manufacturer, and Centrum, an extensive chain of department stores. The scheme would be an imaginative way of interweaving two important government aims: servicing Hungary's Dollars 21bn foreign debt, the largest per capita in eastern Europe; and fuelling investor demand for Hungary's ambitious privatisation programmes. But it is unclear how the scheme would mesh with the plans already being drawn up by advisers hired to privatise the 20 companies in the second half of 1991. Moreover, the Hungarian government is already planning to issue bonds convertible into privatised assets in compensation for property expropriated by the Communists. These, stock exchange officials fear, may flood the market and quickly trade at a discount. The idea of issuing convertible bonds is part of the Hungarian National Bank's effort to return to favour on international money markets. Hungary recently announced a DM150m bond issue after an DM200m issue last month was oversubscribed. With the latest issue, the central bank was able to narrow last month's 250 basis point spread over bund yields. Mr Harshegyi recently said that Dollars 1bn-worth of bonds would be issued this year, about three-quarters of that in Japan and Germany.</p>

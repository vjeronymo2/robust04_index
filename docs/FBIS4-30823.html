			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F> Horn by Tibor J. Keri; place and date not given: "We Do Not  Need Redeemers"]    [Text] [Keri] What do you expect from your party's  extraordinary congress on 4 June? Apart from you, does anyone  else have a chance to be nominated as candidate for the position  of prime minister?    [Horn] The congress must decide about the possible coalition  partners of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and also about  the person who will be the party's candidate for the position of  prime minister. Naturally, if the congress asks me to play this  role, I will accept it. As for other possible candidates, I do  not know of anyone, I do not have information about this; we  will see how things develop.    [Keri] In your view, how long will the coalition talks last  and when can a new government be formed?    [Horn] It is difficult to predict this, but I think that the  coalition talks can end within one or a maximum of  one-and-a-half months, and a new government can be formed by  mid-July at the latest.    [Keri] Do you think it is wrong that the names of certain  figures were made public prematurely as members of the new  government?    [Horn] No. I think that we need a government of experts and  I would welcome both Ferenc Glatz and Kalman Kulcsar in the next  government. Of course, this does not yet mean any commitment  but the aforementioned people are not MSZP members; on the other  hand, they are experts of European reknown in their fields. I  think that such viewpoints will also emerge at the coalition  talks.    [Keri] Have you already asked the aforementioned persons  whether they would accept a ministerial position?    [Horn] We have not held any committing talks but, naturally,  I asked them whether they would accept such a role in the next  government. After all, this still depends on many things....    [Keri] What if the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] agrees  after all to form a coalition with the MSZP but they do not  accept you as prime minister?    [Horn] I do not think that the SZDSZ will come up with such  a condition; the SZDSZ is much cleverer than that. Not to  mention the fact that, today, most people in the SZDSZ  leadership regard Balint Magyar's declarations as hasty. If  they come up with any similar condition, this might hinder or  even foil the formation of a coalition. I must add that the  issue is not primarily about myself. It is rather about the fact  that coalition talks that start with preconditions do not augur  well.    [Keri] How much chance do you give to an MSZP-SZDSZ  coalition?    [Horn] I see very big chances for this. Of course, there is  no 100-percent guarantee for anything, but it seems that both  parties have a strong willingness for coalition cooperation.    [Keri] Do you completely exclude the possibility of a  coalition with the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]?    [Horn] At the end of February, we said that we do not  exclude the possiblity of a coalition with a KDNP free of  extremism, because we judge quite a few things similarly.  However, the campaign experience shows that the KDNP did not  quite succeed in changing its style. They used a rather  extremist tone, and this did not prove to be profitable for them.    [Keri] The new government is also facing tough and unpopular  decisions. Do you think that you will lose the support of our  society in a short time and the events of 1990 will repeat  themselves, namely you will lose the local government elections?    [Horn] I do not fear that, because the new government will  represent a totally different style than the current one. By  this I mean that the new government will conduct an open policy  and will not sign any secret agreement. We will sincerely  present Hungary's real situation to the public, the "heritage"  we received, and the very difficult tasks awaiting solution,  tasks the new government will have to confront. On the other  hand, the government will continue the social dialogue  successfully used by the MSZP in the past four years. Contrary  to the current government, we do not want to have confrontations  with various strata of our society; instead, we will endeavor to  come to an agreement with them. This could be one of the  guarantees for a long-term activity of the new government. The  other guarantee is that every government decision should be  based on the view that the government is acting in the interest  of a large majority of our society. Of course, all this cannot  bring a spectacular improvement overnight. Most probably a  considerable amount of time must pass for the people also to  feel the changes in their everyday life. I can confidently say  that, no matter how bad our situation is, it is not hopeless.  We can stabilize the situation while definitely improving the  situation of those mostly in need. However, we can only achieve  considerable improvement in one or two years.    [Keri] According to [departing prime minister] Peter Boross,  it is useless to prepare any inventory, because you are quite  aware of Hungary's situation.    [Horn] I highly respect Mr. Boross for really doing  everything in his power for the benefit of smooth elections, and  I hope the same will apply to the second round. But Mr. Boross  promised to present Hungary's real situation to the public. I  do not see that the government did this. The government still  has to prepare the bill and show the commitments it accepted and  the commitments it will leave for its successor. Mr. Boross is  giving evasive answers. I would really like him to think things  over: He would also benefit from adequate relations between the  government and the opposition in the next parliament.    [Keri] Mr. Boross also said that he would like to hold a  detailed conversation with his successor on what mistakes the  new government should avoid and what values it should preserve.  If you become the prime minister, what will you expect from  this conversation?    [Horn] I am open to any dialogue. Obviously, a departing  prime minister can give very serious and wise advice to the new  government. It is another matter to what extent the new prime  minister can use this advice, because it is possible that things  that Peter Boross finds very useful are regarded as nonessential  things by us. Not accidentally, we would like to have a  different policy and style from the one carried out by the  current government. However, we would welcome a regular  dialogue between Peter Boross and the other future opposition  leaders and the future government parties.    [Keri] What attitude would you regard as desirable in the  new parliament?    [Horn] I find it extremely important to ask the opinion of  the opposition when preparing the laws, as well as the efforts  for coming to an agreement. Even if the MSZP and the SZDSZ got  a two-thirds majority in parliament, we would still endeavor to  hold coordinating talks with the opposition by considering  Hungary's interests. For example, clarifying the authority and  jurisdiction of the president of the republic could be such an  issue. I must point out that this would not mean any  limitation. Something else: The opposition is also interested  in legislating a good media law as soon as possible. I very  much hope that, in line with their promises, they will play a  really constructive opposition role.    [Keri] What is your opinion about the claim that an  MSZP-SZDSZ two-thirds majority would carry the danger of a  parliamentary dictatorship?    [Horn] A dictatorship would emerge if laws threatening  democracy were legislated. I do not think, and I even find it  an irresponsible and empty talk, that anyone presumes that the  MSZP or the SZDSZ has such intentions. It is useless to  threaten people with such things.    [Keri] In connection with this, what is your opinion about  Matyas Szuros' recent declaration that Hungary would also  benefit if the MSZP did not win too much?    [Horn] I find this ridiculous, because I cannot explain the  meaning of "winning too much" [tulnyer]. What should one  understand by this? If the MSZP achieved results close to an  absolute majority, it could assert its views more successfully  than with smaller results. Therefore, I would very much like  Matyas Szuros to stop making such declarations.    [Keri] In connection with Miklos Nemeth, you said that  people who struggled for the election results do not like it if  someone joins the finished house....    [Horn] I am glad you asked this question because the answer  appears in print and this can be interpreted much more exactly  than the spoken statement. By ready-made situation I meant that  the MSZP achieved a considerable election result without Miklos  Nemeth. The ready-made situation does not mean that Hungary is  in some kind of a rosy state. Regarding Miklos Nemeth, in  January we offered him the possibility to return to Hungarian  political life. He was unable to accept this, but we did not  rebuke him for this; we understood him. When it became clear  that there is a debate regarding the person to be nominated as  our candidate for the position of prime minister, one could hear  voices saying that Miklos Nemeth will come and this will solve  all the dilemmas. He will not be able to solve this because  there are no redeemers. Hungary needs very tough and hard  working people, rather than redeemers. One who has not lived  through the struggles of past years is not really aware of  Hungary's real situation, because this could not be sensed  clearly either in London or Paris. I stress, however, that we  would very much welcome Miklos Nemeth's future return to  Hungarian political life because we are talking here about a  valuable person. But this is not an issue for us today.    [Keri] Do you find it necessary to change the current  government structure?    [Horn] By all means, but I would caution the new government  not to start some kind of a radical reorganization. In my view,  we definitely need an efficient economic cabinet and its head  should have full authority. It was an impossible situation that  four finance ministers replaced each other in the past four  years and that economic ministers were constantly forced to  confront each other and often forced to play against each other.  Such a situation only harms the country. In addition, I am  against any kind of amalgamation. I find it more important to  eliminate quite a few offices. Compensations should end next  year, and so should the Compensation Office. The National  Information Office is absolutely useless and I do not know  whether it is necessary to have an office for ethnic Hungarians  living beyond our borders (although I can be convinced with  proper arguments) because, in my opinion, the Foreign Ministry  can carry out these tasks. In my view, managing the  privatization affairs should be settled and the National  Property Agency [AVU] and the State Trust Fund Ltd [AV Rt]  should be amalgamated. In other words, we need a streamlined  state administration by all means.    [Keri] Can you envisage the restoration of the position of  deputy prime minister?    [Horn] I do not see much sense in this, although I am open  to any argument. However, I do not find it a positive thing  when a new government reorganizes everything.    [Keri] What is your opinion about Peter Boross'  declaration that, according to Western European practice, the  largest opposition party should fill the position of parliament  chairman? An example of this was in 1990 when Arpad Goncz  became chairman of the parliament and then president of the  Republic.    [Horn] This is a very nice statement; interestingly enough,  it is formulated when the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is  forced into the opposition. Arpad Goncz was chairman of the  parliament for a very short time, until he was elected president  of the Republic, and this was part of the MDF-SZDSZ pact. I do  not find it necessary at all that the opposition should provide  the chairman of the National Assembly. In my opinion, one of  the parties that received the largest support should provide the  chairman of the National Assembly. As for Peter Boross'  statement, there are indeed countries where the representative  of the opposition fills the position of parliament chairman.  However, in neighboring Austria, for example, the deputy  chairman of the ruling Social Democratic Party fills the  position of parliament chairman. So, one does not have to go  too far to refute this statement about the "Western European"  practice.</p>

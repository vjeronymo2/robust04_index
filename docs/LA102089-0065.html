			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE IGNORES VETO VOW; OKS ABORTION BILL  </P> <P> The Senate on Thursday sent President Bush legislation that permits federally  financed abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest, despite  the President's pledge to veto the measure.  </P> <P> The language of the bill, which has assumed symbolic importance in the larger  political war over the abortion issue, would ease a restriction in force for  eight years on circumstances in which Medicaid will pay for an abortion sought  by a poor woman.  </P> <P> The 67-31 vote in the Senate Thursday provided final congressional passage of a  spending bill, including the key provision on abortion, which the House  approved in a vote last week.  </P> <P> The legislation would allow federal money to be spent on abortions for poor  women who are victims of rape or incest and who "reported promptly" to law  enforcement or public health authorities.  </P> <P> Although the measure has become the object of intense effort on both sides of  the abortion issue, there was little Senate discussion as it came to the floor.  </P> <P> Sen. Brock Adams (D-Wash.) said that Bush's promise of a veto would "cause  enormous additional suffering" for poor victims of rape or incest.  </P> <P> "Forcing women and children . . . to bear a child which is the result of rape  or incest is unconscionable," Adams said. "This is about the right to have a  choice regardless of financial circumstances."  </P> <P> Medicaid restrictions in the law since 1981 permit federal money for abortions  only in cases where the life of the mother is endangered by her pregnancy.  Medicaid financing for poor women's abortions has been restricted in one way or  another since 1977.  </P> <P> The abortion provision is part of a $156.7-billion measure to finance labor,  health and education programs for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1.  </P> <P> Bush last week said he was looking for "room for flexibility" on the issue and  did not wish "conflict" on abortion -- an issue that has been troublesome for  him throughout his political career. But this week he hardened his stand and  promised the veto.  </P> <P> Neither the Senate nor the House is expected to have the votes to override a  veto.  </P></p>

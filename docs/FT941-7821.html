			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / People: Russian potential Middlesex Holdings, the renamed Ferromet Group headed by ex-England cricketer Phil Edmonds, is the latest UK company to appoint a director from the CIS. Alexander Vladislavlev, the former first deputy minister of foreign affairs for the USSR, will become an executive director and is expected to play a key role in identifying business opportunities in the CIS. Middlesex owns a variety of businesses around the world, including gold mining in the US, and metal and petrochemical trading in the CIS. Other companies to have gained CIS board representation recently include Aminex, in natural resources, and Marine &amp; Mercantile, in petroleum distribution. Middlesex chief executive, Masoud Alikhani, an Iranian businessman who has lived in the UK since 1979, injected his private businesses into the company through a share subscription in November. He and a group of Russian investors, four of whom are employees, own 29.9 per cent of Middlesex. Alikhani says he intends to exploit opportunities for trading within the CIS. The lack of a financial or trading infrastructure there gives Middlesex an opportunity to provide essential trading facilities to the individual republics, he says.</p>

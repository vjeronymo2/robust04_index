			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Ian Davidson On Eurpoe: An American row in Paris The papers say there is a big chill in Franco-American relations. The centre-piece in the story is a visit to Washington by Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister. The story says Mr Dumas had a difficult confrontation with Mr James Baker, US secretary of state; they disagreed about French ambitions for a European defence policy; to the point where Baker asked Dumas point-blank: 'Are you for us or against us?' It turns out this is an old story; but it keeps reappearing. The incident in question took place nearly two months ago, and was duly reported at the time. Other accounts followed sporadically. The same story was carried at length in the New York Times again last week, freshened with up-to-date embellishments. Some people in Washington must really want the world to know that they are displeased with the French. This disagreement has a long history. Friction over the defence of Europe was a constant feature of the Cold war: the US insisted on an integrated Nato alliance, President de Gaulle insisted on French independence. But it seems extraordinary that it should still be going on today. The Cold war is over, the Warsaw Pact has been disbanded, the Soviet Union has disintegrated, and Nato has joint meetings with its former enemies. There must be something irrational in constantly resuscitating these out-dated quarrels. Americans may think the French are doing their best to bring the old quarrel right up to date. Nato is trying to make sense of a slimmed-down role, with fewer forces and no enemy; but the French are making the job harder by pushing ahead with a rival European Corps, in league with their German friends. In reality, of course, the Franco-German Corps is only a military symbol for a political conflict, which is about the American role in Europe. If defence becomes a lower priority, Nato becomes less central to transatlantic relations, and America loses leverage. But if the Europeans start to get together on defence, in the Western European Union, in the Franco-German Corps, or under the Maastricht treaty, that is much worse for the Americans who fear they will be marginalised. Who is to blame? The French, of course, because they have always been unsound on Nato. The US response so far has been to adopt the tactics of an old scold. They have shrieked with indignation whenever the Europeans showed interest in a purely European defence policy; and have demanded that Nato be pumped up with important new tasks to sustain its central role. This is not very clever. The Atlantic Alliance was first created, and then held together for 40 years, solely by the overwhelming threat of attack by the Soviet Union. That purpose was written into Nato's treaty, and there is no consensus, nor even majority support, for re-writing the treaty to give Nato new military missions. The US has persuaded its allies that Nato can in future provide logistical support for humanitarian tasks not written into the Treaty. But that is just about as far as they will be able to go, and it does not give Nato a new raison d'etre. Sooner or later, it will be necessary to throw off these nostalgic regrets, and analyse the transatlantic problem in terms of today's realities. These realities can be simplified in three propositions. First, unless a belligerent Russia rises from the ashes of the defunct Soviet Union, the new security risks facing Europe and America will be different in kind from the old, and need different responses. Second, Europe and the US will have to co-operate in facing these new risks; so they need a new frame of co-operation; but it must be a co-operation between equals. Third, the specific challenge in such co-operation is to find ways of mobilising Germany as a full participant in the new security arrangements. The terrible disorders in ex-Yugoslavia and various parts of the ex-Soviet Union give some hints of the new security risks. Military force is not necessarily the central response; yet it may be an element in a larger strategy. Nato cannot be the forum for a Euro-American strategy, because Europe will not give it that task. The 12 EC members are committed to work on a common foreign policy; they will not subordinate it to US domination in Nato. Germany's size and position make it pivotal to any security arrangements in central Europe; but history and the constitution constrain the exercise of its new-found sovereignty. German participation is likely to be fullest, and most constructive, if it takes place in a larger frame, and one which is not essentially military; not Nato, therefore, but the European Community. In other words, the US may be able to resolve the conundrum of its role in Europe, only if it accepts the full implications of Nato's irreversible decline, of Germany's sovereignty, and of the Community's ambitions for an independent future. This would mean a broad-based treaty of co-operation of equal partners, between the US and the European Community. It may not be Washington's preferred solution; but it must be better than having childish rows with the French.</p>

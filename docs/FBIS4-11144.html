			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Celia de Gouvea Franco] </F>   [Text] The prices of the products manufactured by the  Brazilian Ammunition Company (CBC) -- Brazil's largest arms and  ammunition manufacturer -- have since 1990 dropped very  noticeably in real terms. Today, its Brazilian clients pay  about 50 percent of the price they paid four years ago. On some  products, the cut has been 70 percent.    This is the concrete and most tangible result, for  consumers,  of the broad managerial restructuring process the enterprise has  undergone since 1990, and which is now entering its second phase.    The CBC was founded in 1926 by the Matarazzo family and is  today controlled by the Arbi group of Rio de Janeiro (with 30  percent of the shares in the hands of the War Materiel Industry,  Imbel). During 1994 it will invest $8 million in Belgian and  Italian equipment and machines that will allow the enterprise to  double the production of some types of ammunition.    The enterprise has also begun a process in which part of the  work will be contracted out to third parties. CBC suppliers  will produce the parts and components that are not specifically  built by CBC. For example, negotiations have already begun with  suppliers of wood (imbuia and ivantiji [types of Brazilian  wood]). The wood is used for gun stocks. Considering the  production of ammunition and arms involves productive processes  of metallurgical and chemical nature, it is wiser to order  wooden pieces from specialists.    The plan to order parts from third parties is, however, more  comprehensive, as CBC president Antonio Marcos Moraes Barros put  it. CBC intends to buy from third parties most of the 105 items  that it uses to manufacture rifles. At its factory in Ribeirao  Pires, in the Sao Paulo industrial belt, CBC will continue to  master essential technology for arms production, like rifle  chambers and barrels, and the assembly and testing phases, for  which the company has special equipment and laboratories.    A third major point in this plan is an advertising campaign  that the enterprise has set in motion, at an estimated cost of  $2.8 million, through the Enio Minardi agency.    Some six months ago, the enterprise ordered a survey to  identify who buys arms and ammunition in Brazil. The main  conclusion is that buyers are generally frightened people, who  are upset and who make the decision to buy arms as a reaction to  violence. They frequently buy a gun that is not suitable for  their objective, or the incorrect ammunition.    Based on that information, ads were published in magazines  --  beginning with EXAME VIP -- describing the arms that can be  bought in Brazil and how they can be bought. This first ad  specifically referred to the 12-caliber pump-action shotgun.  The ad emphasized security for the consumer's home or business.  The decision to publish the adds was delayed, Barros said,  because the enterprise knows this is a sensitive matter that can  hurt people's feelings.    With this advertising campaign, CBC is trying to diversify  its consumer market. The enterprise is looking for consumers  because it decided that increasing its production capacity and  its production itself are the basic goals of its restructuring  plan -- the first stage of which is based on a quality program  that introduced radical changes into the productive processes.    The company's production capacity is increasing very much:  In 1991, the company manufactured 12 million rounds of  ammunition and 1.6 million guns (shotguns and rifles); this  year, it will produce 22 million rounds of ammunition and 7  million guns. This represents an increase of 83 percent and 337  percent, respectively. But is there market for all the CBC  production? Is the demand for weapons increasing in the same  proportion?    Barros promptly says no. He adds that, at best,  international demand for arms and ammunitions is stagnant. The  fundamental difference for the company, however, is that it has  noticeably increased its exports. Over four years, the CBC  sales abroad increased from $11.5 million to $24.5 million.  Currently, 60 percent of the ammunition and 80 percent of the  guns produced by CBC are exported. Basically, what made the  company gain a bigger market share in the United States, all  European countries except Italy, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan,  and Australia was its prices, which are nearly 5 percent lower  than those of its main international rivals.    Exports Director Gilberto Salm said the company is also  selling, although indirectly, to some East Europe countries.  Companies headquartered in West European countries purchase CBC  arms and ammunition and reexport them to other countries,  including countries of the former Communist bloc. The Brazilian  Government supervises these sorts of exports.    As a result of the recent emphasis given to exports, the  Armed Forces are no longer the CBC main customer. Some years  ago, as much as 35 percent of the CBC production was purchased  by the Brazilian Armed Forces. This has dropped to 10 percent.  The CBC reorganization process began in 1990 when the Arbi  group bought the company in 1979 [date as published] from the  two partners who had been controlling the company since 1936  (the U.S. Remington Arms Co. and the British ICI complex).  Barros was appointed president of the company by the Arbi group  after having worked at the Eluma company for 18 years. During  the time Roberto Gusmao headed the Industry and Commerce  Ministry, he was the ministry's secretary general.    The reorganization began by the adoption of new production  procedures. Without funds to invest in large projects or  expensive machinery, the best alternative to modernize the  company was to adopt quality control measures and redesign its  assembly line.    A good example of the changes implemented has been given by  CBC Operations Director Marco Aurelio Salvany: Previously, as a  result of the location of the assembly lines, the product  sometimes had to "cover" nearly 1.5 km from one section of the  plant to another. The new assembly line design places all the  machinery required for the manufacture of a certain product in a  much smaller area, so there is less loss of time and materials.  The company also implemented a system that allows workers to  suspend manufacture of a specific product when its stock reaches  preestablished levels.    Barros explained: "Before the reorganization started, the  company had as much as $12 million worth of completed products  in stock. Currently, it only has $4 million worth in stock.  Reduced financial costs resulting from the drop in the value of  products in stock has, so far, paid for the reorganization  process." To pay for the equipment that the company plans to  purchase this year, the CBC consulted the National Bank for  Economic and Social Development about the possibility of  obtaining financing.    So far, the CBC reorganization program has not increased the  company's profits. On the contrary, the company has been  registering losses since 1991 and last year made a "symbolic"  profit of a little more than $200,000. This was contemplated in  the initial project but, as a result of the expected exports  hike, prospects for this year are more favorable. Barros  preferred not to reveal the profit expected for 1994. He said  the results depend very much on factors that are very difficult  to forecast, such as exchange rate behavior.    The company's reorganization program has significantly  affected the routine of its employees. First because the number  of employees was cut from 1,584 employees in November 1991 to  the current 1,334. This number, however, is not expected to  change dramatically in the next few months, not even after more  modern equipment is purchased and parts are ordered from third  parties. The projected increase in production will require the  company to retrain employees that would have to be dismissed and  to keep them on the payroll.    As frequently occurs in programs that seek to improve the  quality of a company's products, the workers have become much  more involved in the productive process. Often, the workers  themselves suggest ways to improve the products.    Naturally, the implementation of quality control measures is  not new to the company. As it produces arms and ammunition, the  company has always been forced to adopt special precautions.  The CBC must be particularly careful about these precautions  because it not only manufactures arms and ammunition, it  produces practically all the necessary components too.    The CBC is one of only two companies in the world that  produces powder and ammunition at the same time. Normally,  ammunition manufacturers purchase powder from other companies.  To keep the powder and the starting mixture (a chemical mixture  that makes powder explode when the trigger is pulled) production  process safe and under control, the CBC has built the units that  manufacture these two products far from the other buildings.  The products are manufactured with a minimum number of  employees. Most of the process is controlled from a distance  through automated systems.</p>

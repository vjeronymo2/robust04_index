			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary  of Defence William Perry said tonight that the military in the  United States and Ukraine are establishing new relations with  strategic significance.    Perry made his remarks at a press conference here at the end  of a two-day visit to the former Soviet republic.    The U.S. secretary of defence did not elaborate on this new  strategic relationship, but it was reported that the two sides  signed a series of agreements during Perry's stay.    These included an agreement on Ukrainian participation in  the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and agreement on an additional  100 million U.S. dollars of U.S. aid to help Kiev dismantle its  nuclear arms and convert part of its military industry to civil  use.    Both sides also reportedly touched on the possibility of  holding joint military exercises and will set up a hot line  between military authorities of the two countries.    The U.S. reinterated its support for safeguarding state  sovereignty in Ukraine and maintaining territorial integrity.    They also expressed an understanding of Kiev's position on  the issues of Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet.    As for the security umbrella demanded by Ukraine, Perry said  that Washington will not provide the security guarantee for Kiev  after Ukraine joins the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and  would only offer a kind of pledge on the issue.    However, before Ukraine began dismantling its nuclear arms,  Washington had repeatedly pledged to provide a security  guarantee for the former Soviet republic.    Perry said that the dispute over Russia's delay in  compensating Ukraine for nuclear disarmament is expected to be  resolved in the near future.    Ukraine has threatened to reconsider the timetable for  shipping nuclear warheads to Russia for dismantling because  Russia has failed to compensate for the transfer. Moscow has  argued that the delay was caused by Washington's failure to  uphold its part of the disarmament pact.</p>

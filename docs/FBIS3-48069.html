			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Royal message" to the nation from King Norodom Sihanouk in </F> Beijing; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] I would like to extend highest respects to the two  supreme patriarchs, Venerable Patriarchs Khousananda,  Pouthiveang, and Mongkoltepeacha and to all venerable monks; I  would like to extend my greetings, profoundest love, and  everlasting faithfulness to wisemen, nuns, brothers, sisters,  children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, and all  compatriots male and female alike:    I take this opportunity as the royal government of our  Cambodian nation -- led by Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh,  first prime minister, and His Excellency [H.E.] Hun Sen, second  prime minister -- is paying an official visit to the PRC, the  great nation and friendly country, to send this message to the  supreme patriarchs and venerable monks as well as wisemen, nuns,  brothers, sisters, children, grandchildren, great grandchildren,  and all beloved and respected compatriots male and female alike.  The message is as follows:    1. The cancerous disease in my body has been gradually  cured. The cancer that remains in my spinal cord is being cured,  but slowly. This is because my prominent Chinese doctors dare  not use medicine too strong in the treatment considering my age  and other illnesses, such as my veins and arteries which have  hardened due to [words indistinct] and my heart disease. Using  drugs that are too strong in this kind of medical treatment  might affect my heart and so forth. A number of the most  prominent PRC doctors, the very kind brothers, recently met and  discussed new methods to more effectively eliminate the cancer  in my spinal cord. My cancer is a very serious illness. This  is why I need many more months to complete the treatment,  despite the effective and very thorough care given my these most  prominent doctors. Although I am not yet cured 100 percent, I  will certainly return to our motherland in April 1994 to meet  and join all beloved and respected compatriots in celebrating  our traditional new year.    2. I would like to zealously appeal to my Khmer Rouge [KR]  children from the Party of Democratic Kampuchea to please stop  planting mines in our country and to stop destroying our  nation's roads and bridges. The grenades and mines planted  inside our territory have caused and are causing miserable harm  to our compatriots, civilian, old and young, and male and female  alike. Every month, victims, male and female alike, die or  become cripples for the rest of their lives. Our country is  known to have more disabled persons, amputees due to grenades  and mines, than any country in the world. This is the [words  indistinct].    I would like once again to appeal to the children who plant  mines to completely stop all these crimes against our people.    All roads and bridges are vitally important to our innocent  people and our motherland. Those roads and bridges do not serve  Vietnam. They serve only the interests of our society and the  economy of our Cambodian people and motherland.    At present, our Cambodian motherland has been classified as  one of the poorest and most underdeveloped countries in the  world. This is a great shame to our motherland, our nation, and  every Cambodian.    Those children who have planted mines, destroyed houses,  villages, and the property of our people as well as ruined our  nation' roads and bridges -- if you really are patriots, you  should completely and permanently stop from now on all acts to  destroy the people and your own country.    3. I would like to insistently appeal to all children who  have chosen the wrong way of living by becoming robbers;  thieves; and bandits, who mercilessly killing both their own  fellow Cambodians and foreigners, to permanently end all of your  crimes. These vicious activities degrade your honor as well as  the prestige of our nation and race and our Cambodian motherland.    I know that a large number of you have become thieves,  robbers, and bandits, who kill people, after you have  experienced great misery in your families. Most of you have  chosen these vicious and criminal activities after you have felt  despair. I will ask our Royal Cambodian Government [RCG] to  grant you complete pardon if you agree to come out to see Prince  Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and H.E. Hun Sen, the two prime  minister of our RCG; pledge to stop robbing, plundering, and  killing people; and agree to come out to lead a life like all  other ordinary citizen and render yourselves worthy of being the  sons of independent Cambodia and our Angkor motherland. The RCG  will not forget all of you who [words indistinct] and will seek  honest jobs for you.    In conclusion, I would like to extend best wishes to the two  supreme patriarchs, Patriarchs Khousananda, Pouthiveang, and  Mongkoktepeacha; all venerable monks; wisemen; nuns; brothers;  sisters; children; grandchildren; great grandchildren; and all  beloved and respected compatriots. May you enjoy Lord Buddha's  five blessings -- longevity, social prestige, happiness,  strength, and enlightenment.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Institutions that receive a Federal Capital Contribution (FCC) and participate in the ELO are required to match the FCC on a dollar-for-dollar basis and are allowed to make loans to students at higher annual maximum and aggregate loan limits than is the case at nonparticipating institutions. The Secretary proposes to add this section to incorporate these statutory changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 674.8&blank;Program Participation Agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 463(a)(2)(B) of the HEA increased the capital contribution requirements for institutions that have a participation agreement with the Secretary to participate in the Federal Perkins Loan program in the 1993&hyph;94 award year and subsequent award years. The Secretary proposes to include in the participation agreement, under &sect;674.8, these new capital contribution requirements. In addition, the HEA eliminated the definition of default rate and implemented the cohort default rate, which includes new reporting requirements. The Secretary therefore proposes to amend the regulations to incorporate new reporting requirements containing information that the Department will use to determine an institution's cohort default rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 674.9&blank;Student Eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments to section 461(a) of the HEA provide for the eligibility of a student engaged in a program of study abroad. This program must be approved for credit by the home institution. The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations to reflect this statutory change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations to incorporate the new statutory requirement (section 464(b)(1) of the HEA) that a student must provide a driver's license number, if any, to the institution at the time of application for the Federal Perkins Loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also proposes to amend &sect;674.9 to require that, to establish eligibility to receive additional Federal Perkins Loan funds, a borrower must reaffirm a Federal Perkins Loan debt that was previously cancelled due to the borrower's total and permanent disability, discharged in bankruptcy, or written off (if the amount of the write off exceeded $25). This proposal has been incorporated from the current Federal Family Education Loan program regulations as part of the Secretary's on-going effort to maintain similar provisions, wherever possible, in the title IV, HEA student loan programs. This proposal would treat any borrower who has not satisfied a previous Federal Perkins Loan debt in a manner that is consistent with 34 CFR 668.7(a)(7), which provides that a borrower who is in default on a Federal Perkins Loan is ineligible for new loans. It is the Secretary's position that cancellation in exchange for performing a service (such as teaching in a low-income school or teaching disabled children) satisfies the debt but cancellation for total and permanent disability or bankruptcy does not satisfy the debt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 674.12&blank;Loan Maximums  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amendments establish annual maximum loan amounts and increase the aggregate maximum loan amounts allowable for an eligible student. These amounts depend on whether the student is attending an institution that participates in the ELO or whether the student is in a program of study abroad approved for credit by the home institution. The Secretary proposes to amend the maximum loan limits in &sect;674.12 to reflect the statutory changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 674.13, 674.19, 674.31, 674.41, 674.47, and 674.49  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;&sect;674.13, 674.19, 674.31, 674.41, 674.47, and 674.49 to remove all references to the term ``endorser'' in accordance with section 464(c)(1)(E) of the HEA, which now provides that Federal Perkins Loans are to be made without security or endorsement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 674.16&blank;Making and Disbursing Loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amendments require an institution to report to any one national credit bureau organization with which the Secretary has an agreement the amount of the Federal Perkins Loan made to a borrower. The Technical Amendments require that an institution report this information at least annually. The Secretary proposes in &sect;674.16 to incorporate the new statutory requirement that an institution report loan disbursements to a national credit bureau organization, in accordance with section 463(c)(4) of the HEA. In addition, the Secretary proposes to establish procedures by which a borrower may not be required to sign for any advance of funds made while the borrower is in a program of study abroad, if obtaining the borrower's signature would pose an undue hardship on the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

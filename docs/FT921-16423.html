			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / In an age of ink and innocence: Paul Cheeseright reports on the Pounds 125m management buy-out at the Birmingham Post and Mail MR CHRIS OAKLEY is hoping for the triumph of the innocent. He is the man who, in November, led the Pounds 125m management buy-out of the Birmingham Post and Mail. On financial matters, he confesses to having gone up 'a fairly steep learning curve'. On further reflection he says it was 'not so much steep as vertical'. The buy-out was, after all, the largest UK regional newspaper transaction for years. It took place against the background of an industry recession which has cut lifelines of advertising revenue and created difficulties for other groups with managers more experienced than Mr Oakley. In any event, as Mr Richard Stott, editor of the Daily Mirror and a buy-out aspirant himself, reminded readers of The Times last year: 'the road to management buy-out lies littered with journalistic corpses'. Just as Mr Stott wishes to pull the Mirror group out of the financial morass left by Robert Maxwell, so Mr Oakley wanted his company to escape from the growing capital problems of Ingersoll Publications, the US group which took control of the Post in 1987. To do that, Mr Oakley, managing director under Ingersoll, and his team had to pay about twice the sum Ingersoll had spent four years before. 'Success in the management buy-out was based on ignorance,' Mr Oakley said. 'People find it astounding that six people with no City track record could raise Pounds 125m.' But the innocents came away from the City with a package of equity and debt: Pounds 60m of equity held by Candover, buy-out specialists, and CIN Ventures, an offshoot of the British Coal pension funds, and Pounds 65m of borrowings, made up of Pounds 50m of senior debt and Pounds 15m of mezzanine finance. Within this package there is what Mr Oakley called 'a bit for the management'. But there is no equity yet for the staff of the Post. There are no immediate plans to widen the equity base. 'What we need is a good year's performance under our belts, and then we can think of the options,' said Mr Oakley. The staff had little to do with the buy-out. Indeed, they knew little of what was going on during the months of waiting for Ingersoll to make up its mind on the technique it would use to reduce debt. That said, when members of the Oakley team returned from London having completed the buy-out, they found congratulatory posters stuck on their cars. At the very least there was relief among the staff that the Americans had gone. They left a clutch of valuable assets, a larger clutch than the name Post suggests. The jewel is the Sunday Mercury, the best-selling Sunday paper outside London with a circulation in Birmingham which exceeds those of all other Sunday papers there except the News of the World. The Evening Mail, a breezy tabloid, has stabilised circulation at about 220,000 after enduring falling sales for a decade. The Coventry Evening Telegraph has locked up its city with a very high proportion of home sales. There are eight weekly newspapers and a local listings publication called What's On. The Sports Argus is one of the few Saturday sports papers and sells more than 60,000 copies. That circulation is more than double that of the morning Birmingham Post, the problem paper of the group. In 1989, the latest year for which accounts are available at Companies House, the newspaper group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 885,000, down from Pounds 4.56m the previous year. It had gearing of 132 per cent and was returning 0.59 per cent on total assets. But there is more to the company than its titles. It owns its headquarters building in the centre of Birmingham; this would be worth several tens of millions of pounds given happier circumstances in the property market. Ingersoll installed new printing equipment in the building; there are four presses able to provide high-definition colour, but they are under-used, with only one occupied every night of the week. The difficulty for Mr Oakley is both nursing these assets through the recession and making use of spare capacity. With Pounds 65m of debt to service, he will be watching his cashflow. Some staff felt that the price paid for the company would inevitably lead to retrenchment. But Mr Oakley is clear that 'you don't grow a business by continually cutting away at it'. Certainly no redundancies have been announced and the only casualty seems to have been the features editor of the Post. 'Over the next 12 months we're looking at developing our titles and not cutting them back,' said Mr Oakley. Probably one quick way of reducing the debt burden would be to sell the headquarters building and move into cheaper premises. Mr Oakley agreed that 'at some point it may make sense to realise the asset and have a move', but not yet. Not only is the property market weak, but 'we desperately need a period of stability; the last thing we now need is a move - it would be counter-productive'. The choice then is to slog through the recession. Mr Oakley implied that the management's backers are patient, that there is time to massage the assets. There were two principles behind the buy-out, he said. First, 'we did not draw up a business plan we didn't believe is achievable; it would have been easy to put forward some tempting figures'. Second, 'when we looked at the price to be paid we were determined not to end up paying such a price as to find it impossible to service the debt and pay a return to the backers'. Mr Oakley listed some of the immediate corporate targets. He wants, for example, to have the presses, at Birmingham and Coventry, in use all the time. That means an expansion of the contract printing business. There is scope, for example, to undertake the regional printing for a national newspaper. He wants to strengthen the free-newspaper stable - 'we're not going to see competitors come into our area unchallenged'. Then there is the question of the Post, where circulation remains stubbornly low in spite of a change of editor last year and re-launch as a broadsheet. Mr Oakley argued that its influence outweighs its sales. He noted that 'it has a business-dominated readership'. But it seems uncertain of its constituency, insecure in its identity. Life is uncertain in the amorphous market area where the styles of the Daily Mail and The Daily Telegraph cross over, and it is in this ill-defined slot that the Post operates. Such tasks would be easier in an expanding economy. While the Post has managed some growth of advertising in the areas it can influence, there is little it can do about, for example, the sluggishness of the Situations Vacant columns. The Evening Mail used to advertise 29 pages of jobs two years ago. Now it is down to 14 or 15. 'We expect to see some improvement in the economy next year, even if it's not manifest until the second half,' Mr Oakley said. 'We expect advertising to increase.' There are plenty of other newspaper proprietors who will hope that he is right.</p>

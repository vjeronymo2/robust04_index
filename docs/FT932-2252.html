			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Liberty Mutual invests Pounds 85m in London market Liberty Mutual, a Boston-based insurer, is to invest Pounds 85m in its London market subsidiary. The investment, which increases paid-up capital of the company from Pounds 15m to Pounds 100m, reflects increasing confidence by investors in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets, after recent rises in rates. Mr Dick Hazell, chairman of the UK subsidiary described the new investment as 'timely'. Mr Hazell, who was previously deputy chairman of the Lloyd's of London insurance market, said: 'It represents an act of faith in the London market which, in view of the improving climate for insurance will prove amply justified'. Mr Mark Bodkin, another former Lloyd's underwriter, is to become managing director of the new company. Other senior underwriters are also being recruited. The company is understood to be seeking to play a leading role in a number of market sectors - including marine reinsurance, aviation, property and casualty catastrophe business, from next year.</p>

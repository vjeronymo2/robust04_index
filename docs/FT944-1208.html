			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Scott Paper to buy back shares Scott Paper said it would use the after-tax proceeds of Dollars 1.6bn from recently announced asset sales to buy back its own shares and pay off debt. About Dollars 300m of the money would be used in a stock repurchase programme, while the rest would be used to retire debt, the company said. The cash was raised through the sale of S. D. Warren, a coated paper subsidiary, for Dollars 1.6bn and the disposal of an energy business in Alabama for Dollars 350m.</p>

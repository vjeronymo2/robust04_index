			<p>BFN     [Text] Baroda -- The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has  reaffirmed that the swadeshi [national] approach to development  is the bedrock of its economic policy, rejecting what the party  has called the Rao-Manmohan Singh model.    The economic resolution adopted by BJP's national council on  Saturday demanded that the present economic policy be replaced  with a swadeshi model based on Mahatma Gandhi's Ram Rajya and  Deen Dayal Upadhya's Integral Humanism.    The resolution was moved by Satish Agarwal, former Union  Minister of State for Finance and a member of BJP's economic  cell, and seconded by the party general secretary M. Venkaia  Naidu.    Concerned over the sugar muddle which hit the country  recently, BJP demanded the resignation of Union Minister of  State for Food Kalpanath Rai and expeditious completion of the  enquiry by Public Accounts Committee into the scandal.    At Baroda, BJP took special care to see that the confusion  prevailing inside and outside the party over the swadeshi  approach was clarified once and for all to set at rest all  speculation about the party being divided on the GATT versus  swadeshi issue. The party had failed to put these issues in the  right perspective at the Hyderabad national executive less than  three months ago.    Party leaders had no hesitation in admitting that their  failure to clarify the concept of swadeshi had led to confusion  among the rank and file. That was sought to be corrected as BJP  president L. K. Advani put it in his speech.    Swadeshi is not merely an issue of goods produced in India  versus foreign goods. It was an all-embracing philosophy which  has "civilisational, political and economic dimensions, " he  said.    The economic policy pursued by Congress which was contrary  to  the spirit of swadeshi in effect meant "wholesale and shameless  capitulation before foreign vested interests, the lowest point  of which was the signing of the GATT treaty at Marrakesh," the  economic resolution noted.    The Rao-Manmohan Singh model of development was based on  three legs: Fiscal stabilisation, economic re-structuring,  foreign investment and globalisation. BJP felt the government  had placed "misplaced faith" in foreign investment and  globalisation as a "panacea for all our ills."    BJP accused the government of subserving the needs of  foreign  vested interests in order to attract foreign investment. The  government had made "shoddy compromises" affecting economic  sovereignty and security interests of the country in relentless  pursuit of globalisation.    The resolution clarified that the BJP was not against the  entry of foreign capital and technology in hi-tech areas. But  it cautioned that even here it should not be to the exclusion of  Indian companies.    The net result of Rao Government's economic policy was that  prices of essential commodities had risen by 50 per cent in the  last three years, unemployment was on the rise, there was  stagnation in agriculture and recession in industrial growth,  the country had fallen into a debt trap and corruption and  scandals had become the order of the day.    The resolution said the performance of the government on the  economic front was "dismal".</p>

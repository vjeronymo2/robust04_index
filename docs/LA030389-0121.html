			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: JAZZ  </P> <P> Top jazz musicians are rallying to the aid of Woody Shaw, 44, the blind and  ailing jazz trumpeter whose left arm was amputated earlier this week after he  tumbled from a subway platform in Brooklyn, N.Y., into a train's path.  Musicians around the country have begun organizing a concert to benefit Shaw,  whose deteriorating health forced him to return last fall to his parents' home  in Newark, N.J., from the European jazz circuit. "The fact that he is still  alive -- we're very thankful for that," said alto saxophonist Bobby Watson, who  shared the bandstand with Shaw during their years as sidemen with Art Blakey's  Jazz Messengers.

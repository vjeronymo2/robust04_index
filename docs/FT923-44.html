			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE IMPROVED performance of sterling together with suggestions of a cut in German interest rates led to a late squeeze in stock index futures and enlivened an otherwise poor trading session, writes Joel Kibazo. The December contract on the FT-SE opened for business at 2,609, a 54 point premium to the cash market, and quickly went into retreat on the back of reasonable selling and fading hopes for a cut in UK interest rates. It had fallen to 2,572 by midday. A period of sideways trading followed before the improved performance of sterling and rumours of a cut in German interest rates caught the early sellers on the hop. This led to a squeeze which sent the contract sharply forward. December finished the session at 2,626, a 5 point improvement on Monday's closing level and around 22 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 40. Turnover was healthy and it reached 11,340 by the close. Business in the traded options was much improved and turnover rose to 31,894 contracts, up from Monday's poor 20,382 lots. The FT-SE 100 option more than doubled to 15,563 lots. Barclays was the busiest stock option with a day's total of 1,319 contracts.</p>

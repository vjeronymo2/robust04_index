			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YELLOWSTONE AND THE GRAY WOLF  </P> <P> Rep. Wayne Owens (D-Utah) has joined with the conservation organization  Defenders of Wildlife in sponsoring legislation that would implement the  deadlocked federal plan to reintroduce the gray wolf to Yellowstone National  Park. The proposal deserves speedy congressional approval and should eliminate  any further hesitation by the Department of the Interior in carrying out the  wolf recovery plan in Yellowstone -- as it actually is required to do now under  the Endangered Species Act.  </P> <P> The Interior Department has balked because of the opposition of a handful of  senators and House members from Rocky Mountain states who are representing the  interests of alarmed stockmen in areas of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana that  border Yellowstone. But the wolf restoration program has picked up some  powerful supporters in the last year or so, including Idaho Sen. James A.  McClure, the ranking Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources  Committee and a longtime opponent of most progressive conservation and  wilderness legislation.  </P> <P> Defenders of Wildlife and Owens may not have a deal the ranchers will find  irresistible, but the stockmen should find it difficult to be so stubbornly  opposed to the wolf program now. Defenders of Wildlife has established a  private foundation to compensate ranchers for any sheep or cattle lost because  of the wolf recovery program. The fund would be publicly administered, somewhat  like the one that has been in operation for some time in northern Minnesota,  which has the largest wolf population in the lower 48. The Owens bill  woulddirect the secretary of the interior to complete an environmental impact  statement on the wolf recovery program by the end of 1991, to make a decision  on the recovery program within 60 days after that and then implement the  decision within six months. The bill authorizes the secretary to give financial  assistance to the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho to help administer state  wolf conservation and management plans.  </P> <P> More than 100 wolves lived in the 2.2-million-acre Yellowstone in the early  1900s before the government started a systematic plan of killing them by  shooting, trapping and poisoning. The wolf was wiped out by the 1920s. Idaho's  McClure is correct in saying, in an interview in the Defenders of Wildlife  magazine, that the eradication of the wolf has upset the natural balance in  Yellowstone and, among other things, led to the overpopulation of elk in the  park. One result was the very high death rate of elks in Yellowstone this past  winter.  </P> <P> McClure said that wolves were eliminated by man unnaturally. "If we can  reintroduce them in a way that minimizes conflict with man and man's raising of  livestock, then I think we have accomplished something," McClure said. The plan  proposed by Owens and Defenders of Wildlife would do just that. But the  Department of the Interior does not have to wait for Congress to act. With the  conservationists pledging to pay for any steer or lamb killed by a wolf, and  with people like McClure in agreement, the department should feel confident  enough to move ahead with the recovery program immediately.  </P></p>

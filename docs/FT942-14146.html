			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Market debut to value Superscape at Pounds 10.5m Superscape VR, a pioneer of desktop computer virtual reality software, is coming to the market via a placing with institutional investors which values the Aldermaston-based group at Pounds 10.5m. The group, which was founded in 1983 by Mr Ian Andrew, chief executive, and was previously known as Dimension International, is the third UK company associated with advanced VR computer technology to float on the Stock Exchange. Bristol-based Division Group came to market in May last year and Virtuality Group, which designs and manufactures VR computer games, was successfully floated in October. The Superscape flotation, sponsored by Henderson Crosthwaite, involves the placing of 1.75m shares in the group, equivalent to 33 per cent of the enlarged capital, with institutional investors at 198p each. Trading is due to begin on April 28. Some 92 per cent of the shares are being placed on behalf of the company. The placing, together with a private subscription by ICVEN, an IBM subsidiary, for 214,646 shares at 158.4p each, will raise about Pounds 3.2m net of expenses for the group. The funds will mainly be used to finance the increased cost of marketing Superscape's software products on an international basis, particularly in the large and fast growing US market. Superscape reported a Pounds 73,000 pre-tax loss on turnover of Pounds 390,000 in the six months to January 31 and has forecast a pre-tax loss of Pounds 450,000 for the year to the end of July, mainly reflecting the costs of its overseas marketing push including establishing a US marketing subsidiary. The group currently exports approximately half of its software. Its main product, Superscape VRT, is a 'shrink-wrapped' software application design package which costs Pounds 3,450 and runs on later generations of industry standard desktop computers. The software enables customers, including people who are not professional programmers, to design and develop computer applications which use virtual reality techniques.</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Pakistan finds coal field of 80bn tonnes COAL reserves of 80bn tonnes have been found in Pakistan's Sind province, Reuter reports from Islamabad. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was informed about the find in the southern province's Thar area while flying to the central Sind district of Nawabshah, the official APP news agency said. No further details were immediately available about Pakistan's biggest reported coal discovery. Mr Sharif issued instructions to concerned authorities to develop fully the mine for coal-based generation of electricity to help meet Pakistan's energy shortage, APP said. Pakistani authorities said last that year they had found what they called the largest coal field in south-east Asia and the Middle East. The field's reserves have been put at more than 10bn tonnes. Those reserves are also located in Sind at Thara-Jo-Goth near the Indian border. Previously Pakistan had estimated its coal reserves at only 579.6m tonnes with an annual production of more than 2m tonnes in recent years.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Buy early and get a better share / Examining the mystery of a seasonal pattern in dealings around the world BUY EARLY to get the year's profits. UK share prices seem genuinely to follow a seasonal pattern which, although not completely regular, has persisted as an average tendency over the past six, very different years. One of the best-known sayings from the stock market is 'sell in May and go away.' Its popularity might partly be due to its encouragement of long holidays, but it also turns out to be good advice. So would 'put some shares in your Christmas stocking,' although it does not rhyme. The record of quarterly percentage movements of share prices in the UK since 1986 is set out below. On average, the whole of a calendar year's rise is achieved soon after the end of the first quarter. Some upward momentum usually is sustained into the second quarter, but it is then given up over the second half of the year so that the market rises only 1 per cent in the last three quarters of the year. Average relationships can, of course, be deceptive. They could arise, for example, from an exceptional result one year swamping a number of opposing, modest results. But, in this case, the average quarterly results remain representative year by year. In only one out of the six did the market fail to rise in the first quarter. The same is true of the second quarter, although the rises were less impressive. In each of the third and fourth quarters, the market fell as often as it rose. On average, share prices have fallen in the second half of the calendar year and they have done so as often as they have risen. All sorts of special factors have influenced the UK: the October 1987 Wall Street crash, joining the EMS, the fall of Margaret Thatcher, the Gulf war. Possible explanations for market falls come readily to mind. Who can remember the good news of early 1989 that brought a rally of the same scale as the fall suffered 18 months later when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait? Before searching too hard for a UK explanation of this seasonal phenomenon, it is worth looking overseas to see if it is unique to Britain or a more general feature. The second table below presents quarterly market performance from elsewhere in the world. The entries are the average quarterly percentage movements over the past six years, 1986-91. They are in local currency terms except for Latin America, which is measured in dollar terms to avoid the confusion which large devaluations could cause. The results are startling. As in the UK, the whole of the year's rise in US share prices usually comes in the first half, and most of it in the first quarter. Perhaps there is some shared Anglo-Saxon reason for this, but it is hardly obvious given the huge difference in scale and status of the two economies. In contrast, Japan's culture - and, particularly, the logic of its stock market - is impenetrable to foreigners: yet, once again, all the share price rises come in the first half and virtually all in the first quarter. Continental European share prices rise and fall in the same way with even safe, neutral Switzerland moving to the same rhythm. What can be the explanation of this very regular behaviour of the equity markets of the developed world? Perhaps it is something to do with the weather in the northern hemisphere. The timing of harvest receipts and sowing costs might explain such a seasonal pattern to financial markets in a predominantly agricultural economy, but that can hardly be the case for these countries. Anyway, the timing of even agricultural receipts is now more to do with bureaucratic procedures than to wind and rain. Even if weather gave some explanation of market movements in the northern countries, why does tropical Thailand's market follow the same pattern? At least the timing of the 'annual downturn' is delayed in the southern hemisphere: New Zealand concentrates its second-half falls into the fourth quarter. Latin America, too, is a first-half performer which concentrates its weakness into the fourth quarter, as do the emerging Asian markets. Only gold shares and Hong Kong have different seasonal patterns, with falls common in the first half of the calendar year for gold, while Hong Kong rises throughout the year on average despite the second-quarter (June) fall in 1989 after the Beijing massacre. It is hard to believe that domestic UK events, such as entry to the EMS or the fall of Thatcher, affected all (or any) of these other markets. The Gulf war was a more universal event - so far as the doubling of oil prices was concerned, anyway - but it still seems surprising that there was so little difference between the market responses of combatants and non-combatants. A more plausible world-wide link is with Wall Street. The mighty US market might act as a locomotive for the world's stock markets: tugging the carriages forward over the Christmas holiday so they all get rolling in the first quarter of the calendar year; slowing in the spring before stopping mid-year - and, in the process, inflicting a series of shocks for the next six months to the little markets following behind. Naturally, world share prices repeat the pattern. Stock markets go up sharply in the first quarter, lose momentum in the second and often go into reverse over the second half of the year. There is no obvious explanation for it but, whichever equity market you pick, there is no escape from the seasonal pattern. Who would bet against that form-book?

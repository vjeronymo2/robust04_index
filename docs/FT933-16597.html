			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Inkjet print battle leaves its mark - Alan Cane details a niche market which is dominated by UK-owned companies THE PROGRESS of one of Britain's few high technology leaders is charted in a laconic note at the back of GEC's results statement this week. 'Videojet's sales and profits advanced, with new operations established in the Netherlands and Ireland'. The bland commentary camouflages the new aggression that the company, based in the US but owned by GEC, is displaying in the European marketplace, unsettling its chief competitors and forcing them on the defensive. Mr Michael Keeling, managing director of Linx Printing Technologies, one of Videojet's newest challengers, said wryly yesterday: 'Videojet has been growing much faster than people anticipated.' Videojet specialises in continuous or industrial inkjet printing. Its systems are designed to print numbers, letters, barcodes and graphics on almost anything and are sufficiently delicate to print on fresh eggs and accurate enough for telephone cabling. Industrial inkjet printers differ from their office equivalents in robustness and speed. They are the only machines capable of labelling products on ultra high speed production lines. A small but growing niche market, it is dominated by British-owned companies. Videojet disputes overall leadership with Domino Printing Sciences, the Cambridge company, each having close to a third of the world market. Linx and another UK company, Willett, have under 10 per cent each. The overseas competition is represented by Imaje of France with about 16 per cent, and Hitachi of Japan with 7 per cent. The market has grown rapidly in the past few years, driven by national and international legislation demanding the marking of foods, beverages and drugs with batch numbers and sell-by dates. 'Everybody did well,' said Mr Howard Whitesmith, Domino's managing director. Domino's share price reached 620p earlier this year, while Linx came to the market in October 1992 at 130p and saw the shares advance to 220p. Now the boom has petered out and supply exceeds demand in Europe for the first time since the 1980s. Imaje, which moved ambitiously from distribution to direct sales, is losing money and shedding staff. Domino issued a profits warning in March and Linx followed suit in May. Yesterday their shares were trading at 430p and 117p respectively. However, Mr Adrian Shepherd, managing director of Videojet in the UK, does not think the inkjet printing bubble has burst. 'There is a lot of business out there to be had, although the market is becoming more competitive.' He points to the possibility of new legislation forcing producers to label eggs and a spread of opportunities in the labelling of pharmaceuticals and automotive parts. He believes his business grew 15 per cent in the UK last year compared with 9 per cent for Domino and an estimated 4 per cent for Linx. Hard numbers are difficult to come by in this business. The fact that Videojet's figures are not reported separately in GEC's corporate results makes analysis difficult. Mr Whitesmith, for example, estimates that 9,000 small character inkjet printers were sold worldwide in the first half of 1993, of which Domino had a 29 per cent share and Videojet 1 per cent less. Mr Shepherd reckons the total to be 10,500 units with Videojet in the lead with 30 per cent and Domino in the high 20s. A principal battleground is the US, where Videojet is synonymous with industrial inkjet printing, having at least 55 per cent. Domino, however, has failed to make much impression. Domino produced gross profits up 21 per cent in the six months to April but the pre-tax figure fell from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 3.7m. The main reason was the cost of taking on 14 additional sales staff together with support in the US, so far without much result. Mr Whitesmith blames a reluctance to invest while US business assesses the impact of the Clinton administration. Others argue that Domino underestimated the strength of Videojet's hold on the market. Mr Whitesmith is confident about the coming year, pointing to strong sales in the UK and France where its blue chip customers include Citroen, the motor manufacturer, and Nestle, owner of the Vittel bottled water brand. Mr Keeling blames the company's likelihood of flat profits this year on competition from Videojet coupled with inexperience in operating as a public company. 'The effort of going public took more senior management attention than we anticipated. It has been a hard year and we have to do things differently.' The company recently took on an experienced senior executive from Videojet to run sales and marketing. It has performed particularly well in Japan and the Far East, now its biggest market. Hitachi, the Japanese challenger, seems content to stay on its home turf. Given the interest in industrial labelling, the inkjet printer market seems certain to continue to expand although at a modest 10 per cent a year or so compared to the exuberant rates of 25 per cent to 30 per cent in earlier years when legislation forced the pace. The days of easy pickings have gone. With Videojet taking the battle to Europe, Domino, Imaje and the others have a fight on their hands. If Videojet gets permission to break out its figures from GEC's results, the full extent of the threat would be revealed.</p>

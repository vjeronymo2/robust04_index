Such an action would be consistent with the agency's requirements for other lamps and would lessen the testing burden for manufacturers. This action is taken in implementation of a grant of a petition for rulemaking. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The due date for comments is January 24, 1995.

Under S5.1.1.6 of Standard No. 108, taillamps and parking lamps need not meet the minimum photometric values specified for each of the test points of the relevant SAE Standards incorporated by reference, provided that the sum of the minimum candlepower measured at the test points is not less than that specified for each group listed in Figure 1c. In addition, the more recent SAE Standards for stop lamps and turn signal lamps that have been incorporated into Standard No. 108 no longer specify values for individual test points (though including them as photometric design guidelines). Instead, they specify required values for ``zones'' only. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In contrast, the applicable photometric values for center highmounted stop lamps (CHMSLs) are those of Figure 10 of Standard No. 108 and are for individual test points. Moore views this as an anomaly. He believes that laboratory test results vary so greatly that CHMSLs must be overdesigned to ensure compliance at each test point. As a result, they draw more power and have a shorter life expectancy. He argues that because CHMSL bulbs burn out faster ``and are generally located in an area that is inconvenient,'' they are not replaced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has granted Mr. Moore's petition and is implementing it through this proposal. While the agency has no information that indicates the present requirement results in shorter bulb life and failure to replace bulbs, it is sympathetic to his position that photometric compliance for all stop lamps, including CHMSLs, should be determined on the same basis, as the agency already allows the zonal method of determining compliance for stop lamps other than CHMSLs. The agency tentatively concludes that there is no reason why this approach should not be extended to CHMSLs as well. As with other lamps, adoption of the zonal method will enable compliance to be judged on the suim of the candela at the test point within a zone (i.e., the overall light output of a zone) rather than on the basis of whether each individual test point meets the prescribed minimum. This will not derogate from safety, and should make it easier for manufacturers to design and test lamps that meet Standard No. 108. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In implementation of the grant of the petition, this notice proposes a revised Figure 10 which would establish zonal photometrics that are the sums of the minimum current photometric test point values. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary arguments in a concise fashion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA, at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation. 49 CFR part 512. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for the proposal will be considered, and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Comments received too late for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking action. Comments on the proposal will be available for inspection in the docket. The NHTSA will continue to file relevant information as it becomes available in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

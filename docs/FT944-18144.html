			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Avon rejects transition costs Avon County Council yesterday made a further attempt to avoid abolition under the local government review, saying that the transitional costs of reorganisation had been greatly underestimated. The local government commission has recommended that the county and six district councils in Avon should be replaced by four unitary authorities. In June the High Court rejected an application by the county for a judicial review of the proposals. An Avon deputation including councillors from all three political parties and backed by local business groups and trade unions yesterday urged Mr David Curry, local government minister, to reject the proposals and refer them back to the commission. The deputation told Mr Curry that the commission's estimate of Pounds 16m in transitional costs in Avon made no allowance for redundancy payments. The district councils estimated the costs at up to Pounds 34m, and the county council at about Pounds 40m. Avon council also said that the commission's proposals would not provide the strategic capacity to tackle the region's economic development, transport and planning.</p>

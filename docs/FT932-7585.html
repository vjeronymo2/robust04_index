			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Advisers in quandary over Hong Kong boom - Overseas investors are ignoring recent hints that it is time to get out of the market When new issues are hundreds of times over-subscribed, second line stocks double over-night, and the stock market shrugs off negative news with historic highs, it is generally-assumed to be time to get out of the Hong Kong stock market. Certainly, there are enormous profits to be taken. The Hang Seng index has celebrated a major bull run since the start of 1991 and in spite of the political uncertainties of the moment, it has still achieved a 30 per cent rise this year, closing yesterday at a record high of 7,169.96. The stock market has focused on seemingly-improved Sino-British relations, and has chosen to ignore crucial issues such as the debate over the renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation status, and the over-heating of the Chinese economy. However, the move has not been entirely irrational. For the past three years, Hong Kong has been gradually eroding its substantial political risk discount, as investors have realised that the 1997 hand-over to China offers huge economic benefits, in addition to its political challenges. The economic boom in Southern China, the fastest growing region in the world during the past decade, has been the engine for corporate earnings growth (in earnings per share terms) of 21 per cent in 1991, 22 per cent in 1992 and an anticipated 20 per cent in 1993. This growth is eroded by the high inflation rate, which remains alarmingly close to double digits, but the corporate earnings trend remains impressive. There have been other fringe benefits from China, with mainland money pushing up the property and stock markets, as a means of switching out of the rapidly devaluing Renminbi. The story of Hong Kong as gateway to the Chinese economic miracle has caught the imagination of US fund managers, with a stream of fresh capital flooding in. To US institutions, Hong Kong offers the twin advantages of its currency peg to the strengthening US dollar, and its strong regulatory framework (at least by Asian standards). In addition, when Hong Kong experiences an economic slowdown, as in 1989, it has tended to achieve growth figures that outpace the economic booms of the major economies. But there are a number of reasons for caution. One of the keys to Hong Kong's boom has been local liquidity. Hong Kong has experienced sizeably negative interest rates for two years, leaving locals with the option of shoring up savings in either the stock market or property market. As a result of the currency's US dollar link, interest rates are expected to push upwards soon. The annual US debate on China's MFN will also cause some unease, as the impact on Hong Kong would be devastating, if China lost this status. Next year's renewal may hang on some conditions, but while there is little indication that it is seriously at risk, the uncertainties of the debate could have some impact on current enthusiasm for stocks. Finally, and most important, there is the issue of China's economy. Last week's announcement of a 25 per cent increase in China's retail sales for April is the latest in a line of statistics which demonstrate unequivocally the overheating of the Chinese economy. The last time this happened, austerity measures led to a 60 per cent drop in Hong Kong's GDP growth, back in 1989. This time round the impact would be less severe, as the economy in the neighbouring Chinese province of Guangdong has reached a greater level of autonomy, but with a substantial devaluation of the RMB expected and a credit crunch already being imposed, Hong Kong will be affected. Mr Sheldon Kasowitz, research analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities, says: 'Huge increases in interest rates, the collapse of the currency and a deteriorating trade balance are not the things that bull markets are made of'. However, the index is not overvalued on a current year basis. Based on Jardine Fleming's forecasts, the Hong Kong market is trading on a price-earnings ratio of only 12.4 times 1993 earnings. By comparison, Thailand is on 13.2 and Malaysia 21. This represents the top-end of Hong Kong's historical trading range, but that could be said to reflect the rapidly-changing attitude towards Hong Kong's future relationship with China. Of greater concern is the fact that share prices have been rising on the basis of political interpretation, rather than on political fact. It is widely assumed that there has been a dramatic narrowing of the political impasse over Governor Patten's controversial political proposals, yet the meetings between Britain and China have not yet succeeded in moving beyond principals. Furthermore, it can be argued that China has a certain amount of self-interest in appearing more conciliatory, during the course of the debate over its MFN status. China has already demonstrated its ability to influence the stock market when it wants to make a political point. Against this, there is the enthusiasm of overseas investors. Mr Richard Witts, managing director of United Mok Ying Kie Securities, says: 'It is going to take a lot to stop money flooding in from the US and Europe. These investors are going to be prepared to suffer a little for the long-term attractions'. Brokers' targets of a year-end Hang Seng index of between 7,500 and 8,000 still do not seem far-fetched, on current earnings forecasts. But given the numerous uncertainties facing Hong Kong, it is hard to imagine there will not be any blood and tears before it gets there.</p>

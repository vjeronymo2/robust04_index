			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Death Duty again - Correction AN incorrect reply was given in the item last week headed 'Death duty again'. It ignored paragraph 2 of schedule 6 to the Inheritance Tax Act 1984. The correct position as stated in Chapter 7.17 of the Inland Revenue IHT 1 booklet is: 'Where estate duty was paid on the death of one spouse on property in which the other was given a limited interest, for example, for life or widowhood or widowerhood, the property was usually exempt from estate duty on the death of the survivor. In such a case when the survivor dies, or the interest comes to an end or is disposed of, there will be no charge to IHT on the settled property if it would have been exempt from estate duty on the survivor's death.' IHT would not be payable on the death of the life tenant on the value of the settled fund as described by our reader. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

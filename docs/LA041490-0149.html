			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRUCIFIXION STORY'S DISTORTIONS HAVE BEEN BASIS OF MANY SINS;  </P> <P> GOOD FRIDAY: ALTHOUGH CHRISTIANS HAVE CONFESSED GUILT FOR THE DEATH OF JESUS,  JEWS HAVE USUALLY BORNE THE BRUNT OF HOSTILITY.  </P> <P> Christians on Good Friday marked the crucifixion of Jesus, whom they regard as  manifesting God on Earth. Through twists of history, his death has been blamed  variously on fellow Jews, Romans and a combination of both.  </P> <P> A noted professor of ancient history, Paul L. Maier, says it is "beyond debate"  that the Roman governor Pilate delivered the execution verdict and bears the  final legal responsibility.  </P> <P> Theologically, however, Christians themselves, in recalling that event,  acknowledge that their own sinful failings brought about the crucifixion,  necessitating it to redeem humanity.  </P> <P> They were involved. They "were there," a hymn for the day's services goes. Only  through that confessed participation in the wrong do they find forgiveness for  it through Jesus' suffering on the cross.  </P> <P> It's regarded as the "atonement," the laying down of a sinless life to make  amends for universal offenses against that goodness. In that purpose, "God so  loved the world that he gave his only Son," Scripture says.  </P> <P> The day is called "Good Friday" because the crucifixion is seen as absorbing  the results of human wrongs in God himself, thus providing His pardon from  them, His grace.  </P> <P> It is the great saving act in the belief of Christians, the essential key to  their ultimate salvation. For them, it is a topmost good.  </P> <P> Despite that basic theology, however, various slants, contentions and  distortions about Jesus' death have sometimes made it a bitter legacy.  </P> <P> "Probably no issue in the history of religion has elicited more blind  partisanship, misinterpretation, faulty logic, hostility or fad following,"  Maier writes.  </P> <P> The "pendulum has swung from one illogical -- indeed, ridiculous -- concept to  another, from assuming Jewish generic involvement to arguing for no involvement  at all," he writes in the April 9 issue of the evangelical fortnightly,  Christianity Today.  </P> <P> Maier, who teaches ancient history at Western Michigan University and who has  written several books about 1st-Century Judaism, of which Jesus was a part,  says the early church often bent Scripture to blame Jesus' fellow Jews.  </P> <P> That notion of "Jewish collective responsibility" for the crucifixion had  "horrifying results" through the centuries -- ghettoization, pogroms, the  Inquisition, centuries of anti-Semitism, the Nazi Holocaust, Maier says.  </P> <P> Past labeling of Jews as "Christ killers" was "illogical, unethical and  misinterprets the gospels," Maier says. That falsehood has been repudiated by  almost all churches, including the World Council of Churches and Roman  Catholicism's Second Vatican Council.  </P> <P> However, he says that in trying to atone for the past, it's become "high  theological fashion to argue that no Jews were involved on Good Friday in the  manner set forth" in the Gospels.  </P> <P> These arguments blame only Pilate, but to deny any Jewish participation "flies  in the face of historical fact," including traditions in the ancient  non-biblical Jewish sources, Maier writes.  </P> <P> He says opposition to Jesus of the Jewish religious rulers, led by the high  priest, is confirmed by the ancient Jewish historian Josephus' account of their  later plotting the death of Jesus' kinsman, James.  </P> <P> "Certainly Jesus had his Jewish opponents," Maier says, and doubtlessly there  was a group shouting "Crucify," but that "claque seems to have been primarily a  throng from the temple -- a group perfectly orchestrated by Jesus' priestly  adversaries. "But Jesus also had his Jewish friends and supporters on Good  Friday and not just the timid 12 disciples," Maier says, citing the massive  adulation he received on Palm Sunday and other occasions.  </P> <P> "Thousands of Jewish Passover pilgrims must also have remained loyal to him,"  Maier says, but most of the pro-Jesus Jews "failed to learn of his arrest,  hearings and trial until it was too late.  </P> <P> "He was arrested after many had retired for the night on Thursday, and he stood  trial at dawn the next morning," Maier says. That early morning camouflage was  arranged by Pilate apparently to avoid an uprising.  </P> <P> However, Maier contends that past misinterpretations should not justify  "tampering with the scriptural sources. Secular historical records of the 1st  Century support the New Testament records," he says.  </P> <P> However, he says Christians should always identify generalizing of "the Jews"  in John's Gospel as meaning Jesus' Jewish opponents, never Jews in general.  </P> <P> But that doesn't mean John's Gospel is anti-Semitic, Maier says, noting that  Josephus also often refers to his opponents simply as "the Jews" without  intending to generalize.  </P></p>

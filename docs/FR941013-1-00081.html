			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NESHAP proposed today for the off-site waste and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery operations source category are a combination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards and equipment, design, work practice, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operational standards. Whenever feasible, emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards have been proposed. However, in some cases,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission limitations would not adequately ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum emission reductions required by the standards are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved. In those cases, a combination of equipment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design, work practice, and operational standards have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by the EPA to be equivalent to the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards proposed today.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Selection of Test Procedures and Compliance Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposed rule, determination of the VOHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration would not be required for materials placed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units that use air emission controls in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the rule. To determine whether a particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste or recoverable material may be placed in a unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the rule but not using the required air emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls, the owner or operator would be required to conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial and periodic determinations of the material VOHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration. The proposed rule would allow the owner or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator to directly measure the VOHAP concentration by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzing samples of the material or to use knowledge of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste or recoverable material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Selection of Monitoring and Inspection Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Air Emission Control Equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Control devices used to comply with the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent reduction or concentration limit need to be properly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated and maintained if the standards are to be achieved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a long term basis. Continuous monitoring of the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device operation provides a means to help ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control device remains in compliance with the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standard. The EPA considered two monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options for this NESHAP; (1) the use of continuous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions monitoring (CEM) systems; and (2) the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitors that measure operating parameters which can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly related to the emission control performance of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular control device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The organic HAP emissions from off-site waste and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery operations which would be vented to control devices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under this NESHAP typically are not composed of a single or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a few specific organic HAP chemicals. Rather, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions are more likely to be composed of a mixture of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many different organic HAP chemicals because of the varying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compositions of the wastes or recoverable materials received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities. As a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general rule, CEM systems that uses gas chromatography to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure individual gaseous organic HAP compound chemicals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not practical for applications where the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic HAP chemicals to be monitored exceeds five (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed PS 101 and 102, Appendix A of 40 CFR part 64,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 22, 1993 at 58 FR 54648). Therefore for many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> off-site waste and recovery operations applications, a CEM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system is not currently commercially available which can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure total organic HAP for the specific set of organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAP chemicals selected for regulation under the off-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste and recovery operations NESHAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A possible alternative would be to use a CEM system to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure total VOC or total hydrocarbons (THC) as surrogate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for total organic HAP. However, the EPA concluded that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring monitoring based on this alternative is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate for this rulemaking. Current CEM systems that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure VOC emissions operate by flame ionization detection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FID), photoionization detection (PID), non-dispersive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infrared (NDIR) absorption, or other detection principles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that respond to VOC levels. These CEM systems provide a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure of the relative concentration level of a mixture of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic chemicals, rather than a quantification of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic species present ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the total VOC measurement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device will have a different instrument response for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different organic chemicals). While CEM systems would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide an adequate measure of compliance, monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control device operating parameters (as described below) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> common practice and provides at least an equivalent measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of control device performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the reasons explained above, the EPA rejected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring the use of CEM systems for the off-site waste and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery operations NESHAP. Instead, the EPA selected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring of control device operating parameters indicative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of air emission control performance as the most appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach to monitoring for the off-site waste and recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations NESHAP source category. However, the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule would not preclude owners or operators choosing to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a CEM system to comply with the rule's monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for those cases where it is possible to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed off-site waste and recovery operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NESHAP specifies the types of parameters that can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitored for common types of control devices. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters were selected because they are good indicators of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control device performance and instrumentation is available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at a reasonable cost to monitor these parameters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuously. The proposed rule also would provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions under which an owner or operator could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved, on a case-by-case basis, to monitor parameters not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically listed in the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

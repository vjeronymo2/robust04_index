			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN)--The last soldiers of the German  Somali contingent arrived at the military section of  Cologne/Bonn airport today. Before German Defense Minister  Volker Ruehe disbanded the unit, he praised the "masterly  performance" of all those involved in the operation. The German  armed forces had "opened up a new chapter in their readiness for  deployment and aid." Ruehe stressed the soldiers' humanitarian  aid, in particular. Schools, roads, and bridges had been  rebuilt, and the infrastructure of the region had been  considerably improved. He said the German soldiers had "turned  the Beledweynne region into a model UN area for the rebuilding  of Somalia."    Ruehe said the public supported such missions and expected  them of the Bundeswehr. This acceptance would not, however,  have been reached without its participation in Somalia and  earlier in Cambodia, as well as in the aid flights to Bosnia and  the AWACS missions. Ruehe, however, admitted to shortcomings in  the Somalia mission, for which he primarily blamed the United  Nations. He referred to the interaction between Mogadishu and  New York, which was less than ideal, as well as the lack of a  viable political concept for Somalia. Arising out of this is  the task of strengthening the United Nations' ability to act.</p>

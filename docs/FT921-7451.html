			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Stocks the best place to be 'STOCKS ARE clearly the best place to be,' says Ms Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chair of the investment policy committee at Goldman Sachs in New York. 'We'll see a recovering economy and a recovery in corporate profits,' she says. However, Ms Cohen warns that there are still risks associated with what she calls 'deep cyclicals' - companies very dependent on economic recovery in the US and around the world, and especially commodity price-sensitive companies. 'We are concerned that their profits won't recover as much as expected in 1992,' she says. She likes 'growth cyclicals', such as technology, transportation and electronics stocks. But she is wary of small-capitalisation stocks, 1991's best performers, and companies that diversified abroad in the 1980s. 'As we look into 1992, US markets may recover before overseas markets, so companies that depend upon economic vigour in Europe and Asia may face some earnings disappointments.' Ms Cohen favours specialty US retailers with strong domestic exposure and pharmaceuticals.</p>

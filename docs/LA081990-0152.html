			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: HOSTELS OFFER INEXPENSIVE LODGINGS AROUND THE WORLD  </P> <P> Quick: What do a battleship in Massachusetts, a castle in the English  countryside, a prison in Ottawa, a clipper ship in Stockholm and a couple of  treehouses in Georgia have in common?  </P> <P> Answer: Each provides budget accommodations and is affiliated with the  International Youth Hostel Federation (IYHF).  </P> <P> Youth hostels provide clean, safe, inexpensive accommodations, often in small,  dormitory-type rooms. Most guests are 18 to 24 years of age, but few hostels  impose age restrictions. There are more than 5,200 IYHF hostels worldwide,  providing more than 370,000 beds in 59 countries.  </P> <P> In addition to financial savings, hostels also offer an excellent atmosphere  for solo travelers. Communal kitchens and lounges are ideal settings in which  to meet other travelers.  </P> <P> According to the IYHF's 1989 annual report, the countries in which American  travelers spent the most nights were West Germany, England, Wales, Switzerland,  Israel, Italy, Austria, France, Australia, the Netherlands and Canada.  </P> <P> Travelers are encouraged to purchase an IYHF membership, which costs $25 per  year, from their own national hostel association before leaving home. Although  guest passes are sold abroad, if you buy before you go, some of the money will  be used to support the local organizations.  </P> <P> A portion of the membership fee also is earmarked for hostel development in  underdeveloped countries, plus other special projects.  </P> <P> For example, Kenya's association this year was able to open a simple hostel in  Samburu bush country. In addition to the dormitory rooms, it contains some  facilities for couples. It also has camping, often with zebra grazing around  the sites.  </P> <P> In response to the recent changes in Eastern Europe, IYHF funding was used to  produce a free map, in six languages, with information to assist young people  from Eastern Europe who want to visit Western European countries. A special  IYHF membership card also is available to young people from this area, at a  cost of $2.  </P> <P> One of the main focuses of IYHF in the past several years has been the  development and upgrading of youth hostels in key gateway cities. For example,  in the past two years, New York City got its first IYHF hostel (500 beds).  </P> <P> In Paris, Le D'Artagnan was renovated and reopened (400 beds); in Auckland, New  Zealand, a new hostel opened with 140 beds (maximum four per room); a facility  was opened in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (14 air-conditioned rooms), and  construction has begun on a new one in the Banglumpoo area of Bangkok,  Thailand, with the opening expected in October.  </P> <P> A new hostel has opened in Dublin, and, for the first time, the youth hostels  in Northern and Southern Ireland are covered in a joint handbook.  </P> <P> Many national hosteling associations have travel services, and the trend is to  market each other's "do-it-yourself" touring packages. In some cases you'll  have to contact the foreign association directly to find out if it has anything  suitable.  </P> <P> Finland, for example, offers packages combining bus, rail and bicycle transport  with hostel accommodations. Belgium's association has its own bike-touring club  and invites foreign members to join.  </P> <P> For more information on the IYHF network, or hosteling at home, contact  American Youth Hostels, Los Angeles Council, 335 West 7th St., San Pedro 90731,  (213) 831-8846.  </P></p>

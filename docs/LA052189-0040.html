			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY OF SLAIN MAN TO GET $50,000 FROM COUNTY  </P> <P> Los Angeles County has settled a lawsuit against a Lakewood station sheriff's  deputy by paying $50,000 to the 8-year-old son of a man who was fatally wounded  during a traffic stop in 1984.  </P> <P> The recent award by the county Claims Board ends a wrongful-death suit filed by  the family of Danny Ray Keele, a part-time janitor who was shot while sitting  in his car in the parking lot of a motel on Lakewood Boulevard in Bellflower  where he was staying with his girlfriend and young son.  </P> <P> Keele, 25, who had been pulled over for weaving in traffic, was shot in the  back at close range after he allegedly grabbed the gun hand of rookie Deputy  Steven Minnis, who had leaned into Keele's car to investigate, county lawyers  said.  </P> <P> Keele had failed to get out of his car as ordered, and lab tests showed later  that he was under the influence of the hallucinogenic drug PCP, lawyers said.  </P> <P> But in recommending settlement, the county counsel's office said that expert  witnesses hired by the Keele family were prepared to testify that the deputy,  on the job just six months, did not follow acceptable police procedures when  approaching Keele.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contradictory Stories  </P> <P> In addition, witnesses at the motel contradict deputies' accounts of the  shooting incident, said Patrick J. Gardiner, principal deputy county counsel,  in a report to the Claims Board. Minnis was on patrol alone, but other deputies  arrived just after the shooting, the lawyer said.  </P> <P> "There was enough that a jury could probably have gone either way," and its  award could have exceeded the $50,000 settlement, Gardiner said in an  interview.  </P> <P> Samuel Paz, attorney for the Keele family, said the death resulted from bad  judgment by an inexperienced deputy.  </P> <P> "It's pretty straightforward," Paz said. "If you have someone who you think may  be dangerous, you should not go one-on-one. The deputy is supposed to call for  backup and maintain the status quo.  </P> <P> "But he walked up to the car, told Keele to freeze, stuck his gun in his back  and leaned over and started looking into the car and into the guy's eyes.  That's when the gun went off," Paz said.  </P> <P> Paz said Minnis has changed his account of what took place at the Hazy 8 Motel  in Bellflower that hot July evening five years ago.  </P> <P> According to a report by another deputy, Minnis first said that Keele had  jumped from his car and struggled with the deputy before his gun went off.  Minnis also told sheriff's homicide investigators a similar story a few hours  after the shooting, Paz said the investigators reported.  </P> <P> But a witness in a nearby motel room said that immediately after she heard the  gunshot, she saw Minnis standing alone next to the car. Minnis then pulled  Keele nearly out of the car before other deputies arrived, the woman said in a  sworn statement, according to Paz.  </P> <P> The county's Gardiner said Minnis "was in shock" after the shooting and the  initial account was a misunderstanding.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disagree on Struggle  </P> <P> Both sides now agree that Keele was shot while sitting in his car. But they  disagree on whether a struggle took place.  </P> <P> Paz said there is no forensic evidence that Keele ever laid his hands on the  deputy's revolver. But Gardiner said, "The deputy breaks loose, and that's when  he shoots. The deputy thought he was going to get disarmed. He was protecting  himself."  </P> <P> Since the shooting, Minnis' record has been cleared of accusations of excessive  force, Gardiner said. "This is a bad situation, but the guy's a good cop," he  said.  </P> <P> Paz said the county was fortunate that Keele's work history was spotty and that  his survivors could show only limited loss of support as the result of his  death.  </P> <P> "If the fellow had had a decent job, this case would have cost them four times  this amount," Paz said.  </P> <P> About $33,000 of the award was placed in a trust account for Keele's son when  he reaches 18. The remaining $17,000 paid attorneys' fees, funeral costs and  other expenses incurred by the family.  </P></p>

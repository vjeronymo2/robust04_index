			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Timex ex-staff win Pounds 3m guarantee DISMISSED TIMEX workers in Britain have secured a Pounds 3m legally binding guarantee from the US-based company to cover any awards they secure from industrial tribunals for their alleged unfair dismissal. The company, which shut its Dundee circuit board production plant last week after a dispute with employees lasting eight months, said yesterday it would 'vigorously defend' itself before the tribunals. Mr Gavin Laird, the AEEU engineering and electrical union's general secretary said: 'We are going for the maximum level of award under the law.' Mr Laird added that Timex had not wanted to provide a financial guarantee of its good intentions before the industrial tribunal but the union would not accept this. Last week the union sought an injunction in a Scottish court against the company to compel Timex to provide Pounds 3m as a guarantee that it would honour any awards for the 317 workers involved. The court agreed with the union.</p>

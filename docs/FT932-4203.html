			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Steps agreed to defend Moslems: US and EC still divided on strategy for ending conflict in Bosnia THE US and the European Community yesterday agreed on minimum steps to defend the besieged Moslem population in Bosnia and pledged to reinforce efforts to prevent the conflict from escalating into a wider Balkan war. But after a meeting of EC foreign ministers and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, profound divisions remained over a wider strategy to end the conflict in Bosnia and reverse Serbian and Croatian territorial gains. The divisions became explicit during a news conference at the end of the Luxembourg meeting originally intended to provide a show of western alliance unity ahead of the Nato summit which opens today in Athens. Mr Niels Helvig Petersen, foreign minister of Denmark, which holds the rotating EC presidency, said there was no point in finger-pointing. But he promptly laid bare transatlantic differences by saying the Vance-Owen peace plan was 'the centrepiece of EC policy' towards Bosnia. In response, Mr Christopher declined to endorse the Vance-Owen plan, declaring only that the UN-EC plan had 'many positive aspects' which could be built on. He also said that the US had not abandoned its preferred option of arming the Bosnia Moslems - despite a French statement that this was 'a policy of despair'. More fundamentally, Mr Christopher's references to the Vance-Owen 'process' left the impression that the US believes the original EC-UN plan to divide Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces is no longer viable because of Serbian and Croatian territorial gains in Bosnia. This assessment gained tacit support in Luxembourg, with some delegations, notably Belgium, calling for a basic reassessment of the Bosnian conflict. A new approach would include sanctions against Croatia to deter further aggression and a possible redrawing of the Vance-Owen map, an EC official said. It would also reinforce what Mr Christopher identified as a prime US goal - the territorial integrity of Serbia's province of Kosovo and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. The immediate requirement is to plug the gaps in the UN peacekeeping force and give effect to last week's UN resolution to defend the six UN 'safe areas'. Both the EC and UN are seeking recruits from Moslem countries, Scandinavia and the former Soviet Union, but EC diplomats said it would take at least six weeks to put the force of about 5,000 troops together. Mr Christopher repeated that the US was not willing to provide ground-forces in the 'safe areas' operation. He rebutted criticism from Lord Owen, the EC peace negotiator, saying that the US would provide troops only after the warring parties have reached a watertight political settlement. The limited nature of US military engagement became clear when Mr Christopher avoided a commitment to send aircraft to defend civilians.

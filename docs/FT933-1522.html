			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Fleming Chinese ups issue size FLEMING Investment Trust Management has increased the issue size of the Fleming Chinese Investment Trust from a maximum of Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m, after greater than expected demand during the placing stage. Indications of interest have been received for 45m ordinary shares at 100p, with one warrant attached to every five shares. Up to 15m shares are available through the public offer, which opened yesterday, and closes at 10am on Friday October 8. Dealing is expected to start on October 19. Expenses for the issue will be capped at 3.5 per cent, and the annual management charge will be approximately 1.45 per cent. The portfolio will be managed on a day-to-day basis by Jardine Fleming in Hong Kong. It will invest in Chinese companies listed in China and Hong Kong, and non-Chinese companies deriving a large part of their profits or revenues from China. The number of companies with shares available to foreign investors listed on Chinese stock exchanges is low; demand is high, however, so only a small portion of the fund will initially be invested directly in China. The fund's objective is capital growth and the shares are not expected to pay a dividend.</p>

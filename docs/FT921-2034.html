			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / China neutral on Midland HK deal CHINA indicated yesterday that it would not raise serious objections to Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's proposed takeover of Midland Bank. A statement issued in Hong Kong by an unofficial mouthpiece for the Beijing government allayed fears that the Chinese authorities would see Hongkong Bank's move as desertion of the territory ahead of China assuming sovereignty in 1997. The Hong Kong branch of the China News Service, an unofficial Chinese news agency which has close ties to Beijing and usually reflects the official line, said the merger was a means of switching the assets of the colony's quasi-central bank out of Hong Kong. But it also said the move by Hongkong Bank to merge with Midland Bank represented a sound commercial strategy for the long term, because of the limited potential business growth in Hong Kong. The China News Service statement added that the proposals reflected 'the group's strategy of vigorously expanding their overseas business'. The double-edged response was interpreted as neutral and reflecting an apparent decision by the Chinese government to adopt a wait-and-see attitude towards the proposed merger, which will substantially dilute the impact of earnings in Hong Kong on the enlarged group. Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank chairman, kept the Beijing authorities informed of the bank's plans, and has emphasised its long-term commitment to the territory. This appears to have lessened the likelihood of any negative official reaction. Hongkong Bank's role in the colony is sensitive because it performs some of the functions of a central bank, including issuing banknotes. Its chairman sits on the executive council, the governor's most important decision-making body. However, the Chinese authorities had previously given tacit approval to its move in 1990 to switch the domicile of its holding company to London. Concerns about the financial implications for Hongkong Bank of further overseas expansion continued to weigh on its share price yesterday. It dropped a further HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 40.25, making an 11 per cent fall in two days' trading since the plan was announced. Midland Bank's shares rose 10p to 350p.</p>

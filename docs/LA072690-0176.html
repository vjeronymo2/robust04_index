			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORT CARD SHOWS WIDE GAP BETWEEN BEST, WORST S&amp;LS  </P> <P> The nation's beleaguered savings and loan industry is becoming more sharply  divided, with the healthy institutions now earning steady profits while "the  bad ones are getting worse," the nation's top thrift regulator said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The 2,514 independent savings and loan associations suffered an overall loss of  $271 million during the first quarter, but performance varied widely among  different segments of the industry, according to figures issued by the Office  of Thrift Supervision.  </P> <P> "We see at least some positive results, but this is still a very tough  situation," Timothy Ryan, OTS director, told a news conference.  </P> <P> Ryan's figures showed that the well-capitalized and healthy S&amp;Ls made  profits of about $700 million, and another group -- sound but not quite as  strong financially -- earned about $200 million.  </P> <P> But these profits were far overshadowed by the deep deficit of about $1.2  billion at two groups of dangerously weak thrifts.  </P> <P> The fate of these badly ailing institutions is expected to play a major role in  determining the ultimate cost of the S&amp;L bailout, the biggest financial  rescue in history.  </P> <P> The government is slated to spend an estimated $300 billion or more over the  next 30 years to finance the closing of hundreds of insolvent thrifts and to  pay off depositors. Currently, federal insurance covers the first $100,000 of  each account.  </P> <P> The government already has seized nearly 500 institutions and will report  separately on how they are faring under federal control. Regulators say they  may be forced to seize between 350 and 700 of the thrifts still in private  hands, depending on the health of these institutions.  </P> <P> Ryan offered a mixed financial portrait of the S&amp;Ls that are still in the  private sector, underscoring a wide disparity between the sick and the healthy  ones.  </P> <P> "We see at least some positive results in identifying insolvent institutions  and putting them out of business," he said. The OTS identifies the institutions  that are about to fail, and the Resolution Trust Corp. places them under  government control.  </P> <P> The report showed that 1,264 institutions that the agency placed in the  category of healthiest thrifts contained $404 billion in assets, about 38% of  the total held by all the independent thrifts.  </P> <P> According to the regulators, all these institutions have adequate capital and  are well managed. This group also has been a consistent moneymaker, despite the  recent softening in the general economy and the downturn in the real estate  markets.  </P> <P> These healthy institutions had profits of about $700 million in the first  quarter, the same as they earned in the first quarter of 1989. The S&amp;Ls in  this category have "long-term viability, and they earn an adequate return,"  said Bert Ely, an independent consultant.  </P> <P> A second group, made up of thrifts that are profitable but fall short of the  government's new, stricter capital requirements, had much lower earnings --  about $200 million in the first quarter, down from about $300 million a year  ago.  </P> <P> The second group includes 620 S&amp;Ls with $326 billion in assets, or about  30% of the industry total.  </P> <P> Although the S&amp;Ls in this group were technically profitable, Ely and some  other analysts are much less sanguine about them.  </P> <P> These thrifts "may be survivors in the regulatory sense, but they won't make it  in the marketplace," Ely predicted. This second category of thrifts posted an  anemic 6% to 7% return on equity, compared to 11% or 12% for the first group,  Ely said.  </P> <P> The most severely wounded casualties, many of which seem likely to end up under  government control, are split between groups three and four.  </P> <P> Those cited in group four -- 319 in all -- generally have posted massive losses  and have already been identified by federal regulators. The thrifts in this  group lost about $900 million in the first quarter, far worse than the  $100-million deficit in the same quarter a year ago.  </P> <P> These thrifts have cumulative assets of $195 billion, accounting for about 18%  of the industry.  </P> <P> The potential nightmare for Ryan and other federal regulators comes from the  prospect of widespread failure among the 311 S&amp;Ls in group three. They  suffered losses of about $300 million in the first quarter of this year, after  breaking even in the first quarter of 1989. This group has assets of $149  billion, or 14% of the industry's total holdings.  </P> <P> Most S&amp;Ls in group three are operating under strict plans approved by the  federal government to raise additional capital, and they generally restrict  their lending activity until federal regulators say they are satisfied.  </P> <P> "We are watching these very closely," Ryan said. "I am watching them personally  on a monthly basis."  </P> <P> For the two weakest categories of thrifts, "you can see the numbers. . . get  worse," Ryan said.  </P> <P> Ryan said the ultimate fate of many of the thrifts will depend on the real  estate market, "over which we have no control." If billions of dollars in real  estate loans go bad because houses, office buildings and shopping centers  cannot be sold or leased at a profitable price, the lending institutions may be  dragged down.  </P></p>

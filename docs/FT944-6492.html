			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Novo Nordisk adapts its strategy in changing market The shine has been knocked off Novo Nordisk's shares this year. The Danish pharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes producer has been hit by a rapid rise in costs, contributing to a 7 per cent slip in nine-month profits to DKr934m (Dollars 153m) from DKr1bn; problems meeting demand for insulin in the US; and the resignation of an important member of the management board following a reorganisation of responsibilities. The share price fell by DKr15 when the interim results were announced earlier this month. They have picked up since, but at DKr554 yesterday the price is a long way from the 12-month high of DKr748. Mr Mads Ovlisen, chief executive, said: 'We are trying to adapt our strategy, our organisation, to the huge changes taking place in the market place. We are also adapting to increased regulatory pressures.' The shortfall in insulin supply to the US, where it competes with Eli Lily, the world's other leading supplier, was caused by a production stoppage in Denmark. This was compounded by a delay in bringing a new production plant on stream in the US. The delay, Mr Ovlisen said, was caused by the need to ensure the plant met the US Food and Drug Administration's stringent regulatory guidelines, 'a tremendous task'. The supply problem is now over, and he hopes the US plant will go into production early next year. The market situation in the US is changing because the large pharmaceutical producers are buying up healthcare provider groups in order to gain a captive patient base. 'Buying decisions are made by the healthcare provider organisations. The medical doctor is no longer king,' said Mr Ovlisen. The key to survival for a relatively small company such as Novo Nordisk, with turnover last year of about DKr12.16bn, is to be able to innovate and to supply value-added products which the healthcare providers will continue to need, he said. With this in mind board of management responsibilities were changed last spring, to make decision-making faster. However, Mr Erik Sorensen, a long-standing board member, found the changes did not suit him and he resigned this autumn. The company also wants to concentrate on new products, partly by releasing resources from other areas. This was reflected by its recent decision to sell its bulk penicillin production unit. The obverse of this disposal is the DKr6bn-plus which has been invested in new plant over three years, with five new international plants in enzymes and pharmaceutical production due to start up in coming months. This, said Mr Kurt Anker Nielsen, finance director, was one of the main reason why costs, up 16 per cent against a sales increase of 12 per cent at nine months, had soared. Staff for the plants have been recruited, although the plants are not yet contributing to sales. Depreciation costs have also risen. The group has a stated aim of increasing profits by 15 per cent a year, he said. Viewed over the 1991-94 period, the average increase will be about 13-14 per cent in spite of this year's slip, 'so we are not that far off'.</p>

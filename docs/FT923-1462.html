			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / US talks still grappling with Russian debt TALKS in Washington have so far failed to resolve disagreements over how to ease some of Russia's debt repayment burden, but ministers and officials remain confident they can still reach a formal debt rescheduling agreement in the next month or so. Russia must settle a number of outstanding issues with the other republics of the former Soviet Union, while its creditors are at odds with each other on how to structure the rescheduling agreement they hope to conclude at the Paris Club of creditor-nations in October. Germany and the US have taken opposite stances on the need for concessions to Russia on its debt problem. Germany, by far Russia's largest creditor, wants tougher conditions than the US, which has relatively little money at stake in any debt deferral. Over the juridical details of a Paris Club agreement looms the question of economic reality: will Russia earn enough money next year to meet the repayment obligations it will take on? 'We want to sign an agreement we can definitely fulfil,' says Mr Pyotr Aven, Russia's minister for foreign economic relations. He says talks are still proceeding on the basis of preliminary projections for the Russian balance of payments in 1993, which suggest his country could take on a payment schedule that fell within Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.4bn). But detailed balance of payments projections are not yet available. 'Until we have them, it is impossible to conclude a rescheduling. At the moment, we are mainly discussing ideology,' Mr Aven added. Among the issues is the reworking of last year's agreement under which all the republics took on joint and several responsibility for the former-Soviet Union debt. Russia has been negotiating with many of the smaller republics to take over their share of responsibility for the debt, in exchange for their abandonment of any claim on Soviet assets, such as embassy buildings. But Mr Aven said Russia wants a different agreement with Ukraine, because its share of the debt is too big for this kind of 'zero option' treatment. This rearrangement of responsibilities poses problems for some of Russia's creditors, but Paris Club officials are sure a deal can be worked out.</p>

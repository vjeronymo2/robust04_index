			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Labour's tax plans attacked by Major THE STRUGGLE to map out a new political battleground began in earnest yesterday as Mr John Major attacked Labour's tax plans and his opponents homed in on voters' concerns over the National Health Service. With their poor showing at the local elections and the poll tax controversy fading in voters' minds, the Tories are seeking to regain the initiative by highlighting Labour's tax and spending proposals. In contrast, Labour wants to shift the electorate's attention to unemployment and a widely perceived decline in health, education and other social services. Evidence of the parties' new priorities came in Commons question-time yesterday. Mr Major sought to draw attention to Labour's promise to end the ceiling on national insurance contributions and to raise top income tax rates to 50 per cent. He also delivered a side-swipe to the Liberal Democrats by rejecting voting reform and obliquely dismissing a tax-raising assembly for Scotland. In a vigorous counter-attack, Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, attempted to put the health service at the centre of debate. Citing a Watford hospital, he said the NHS reforms were creating an unethical 'two-tier' service whereby general practitioners who had opted to take control of their budgets were getting preferential treatment for their patients. Mr Major denied the claim, saying operations were being conducted on a basis of need. Both main parties are gearing up for a summer of campaigning conducted against a background of speculation over an autumn general election. While the Conservatives are anxious to regain the initiative, party officials are nervous of stepping up their fight-back before next week's Monmouth by-election where a 9,000 vote majority is under threat. In his Commons' answers, Mr Major said Labour's policies on tax and spending proposals would be costed and the findings presented to voters. Anticipating further attacks, Labour officials were last night outlining the contents of a speech to be given by Mr Kinnock in London today challenging the Tories to explain how they will both reduce taxes and raise the standards of social services. By increasing top rate tax and foregoing tax cuts, Labour would have Pounds 20bn in the course of a parliament to restore funding, he will tell a conference of health and community care workers. While Mr Kinnock ruled out tax cuts, Labour officials made clear that this did not exclude raising tax allowances to exempt the lowest paid from the tax net.</p>

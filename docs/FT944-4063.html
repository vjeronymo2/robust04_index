			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (14): Confidence seeping back - Birmingham and the Midlands / Developers remain very cautious about speculative development Price Waterhouse, accountants, recently decided that it might have a better chance of renting out an office building it had not used for two years if, instead of offering a rent-free period to any tenant prepared to take over its lease, it offered a cash payment of Pounds 1m. It was an indication of the slack market for second-hand property in Birmingham, the leading office centre of both the East and West Midlands. Richard Ellis, chartered surveyors, noted that of the 204,000 sq ft taken up in the year to last June, only one third of the total was taken up after January. Indeed, Healey &amp; Baker, chartered surveyors, calculated that on average city-centre rents in the West Midlands declined by 1.5 per cent over broadly the same period. Although this compared with a decline of 10.4 per cent for the UK as a whole, it was in vivid contrast to the East Midlands. There, rental growth of 4.7 per cent took place in the first half making it the fastest-growing region in the UK with, as Healey &amp; Baker put it, 'the upturn in the market mainly concentrated on the two largest towns, Leicester and Nottingham.' That said, more activity was expected in Birmingham, with, Richard Ellis predicted, 'the steady demand for small second-hand units likely to continue and the prospect of further developments starting which could assure more pre-lettings.' Developers remain very cautious about speculative development but some confidence is seeping back into the market. This is reflected in the activity of the London-based property institutions. British Airways Pension Fund is purchasing an office building at Brindleyplace and Schroder Exempt Property Unit Trust has bought offices not only in Birmingham city centre, but also at Birmingham Business Park, adjacent to the airport south of the city - and is funding a Bryant Properties distribution park near Coventry. The institutional interest in offices is linked to space. 'The shortage of supply of offices is a key factor in this. Rents are more likely to rise here in Birmingham than in any other regional city. If you want 100,000 square feet now, you'll have to wait two years,' said Mr Alan Chatham, director of Brindleyplace, a subsidiary of Argent Group. Although development has continued steadily at Birmingham Business Park, this has not been the case in the city centre. The Temple Court development of Richardson Barberry Properties has been pre-let to the Lord Chancellors department, for county courts, and to Coopers &amp; Lybrand, accountants. Now Richardson Barberry is seeking planning permission for a new and adjacent office building of 200,000 sq ft, roughly the same size as Temple Court. But the only speculative office building of more than 50,000 sq ft under construction in or near the city centre is One Brindleyplace. Brindleyplace, across a canal from the new International Convention Centre, is, at 17 acres, one of the largest city-centre property developments presently under construction in the UK. Apart from the speculative Number One, a building of 150,000 sq ft has been pre-let to British Telecom, the largest pre-let in the Midlands for five years. Brindleyplace is talking to possible future tenants such as Central TV, Eversheds, solicitors, and Mercury, the telecommunications company. The list of possible tenants for Brindleyplace points to what Mr Julian Shellard of Richard Ellis said was 'a level of unsatisfied occupational demand' building up. That, he suggested, would result over the next 12-18 months in an increasing supply of top-quality office buildings. Such an awakening of activity is not confined, however, to the offices sector. Along the M6 and M42 motorways there has been increasing demand for design-and-build units by local industrialists anxious to increase the efficiency of their distribution, while contract distribution companies have been in the market for warehousing, frequently on short or medium term leases. Grimley JR Eve, chartered surveyors, noted that 'in the industrial market there have been numerous transactions, particularly in the owner-occupied sector where realistically-priced freehold accommodation is in demand.' If, however, interest rates increase, Grimley expects more activity in the leasehold sector of the industrial market. Investment in distribution parks on motorways has been relatively recession-proof. With the market stimulated by forecasts of greater need, not least to meet what is assumed will be a growing rail freight traffic to Europe through the Channel Tunnel, plans for new developments have proliferated. Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors, calculated that at 20 motorway junctions within 25 miles of Birmingham, there is 1,500 acres of land for which planning permission to build business and distribution parks has been sought or granted. Theoretically, this could translate into the provision of up to 25m sq ft of business space. Who would occupy such space is not clear. But there is the possibility of a recurrence of the situation which emerged along the M4 where, during the 1980s, optimistic views of demand for offices led to over-supply in the 1990s. In the retail sector, concern is of a different order. The government's newly-expressed determination to promote the viability and vitality of town centres has rekindled, somewhat belatedly given the developments of the 1980s, the debate about new shopping centres. The relationship between Fosse Park, on the edge of Leicester, and the shopping heart of the city itself, is the subject of local controversy. In the West Midlands, meanwhile, the proposal of Chelsfield to extend the Merry Hill shopping centre in Dudley by a further 650,000 sq ft has rung alarm bells in Birmingham, where proposals to re-develop the Bull Ring have been shelved in favour of gradual rehabilitation.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Nils Morten Udgaard: "Jan Henry's Battle With </F> History"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] It is not unwieldy fishermen  from the far north but, rather, a solid Norwegian citizenry in  the south whose thinking for decades has been out of step with  the concept of European integration. That is why the road to  Brussels today is so long and so arduous.    Ever since 1905 Norway has been close to Great Britain in  foreign policy philosophy. Two world wars and a joint battle  against a Nazi Europe in 1940-45 joined the Britons and the  Norwegians. As a result it was a major break with custom when  the Britons in 1972 went into the EC (albeit backwards) while  Norwegian voters chose to remain on the outside. [passage  omitted]    What is interesting about Norway is that once the Danes and  the Britons bid farewell and disappeared into the EC, we needed  other countries to be travel guides towards the EC/EU [European  Union]. The Swedes declared their intent to apply (in passing)  in October 1990 when they unveiled a drastic economic crisis  program that spelled the end of the "Swedish model." It was no  longer possible to continue to extend and extend the welfare  state, East Europe did not want to choose the Swedish "third  way" between capitalism and communism, and Sweden wound up  placing its bets on Europe both politically and industrially.  With increased unemployment, a debt crisis, and devaluation the  country was highly motivated economically.    The Finns were close behind. Less than 100 days after the  dissolution of the Soviet Union, a Finnish application for EC  membership was on the table in Brussels. That was March 1992.  Finland entered by the "window of opportunity" to become a  member of the greater European family. The Finns had, and have,  their very strong reasons.    Oil-rich Norway has not been under any strong economic  pressure to become a member, as the Swedes and the Danes have  been, nor do they have the same security threat overshadowing  them as the Finns have. As a result such values as the meaning  of life, Norway, and the world gain in importance. And this is  where we notice that Norway has lacked that sense of European  citizenship that has been a driving force among the countries of  the continent.    It is a broad citizenship that sees itself as part of a  larger Europe through family tradition and the pursuit of  profession, extending beyond the national and the regional.  This sense of citizenship we know in Norway primarily from the  centuries-old tradition of Danish senior civil servants [in  Norway]. This indoctrination of European thought patterns was  very important for Norway, but the ranks of senior civil  servants were never large and for a long time these persons were  not regarded as 100-percent Norwegians. It is only in the very  last years that historians are looking at the 400-year "night"  with the Danes with new eyes. Now they are saying that it "was  a good night."    Norway's deep-rooted Euroskepticism was seen perhaps the  most  clearly when in 1929 French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand  unveiled a plan for a European union. In the League of Nations,  Norway took a strong stance against such "group arrangements,"  preferring to escape into nonbinding support for a "universal  coalition of all the world's nations." [passage omitted]    The skepticism is seen all through and beyond the war years  when thoughts of European integration once again arose in  conjunction with initial doubts about the Marshall Plan. It  even made British Finance Minister Hugh Dalton ask in 1947  whether Norway really belongs in West Europe. "The Norwegian  people are...skeptical to integration plans...with the  Mediterranean countries," Foreign Minister Halvard Lange said  two years later, after Norway had joined NATO.    [Fisheries Minister] Jan Henry T. Olsen today has to do  battle not only with the Mediterranean countries with regard to  "not one fish," but also with the modern tradition of Norwegians  mentally distancing themselves from the rest of Europe.</p>

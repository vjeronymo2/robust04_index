			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] New York, May 12 (TANJUG) -- The U.N. Security  Council on Wednesday evening condemned Bosnian Muslim attacks on  Brcko, Serb town in the north of the ex-Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina where four people were killed and 13 wounded  on Tuesday. The Security Council is concerned about the reports  on the shelling of Brcko...[ellipses as received] by the Muslim  government forces which resulted in civilian deaths, including  those of women and children, reporters learned from Security  Council President Ibrahim Gambari of Nigeria after a  consultative session.    Bosnian Muslim and Croat military commanders recently  publically confirmed they are preparing an offensive on Brcko,  Serb town in the northwestern part of the corridor which links  the eastern and western parts of the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS).    On Tuesday evening the Muslims shelled Brcko during a  session  of the RS parliament. The attack left four Serb civilians dead  and 13 wounded. Only 24 hours later, the Muslims attacked  again, but this time no-one was injured. RS officials described  the attacks as the latest Muslim attempt to provoke a Serb  military response and force fresh NATO air strikes against the  Serbs.    Gambari also said that the Security Council is worried about  the violation of the security measures in the region of Tuzla  (Muslim-controlled city in northeast Bosnia) especially "the  Serb shelling."    However, TANJUG learns that the Muslims launched artillery  and infantry attacks on Serb positions near Tuzla on Wednesday,  and U.N. representatives in Sarajevo confirmed that the Muslims  have massed strong forces in the south and southwest of this  city aiming to prevent the movements of U.N. military observers  and to prepare military actions in the region.    According to the Nigerian diplomat, the Security Council  called on the warring sides on Bosnia to fully cooperate with  the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), to meet their obligations  and to refrain from actions which could worsen the situation or  threaten the peace process.    Gambari said that the Security Council session did not  discuss in detail the modified French proposal on Brcko because  the opinion prevailed that it is necessary to wait for the  outcome of the meeting of the foreign ministers of Russia,  United States and the European Union scheduled to open in Geneva  on Friday.    Russia insisted that the Security Council condemns the  massing of the Muslim heavy arms and their offensive in Mt.  Igman, which is close to the exclusion zone in Sarajevo, but  Gambari failed to mention this.</p>

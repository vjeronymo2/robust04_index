			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Petrovac, June 12 (TANJUG) -- Fierce inter-Moslem  clashes continued on Sunday morning [12 June] in the autonomous  provice of western Bosnia (APWB), local Moslem media reported.  Radio Velkaton in Velika Kladusa, the APWB administrative  centre, reported that apwb military and civilian targets along  the entire fromtline were continuously attacked by moslem forces  loyal to the Sarajevo-based central Moslem authorities headed by  fundamentalist leader Alija Izetbegovic. The radio reported  losses on both sides, but did not specify whether the frontline  was moved.    Izetbegovic's Radio Cazin and Radio Sarajevo reported  fiercest clashes at Pecigrad and Todorov where Izetbegovic's  forces strongly attack the APWB forces which were trying hard to  defend themselves. Izetbegovic's media added that an APWB  brigade changed sides and took hold of several hamlets around  Todorovo in the past 24 hours, moving considerably the frontline.    World news agencies, however, quoted Eric Chaperon, UNPROFOR  (U.N. Protection Force) spokesman in Sarajevo, as stating that  the APWB forces made an advance in the attack they began on  Friday. Chaperon said that the Izetbegovic forces were  suppressed from the line of contact in acute attacks which used  heavy artillery and mortars, with losses indicated to have been  suffered by both sides.    Major Yvon Desjardins, UNPROFOR spokesman in Zagreb,  specified that heavy fighting continued on Sunday morning in the  central and western sections of the Bihac pocket in the APWB  territory, whence reports came about APWB leader Fikret Abdic  forces' opening artillery and tank-gun fire. Maj. Desjardins,  however, could not immediately confirm the reports that  Izetbegovic's forces had lost some of their territories.    Fikret Abdic, the opponent of the war option backed by Alija  Izetbegovic, last autumn proclaimed the APWB (Autonomous  Province of Western Bosnia) and immediately agreed a truce with  Bosnian Serbs and Croats.</p>

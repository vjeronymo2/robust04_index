			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rallies at London close THE DOLLAR rallied sharply against the D-Mark in late European trading yesterday amid increasing speculation that Denmark would vote 'yes' to the Maastricht treaty in its referendum today and that the Bundesbank would reduce short-term interest rates tomorrow, writes James Blitz. In recent weeks, expectations that the Danes could reject the Maastricht treaty have led to some inflows into the D-Mark and the Swiss franc. But a raft of opinion polls in recent days has underlined that, this time, the Danes will probably ratify the treaty, making the D-Mark less of a safe haven in Europe. The latest opinion poll showed the 'yes' vote at 50 per cent and the 'no' vote at 32 per cent, a far better performance by the pro-treaty lobby than was the case a year ago. Mr Christian Dunis, an economist at Chemical Bank in London, said the Maastricht treaty was increasingly looking like a non-event. At the same time, there was speculation that the Bundesbank would lower its discount rate by as much as  1/2 percentage point this week, following last week's larger than expected reduction in the repo rate to 7.60 per cent. The Bundesbank went out of its way last week to calm down expectations of another cut in interest rates. However, a 25 basis-point reduction in the discount rate already appears to have been discounted by dealers at the very least. A meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, due tomorrow, has also been the cause of speculation that the US central bank may lean towards tightening interest rate policy soon. Amid all of these factors, the dollar rose at the end of the day, peaking at DM1.6170 and closing in London at DM1.6160, up nearly  1/2 pfennig on balance. In New York it eased back to end at DM1.6140. Within Europe, the D-Mark weakened slightly against several currencies as dealers awaited tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting. The French franc ended rather stronger against the German currency, at FFr3.366 from a previous close of FFr3.373. One factor helping the French currency higher was the Bank of France's decision not to leave interest rates unchanged at what is now a once-a-week intervention in the money markets. Sterling closed higher, at DM2.4775 from a previous DM2.4650, as dealers awaited today's quarterly inflation report from the Bank of England. The assumption in the market was that the Bank would take a hawkish line on inflation following suggestions that the UK government might cut base rates again to help it out of its political difficulties. The Italian lira was also firm against the D-Mark, in what was seen as a belated response to a comment made last week by Mr George Soros, the currency speculator, that Italian capital markets were worth investing in. The lira ended at L914.9 from a previous L918.1.</p>

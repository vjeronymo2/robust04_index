			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of many people being an important part of the move, and excellent support from CRH and WSH, and a top-notch moving company, our move went smoothly. Our staff was very supportive of the move, despite the fact that it meant most people would have to relocate. For all employees involved in a short-distance transfer, the PCS's were processed quickly and without complication. Because of the sparse population near the new office, the staff was given a 25 mile radius from the new office to move into and still claim a short-distance transfer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When reviewing our comments, it should be noted that our office at Ann Arbor was rather unique. It did not have a public service unit, or any interaction with the public. It also did not have a CWA or NWR program. We still don't have these programs, but will have them shortly when we pick up the service programs from WSOs Detroit and Flint. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Move From Where to Where_Distance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The move occurred between Ann Arbor, MI and White Lake MI, which is a distance of 48 miles. AFOS and other communications were disconnected at 8 AM and running again by 8 PM. We were fully operational by 10 PM that day. The move was managed by following the above-mentioned documents. It went smoothly with no problems encountered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 2. User Notification of the Move <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The attached user notification list was used to notify all users of our move (attachment 8). It was developed based on a generic list provided by CRH (attachment 9). The move letter is also attached (attachment 10) as is the press release that was sent on AFOS (attachment 11). Notification went smoothly with no problems encountered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Service Backup <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The attached service back-up plan (attachment 12) and letter explaining the Flexzone Program (attachment 13) enabled service back-up to be perfectly executed with no problems encountered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Communications, Installation, and Checkout <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> An inventory of all circuits at the old office was taken (attachment 14). This included all voice and data circuits. Then a list was made of all of the necessary circuits that would be needed at the new office, including voice and data. A Request for Change was written by WSH which also addressed necessary actions (attachment 15). Regional Headquarters then ordered new circuits that were needed and ordered ``add term circuits'' for circuits that could be used at both locations i.e. AFOS RDC Circuits. The add term circuits avoided the conflict of having to connect both ends when the move took place. These circuits were ordered approximately eight months in advance with an installation date at least a month in advance of the move. A minor problem did develop with the local telephone company during the evening of the move. It was quickly taken care of by our ESA. Our Regional Communication Manager was also a tremendous help on moving day. No matter how well the communications portion of a move is planned, the actions of the local telephone company are out of the NWS's hands. Other than that minor problem, no other problems were encountered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 5. The Move of Furniture and Equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The move of furniture was handled by one of our forecasters. He was in charge of everything from marking what furniture was to be shipped to the new office, to what furniture was to be made excess property. He also worked with our secretary on preparing the excess property list (attachment 16), worked with CASC and met with the movers to arrange details of the move, and drew color coded maps for both locations as to where each piece of furniture was to be taken from and placed. On move day he oversaw the move of furniture out of Ann Arbor, while our Service Hydrologist oversaw the move of furniture into the new White Lake office. The move of furniture went smoothly with no problems encountered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CRH SOD and CASC procurement handled contracting the moving company for both furniture and equipment. They did not look for the lowest bidder, but the company that showed they could move the equipment properly, without tipping or laying the equipment over. The mover also had to agree to allow the NWS to instruct them what to move and when. This allowed the NWS to get the equipment loaded first and moved safely to the new office immediately. Not only were no problems encountered in moving equipment, but the ability to dictate what equipment was to be moved first enabled us to restore full operations as quickly as we did. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 6. System Installation and Checkout <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The following were the major systems relocated at DTX: AFOS, SWIS, and Remote RADAR displays. An NWS telephone system was also installed at the new office. Approximately 8 months in advance of the move, an inventory was conducted of all of the cables needed by the major systems being moved. The larger cables, such as the AFOS GDM Bus cables were ordered by CRH. The smaller cables were made by the Electronics staff at the WSFO using supplies purchased locally. These were cables such as the ABT cables. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As soon as the building was accepted, the SFT installed the necessary peculiar electrical outlets for the systems that would be installed. At the same time the electronics staff installed all of the phone system cabling and all of the system cables. The phone system cables were terminated where necessary and the system cables were checked to ensure the correct connectors were in the correct locations. The phone system was connected and all of the phone locations were programmed and checked out for proper operation. CRH supplied the phone system and the phone sets. All of the interconnecting cabling and termination supplies were purchased locally by the electronics staff. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The layout of the equipment in the new office was planned well in advance of the move and diagrammed, to scale, by CRH SOD. This diagram allowed local staff to determine where all furniture and equipment would be located. It also allowed the electronics staff to determine where all of the system cables and telephone cables needed to be terminated. As a result, no problems were encountered with systems installation and checkout. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Validation of System Operability and Service Delivery <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Diagnostics were run on AFOS followed by a MODIFY. Then all equipment was turned on and the electronics staff and forecasters made sure all incoming data was received. We were fully operational and receiving all incoming data by 10 PM the evening of the move and there were no problems encountered validating the system operability or products delivered by the WSFO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> User Reaction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> User reaction has been extremely positive. After moving to White Lake, we immediately held 2 open houses. One was for our users (see attachment 17), and one for our new neighbors (see attachment 18). Both open houses went a long way toward building a positive relationship with our users. A typical response from our users is one that a county emergency manager made to a letter from our WPM (attachment 19). One neighbor did raise some concerns which were addressed in a memo which is attached to this response (attachment 20). The response satisfied his concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Attachments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

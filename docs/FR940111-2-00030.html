			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fact that the prohibition in 34A&hyph;2&hyph;111 does not apply to complaints from governmental entities or to other State environmental programs provides the State some options for the general public to use in reporting concerns about possible violation or problems related to wastewater treatment or effluent. The description of the State process will be published in major newspapers in South Dakota and posted in the DENR offices located throughout the State. Therefore, mechanisms exist to ensure proper consideration of information from the general public and are sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of public participation consistent with 40 CFR 123.26.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA acknowledges there may be some delay in investigation of information received from the general public because of the requirement for a signed complaint. South Dakota has explained, however, that the requirement should not unduly delay prompt investigation when the member of the general public indicates a willingness to identify himself or herself and sign a complaint.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The volume of unsigned complaints which are received by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any one entity is not expected to be so great that it would strain the resources available to that organization. However, the DENR is responsible for assuring whatever resources needed to respond to unsigned complaints are available, as well as providing adequate resources to administer the NPDES program as a whole.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA notes that the adequacy and effectiveness of DENR's public reporting requirements are easily verified, both by EPA and the general public. If the described procedures do not, in practice, provide for adequate and effective public reporting, DENR's compliance with public reporting requirements may be reexamined. Should subsequent administrative or judicial interpretations of Section 111 broaden its scope from that described in the program submission or otherwise impair implementation of the public reporting procedures, EPA may reevaluate whether the existence of Section 111 yet enables DENR to adequately administer the NPDES program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Motives of Anonymous Tipsters, Rights of the Accused, and Complainant Fear of Reprisal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA does not dispute that some complaints may be submitted with questionable motives or that signed complaints may often be more credible than unsigned ones. ``Crank'' calls may be from disgruntled neighbors or business competitors. However, a statute is not needed to eliminate the problems associated with frivolous calls. The DENR has professionally trained staff capable of screening out such calls, based on the information provided or not provided. Such calls are also possible from persons who do sign their names.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fact that the prohibition applies only to the general public and not to other governmental entities allows the NPDES program to use information referred to it by these entities. This information may be provided as problems the entities have identified in the course of their duties (including accepting referrals). It may also come from problems identified by complainants to other entities about their programs which contain information also applicable to the NPDES program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the rights of the accused, the Sixth Amendment right to face accusers applies in criminal cases when the testimony of an informant is to be used in trial. However, if an informant's tip is independently confirmed by a law enforcement agency and the testimony of the informant is not needed at trial, then any rights under this amendment have not been affected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

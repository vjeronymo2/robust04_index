			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Musabasic on the news conference by </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic,  Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, and Pakistani Prime  Minister Benazir Bhutto in Sarajevo on 2 February; Ciller and  Bhutto statements are in English with superimposed  Serbo-Croatian translation -- recorded]    [Text] [Musabasic] After a welcoming ceremony with the  highest state honors in front of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency building, Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and  Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and their associates  were greeted by Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija  Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. Turkish Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin was also with the Turkish delegation,  while his counterpart Ahmad Sardar Asif Ali was with the  Pakistani delegation.    The esteemed guests then held talks first with Presidency  President Izetbegovic and then with Prime Minister Silajdzic.  After the talks, decrees on friendship and cooperation were  signed in front of a number of reporters. The decree on  friendship and cooperation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Turkey  was signed by Prime Ministers Silajdzic and Ciller, and between  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Pakistan by Silajdzic and Bhutto.    After the signing ceremony, Presidency President Alija  Izetbegovic made the following statement:    [Izetbegovic] It is a great honor and pleasure for me to  have had a chance to welcome to Sarajevo Pakistani Prime  Minister Benazir Bhutto and Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller.  Our two esteemed guests come from countries friendly toward us,  countries that base their relations with other countries and the  world on the defense of the principles of the UN Charter, a  dedication to human rights, and a respect for human dignity.    I would like to stress that our esteemed guests have been  elected prime ministers in their countries through democratic  elections, which is a fact that supports [words indistinct].  Therefore it is no coincidence that the two prime ministers are  today guests of this besieged city, which symbolizes resistance  and the heroic struggle of the peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina for  sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the political  independence of our country. Our tragedy provides our true  friends with an opportunity to to show in deed that they are  friends, but also to unmask the hypocrisy of a number of  countries that defend human rights in words only. In adopting  resolutions and declarations, these countries [words indistinct]  but a lack of any concrete action on their implementation has  contributed to the continuation of the war, and to the  deterioration of the situation in our country.    I would like to express my gratitude to Mrs. Bhutto and Mrs.  Ciller for the unqualified support we have received from their  governments and people in our struggle for a just peace. This  country, which is a victim of two (fascist) [words indistinct].  The joint declaration of the two prime ministers -- with which I  have had a chance to acquaint myself -- reiterates their  readiness to extend, on a bilateral level, concrete material and  other assistance to our struggle.    Finally, I would like to congratulate these brave women on  their personal courage to come to Sarajevo despite warnings not  to do so. Their visit and support are an encouragement to us to  persevere in the struggle for the defense of our homeland, and  therefore for all those principles on which the United Nations  rest. This is also a incentive to all the defenders of  democratic [word indistinct] in the world to intensify their  efforts in the search for a just peace [words indistinct].    [Musabasic] The Turkish and Pakistani prime ministers also  prepared a declaration on their visit to Sarajevo, and they  addressed a few words to the reporters.    Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said:    [Ciller] We are here primarily for humanitarian purposes.  We believe that the Bosnians are fighting for freedom,  territorial integrity, and human rights. We have always been  concerned about human rights, regardless of where [word  indistinct]. The basic right is the right to life. Thus our  aim can serve as an appeal for the defense of human rights.    Second, we believe in territorial integrity, and we believe  that territorial integrity always has to be defended. This is  why we believe that the efforts by the European Commnity must be  reassessed, and they must be complete. This is a humanitarian  issue, and also a moral issue [word indistinct]. Civilians are  being killed here. We have once again to draw the attention of  the world community to the fact that this is a moral issue. We  have always defended democracy and human rights, and territorial  integrity. Now it is time to unite and defend the aims that we  and the international community support.    It is an European idea, coexistence, coexistence among  various religions, ethnic groups, and cultures, and we have to  defend that. (That) is our treasure. This is the reason why we  should defend that idea. The territorial integrity and  coexistence in Sarajevo [words indistinct] but it has to be a  just peace [words indistinct].    [Musabasic] Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto told the  reporters that she did not want to reiterate the Sarajevo  declaration, but she stated:    [Bhutto] We have signed this declaration less as prime  ministers and more as mothers, daughters, and women, to express  our solidarity with the suffering of the people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also to draw the attention of the world  once again to this place where the people are suffering so. We  have to do something to stop this human suffering. But it is  not only a question of human suffering, it is also a question of  the values on which the UN Charter is based, and upon which  peace and stability in the world have been built.    Territorial integrity must be respected and aggression must  not be rewarded. The international community has to act fast.  First to stop the killing of innocent people, women, and  children, and second, to protect the values that enable the  world to live in peace. Territorial integrity must be defended,  and aggression must not be rewarded if the world is to continue  to live in peace.</p>

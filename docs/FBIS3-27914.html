About 60 demonstrators and policemen  were injured.    Following a national farmers rally against the rice market  opening, held at the Marronnier Park at Tongsung-tong at 1 PM,  the participating farmers and students totaling about 20,000  marched along the Chongno Street carrying placards that read,  "Kim Yong-sam Government Should Step Down" and "Hold Uruguay  Round Talks Again."    As the demonstrators tried to proceed toward the American  Embassy and Chongwadae [presidential residence], police cordoned  them off, in the course of which they violently clashed with  stick-wielding demonstrators.    A group of demonstrators raided three unoccupied police  buses  near Samil Building, setting fire to one of them and smashing  the windows of the two tohers. They also destoryed a nearby  garbage truck and smashed the doors of a KBS sedan.    In another action, student demonstrators surrounded 100 riot  police at Chongkye 2-ka and collected and set fire to their  helmets, shields and gas masks.    The police decided to criminally punish those who took part  in violence as well as those who organized the rally.    The rally was attended by Yi Ki-taek, head of the Democratic  Party, 11 other opposition party lawmakers, and a number of  dissident leaders.</p>

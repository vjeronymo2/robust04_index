			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Observer: Customer loyalty It is easy for journalists to abuse the privilege of their position by slagging off a product or company that has provided them with shoddy service. Members of the public rarely get the same sort of response as an incensed scribe threatening to reveal all. Even so Lynn Barber's tale, in The Independent on Sunday, of how her daughter has been waiting seven weeks for her free camera and cash card after opening a Lloyds Bank student account, struck a chord. The free camera has finally arrived - it doesn't work - but still no sign of her daughter's cash card. Ms Barber contrasts Lloyds' response with that of the John Lewis department store group after she complained about a worn out loose cover for her sofa. The offending item was whisked off to a laboratory to see what went wrong and a replacement is being made as fast as possible. 'Imagine if someone had seen that cover and you had said you got it at John Lewis,' a worried John Lewis partner told Ms Barber. The difference between a clearing bank and a department store is that the latter's success depends on repeat business, whereas a clearing bank can live off a near captive customer base. That said, tales like the above do raise the question of whether Lloyds Bank really deserves its reputation as the best-managed London clearing bank.</p>

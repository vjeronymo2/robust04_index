			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Gerfried Sperl editorial: "Every Day Everything -- or </F> Nothing"]    [Text] In his decision to talk publicly about his  problems, President Klestil only told half the truth. Now the  whole truth has become apparent. The word "resignation"  appeared for the first time on the front page of a daily -- as  though NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG had decided to abandon him after it  had insinuated, with the help of a few readers' letters a few  days earlier, that people believed that he ("and his family")  should be left alone. Has Thomas Klestil caused this media war  through carelessness? Will he receive EVERYTHING EVERYDAY -- or  will he be left without anything in the end?    U.S. President Bill Clinton is also facing media reports  about former mistresses. Still, the population apparently  judges him by his domestic achievements and his performance as  President. Polls have been showing large popular support for  some time -- for good reasons: Clinton did not offer stories  about his past to the media, and he did not appoint beauty  queens as members of his cabinet. His political program is not  shaped and influenced by a mistress -- even if only optically.    On the other hand, the interviews with Edith Klestil have  shown how eloquent and quick-witted the "First Lady" is. It has  become clear that she might have been able to assume political  tasks beyond the duties laid down in the protocol, that she  might have become a mini-Hillary at the Hofburg Palace. Thus,  it is all the more understandable that, as a first conclusion,  she left the official villa and not her husband, who must have  left her a long time ago as far as his feelings are concerned.    Even though Klestil's resignation might seem obvious to  some,  and even though some of his friends in the Austrian People's  Party might not be too unhappy about that, resignation should  not be offered as an easy solution to the president -- all the  more so because the idea was launched by tabloids. Moreover, a  resignation by the president is not covered by the Constitution  -- as though the rules of the monarchy were still valid.    Naturally Austria has not plunged into a state crisis  because  of this affair. The president continues to be able to act  politically. However, the need for the president to settle his  private matters that even effects his closest aides at the  office is all the greater. What is the real problem?    First, a clarification is required regarding the private  sphere that was sold to the population as intact during the  election campaign. Klestil should try to win back his wife on  her conditions or seek a divorce. In both cases, his aide  Margot Loeffler would have to return to the Foreign Ministry,  which could be ordered by the foreign minister, who is her  official boss.    Second, the office itself must be examined. Klestil has  always considered his German counterpart, President Richard von  Weizsaecker, as his ideal. This is probably no longer topical,  even though a solution of his private problems might save some  of his public authority. It would probably take months to  restore it.    If it is not possible to repair the presidency, the public,  the Austrian People's Party, Klestil himself would have to think  about resignation. The president still has a little time to  prevent this and to prove that he is still capable of fulfilling  his duties as president.    Otherwise, there is the danger of a greater damage and of a  lasting weakness: Whereas anger, bitterness, and withdrawal  characterized Waldheim's term of office, the worst of all  judgments is now threatening -- that of ridicule.</p>

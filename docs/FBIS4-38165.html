			<p>BFN     [Text] The Islamic Action Front [IAF] and the Pan-Arab  Action Front [PAAF] have held a news conference in which they  discussed developments in the national, Arab, and international  arenas. IAF Secretary General Ishaq al-Farhan read out a joint  statement issued by the two parties.    The statement expresses both parties' concern over  violations  of citizens' liberties, guaranteed by the noble Islamic  shari'ah, safeguarded by the Constitution, and imposed by the  state of democracy adopted by our people. The statement deals  with the following forms of violation:    -- The detention of citizens for months without being  referred to civilian courts, as well as their exposure up to now  to psychological and physical torture.    The statement adds: "The state organs still insist on  preventing the people's deputies from visiting the prisons,  particularly the General Intelligence prison, to acquaint  themselves with conditions inside prisons, after reports have  leaked regarding practices incompatible with man's dignity and  rights.    The statement calls for an immediate release of all  prisoners  and for compensating them for the harm they have suffered,  particularly those who were taken from schools and consequently  missed their school year.    The statement also deals with restrictions imposed on the  activities of political parties and their members. It says:  "We feel the government does not treat the parties as national  institutions established in accordance with the constitution and  the law. Instead, it casts doubts on them, restricts their  activity, and besieges them in order to prove that the party  experience in Jordan has failed."    The statement condemns administrative officers' insistence  on  preventing party activities, depending on an unfair  interpretation of the law. They therefore prevent receptions,  festivals, and seminars in public halls and squares as if they  were telling the parties not to meet over a national cause.  They also watch members of some parties and press them to  resign from their parties, after their memberships have become  obstacles preventing their professional stability and promotions  while the government shows bias toward other pro-government  parties and supports the party that constantly praises it."    The statement refers to restrictions on the ulema and the  educational institutions and says the government prevents them  from playing the role they used to play even under martial law.  The clearest example of that is that the former education  minister's decision not to allow the use of school facilities  during summer holidays and his cancellation of previous  approvals by education directors."    The statement adds: "The schools, which were built at the  expense of the people's bread, should be centers of  enlightenment in the region and should be used to serve the  local community through educational and social programs with the  approval, help, and supervision of competent authorities. We  view the education minister's decision as determination to  deprive students from educational programs, chief of which are  plans for students to learn the Koran by heart. This activity  is conducted by the Society for the Preservation of the Koran,  licensed by the Ministry of Culture, in order to compensate for  the Education Ministry's failure to carry out this task."    Regarding interference concerning passports and restrictions  on citizens who want to travel abroad, the statement says:  "Every citizen has the right to have a passport and to travel  abroad and return to the homeland."    Regarding the new government, the statement says: "Our two  parties also criticize the way the government was formed under  these critical circumstances." It adds: "The prime minister  who was asked to reshuffle the cabinet did not consult the  parties and the parliamentary blocs. Therefore, the  government's makeup was intended to satisfy certain sides at the  expense of the national interests. So, the number of ministers  was the largest in Jordan's history. It is enough for us to  know that it includes eight ministers without portfolios. We  also criticize the government because its makeup is aimed at  weakening the opposition in the House of Representatives by  securing an additional number of deputies in order to go ahead  with plans to sign a unilateral reconciliation agreement with  the Zionist enemy."    The statement asks the government to convene an  extraordinary session to present a statement to the House of  Representatives, especially since only seven ministers have  remained in the government that had received a slight majority  by the House of Representatives.    The statement emphasizes the following:    1. The Palestinian people's right to practice their  legitimate right to resist in order to attain their objectives  of liberation, return, and sovereignty on all their homeland.  Hence, any attempt to deny them this right is an aggression  against a natural right, and they have the right to reject and  resist it.    2. The unity of our Palestinian people is a sacred unity  that should be preserved and protected from any encroachment.  Hence, we consider any encroachment on the unity of the  Palestinian people as prohibited and criminal.    The statement adds: "As for the Jordanian arena, after a  suspension [of the peace negotiations] caused by the siege on  the Gulf of Aqaba, the past two weeks witnessed unnatural  acceleration that looks like a race with the Palestinian  negotiator. Sub-agendas on borders, security, and water have  been signed tackling details that our two parties believe  represent a deviation from the so-called national constants that  focussed on a comprehensive solution, the return of Jerusalem,  and solving the problem of refugees.    On normalization of relations with the Zionist enemy, the  statement says: The Arab regimes, including the PLO, continue  normalization measures through secret and open meetings and  bilateral and collective meetings. These meetings were held in  several Arab countries including Egypt, Oman, Qatar, and  Morocco. If what has been announced is bad, undoubtedly what is  hidden is worse.    The Jordanian government has recently embarked on a major  normalization step through the U.S.-Jordanian-Israeli meeting.  By this step, the Jordanian government overlooked Madrid and  Arab coordination with the cordon states. It relinquished its  declared constants on the Palestine question, including the West  Bank and holy Jerusalem, considering its problem with the enemy  no more than the land the enemy occupied to the east of the  river, the water problem, and the refugee problem.    The statement also speaks about the Arab and international  developments, and the situation in Yemen. It says: "The Arab  masses and their pan-Arab and Islamic forces had been delighted  by the propensity of Yemen in the north and south toward unity,  shura, and democracy, and viewed this as a manifestation of the  Arab-Islamic future"    On the internal situation in Egypt, the statement says: "Our  two parties have more than once expressed their concern for the  violence that is going in beloved Egypt. Violence only begets  violence, and we emphasized our condemnation of all sorts of  violence regardless of the parties that are practicing it. We  are confident that the ideal solution for the cycle of violence  is through enhancing liberties, and entrenching shura and  democracy."    On the siege imposed on Iraq, the statement condemns the  continuation of the siege, and urged the Arab and Islamic forces  and parties to do all they can to end this unjust siege,  starting with the neighboring states.    It calls for more efforts to unify the position of the  pan-Arab and Islamic forces on a specific program for lifting  the siege and ending the harm to our people in Iraq and  unleashing their capabilities in the interest of our Arab nation  and the Islamic peoples.</p>

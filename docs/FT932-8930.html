			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: The great leap forward - Doing the splits / Split capital trusts are investment trusts with several different classes of share, designed to appeal to as many investors as possible. They can be highly tax-efficient, but they can also be risky and confusing. In a new series, Philip Coggan will examine the structure and records of some of the leading split trusts IN 1987, River &amp; Mercantile made a leap into the unknown. It was one of the first big trusts to create the modern fashion for a split capital structure. Its success has allowed its managers to offer a range of similar trusts and enabled the trust to expand via a rights issue in 1991. The trust was founded in 1881 as the River Plate Trust and Loan Agency Company to finance the development of the pastoral industry in Argentina. The name change to River &amp; Mercantile occurred in 1962 but the company did not formally become an investment trust until 1975. After more than a decade as a UK income trust, the change to split capital status was aimed at eliminating the discount to net assets, a problem that plagued all investment trusts in the 1980s. Since the package of shares currently stands at a premium to asset value six years later, the move must be counted a success. As with a conventional investment trust, the assets of a split capital trust are invested in shares and other securities. What makes a split different is that the rights over those assets are divided in unconventional ways. The earliest type of structure was to give all the revenue to one class of shareholder and all the capital growth to the rest. But there are infinite possibilities and investors need to be clear what they are buying. In the case of River &amp; Mercantile, there are four classes; preference, stepped preference, income and capital, plus warrants on the capital shares. There is a fairly small amount of preference shares in issue, which pay a fixed rate of 5 per cent. The other three classes of shares are really the key to the trust. The stepped preference shares have the right to receive a 5 per cent annual increase in dividend, plus a 5 per cent increase in asset backing. The repayment value of the shares, when the trust is wound up in 1999, is scheduled to be 188.6p. At the end of 1992, the net assets per stepped preference share were 134.01p. The initial price in 1987 was 100p. The dividend for 1992 was 5.36p and for the current year, it will be just under 5.63p. At a price of around 149p, the shares are on a yield of around 4.7 per cent. Someone who buys a stepped preference share is therefore buying a relatively safe security - one which will not make them rich but which will allow for steady dividend growth. The income shares have the right to the revenue of the trust after the preference and stepped preference shareholders have been paid. Dividends are paid quarterly and for 1992, the total dividend was 9.2p. Antony Foucar, the chairman, says the board intends to maintain that dividend this year. The shares were initially priced at 100p and have the right to be repaid at 100p on the wind-up date in 1999. However, the income shares will only be repaid after the preference and stepped preference shares have their entitlement. Any income-seeking investor needs to be aware that buying the shares at the current price (around 115p) involves locking in a capital loss. The flat yield looks attractive at 10 per cent, but if the dividend fails to grow between now and 1999, the gross redemption yield (which allows for both income and capital loss) falls to 9.7 per cent, according to analyst Lewis Aaron at SG Warburg. However, potential capital loss on those income shares is much smaller than on many other trusts in the sector. This safety element means the yield on these shares are lower than on many other income shares in the split sector, says Aaron. The capital shares receive no revenue but are entitled to all the assets of the trust after the preference, stepped preference and income shares have been repaid. The asset value on May 7, assuming the other classes of shares are repaid in full, was 59p, compared with a share price of 74p. On the current entitlements of the other shares, the net assets per capital share are 172p. This discrepancy is one of the problems for investors who want to buy capital shares. In the back pages of the Financial Times, capital shares appear to be at enormous discounts to asset values - over 50 per cent in the case of River &amp; Mercantile's capital shares. To the casual observer, they might seem as if they are fantastic bargains. But these discounts cannot be judged in the same way as those which apply to conventional investment trust shares. The steady increase in the claims of the other shares are like termites nibbling away at the foundations of the capital shares. The trust needs to grow merely for the asset value of the capital shares to stand still. In the case of the River &amp; Mercantile trust, the assets of the trust need to grow at around 0.5 per cent per annum to repay the current share price and at 3.3 per cent per annum for the investor to earn the stated net asset value of 172p per share. In short, the capital shares are a highly geared play on the success of the managers in growing the trust. A small difference in annual percentage performance can result in an enormous difference in the eventual return to the capital shareholders. If the assets of the trust grow at 2.5 per cent per annum, the capital shares will offer a 10.66 per cent annualised return, according to Warburg's Aaron. At 5 per cent asset growth, that return increases to 18.9 per cent. Iqbal Assan, split capital specialist at brokers Olliff &amp; Partners, sees R &amp; M's capital shares as among the most attractive in the sector. The warrants entitle the holder to buy one capital share at 249p. Obviously, with the capital share price at 75p, a lot of growth is needed for the warrants, currently at 11p, to be worth exercising. The structure of such a trust is obviously important, but in the end the success or failure of the trust must depend on the assets in which the manager invests. The portfolio yield is around 6 per cent to 6.3 per cent, says manager Piers Godfrey, the equivalent of around 150 per cent of the yield on the All-Share. Achieving that yield by buying ordinary shares would involve buying some high risk stocks, so Godfrey has around 20 per cent of the portfolio in fixed interest securities, mainly preference and convertible preference shares. The ordinary shares in the portfolio fall into three segments, according to Godfrey. The main element is a core of high yielding stocks, such as the utilities. Then Godfrey will buy recovery and cyclical stocks for the upturn  -but these are not shares which he would hold for long periods. Finally, he will buy a limited portion of growth stocks, where faster-than-average dividend increases are expected. The ten largest holdings in the portfolio are: BT, BAT, British Gas, National Westminster, Shell, Fisons, General Accident, Smith &amp; Nephew, BICC and P&amp;O. 'The share price has never really recovered from the rights issue two years ago but it has delivered the goods in terms of asset performance,' says Warburg's Aaron. With a high-yielding portfolio, River &amp; Mercantile has benefited from the post-devaluation recovery. But manager Piers Godfrey accepts that, because of the need for UK corporates to rebuild cover, there may be little scope for dividend growth on the income shares in the short term. Key facts. The trust has assets of Pounds 178m and a market capitalisation of Pounds 180m, so the overall package of shares stands on a slight premium. The quarterly fee paid to the managers is the higher of 1.25 per cent of the gross annual revenue plus 0.05 per cent of the value of the investments, or Pounds 117,500, together with one quarter of the dealing profits of R&amp;M Securities. Board. Antony Foucar, chairman, is the former chairman of insurance brokers John Plumer. Philip Macpherson is deputy chairman of Misys and an investment banking adviser to Baring Brothers. The other two directors are River &amp; Mercantile employees, Piers Godfrey and Vivien Gould. Savings scheme and Personal Equity Plan details. There is no savings scheme, except via the Pep. The River &amp; Mercantile group, which manages several investment trusts, offers a variety of Peps. The stepped preference and income shares of the main River &amp; Mercantile trust are available in an income Pep; the capital shares in a growth Pep. The initial charge on these plans is 4 per cent plus VAT and the annual charge is 1 per cent plus VAT. Minimum investment is Pounds 3,000 or Pounds 250 per month. R &amp; M also offers actively managed Peps which invest in all its trusts.</p>

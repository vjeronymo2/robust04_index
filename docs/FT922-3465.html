			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Bovespa rally after Telebras-led slump The Sao Paulo stock market, which broke a string of five straight losing days on Tuesday with a 2.45 per cent rise in the Bovespa index to 25,325, was unchanged by midday yesterday, writes Bill Hinchberger. Before Tuesday the index had registered a drop of 4.6 per cent for June. The real loss was greater given an inflation index of 9.75 per cent for the same period. That downturn has been primarily due to a fall in Telebras, the state-controlled telecommunications holding company. Telebras closed up 1.6 per cent on Tuesday, at Dollars 24.12, after a 6.4 per cent drop on Monday. It was 2.3 per cent lower by midday yesterday. Generally responsible for over one-half of trade, Telebras weighs heavily on the index. Some analysts attributed the Telebras downturn to domestic investors, primarily concerned with their positions in the local options market. Others believe that foreign investors are slowing their rate of investment in Telebras, and Brazil, after the government's decision last week to cancel the company's planned ADR placing in New York. The official explanation is that a large ADR issue might erode the Telebras share price, with a negative affect on privatisation plans. Some say that this step has created doubt in the minds of investors over the government's commitment to privatise the company. Mr Alvaro Augusto Vidigal Filho, Bovespa president, has called on officials to calm the market with a clear statement of its plans for Telebras.</p>

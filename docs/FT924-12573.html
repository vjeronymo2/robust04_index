			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Observer: Nun so lucky A nun, who has lived for 54 years under a vow of poverty, has proved that the meek do, just occasionally, inherit the earth. Sister Josephine Contris, 71, a member of the Sisters of St. Francis order in San Francisco, initially won a Dollars 40,000 prize in a local lottery. Given the choice of taking the money or participating in the state lottery's televised Big Spin game show, she consulted her fellow sisters. 'Go for it. Don't just take the Dollars 40,000,' was their advice. She did, and won Dollars 1m. Contris says she will give the money to her order with a request that it be used to support a retirement home in Santa Maria.</p>

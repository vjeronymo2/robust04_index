			<p>BFN     [Text] Doha, 12 May (INA)--Information Minister Hasan  al-Lawzi today said that the elements who ignited the military  situation in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] must leave the  country or stand trial.    In a statement over the telephone to the QATARI NEWS AGENCY,  al-Lawzi said that the opportunity is now open for the limited  number of elements who ignited the situation to leave the  country in order to spare the blood of the people and to stop  destroying the country's resources.    He added that there is a chance for these elements, who are  a  minority in the YSP, to leave the country so that they will not  cause any further losses in the southern governorates of Aden  and Lahij.    He continued by saying: If they stay, these elements who are  involved in the crime of engineering a secession and destroying  the country must be interrogated and punished for violating the  constitution and the law.    On Wednesday [11 May], President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  announced his willingness to give orders that would allow the  secessionists to leave Yemen.</p>

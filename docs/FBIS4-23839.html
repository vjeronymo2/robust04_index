			<p>BFN     [Text] Hundreds of refugees have flooded into Burundi's  capital, Bujumbura, following an Army crackdown on armed  civilians and reports of massacres near the border with Rwanda.  Reports said over a hundred people who fled into Burundi to  escape Rwanda's bloodbath had been killed at Bugabira in the  Kirundo Province. An aid worker said all the dead were Rwandan  refugees, and that at least another 20 people were also killed  in the weekend violence in the nearby town Kayanza, where  Burundi's Tutsi dominated Army has launched a counter operation  against Rwandans entering the country. Aid agencies said between  1,500 and 2,000 refugees had flocked into Bujumbura following  several days of fighting in the hills around the city. The  fighting began last weekend.</p>

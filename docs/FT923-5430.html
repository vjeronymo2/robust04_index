			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Economics Notebook: EC turmoil gives a tonic to Swiss franc A welcome whiff of the good old days has returned to Swiss financial circles in recent weeks, with the Swiss franc rising sharply in response - at least in part - to political turmoil abroad. Early last week, Germans had to pay DM1.13 to buy a Swiss franc compared with only DM1.07 at the beginning of May. And Swiss short-term interest rates were a full 2 per cent lower than German ones. Those of us who do not expect a German bank to block foreigners' accounts, or some other calamity to occur in Germany in the near future, may find these trends a bit mystifying. For many Swiss analysts, however, the explanation is simple. The European Community is in such a state of turmoil that Switzerland and the Swiss franc have recovered their safe-haven status. Perhaps the assaults on the Maastricht treaty and the European Monetary System look more spectacular when viewed from the calm banks of Lac Leman or the Zurich See than they do on the spot. The Swiss acknowledge that other factors are at work, such as the weakening of the dollar and the sheer scarcity of francs stemming from the Swiss National Bank's very tight monetary policy in recent months. The franc may also have benefitted from an improvement in the SNB's battered image. In the spring, the central bank toughed out an attack on the currency, letting short-term interest rates rise above 9 per cent. This was considered brave because it courted the risk that banks would raise their mortgage interest rates. But it was a pretty minor risk. The banks need all the public support they can muster to win a national referendum at the end of September on abolishing stamp duty on securities transactions. They would not have won many friends by raising mortgage rates. Political events may continue to have an impact on the franc for at least the next few weeks. The snag is that they could move the currency either way. A 'No' vote in the French referendum on Maastricht on September 20 could boost the haven quality of the currency. But a 'No' in the Swiss stamp duty referendum a week later - which is a strong possibility - would accelerate the outflow of financial activity. The result of another Swiss plebiscite on September 27, on a SFr15bn (Pounds 6bn) plan to drill two new rail tunnels through the Alps, could also hurt the franc. Switzerland's severe restrictions on alpine road traffic force more than 80 per cent of trans-Alpine freight tonnage, with its intolerable burden of noise and fumes, to move through Austrian and French passes. Austria and France insist that if the new tunnels are not built Swiss road restrictions must be eased. The stubborn burghers of canton Uri do not see things that way, and one can almost imagine them implementing their second world war contingency plan to blow up access to the Gotthard pass rather than tolerate more juggernauts. Whatever happens on the political front, few expect the franc's strength to last for long. The Swiss economy has been in recession since the fourth quarter of 1990 and most economists, in the wake of the July discount rate rise in Germany, have revised downwards their forecasts for real growth this year to nil or close to it. ***** This recession in Switzerland's has been accompanied by an extraordinary rise in unemployment. Since the fourth quarter of 1990, more than 90,000 jobs have been lost, and the number of unemployed is now the highest since the 1930s. One hesitates to mention the official rate - 2.9 per cent in July - because it is so derisory compared to that in other industrialised countries. However, it is not the real figure, merely a head count of people who have registered with cantonal employment agencies. The government believes that the real rate is about double the official one. The important point is the trend. From the early 1970s until late 1990, the number averaged around 20,000 with little fluctuation either way. Then suddenly it soared, with still no sign of any easing in the sharply upward slope. Apart from the cyclical downturn, one technical and two structural changes are taking place, and economists differ on how much importance should be attached to each. Mr Stefan Wolter of the Union Bank of Switzerland believes the main factor has been the improvement in unemployment benefits, which has led many more people to register at the cantonal employment agencies than used to be the case. Mr Christophe Koellreuter, head of the BAK economic forecasting institute in Basle, emphasises the change in behaviour of foreigners. Job losses in the mid-1970s were much higher than those in the current recession, reaching 300,000, but two thirds were gastarbeiters who went home and most of the rest were women who also went home. Today, Mr Koellreuter says, 'foreign labourers are more integrated in the workforce'. In other words, they are not the first to be sacked when times are tough. The other structural change is more surprising. It looks as if the Swiss, who we all thought were so efficient, have long had a variant of the old British disease. It occurs mainly in services, especially banking, and is the result of a Japanese style paternalism. In today's cold, competitive world, paternalism is out. Even the big banks and sacred national institutions like Swissair are turning people out in their hundreds. 'There is no stigma to laying people off any more. It has even become a sign of progressive management,' a Zurich banker said last week.</p>

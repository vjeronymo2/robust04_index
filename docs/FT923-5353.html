			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / International Company News: Conduit named as president of Boeing BOEING, the Seattle-based aerospace manufacturer, yesterday named Mr Philip Conduit, the well-respected executive vice-president of its commercial airline operations, to be president of the company and a member of its board of directors. The move is seen as possibly positioning Mr Conduit, aged 51, to take over the Boeing chairmanship in four years' time, when the current chairman, Mr Frank Shrontz, is due to retire. The post of president has been vacant at Boeing since 1988, when Mr Shrontz moved up to become chairman. Boeing also said that Mr Alan Mulally, 47, will succeed Mr Conduit as vice-president and general manager of the 777 division. Mr Conduit had previously overseen development of the Boeing 777, the company's new wide-bodied twin jetliner. Mr Conduit will have three product divisions reporting to him - the commercial airline group, the defence and space group, and computer services.</p>

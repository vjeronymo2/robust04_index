At his  party's traditional Ash Wednesday meeting in Bayerbach, Lower  Bavaria, Kinkel called for a "radical change of thinking" in  labor market policy. Strikes and lock-outs are "a fist in the  eye of the economic development"; in view of the high number of  unemployed, all politicians must work to ensure the recovery of  the economy.    FRG Foreign Minister Kinkel called for a zero round in the  public sector and a stop to the "galloping state debts," and he  rejected tax increases for higher earners. The FDP politician  said that "the old-style social state" is "unsocial, cannot be  financed, and is counterproductive." It must be placed on a  narrower but solid basis. The social state must not become a  "milking cow," Kinkel stressed.</p>

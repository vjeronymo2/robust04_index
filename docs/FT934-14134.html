			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / World Trade News: EC doubts on two-tier services proposal EUROPEAN Community trade negotiators yesterday expressed concern over a controversial US Uruguay Round proposal to deny Japan and developing countries the benefits of liberalisation of the US banking and insurance sector. They have warned the proposal could unravel other countries' commitments to open up their service sectors to international competition, and jeopardise completion of the round by the deadline of December 15. The proposal, discussed in Brussels yesterday by Mr Lawrence Summers, US Treasury undersecretary, during an early morning meeting with Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, would involve giving all countries open access to the US financial services sector as it now stands, but reserving to industrial countries - minus Japan - the benefits that would come from further liberalisation of the US financial services market. Most significantly, this would exclude Japan and other developing countries from setting up universal banking operations in the US if and when the Glass Steagal Act, limiting banking licences to a single state, is reformed. The US is considering this two-tier approach to trading partners out of frustration at the reluctance of Japan, South Korea and the Asean nations of Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia to open their banking, insurance and stock market sectors to international competition. Gatt estimates that commercial services affected by financial services liberalisation amounts to Dollars 12,000bn (Pounds 7,947bn). The US proposal is seen by trading partners as contentious in particular because it apparently shows the US is unwilling to abandon bilateral leverage against trading partners when Uruguay Round negotiations aim to win wider support for multilateral settlement of trade disputes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Aerospatiale-BAe-DASA Agreement on </F> Supersonic Research"]    [Text] Paris -- On 7 April, Aerospatiale announced that  aircraft manufacturers Aerospatiale (France), British Aerospace  (BAe) and Deutsche Aerospace have signed an agreement protocol  for a joint supersonic research program.    The purpose of the European Supersonic Research Program  (ESRP), which will be financed equally by the three parties, is  to define the basic design for a future supersonic aircraft that  might succeed the Concorde.    For the time being there are no plans to develop an actual  supersonic aircraft. The project aims simply to choose the  minimum specifications which will then enable significant  research to be done.    The main specifications are a range of 10,000 km, a capacity  of 250 passengers and a top speed of Mach 2 (2,250 km per hour).    With this initiative, the three manufacturers hope to create  a center of European research that can compete with the work  being done in the United States and Japan, and in a few years  bring European research to almost the same level as in these two  countries.    Last year, just $15 million was spent on supersonic research  in Europe, as opposed to $60 million in Japan, and $108 million  in the United States.    With their joint effort, Aerospatiale, BAe, and DASA also  place themselves in a better position to negotiate their future  participation in the development of a second generation  supersonic aircraft that will probably mobilize manufacturers on  all three continents. The development of such an aircraft is  estimated to be worth around $12-15 billion (with a potential  market of around 500 to 1,000 aircraft). According to the three  groups: "Just one type of supersonic aircraft will be  developed," for reasons of commercial viability.</p>

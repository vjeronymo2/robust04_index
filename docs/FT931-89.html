			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Non-banking income gives boost to Bank Hapoalim BANK Hapoalim, Israel's largest bank, yesterday reported a 66 per cent increase in net earnings to Shk247m (Dollars 88m) for 1992 from Shk148m. This rise was due to a sharp increase in income from non-banking activities, such as brokerage, underwriting, foreign trade and foreign currency operations. Hapoalim was the leading underwriter on the Tel Aviv stock exchange last year, with 21 new issues amounting to over Dollars 400m. Like other Israeli banks, Hapoalim was forced to narrow its financial margins in 1992 in response to central bank pressure to lower interest rates on loans to the public. Another factor behind the advance was a decrease in bad debt provisions. Previously one of the largest lenders to the country's troubled collective and semi-collective farms, Hapoalim had been forced to make massive write-offs on their account in recent years. Consolidated assets totalled Shk94.14bn at the end of 1992, a rise of 1.6 per cent over the previous year's Shk92.65bn. Loans to the public were Shk46.26bn, compared with Shk43.5bn, while deposits from the public were Shk54.75bn, against Shk54.15bn. Shareholders' equity rose 7.4 per cent to Shk3.81bn from Shk3.55bn; net return on equity was 7 per cent, against 4.4 per cent last time.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Constitution is being contravened in  Mordovia. That is the finding of a special commission formed by  the Russian president, which investigated whether laws and legal  enactments adopted in the republic conform to the Constitution.  According to our Saransk correspondent, Nikolay Vechkayev, the  commission found among other things that the Mordovian  parliament's decision to abolish the republican constitutional  court was a breach of the constitution. It also ruled that the  Mordovian Government had no right to carry out the [Mordovian]  Supreme Soviet's decision to provide the heads of urban and  district administrations with powers to call local elections on  their own initiative. This is the responsibility of the  republic's supreme body of power.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 17 (A.A.) -- Prime Minister Tansu Ciller  on Tuesday [17 May] said that the force of the terrorist PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization is dwindling from day  to day.    `As long as terrorism is the biggest problem of the country,  the fight against terrorism will rank at the top of the agenda,'  Ciller said.    Addressing the True Path Party (DYP) parliamentary group  meeting, she said that the PKK wants to spread new scenarios to  the world public opinion, and for this reason defenseless people  in the southeastern Anatolian region such as women, children and  senior citizens were forced to migrate to northern Iraq forcibly  by armed groups.    `These people had wanted to move to other regions under the  security of the state,' she said. `All the world knows the pkk  is a group of terrorists burning and destroying all the means  provided by the state to develop that region.'    Ciller said she is once again calling on young people and  their families not to fall into the trap of the terrorists,  adding the state will continue to fight against the PKK until  the terror ends.    She said the government is also closely following the  developments in the region.    Concerning the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline, she said that  Turkey is willing to solve the problem with a decision by the  United Nations.    On the Turkish military units to be sent to Bosnia she said  preparations are in the last stage.</p>

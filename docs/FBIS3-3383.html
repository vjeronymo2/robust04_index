			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016), and Peng Shujie </F> (1756 2885 2638)]    [Text] Beijing, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- The CPC Central  Committee United Front Department and the Nationalities  Committees of the National People's Congress [NPC] and the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]  National Committee gave a tea party at the Great Hall of the  People this evening in honor of minority deputies and members  attending the Second Sessions of the Eighth NPC and the Eighth  CPPCC National Committee.    Qiao Shi, NPC Standing Committee chairman; Li Ruihuan,  chairman of the CPPCC National Committee; and Comrades Tian  Jiyun, Wang Hanbin, Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Cheng Siyuan, Tomur  Dawamat, Ismail Amat, Yang Rudai, Qian Zhengying, and Liao  Hansheng attended the party and joined the minority deputies and  members coming from all parts of the country to mark the  victorious convocations of the two meetings.    Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,  chaired the tea party. Addressing the party, NPC Standing  Committee Vice Chairman Buhe said: Directed by the guidelines  laid down by the 14th national party congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and  proceeding along the path of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, our great motherland attracted worldwide  attention with our high economic growth, political stability,  national solidarity, and social progress last year. This year  is crucial for restructuring the economic system, and the  success of the second sessions of the Eighth NPC and Eighth  CPPCC National Committee will be significant for properly  handling the relations between reform, development, and  stability and expediting all national projects in all fields  through accomplishing the task of overall importance -- "seizing  the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider to the  outside world, expediting development, and maintaining  stability."    Buhe said: The current situation is very favorable for  China's reform, opening up, and modernization; and the situation  also provides minority regions with a good opportunity for  promoting economic and cultural development. Just as Premier Li  Peng stated in his government work report: "Through reforms and  opening up to the outside world, minority regions, with state  support and economically developed areas' assistance, certainly  will demonstrate their own strengths, have stronger vitality for  economic development, gradually reduce the gap with economically  developed areas, and achieve prosperity with them together."  While this reflects the consistent policy of our party and  government, it is also the experience acquired from years' of  actual work. As long as we are united as one and work hard  earnestly, minority areas certainly will achieve new and greater  victories in their economic and cultural development.    He said: Deepening reform, opening wider to the outside  world, maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy national  economic development, and ensuring the successful implementation  of all reform measures are major issues we must make special  efforts to deal with today. Only when we work together to  safeguard and develop political stability and unity and  consolidate and develop our socialist national relations marked  by equality, solidarity, and mutual assistance can we build our  great motherland into a happy and harmonious home of people of  all nationalities.    Artists of the central national song and dance ensemble and  the Central National University Department of Choreography  staged an art show at the reception.</p>

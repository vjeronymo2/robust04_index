			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 28 (TANJUG) -- Italian Foreign  Minister Antonio Martino said on Tuesday that the new Italian  Government had assumed a more decisive role in the quest of a  solution to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, for which he  said it had quite a few reasons.    Martino, who is on a brief working visit to Yugoslavia, told  a news conference at the Italian Embassy in Belgrade that an  extra reason for Italy's more active role was the summit of the  world's leading seven industrial countries, which opens in  Naples on July 8.    Martino, who visited Sarajevo and the Croatian capital of  Zagreb on Monday, said it was necessary to hear all sides  involved in the conflict.    The Italian foreign minister said all officials with whom he  had conferred during his current Balkan tour had expressed  pleasure at Italy's more active role. 'We are a neighbouring  country and we are very much interested in the resolution of the  problem in the region. and, I, myself, despite all the caution,  believe that we can find a solution,' Martino told the news  conference.    Martino said that, after the talks held with the Serb, Croat  and Muslim sides, he had the impression that all sides had  confidence in the international community.    Asked about the peace plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina prepared  by  the international 'contact group', the Italian foreign minister  said he had not seen the plan yet but expected that it would be  acceptable to all warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Asked about the Osimo accords signed between the former  Yugoslav Federation and Italy, Martino said it was the Italian  Government's stand that the accords should be respected. All  territorial issues between Italy and the former Yugoslav  Federation, i.e. its western republics of Croatia and Slovenia,  were resolved under the Osimo accords.    Slovenia and Croatia, which forcibly seceded in 1991, reject  everything that has any connection with the former Yugoslavia,  but, nevertheless, feel that the Osimo accords are valid and not  subject to revision.</p>

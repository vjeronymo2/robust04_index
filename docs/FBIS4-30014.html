			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Hiroji Akita] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 17 Jun -- Japan will export the latest  communications system, the SDH [expansion unknown], to China. In  the past, Japan's export of the SDH to China was banned by the  export controls of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral  Export Controls (Cocom). Japan will export the SDH to China in  response to Cocom's decision to lift export controls on the SDH.  The NEC Corporation has won a contract from the Chinese Ministry  of Railways to supply an SDH optical communications system to be  installed for a 430-km stretch of railroad between Hengsui city,  Hebei Province, and Shangqiu city, Henan Province, which is part  of a 2,500-km railroad between Beijing and Kowloon (in Hong  Kong), the construction of which is scheduled for completion in  1997. NEC has contracted to supply the system by September  1995. The Chinese Government, which places importance on  upgrading its existing communications network, is eager to  introduce the SDH. The NEC Corporation's export of the SDH to  China will spur other Japanese communications companies to look  for business opportunities in China.    The NEC Corporation is the first Japanese communications  company to supply the communications system for a long-distance  railroad in China. NEC anticipates that China's adoption of its  communications system for the railroad will give it an upper  hand in vying with other competitors in the future bidding to  supply another communications system to be installed for the  remaining 2,000 km of the railroad between Beijing and Kowloon.    The SDH is state-of-the-art technology. The SDH can more  speedily handle information than can conventional communications  systems, and it can store four times as much information as do  conventional communications systems. In China, the volume of  ground transportation has sharply increased as the economy has  grown. In China, the supply of ground transportation has failed  to catch up with the demand. The Ministry of Railways plans to  use the SDH optical communications system to build a modern  railroad control system in China.    With the end of the Cold War, Cocom was disbanded in March.  It has been decided that a new international organization will  be created instead with the mandate to curb international  terrorist activities. Former members of Cocom are still obliged  to continue to control their exports on their own until the new  international organization is created.    The export of the SDH was banned under the export controls  of  Cocom. In April, AT&amp;T, a U.S. communications company, decided  to supply an SDH optical communications system to China, and  moves are afoot among industrialized nations to lift the ban on  exports to it.</p>

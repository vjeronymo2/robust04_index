			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: RWE shakes off losses at waste unit Profits and turnover for RWE, Germany's largest utility group which is diversifying into telecommunications, increased last year. This was in spite of losses in its waste management division and a lengthy strike at its mining subsidiary in the US, Mr Friedhelm Gieske, board chairman said yesterday. However, improvements in the chemical, energy and petroleum sectors helped offset these losses and would allow RWE to increase the annual dividend of DM12 to DM13, plus a bonus of DM1. The group's net profit rose DM41m to DM922m (Dollars 594.8m) while external net sales, which excludes internal sales, increased 5 per cent, or DM2.7bn, to DM55.8bn. Exports, which account for 18.5 per cent of last year's turnover, rose 0.7 per cent, from DM9.4bn to DM10.3bn. The main growth sectors include the mining and raw materials division, which grew 3.3 per cent to DM2.4bn, the chemicals and petrochemicals division, where sales increased 8.9 per cent to DM22.8bn, and the mechanical and plant engineering divisions, which rose 10.6 per cent to DM6.2bn. In spite of persistent problems in the waste management division, partly caused by losses incurred at NuKEM, RWE's US subsidiary, Mr Gieske said he expected this sector to 'come out of the red from 1995-96 onwards'. He said the ending of a seven-month coal strike at the US-based Consul Energy Inc, in which RWE holds a 50 per cent stake, and which cut sales by Dollars 21m, was expected to lift coal output for this year. It is in the energy, telecommunications and construction sectors that RWE will target much of its DM32bn investment over the next five years. RWE has stakes in Laubag, east Germany's largest lignite, or brown coal, fields, and Veag, the region's main utility and electricity grid. Mr Gieske said RWE would supply energy to the eastern states that roughly corresponded to its 40 per cent market share in west Germany.</p>

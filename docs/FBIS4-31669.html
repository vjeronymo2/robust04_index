			<p>BFN     [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Croatian deputies to the assembly  of the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and a delegation of the  Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna visited Zagreb over the past  weekend and had talks with Croatian President Dr. Franjo  Tudjman. The topic of their talks was the establishment of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. What are their impressions upon  return to Mostar? Zdenko Vranjes has a report:    [Vranjes] The Croat-Bosniak federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina  is to get its government at a session of the constitutive  assembly on 22 June in Sarajevo. The constitution is to be  changed at that session in order to regulate the constitutional  status of mixed cantons in the Neretva river valley and central  Bosnia which have been agreed upon in Vienna. These are just  some of the next steps to be taken in the pursuance of  establishing the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. In order to  provide complete protection of the Croat interests in all this,  there should be maximum unity of the Croat deputies ought to  exist. It is precisely for this unity that the Herceg-Bosna  government assessed their talks with President Tudjman as  exceptionally important. What did the Zagreb talks focus on and  what are the results of the talks? This is what Ivan Bender,  the president of the Chamber of Deputies of the Croat Republic  of Herceg-Bosna, is going to tell us:    [Begin Bender recording] In the beginning it ought to be  stressed that this meeting was organized while the delegation of  the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna was paying a visit to Zagreb  on the occasion of Croatia's Statehood Day. Mr. Jadranko Prlic  and Pero Markovic, chairman of the executive committee of the  Croatian Democratic Union, led the delegation.    A meeting like this one was necessary at this time as it had  been felt that there were forces trying to disunite the Croatian  deputies in the constitutive assembly in order to achieve their  goals -- to wreck the continuity of the Croatian policy on the  territory of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    It is interesting to stress that a majority of deputies were  in attendance as we had taken all the necessary measures, and  within the framework of all this we agreed what has to be done  in the forthcoming period: First, we should stress again that  the federation and its organization is closely connected with  the establishment of the confederation with Croatia. This is a  package. Because without the establishment of the confederation  there can be no federation. This should be clear to all of us  and it should be repeated that this is a package, that is, in  practice, a kind of unity about which there should be no  discussion on this occasion.    Further, we should stress again, and we will do so in the  capacity of deputies at a session of the constituent assembly of  the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, that the bodies of the  Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and Bosnia-Herzegovina itself are  going to exist until the package which I have mentioned has been  established. There can be no talk about the suspension of the  government of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, on the  contrary it should further be strengthened until the federation  and the confederation have been established, i.e. until some  other bodies take over responsibilities currently discharged by  the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna.    As for the next session of the constituent assembly which is  to be held on 22 June, we have reached an agreement that we,  within the Croatian Democratic Union, should carry out all the  necessary preparations for the election of the government of the  federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have agreed, as regards  the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, actually the Croat republic  of Herceg-Bosna, that the executive committee of the Croatian  Democratic Union should prepare concrete solutions as regards  the posts of ministers and deputy ministers.

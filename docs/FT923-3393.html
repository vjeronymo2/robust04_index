			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Sterling and lira kept under pressure BOTH THE Italian lira and sterling remained under intense pressure in the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday despite a strong rally by the dollar against the D-Mark. The dollar rose by more than 4 pfennigs against the German currency, touching DM1.4535 in US trading and closing at DM1.4500 in London - its highest close in three weeks. Previously a rise in the dollar was accompanied by renewed investment in the lira and sterling, as dealers trim their holdings of D-Marks. However, the Italian lira was still weak yesterday, closing at L765.2 against the D-Mark in London, in spite of intervention on its behalf from the Bank of Italy and the Bundesbank. The lira's ERM floor against the D-Mark is L765.4. Sterling again hovered near its ERM floor of DM2.7780, but closed at DM2.7900. In New York it closed at DM2.7864 against the German currency. Neither the German nor Italian central banks were prepared to reveal the scale of their intervention to support the lira yesterday, but some dealers suggested that it was very high and had cost several billion D-Marks. This support operation was on a similar scale to one that was mounted last Friday when the Bank of Italy also raised the discount rate by 1.75 points to 15 per cent. The dollar's rally was not due to any concrete developments, but some dealers suggested that there were signs of a slowdown in the German economy and that the Bundesbank might be forced to cut interest rates this year. The large differential between US and German short-term rates has been the principal factor driving the dollar down since the spring. Wild days here again, Page 6 Currencies, Page 11</p>

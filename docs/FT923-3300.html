			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Is sunset still a golden sea, and is there honey still for tea?: Teresa McLean spent a summer day watching cricket in Madingley. The scene looks as it did when Rupert Brooke wrote of the village in his poem The Old Vicarage, Grantchester. But the sport has changed subtly PHILISTINES commenting on cricket reduce its subtleties to complexity. People commenting on village cricket, however much they like it, can see its existence from only one of two viewpoints. Either village cricket today is just a romantic hangover from a golden age which will never return, or it is still going strong, as it always has done, on the village green, complete with dilapidated pavilion and bespectacled vicar. The facts of village cricket life do the sport proud by being both subtle and simple. On the whole, village cricket is flourishing; but, strictly speaking, it is also fading. I went to Madingley, a village near Cambridge, to learn about its cricket at first hand and was richly rewarded. The match was between Madingley and a pair of villages called Swaffham Prior and Swaffham Bulbeck which joined their two teams into one, Swaffham, about 10 years ago. 'We'd have gone out of existence otherwise,' their captain told me cheerfully. He and a couple more Swaffham stalwarts declared themselves to be 'all going over the hill together.' They are in their early 40s, generous and liquid-loving in appearance. Hardly any of the team live in the village but pretty well all of them originally came from it. The captain, like most of his troops, keeps cricket as his chief connection with the village and regards himself as a Swaffham man. Many modern village teams are local rather than village sides, with players from nearby estates, industrial and factory settlements and from neighbouring villages unable to support an XI. Amalgamation is common, especially where villages have shrunk to shells of their former selves. Where they have become weekend homes for people working in towns, they use their weekend villages for weekend cricket. This means the romantic tradition of the blacksmith bowling hell for leather, the vicar leaving in mid-spin for vespers and the lord of the manor turning up when least wanted is becoming a more pragmatic tradition, bent on survival. Madingley's scorer, Dennis Teversham, a man of few words but great thoughts, is a fund of detailed information on the club's history. For him, changing cricket populations are nothing new. He sat on the pavilion balcony with an extinct pipe and a panting dog, releasing little flurries of facts during quiet patches of play. After 30 overs, with Swaffham 150 for two, I had learnt a bit. Two overs later, with Swaffham 168 for six, Madingley's morale had risen and scoring was busy. I had time to reflect on what I had been told. Madingley cricket club was founded in 1913, died in the Great War, was re-founded in 1933, died in the second world war, was re-founded in conjunction with nearby Dry Drayton village, then refounded yet again, on its own, in 1958. Swaffham's green-capped top scorer was caught by Teversham's son for 103 and Teversham Snr neared a smile. Forty years of playing and 20 years of scoring have taught him that it is better to be philosophical than to be pleased. The game bore him out. The Madingley ground is gorgeous, snuggled in hills, surrounded by meadows, trees and undergrowth. It is overlooked by farms, the village church and the village pub. It boasts a surface which is a force of nature in favour of bowlers and - presumably - of those most familiar with its dangers. It is a steeply tilted set of medieval ridges and furrows, the only consolation for batsmen being that these are parallel to the wicket, not across it to detonate bouncers. A constable bowler made his way slowly up the hill and reached the crease just about fit enough to deliver the ball, mildly. A thin young bowler tore down the hill and bowled furiously, then followed through with unstoppable momentum, almost as fast as the ball. He was one of three generations of Tevershams involved in the match. In Madingley at least, village cricket's time-honoured feature of family dynasties is in good form. The youngest, fastest, 14-year-old Teversham was playing alongside his brother and his father, the captain, while his grandfather (71) scored and his mother and grandmother did the teas. The teens are a surprisingly fertile age for village cricketers, thanks to determined programmes of encouragement from organisations such as the NCA (National Cricket Association) and the Lord's Taverners. Parents from 40 upwards rejoice in their role as the bastions of experience. Often it is 20 and 30-year-olds who are the scarcest, with a sense of village cricket only as a rare and distant entertainment. One of the nicest things about village cricket is that it is still an entertainment. Its gloriously informal atmosphere does not seem to have been stiffened by the advent of the regional leagues. These organise almost all village cricket now, making for more regular and more evenly-matched fixtures. Madingley had lost their last game by one run to Fulbourn village. But they made a more substantial job of their defeat in the game we saw: Swaffham 191; Madingley 112. 'We was walloped,' said Teversham, but he regards the North Cambridgeshire League, in which Madingley play, as neither here nor there. For local women, village cricket is, as it always has been, regular, entertaining and, almost always, non-playing. The glories of the pavilion range from trimmed sandwiches and cups of tea, with paper napkins alongside, to the more unpredictable sort. The huge six that redistributed the kitchen window into the food recently was not unusual. The cows that wandered into the pavilion the evening before the game two weeks ago were more of a challenge. The lady with 20 years' Madingley tea service to her credit smiled grimly. 'You never seen such a mess in your life.' There is no trace of it now. She shook her head in tandem with her mother-in -law, a veteran of 30 years' tea service. Their efforts were worth it. Every tea needs its pavilion and Madingley's is a paragon of cricketing initiative. It used to belong to Queen's College, but when Queen's built a new one in the early 1960s, Madingley Cricket Club's secretary, Ron Martin, zoomed in as from the covers and bought it for a snip. He organised his team into a convoy of tractors and a trailer to move the dismantled bits and pieces to the Madingley ground. Every piece was numbered and on arrival they were fitted together like a jigsaw. Madingley are a friendly lot and drink with anyone who wants to join them in the pub after the match. When I asked Dennis Teversham what was his golden age with his village cricket, he didn't escape into the past. 'Well, it's got to be now . . . I'm retired . . . here I am in the sun, watching cricket with friends from my village and from the other villages. What better?'</p>

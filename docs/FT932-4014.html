			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Truck sales up 18% last month SALES of new trucks jumped by 18.2 per cent last month, indicating that at least one sector of the commercial vehicle market is well on the road to recovery. However, sales of all other categories of commercial vehicles remained below the severely depressed levels of a year ago. Hopes that the important market for panel vans, typified by the Ford Transit, might also be coming out of recession were dashed by statistics published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. In April panel van sales had risen by 1.7 per cent year-on-year and the completion of the management buy-out of Leyland Daf Vans had also been expected to give last month's van market a boost. Instead May's total panel van sales showed a 9.76 per cent sales drop compared with the same month last year. There was some consolation for Leyland Daf Vans. Its share of the panel van market jumped to 13.67 per cent in May, as new orders flowed in the wake of the buy-out's completion. Its share had fallen to a low of 6.5 per cent in March during the van operation's two-month spell in receivership. The May figure was close to the 14 per cent market share achieved by the company for all of 1992. Panel van market leader Ford had been the principal beneficiary of Leyland Daf Vans' problems, its market share reaching 52.2 per cent in March. Last month, however,it dropped back to 46.5 per cent. At 15,311, total sales of commercial vehicles last month were down 4.45 per cent on the 16,024 achieved in May last year. Sales for this year's first five months, at 82,482, were 4.46 per cent down on the same period last year. A continuing surge in the volume of light vans imported from Portugal by Vauxhall, General Motors' UK subsidiary, helped to boost the import share of commercial vehicle sales from 32.06 per cent to 38.2 per cent. For the year to date, the importers' share is running at 39.9 per cent, up from 35 per cent. Sales of light vans, mainly those derived from cars, fell 4.88 per cent in May to 4,761 (5,005); panel van sales fell by 9.76 per cent to 6,923 (7,674); utility four-wheel-drive sales fell 6.12 per cent to 897 (956) and those of buses and coaches by 25.35 per cent to 162 (217).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-MAY 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Volume    Volume      Share (%)    Share (%)                             (Units)  Change (%)  Jan-May 93   Jan-May 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*               82,482     -4.5        100.0        100.0 Imports                     32,914     +8.9         39.9         35.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total                       26,669     -1.8        100.0        100.0 Imports                      9,222    +75.4         34.6         19.3 Ford                        12,608    +12.8         47.3         41.2 Vauxhall (General Motors)    8,552     -6.7         32.1         33.8 Peugeot incl.

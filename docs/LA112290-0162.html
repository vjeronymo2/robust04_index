			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> THE MILKEN SENTENCING;  </P> <P> EASY CREDIT, EMPTY DEALS FROM A MISBEGOTTEN DECADE  </P> <P> Michael Milken's 10-year prison sentence reflects, among other things, public  anger at the deal makers of the 1980s who enriched themselves and left others,  including the taxpayers, holding the bag.  </P> <P> But anger without understanding avails us nothing. The question we should ask  is: What have we learned from Milken?  </P> <P> We have learned again that financial genius is before the fall. The Milken  sentenced Wednesday is the same man who was hailed as the new J. P. Morgan,  come to remake American business. Like scores of speculative geniuses before  him, Milken turned out to be a false prophet. Maybe the next time, the public  will be more skeptical and regulators will act more quickly to protect the  financial system.  </P> <P> But maybe not. Another lesson we have learned is that credit expansions take on  a momentum that is hard to stop, simply because so many people benefit from  easy credit. Milken was not the only juggler in the circus of the '80s. In some  ways, Pogo's famous line applies: "We have met the enemy and he is us."  </P> <P> We have learned that using borrowed money to build a factory is very different  from using it for a leveraged buyout. Japan borrowed for factories, the United  States for deal making -- which is why Japanese firms today are buying U.S.  companies rather than the other way around.  </P> <P> Finally, we have learned that brains and ability without integrity can damage  our institutions. America is financially weaker today because of the  distortions of the '80s. And Milken has a lot to answer for, not only for  illegal acts but for maneuvers that were legal but antisocial.  </P> <P> "It was a misbegotten period," says James Grant, editor of Interest Rate  Observer, a newsletter that spoke out early on the follies of the debt craze.  "It was a cosmic lapse in the art of lending, going far beyond a single class  of loans such as junk bonds."  </P> <P> Milken's influence stemmed from the market he built for high-interest, or junk,  bonds. Still, the junk bond market at its peak totaled $200 billion, a drop in  the bucket compared to the $10-trillion total debt in the U.S. economy -- from  consumer credit to government bonds and all other borrowing. That total debt  roughly doubled in the 1980s.  </P> <P> And Milken's influence was magnified by financial go-betweens, called  investment bankers, because he made millions for them. In one of the first big  takeovers, Milken's firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert, financed T. Boone Pickens  Jr.'s raid on Gulf Oil. When Gulf was eventually bought by Chevron, Merrill  Lynch, Salomon Bros. and Morgan Stanley shared almost $70 million in fees.  </P> <P> Later the business got even better. In the RJR Nabisco deal of 1988, fees paid  to lawyers, commercial bankers, investment bankers and others may have totaled  as much as $1 billion.  </P> <P> "My surprise," says Martin Mayer, author of books on financial markets, "was  that leading lawyers, investment bankers and accounting firms didn't speak up  about these risky deals out of responsibility to their profession and to the  country." They didn't speak up because they were making too much money.  </P> <P> But they spoke up when Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve, tried  to stop the money. Seeing growing takeovers as "speculative froth," Volcker  proposed limiting credit by raising margin requirements on stock purchases in  the fall of 1985. He was shouted down by Wall Street firms, protesting to the  Reagan Administration. The Fed withdrew its proposed margin increase, and the  dance went on until the Crash of 1987.  </P> <P> Milken still claims, and others proclaim for him, that he helped revitalize  U.S. business competitiveness. But that's not true. If American business became  more competitive in the 1980s, it did so under pressure of global competition,  not junk financing.  </P> <P> What Milken and the decade specialized in was persuading the public that two  plus two equaled not four but five or even six. Takeover artists could say a  company was worth more than the market price, and that management should boost  the stock or a takeover would. Then, using Milken's junk bond financing, they  would bid up the stock price -- rewarding market speculators -- and buy the  company, paying off present shareholders.  </P> <P> After that the pattern of normal corporate finance, in which investments are  made in plants and machines to produce a stream of income from which to pay  wages and dividends for years into the future, would be abandoned.  </P> <P> Instead, future cash flow would be brought forward to the present, by forgoing  new investments and harvesting depreciation on the old. A junk-financed Pacific  Lumber hurrying the harvest of old-growth redwoods to maximize cash flow is an  example of the practice. That speeded-up cash flow would then be paid in  interest to bondholders.  </P> <P> It was a system that rewarded the present but aborted the future. And yet that  is how a large stretch of America behaved in the 1980s, when U.S. business  converted $500 billion of equity into debt and legions of experts prattled  about "maximizing shareholder value."  </P> <P> Japan, too, had a riot of borrowing and speculation in the '80s. Yet somehow  its corporations used enough of the money for plant and equipment that now they  outdistance U.S. business in capital investment and research spending every  year.  </P> <P> Milken understood this. An intense, highly intelligent man, Milken understood  the competitive decline of the United States. He would reflect in private  moments that his sons went to a Japanese youngster's house to play Nintendo  because Japanese Nintendo was more difficult than the version marketed to  Americans.  </P> <P> Dumbed-down Nintendo spoke to Milken of a society in decline. Yet he used his  undoubted brilliance not to make a positive difference for America, but to pile  up billions of dollars in secret partnerships and deals, over and above his  well-publicized compensation from Drexel.  </P> <P> Milken's offense is not that he got rich but that, like so much of Wall Street  in the 1980s, he enriched himself at the expense of the society that allowed  him the very freedom to do so.  </P> <P> In a letter to Judge Kimba M. Wood a week ago, Milken said he was "truly sorry"  and asked to be allowed to make recompense through community service. He'll get  his wish. To her harsh 10-year sentence -- which seems designed to force  Milken's cooperation with further government investigations -- Wood added three  years' of probation during which Milken must do community service. He should.  He owes America a lot -- but then so do we all.  </P></p>

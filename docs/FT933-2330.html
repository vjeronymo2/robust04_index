			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Rivals put Pounds 115m into bids to host Olympics CONTENDERS to stage the 2000 Olympic Games have poured well over Pounds 115m into an unprecedented global lobbying battle which reaches a climax this week in Monaco. The campaign has broken all records for the intensity and emotion, the resources and ingenuity invested in winning the votes of the 91 International Olympic Committee delegates. The figure excludes the large amounts spent by China, which has not provided expenditure figures. The five rivals - favourites Sydney and Beijing, along with Manchester, Berlin and Istanbul - present their final arguments to the IOC on Thursday. They have already gone to great lengths to impress one of the world's most courted electorates, spending more than Pounds 1m per delegate on promotion. China has lent a priceless 2,200-year-old life-size terracotta warrior to the new Olympic museum in Lausanne - a project dear to the heart of Mr Juan Antonio Samaranch, the International Olympic Committee's president. Daimler-Benz, the German motor group and a leading sponsor of the Berlin bid, will make its presence felt on Thursday by providing 40 limousines and 12 buses for the meeting. Delegates have been flown around the world to assess the sites and have stayed at first-class hotels. Seventy-nine of the IOC's 91 members have visited Manchester, while 66 have visited Sydney. A group of five-star Australian hoteliers provided ADollars 1m of accommodation. Behind the scenes, big business is thought to have played influential roles in the campaigns. Large sponsors such as Coca-Cola, Kodak and IBM are thought to be unanimous in wanting Beijing. An IOC official said: 'It will give them astonishing presence and contacts in the only world market experiencing double-digit growth.' Governments are also pegging their reputations to the bids. Mr John Major, Mr Paul Keating and Mrs Tansu Ciller, the British, Australian and Turkish prime ministers, are expected to take part in the Monaco presentations. Giant banners extolling their cities' virtues hang from the side of the Manchester headquarters of Granada TV, and flutter from the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Istanbul's slogan - 'Let's Meet Where the Continents Meet' is plastered all over the Turkish city. An IOC evaluation report this summer placed Sydney first and Manchester second in terms of the technical merits of their facilities. But the prize for the most thorough promotion has already gone to Beijing. The early release from jail last week of Wei Jingsheng, China's most celebrated dissident, appeared an effort to allay human rights anxieties. While not matching China's extravagance, Manchester, backed by Pounds 5.5m in promotional funding from the UK government and leading companies, has pursued an energetic campaign with smaller businesses giving Pounds 2.5m in kind. In Sydney, the cost of promotion is close to ADollars 25m (Pounds 10.3m) and the private sector has contributed about ADollars 14m. Olympics 2000 race, Page 8 Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

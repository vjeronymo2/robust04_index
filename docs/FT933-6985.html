			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Consumer confidence in economy rises sharply Consumer confidence in the health of the economy has risen sharply, according to the latest survey by Gallup. Thirty-four per cent of respondents were optimistic about growth while 28 per cent were pessimistic. The positive balance of 6 per cent is 11 points up on the previous month and stems from brighter expectations about jobs. There is a growing belief that unemployment has stopped rising. Low interest rates and a buoyant stock market also gave a further boost to unit trust sales in July. A net Pounds 948m flowed in and funds under management reached a record Pounds 78.8bn, up from Pounds 76.3bn at the end of June. Details, Page 5</p>

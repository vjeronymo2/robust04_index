			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: QUF joins bid battle for Associated Dairies AN ADollars 72m (USDollars 48.9m) bid battle broke out yesterday over Associated Dairies, the Victoria-based dairy products company. The development underlines the rapid rate at which Australia's dairy industry is consolidating in the face of deregulation. QUF Industries, the Brisbane-based milk and dairy goods company, said it was willing to pay ADollars 2.95 a share for Associated Dairies, on an ex-dividend basis. This outstrips the ADollars 2.85-a-share offer from Australian Co-operative Foods, the original predator, and values the target company at about ADollars 72m - about ADollars 2.5m more than the ACF bid. QUF maintained that its offer was friendly and said it expected it to carry a recommendation from the Associated Dairies board. Associated's directors said they had yet to receive the QUF's formal offer. However, in the absence of any higher offer, they proposed to recommend acceptance of the new bid. The bid is likely to be formally submitted within two weeks. ACF indicated that it might still be in the running. 'We're not going to lay down and die,' its managing director, Mr Alan Tooth, commented. The bid battle comes less than two weeks after National Foods, a food processing and consumer products company, won control of United Dairies, which has about 30 per cent of the Sydney milk market.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Signs of a recovery in the modern art market: Saleroom THE market for contemporary art is being nursed slowly back to health by the auction houses. On Wednesday night in New York, Christie's sold 53 paintings and sculptures for Dollars 11m (Pounds 6.3m) but the auction was 25 per cent unsold by value. In a comparable sale last year, Christie's sold 11 works for more than Dollars 1m - on Wednesday only three broke that barrier. The highest price was Dollars 1.87m paid by the New York dealer Richard Gray for West Brand, a black-and-white abstract expressionist canvas painted in 1960 by Franz Kline. Christie's had estimated this important work at between Dollars 2m and Dollars 3m. Bait, by Robert Rauschenberg, made the same sum, at the bottom of its estimate. Bidders are still light on the ground and cautious. The most expensive painting in the sale, Near Parnassus, by Cy Twombly, which carried an estimate of between Dollars 3m and Dollars 4m, failed to find a buyer, but Razzmatazz, a large Surrealist work by the Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein, beat its forecast at Dollars 1.65m. Sotheby's was selling less important contemporary art in New York on Wednesday and was happy with a total of Dollars 7.2m and 17 per cent unsold. Its two days of sales brought in Dollars 28.5m, and by persuading sellers to accept lower estimates to match the fall in demand it managed to dispose of most of the lots at the lower price levels. While contemporary paintings recover, Chinese works of art continue to command high prices. Sotheby's series of auctions in Hong Kong produced a total of HKDollars 115.8m (Pounds 8.6m), with 7 per cent unsold. In the final session, Mist at Dawn, a painting by Zhang Daqian, who died in 1983, sold for Pounds 155,685. Furniture is one market that has not suffered too badly during the recession, mainly thanks to buying by Continental dealers. A Belgian dealer yesterday paid Pounds 13,750, comfortably above estimate, for a late Regency rosewood breakfront bookcase at Christie's in Edinburgh.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Dublin expansion lifts Break for the Border August's Pounds 5m acquisition of Marino helped lift pre-tax profits at Break for the Border Group, the restaurateur and nightclub operator, from Pounds 140,000 to Pounds 259,000 in the six months to September 30. Turnover expanded from Pounds 1.95m to Pounds 3.46m. Mr Robert Gunlack, chairman, said that in their first two months within the group, Marino's Dublin outlets had traded successfully, contributing operating profits of Pounds 254,000 and 'fully justifying the directors' expectations at the time of acquisition'. The integration of the Dublin operations, including the introduction of an improved system of financial and operating controls, was proceeding smoothly and yielding immediate benefits, he added. Sales in Dublin in October and the first two weeks of November were in line with sales in August and September, Mr Gunlack said. Sales for the group's London outlets in October continued to be affected by the partial closure of the Argyll Street cafe. However, the refurbishment was now complete and party bookings were currently significantly higher than last year. Fully-diluted earnings per share advanced from 1.04p to 1.49p and the group is paying a first interim dividend of 0.33p.</p>

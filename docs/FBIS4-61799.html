			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, May 09, BNS -- "We probably don't even  remember such a devastated Vilnius," Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas said in his traditional Monday [9 May] radio  interview this week.    The president said he most probably made a mistake by  persuading the parliament not to dissolve the Vilnius City  Council last year. "It seemed then that new city leaders are  emerging, and it was expected that conclusions would be drawn.  But this did not happen," Brazauskas said.    Sharply criticizing activities of the capital's municipal  authorities, the president recalled an incident with the French  Lyonnaise des Eaux company, which suggested to create a joint  water-supply company in Vilnius, but the proposal was rejected  in a rude manner.    Brazauskas said the Vilnius council mixes politics with  municipal problems. "One party even has its headquarters" in the  municipality building, he said.    In Brazauskas' view, activities of Vilnius authorities  defame  the entire country because they fail to keep promises to foreign  embassies, diplomats have to look for premises themselves.    The president emphasized that the city council is fully  responsible for the present situation in the capital and added  that the council's dissolution may have to be discussed soon.  Brazauskas also urged the parliament to draft a capital city  law.</p>

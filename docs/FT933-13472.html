			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Failure on every front People are starting to speak about the tragedy of Bosnia in the past tense. They express outrage or resignation, compassion or contempt, but they speak as if it were all virtually over. Europe failed, they say; the United Nations failed; the Vance-Owen plan is dead; the Serbs have won. It is terrible for them, and shameful for us. They imply that the Serb military victory - or the joint Serb-Croat victory and the consequent territorial carve-up of Bosnia - is leading to a settlement of the conflict. Not the peaceful diplomatic settlement hoped for from the London conference; nor the consensual settlement laid out in the bizarre Vance-Owen plan. Instead, it is a bloody, messy and unfair settlement, they say. But all wars come to an end eventually, and the end of this war will at least be a settlement of sorts. This line of thinking is mistaken. The Serbs may be winning a territorial victory. But we have no reason to suppose it will produce an end to the conflict. Even if an agreement is signed, there will be no basis for peace, and one way or another fighting will continue. This is because the Serbs' nationalistic objectives are designed to exclude any chance of peace. The atrocities which have been committed in the name of an atavistic national crusade, the slaughter inflicted on so many tens of thousands, cannot fail to provoke bloody acts of revenge for years to come. There is an axiom which states that you should never drive too hard a bargain because it will simply not be kept by the other side. This is exactly the kind of bargain which the Serbs seem to be trying to drive: a carve-up which would not just be unfair to the Moslems, but would give them a mini-territory which was vulnerable, cut off and unviable. Together these moral and strategic flaws produce an inflammable mixture. It will be made more explosive by the mass of homeless refugees. About 3.8m people have been displaced by the war. The US State Department calculates that a complete ethnic carve-up of Bosnia would require the resettlement of 1.5m-2m people. Evidence from the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, suggests that such vast transfers of population cannot take place without massive violence. In any event, many hundreds of thousands will remain homeless refugees. Many will simply submit. But some of those whose fate is destitution will seek revenge. That means terrorism. In the Middle East, the Israelis have saddled themselves with a problem they cannot solve. This is because they will not make peace with the Palestinians inside Israel; nor will they make peace with the Palestinians outside Israel. Since the Palestinians refuse to disappear, there is a continuous low-level conflict. It is hard to believe that the Serbs are deliberately setting out to imitate the Israelis, but that is the way it looks. Some people will shrug their shoulders. We tried to mediate, they will say; we offered a peace process, but we failed. If they want to go on killing each other, it's their funeral. It's not our problem.* But it is our problem, for at least three reasons: refugees, international recognition and the role of the United Nations. European Community policy is to keep out asylum-seekers, by sending them back to the first 'safe' country they pass through. Since all the Community's neighbours are now designated 'safe' countries, this means that the Community expects Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and others to deal with Europe's refugee problem. The idea that the Community can shuffle off Europe's vast and growing refugee problem on to smaller and weaker countries is politically unsustain-able. In any case, such a policy will not work. If a significant proportion of the 3.8m displaced persons from the former Yugoslavia tries to get into the Community, many will certainly succeed, legally or illegally, because the pressures will be irresistible. The war in the former Yugoslavia inevitably has consequences for us. We recoiled from the costs of intervening, so we shall have to bear the costs of not intervening. But suppose the Serbs do cut a deal with the Croats and the Moslems, what then? We shall have to decide whether to recognise their 'settlement'. If we do, we may have to insist on policing it, to minimise its injustices and the risks of further war. If we don't, presumably we have to continue sanctions against Serbia. But to what end, and on what cond-itions? The dilemma is unavoidable. If we were unable to influence the war when it was going on, can we really pretend to influence the results when it is over? And yet, how can we possibly endorse the Serbs' war of conquest? How can we even allow them to remain in the UN, when they have flagrantly offended, both against the organisation and against its basic principles? And so to the UN. Experts debate whether the international community really can claim a new 'right of interference', overriding national sovereignty in the name of higher values. The political facts, as seen in Bosnia and Somalia, are three-fold: no nation state, from Italy to the US, is prepared to submit to UN authority; every interventionist has a different policy; and none of them has an interventionist policy worth tuppence. The rest is just legalistic scratching. * The Carnegie Endowment has republished its 1913 Inquiry into the Balkan Wars of 1912 &amp; 1913, with an introduction by George Kennan.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Rail Sector Tries Out Bold Corporate </F> Reform"]    [Text] China's railway sector will take "substantive  steps" in 1994 to establish a modern enterprise system, Railways  Minister Han Zhubin announced at a national conference that  opened yesterday in Beijing.    The reform will allow 12 railway bureaus across China to  have  more say in planning, finance, employment and wages.    The decision was based partly on the success of an  experiment  carried out at the Jinan Railway Bureau in Shandong Province  last year.    Apart from the railway bureaus, the industrial, construction  and material firms in the railway system will take bigger  strides in changing their operating styles, Han said.    Moreover, bolder corporate reform will be tried in a limited  number of railway sub-bureaus, such as the Fuzhou Railway  Sub-bureau in Fujian Province--mainly by converting them into  solely-owned or limited liability companies.    The Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Company even plans to turn  itself into a shareholding firm and perhaps issue stocks  publicly within the year.    The minister also offered to open up Chinese railways wider  to the outside world now that international capital is eager to  enter the Chinese railway construction market.    The first step will be issuing railway stocks and bonds in  overseas monetary markets to attract foreign investors to  railway projects in China.    This year the ministry will encourage experts from home and  aboard to study opening-up tactics and present specific  co-operation projects.    "If we want to speed up rail development, we must actively  break into the market at both home and abroad," Han told the  meeting.    It is necessary to do away with old taboos, because joining  the market is the only way to ease the bottlenecks in the  railway system, which is the State's pillar infrastructure he  added.    In line with this initiative, railway transport units will  earmark the bulk of their freight cars for shipping key  materials, such as coal and disaster relief supplies, while the  remainder will be used for commercial transport under contracted  freight rates.    To meet market demand, the ministry is ready to form a batch  of specialized firms dealing in container and large-scale cargo  transport, insurance, telecommunications and tourism.    The ministry will initially raise 29 billion yuan ($3.3  billion) of investment for this year's capital construction, a  growth of 6.5 billion yuan ($747 million) over last year.    The fresh input is to result in 2,100 kilometres of new  lines, the double tracking of 1,335 kilometres of existing lines  and electrification of another 194 kilometres.    The record-high figures suggested another high tide of  railway construction this year.    The majority of the planned investment will flow into seven  major railway projects.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Dissidents win control of Andrews Sykes board Dissidents led by Mr Jacques Murray yesterday finally won control of the Andrews Sykes board after shareholders at an adjourned extraordinary meeting voted Mr Murray and four of his supporters onto the eight-man board. Mr Murray, who holds a 29.67 per cent stake in the specialist industrial services group, has waged an 18 month battle for control of the board. He has repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with Sykes' performance. An earlier move by Mr Murray, who is also chairman of Nu-Swift, the fire protection group, to unseat Mr David Hubbard, chairman, and take control of the board in October 1992 failed because of lack of institutional support. Yesterday shareholders decided on a majority vote by proxy to appoint Mr Murray and his nominees to the board. They also decided to remove Mr Stuart Ross, finance director, and Mr David Crowe, an independent director, from the board. However, a proposal to remove Mr David Martin, Sykes' recently appointed chief executive, was rejected.</p>

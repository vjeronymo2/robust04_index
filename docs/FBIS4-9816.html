			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 3 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Delegates of  the Socialist Renewal Movement (CRS) signed today the peace  agreement achieved with the government of President Cesar  Gaviria, which will lead to the demobilization of 300 rebels on  9 April. The rebels at the conference, which was held at the  rebel camp in Flor del Monte, some 1,300 km north of Santa Fe de  Bogota, stuck to their request for a seat in the Senate once the  organization turns over its weapons.    The CRS, a dissident faction of the National Liberation Army  (ELN), signed a political agreement with the Colombian  Government last week. The agreement signed between the  guerrillas [words indistinct] and the Colombian Government  includes the government's pledge to grant sufficient resources  for the incorporation of the CRS into the country's democratic  life and guaranteeing two seats in the Chamber of Deputies for  the rebel group.    The CRS summit, which began on 31 March and concluded today,  welcomed the proposal of Jacinto Ruiz and Gabriel Borja -- its  negotiators -- to vote blank on 29 May, the date of the  presidential elections in Colombia. After rejecting the  candidacy of Antonio Navarro Wolf as an alternative, the CRS  plenum announced that it will promote a political movement "with  a high degree of internal democracy that will set us apart from  the bipartite tradition that has dominated this nation."    According to a CRS spokesperson, participants in the summit  included at least 140 CRS delegates as well as followers of the  legally constituted left wing, leaders of unions, and peasant  organizations that are interested in the new political project.    Presidential Adviser Carlos Eduardo Jaramillo approved the  signing of the agreement and [word indistinct] toward the  consolidation of peace in Colombia.</p>

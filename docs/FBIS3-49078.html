			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zvornik, 4 Jan (TANJUG) -- Major General Milan  Gvero, deputy commander of the main headquarters of the republic  of Srpska's Army [VRS], told TANJUG today that not one UN  Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] member has ever been hurt on  Serb-held territory. At the same time, Gvero added, it is well  known how many UNPROFOR troops have lost their lives or have  been wounded in Muslim and Croat-controlled areas.    "Facts point to the inevitable conlusion that the Blue  Berets  are completely safe only on the territory of the republic of  Srpska," Gvero stressed. According to him, "the Serbian side  has so far displayed full cooperation in its dealings with  members of international organizations and UNPROFOR." Gvero  underlined that UNPROFOR's movements are always determined by  previous agreement between the two sides and that, because of  this, "there is absolutely no reason why the Serb side should be  singled out as the party obstructing or preventing UNPROFOR's  movements."    The deputy commander of the VRS main headquarters pointed  out  that top-level officers recently met General Francis Briquemont,  UNPROFOR's commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that "it was  noted with mutual satisfaction that a high degree of rapport has  been established between the Serbian side and UNPROFOR."    "We expect soon to have a similar meeting with General Jean  Cot, UNPROFOR's commander for former Yugoslavia, which will  certainly be mutually beneficial," General Gvero assessed.</p>

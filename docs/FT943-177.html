			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Pay policy fails to curb earnings in public sector: Rises average 2.5 per cent in spite of Treasury limits The government's policy of pay restraint in the public sector is failing to contain market pressures for higher earnings, according to an official survey published yesterday. Rises in the public sector averaged 2.5 per cent in the 12 months to April, the annual New Earnings Survey revealed, and came in spite of a 1.5 per cent pay norm imposed by the Treasury and a three-year public sector pay bill freeze. The government's own employees enjoyed an average 3.9 per cent earnings rise, with substantial increases of 7.5 per cent for women secretaries and typists in the civil service and 6.8 per cent for staff in scientific and professional grades. Senior and middle-ranking male civil servants enjoyed 3.7 per cent average earnings increases, twice the size of the government's pay target. 'This provides clear evidence that governments can no longer control pay from the centre. The Treasury's policy is not working out as it was intended. Politicians can no longer run incomes policies like they did 30 years ago,' said Mr Chris Trinder, research director of the independent Public Finance Foundation. For the first time since 1990, private sector increases, which averaged 2.8 per cent, moved ahead of public sector rises. The annual survey published by the Department of Employment provides a comprehensive picture of pre-tax earnings for full-time employees. It is based on information from employers and the sample covers 1 per cent of workers employed over the pay period which included early April. It excludes part-timers and the self-employed. Other key findings in this year's survey show: The average pre-tax weekly earnings for all full-time employees were Pounds 325.70 in April with a median figure of Pounds 282 a week. The level of pay rises was greater for women (3.5 per cent) than for men (2.4 per cent), while white-collar employees had an average 2.9 per cent increase compared with 2.4 per cent for manual workers. The level of female earnings relative to those of men has narrowed to 79.5 per cent - its smallest since the survey began in 1970. This reflects the continuing decline in male full-time employment and increase in the size of the female full-time workforce. There has been a slight narrowing in the spread of earnings rises this year, with a 3.5 per cent rise in the weekly earnings of the bottom 10 per cent of the employed workforce while the earnings of the top 10 per cent increased by 2.9 per cent. The bottom 10 per cent earned less than Pounds 158 a week, 44 per cent below the median, while the top 10 per cent of employees earned over Pounds 525 a week, 86 per cent above the median. Young workers' earnings rose more slowly than any other age group with an actual drop of 0.1 per cent for male manual workers under the age of 18 and a rise of only 1.5 per cent for those between 18 and 20. Women aged 18 to 20 secured a 0.7 per cent earnings rise with a decline of 0.2 per cent for female non-manual workers. New Earnings Survey 1994, part 1. HMSO, Pounds 13.00.

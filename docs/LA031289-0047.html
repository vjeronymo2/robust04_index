			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIABETIC ASKS ODDS OF BECOMING MOTHER;  </P> <P> WOMAN WITH DISEASE UNDER CONTROL SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONCEIVE  </P> <P> Question: I have diabetes, and I realize that I will have to take certain  precautions if I plan to become pregnant, both before and during that time that  I'm pregnant. I've read a good deal about this. But I haven't read anything  about whether it will be harder for me to become pregnant, and I would  appreciate any information.  </P> <P> Answer: A woman whose diabetes is in good control is as fertile as any other  woman, and should be able to conceive just as readily. However, a woman whose  diabetes is not in good control may have trouble ovulating, and this can  adversely affect her ability to conceive.  </P> <P> Q: How much water or other fluids should a person drink? When I'm thirsty, I  drink, and when I'm not thirsty, I don't. That always seemed to me to be a  sensible way to do things, but from what other people have told me, that's not  enough. I'm very puzzled by all this.  </P> <P> A: I believe you would not be puzzled if you simply bear in mind that thirst  alone is not a reliable indication of how much a person should drink. This is  especially true of older people, whose thirst mechanism appears to lose its  effectiveness as they age. Older people are also more prone to dehydration  because their kidneys are less efficient in retaining water.  </P> <P> Because thirst is an unreliable guide, the rule is to have six to eight cups of  fluid daily, whether or not you are thirsty. Appropriate fluids for this  purpose include water, milk and fruit juice. Fluids to be avoided include  alcohol and caffeine-containing beverages such as coffee, tea and cola drinks;  these fluids increase water output.  </P> <P> Even a fluid intake of six to eight cups does not completely replace the amount  lost each day; however, solid foods also contain water, and this goes to make  up the balance. For example, water comprises more than 80% of most fruits and  vegetables, and more than 50% of meat.  </P></p>

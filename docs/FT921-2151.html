			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: TNT in international mail deal TNT, the Australian transport group, yesterday said it had completed a deal with five European and North American post offices to operate a joint international express mail service. The venture, to be known as GD Net, will significantly increase the volume of packages being carried by TNT's extensive European network of trucks and air-craft. Mr John Mullen, chief executive, said the agreement was 'an historic day for the world express industry. It makes the world we do business in that little bit smaller.' The completion of the deal ends nearly a year of detailed negotiations between TNT and the post offices of Canada, Sweden, France, Germany and The Netherlands. TNT has suggested that a number of other European post offices might seek to join GD Net, which will be based in Amsterdam, and will employ more than 10,500 people servicing deliveries to 190 countries. The group said GD Net would use the brandnames of TNT Express Worldwide and EMS, the international express mail system operated by European and North American post offices, for the 'foreseeable future.' The deal represents a considerable coup for TNT, which had struggled to generate sufficient volume for its loss-making distribution network in the heavily competitive European market. Earlier this week, TNT announced a USDollars 18m deal to acquire Chronoservice, a leading French domestic express carrier, and deliver in-bound shipments in 10 European countries for Federal Express of the US. The group has recovered strongly since the beginning of last year, when its share price fell below ADollars 1 on the Australian Stock Exchange on worries about its liquidity and profitability. The shares closed 5 cents lower in Sydney, at ADollars 1.88.</p>

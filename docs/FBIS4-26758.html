			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 25 (CNS) -- The harvest of summer  grain crops is expected to be pretty good this year even though  the area under cultivation of summer grain crops across the  country has been reduced to 465 million mu this year, a drop of  7 million mu when compared with the previous year, according to  the Ministry of Agriculture. It is, however, difficult to  realize an overall bumper harvest of crops for the entire year.  Agricultural production across the country should not be  treated lightly.    There are so many difficulties for the autumn grain  cultivation judging from the current situation. First, the land  under cultivation of grains continues to decline which makes it  difficult a gain of crop harvest. Second, natural disasters are  rather serious with grave drought in northern part and in some  areas of southwestern China. Serious impacts are seen on  cultivation of dry crop of maize and on the planting of summer  paddy in these areas. South China and the southern part of the  Yangtze River were hit by rainstorms which have already resulted  in heavy damage to agricultural production. Third, the planting  of cotton suffered natural disasters in spite of the fact that  the area under cultivation of cotton increased to some extent.  It is rather difficult to realize the planned yield of cotton  planting. Meanwhile, rising prices for chemical fertilizer and  pesticide due to short supply this year added more difficulties  to agricultural production.    The ministry appealed to various places to pay much more  attention to agricultural production for the entire year. The  sowing for summer grain crops is now underway in southern and  northern parts and efforts should be painstakingly made in order  to ensure a yield of crops. Time should not be lost in planting  summer crops. Cultivated acreage should be expanded and  multiple cropping should be tried in a bid to increase the crop  yield. Drought condition as well as floods and waterlogging  have to be promptly dealt with in order to make crop cultivation  possible with an eventual aim of having a good harvest of grains  for the whole year.</p>

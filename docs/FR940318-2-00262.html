The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Plum Creek Charters (PCCX)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (FRA Waiver Petition Docket Number SA&hyph;93&hyph;9)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PCCX seeks a waiver of compliance from certain sections of the Railroad Safety Appliance Standards (49 CFR part 231). PCCX is requesting a permanent waiver of the provisions of 49 CFR 231.14 (d)(3) requiring that horizontal end handholds be located one on each side on each end projecting downward from face of end sill or sheathing. The PCCX request that this requirement be waived for passenger car number 800245. Passenger car number 800245 was equipped with 480 volt wiring which necessitated the removal of the original end handholds to accommodate the electrical coupling fixtures. The passenger car is equipped with end handholds approximately 48 inches from top of rail and not more than 16 inches from the side of car and project downward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21/2 inches beyond the face of the end sill.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Passenger car number 800245 is currently leased to and operated by the City of Prineville (COP) in excursion service. The car is used on three trains per week during the summer and two trains per week in the winter. The excursion train travels a distance of 38 miles over COP trackage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear to warrant a hearing.

As Rexrodt described his meeting with Finance Minister  Paul Martin, Economics Minister John Manley, and Foreign Trade  Minister Roy MacLaren, there had been talks in Ottawa between  "free traders" seeking opportunities for closer cooperation on a  broad level.    Rexrodt, who stopped in the Canadian capital for two days on  his way from the United States to Mexico, immediately presented  his hosts with a wish list. He is hoping for "fair competition"  if Canada decides to build a fast railroad line between Quebec  City and Windsor (Ontario). Of course, given Canada's desolate  financial situation, the only argument for such a project is the  creation of jobs.    During a visit to the Bombardier works in Montreal, Rexrodt  also pointed out to the Canadians the advantages of closer  cooperation in aviation and space travel. He called for  improved access to the market in the whole area of  telecommunications.    The assessment of the new aggravation in Washington's  relations with Tokyo made it clear how similar are Bonn's and  Ottawa's ideas on key questions. Both sides basically welcomed  American pressure on Japan, all the more so since the Canadians  also have cause to complain again and again about lack of access  to the Japanese market. It was also stressed, however, that one  does not think much of compromises such as agreement on import  quotas, because this would damage the pure spirit of GATT.    On the sidelines of his visit, the Bonn minister also had an  opportunity to get to know Donald Johnston, Canadian candidate  for the office of OECD secretary general and a former minister  from the Trudeau era. Johnston, who will soon travel to the  capitals of the OECD countries to introduce himself, can count  on the United States' support, but not on help from Bonn.  Rexrodt: "We stick to Lorenz Schomerus."    Regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement, Rexrodt  today again sees a potential for German investments in Canada.  The generally higher educational level in Canada compared with  the low-wage zones [Leichtlohnzonen] of the United States and  Mexico, the more comprehensible legal situation, and the  comparable technical standards favor this, he said.</p>

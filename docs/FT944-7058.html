			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Bill Whitbread, 'fireball' brewer: Obituary Colonel Bill Whitbread, who has died aged 93, was one of the leading family brewers of the 20th century. While typifying the old family brewer of an earlier age - a landowner with a love of hunting, shooting and riding - he took his family business into a more modern age with a jolt in the 1950s and 1960s. As chairman of Whitbread &amp; Co from 1944 to 1971 he reorganised the company's antiquated financial structure and devised a shareholding formula, based on A and B shares and a separate investment company, which preserved family control while providing for the injection of much-needed capital. He invented the 'Whitbread umbrella', a series of equity capital exchanges which enabled more than 30 family brewing companies threatened by takeover to shelter under Whitbread's wing. Later, when circumstances forced the abandonment of the umbrella, he led his company in a determined strategy of acquisition, rationalisation of productive capacity, and the establishment of national beer brands. Whitbread was the great-great-great grandson of Samuel Whitbread, who founded the company in 1742, and the son of HW 'Harry' Whitbread. Educated at Eton and at Corpus Christi Cambridge, where he studied history, he trained as a brewer at Truman Hanbury Buxton in Burton-upon-Trent (1921-23), then worked at Fisons' Thetford maltings before going to Whitbread headquarters at Chiswell Street, London, in 1924. He became a managing director in 1927 and served on the board until 1979. The year 1927 was significant for the company because Whitbread embarked on a big expansion in south-east England by acquiring three Kentish breweries and the Mackeson stout brand. His absence on military service during the second world war weakened the company's management when British brewing was required to maintain its output with depleted manpower and depreciating capital resources. It was in the difficult post-war years that 'Colonel Bill' came into his own. In 1948 he steered through the reorganisation of the company's capital. A quarter of the equity was placed on the market by Barings and Schroders. Six years later Whitbread Investment, a wholly-owned subsidiary, was established to acquire the umbrella shareholdings. This became the vehicle for the directors' retention of a controlling interest in the expanding company. Described by the company's historian as a 'fireball', Whitbread could be impatient and rude. Perceptive about the industry, but strongly wedded to family loyalties and paternalism, he needed a foil. This he found in FOAG 'Alex' Bennett, who succeeded him as chairman in 1971. The Whitbread-Bennett partnership set the company on the right road in the turmoil of mergers and acquisitions which characterised the industry from the late 1950s to the early 1970s. Under Whitbread the company was transformed from a relatively small, under-capitalised concern - in spite of its claims to 'national' status - to one of Britain's big six brewers. The umbrella certainly protected the independence of some companies. For others, it was the first step to full merger with Whitbread in the more competitive conditions of the 1960s. More than 23 companies were acquired in the period 1961-71. The merger programme strained the company's management resources, while the acquisition of numerous small productive sites necessitated a comprehensive programme of rationalisation. Yet while the company had to transform its organisation to match its growth, it always had a reputation for sound management.</p>

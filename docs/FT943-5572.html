			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / World stock prices fall on worries over interest rates Pessimism on the future direction of interest rates affected world financial markets yesterday, in the wake of poor price data in the US, strong output figures from Germany and a Bundesbank decision to leave official rates unchanged. Bond and equity prices fell in Germany, while in the US, long Treasury bond prices and the Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted lower in early trading. In London, the FT-SE 100 Index closed 34.8 points down at 3,216.5. Equity markets started 1994 in bullish mood with many investors believing that interest rates had further to fall, particularly in Europe. But the Federal Reserve's five increases in interest rates, allied to the unexpectedly strong rebound in European economies, has gradually made investors less optimistic about the scope for further European cuts. Some countries, such as Sweden and Italy, have been forced to raise rates and in others, such as Britain, it is clear that the next move in rates will be upwards. Most analysts had expected the Bundesbank council at its fortnightly meeting yesterday to leave official rates, including the repo rate, unchanged. Nevertheless, figures showing that German industrial production had risen by a monthly 2.2 per cent in July reinforced the views of those who believe that German rates are very close to their bottom. The Frankfurt Dax equity market index closed only 12.05 points down at 2,200.80, but dropped further in after-hours trading once the August US National Association of Purchasing Management data were released. Although those showed a fall in the overall index, indicating some slowing of the pace of economic growth, the prices component rose to its highest level since August 1988. Any sign of future US inflation raises fears that the Federal Reserve will push for further increases in interest rates. By 1pm New York time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 10.69 to 3,902.73. Combined with a fall in Treasury bond prices, the result was downward pressure on the dollar, which fell against both the yen and the D-Mark in European trading. The early fall in the Dow also depressed European stock markets, with the CAC 40 index closing 34.17 points lower at 2,034.91. The French market is still suffering from the decision by four French banks this week to increase their lending rates. London Stock Exchange, Page 31 World stocks, Page 38</p>

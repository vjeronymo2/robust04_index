			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gencor steps boldly into world arena - The Shell package puts the S African group in the top league With one big, Dollars 1.1bn step, Gencor is to make up for the many years when its development as an international mining group was held back by South Africa's political isolation. While its rivals expanded - particularly via the mining booms in Australia and the Pacific Rim countries - Gencor had to confine its traditional mining skills to its native country. Now, after its deal to buy most of the Royal Dutch/Shell mining and minerals assets operating under the Billiton banner, Gencor will, if all goes well, by the end of this century control the western world's biggest ferro-nickel business; the second-largest platinum and mineral sands companies; and be among the top three gold producers and the top five aluminium groups. It will also rank among the top 10 in stainless steel and coal and nickel production. However, getting to this position has involved a transaction of immense complexity, and one that has taken well over a year to put together. The struggle was worthwhile, according to Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor chairman, who said yesterday: 'If we are to rejoin the first league of mining we simply have to operate globally.' Once the deal with Shell is completed, Gencor will be one of the most diversified international resource groups, with income derived mainly from seven world-class commodity businesses: gold (Gengold); platinum (Impala); coal (Transnatal); ferro-alloys (Samancor); titanium mineral sands (Richards Bay Minerals); alumina and aluminium and nickel. The Billiton operations, located in 15 countries, fit well with those of Gencor, particularly since the South African group has been 'unbundling' its assets to concentrate on mining businesses. Billiton's bauxite and alumina operations in Australia and Brazil can provide essential raw materials for Alusaf, the South African aluminium producer in which Gencor has a 41 per cent interest, and which is completing a Dollars 2bn expansion to increase annual capacity to 646,000 tonnes. South Africa has no bauxite reserves, and Alusaf has already agreed to take 400,000 tonnes of Billiton's annual alumina output - and maybe more later. Billiton's Cerro Matoso mine in Columbia produces ferro-nickel well-suited to the Columbus stainless steel plant in South Africa, in which Gencor has a 33 per cent interest. This will enable the group to export the higher-value nickel it mines in South Africa, which is really of too high a quality to go into stainless production. These - bauxite and alumina in Australia and Brazil and Cerro Matoso - were the 'core' assets Gencor simply had to have for the deal to be worthwhile. The other core asset was Billiton's international marketing and trading organisation, which can provide outlets for the wide range of metals and minerals Gencor produces. Fashioning a deal to acquire them was complex and time-consuming, partly because Billiton did not exist as a separate corporate entity with its own consolidated financial history. The assets had to be disentangled from Shell operations around the world - to be placed in a new holding company, Billiton International - in a way that would give tax advantages to both Shell and Gencor. This absence of a Billiton corporation also affected the financing, because there was no 'clean' package to offer the banks. Neither could Gencor move cash out of South Africa because of exchange controls. Nevertheless, Gencor has permission to include its 50 per cent share of Richards Bay Minerals as part of its contribution to the deal. The Dollars 335m in cash Gencor is contributing will come from the sale of its North Sea oil assets and its shareholding in TransAtlantic Holdings. Consequently, although Gencor has been able to get non-recourse finance, it is paying well above the usual rate for Billiton's borrowings. It aims to refinance this part of its debt on more conventional terms as soon as possible. Billiton's effective funding cost is a modest average 5.2 per cent, thanks to Shell's contribution to the financing. Shell is taking Dollars 300m of bonds exchangeable into Billiton equity. The bonds, which are interest-free for the first free years, can be converted into 29.5 per cent of Billiton's equity in the first year, and a reduced percentage thereafter. Some 61 per cent of Billiton's revenues come from the bauxite and alumina interests. Indeed, when the aluminium market fully recovers from the worst recession in its history, aluminium could conceivably contribute most of Gencor's earnings. If that time comes, Gencor might attempt to balance earnings by floating Billiton or part of the aluminium assets. Mr Gilbertson pointed out that a combination of Alusaf and the Billiton up-stream operations would produce the fifth-largest integrated aluminium business in the world. He added: 'At low (aluminium) prices, the deal has little appeal. At high prices, the returns are huge. If our estimate of the medium-term price trends are anywhere near correct, then this parcel of assets will prove to be very valuable, and the price we have paid (Dollars 420m in assets plus Dollars 335m cash for at least 70.5 per cent of a group with assets worth Dollars 1.2bn) to have been cheap.'  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Billiton assets  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Asset name                 Location               Description  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bauxite, alumina and aluminium  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Worsley                   Australia          Bauxite mine and                                              alumina refinery MRN                          Brazil              Bauxite mine Alumar                       Brazil          Alumina refinery                                             Aluminium smelter Valesul                      Brazil         Aluminium smelter BMS                         Surinam              Bauxite mine                                              Alumina refinery Boke                         Guinea              Bauxite mine Aughinish            Rep of Ireland          Alumina refinery  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Nickel  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Cerro Matoso               Colombia               Nickel mine  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Precious Metals  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bogosu                        Ghana                 Gold mine Prima Lirang              Indonesia                 Gold mine                                         (also silver, barite)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Other  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Selbaie                      Canada               Copper mine                                                     Zinc mine Pering (2)                 S Africa                 Zinc mine                                                     Lead mine Marketing   Principally Netherlands        Marketing, trading and                     UK, France, Trading              Germany, Japan Commercial &amp;            Netherlands     Commercial, technical Technical Services  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Asset name                 Interest                Production                                 (%)                    (1993)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bauxite, alumina and aluminium  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Worsley                       30.00                 6m tonnes                                                   1.6m tonnes MRN                           14.80                 8m tonnes Alumar                        36.00                 1m tonnes                               46.35            350,000 tonnes Valesul                       41.50             85,000 tonnes BMS                           76.00                 2m tonnes                               45.00               1.5m tonnes Boke                           3.06              11.5m tonnes Aughinish                     35.00               1.1m tonnes  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Nickel  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Cerro Matoso                  52.31              44.5m pounds  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Precious Metals  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bogosu                        81.23        90,000 troy ounces Prima Lirang                  90.00        47,000 troy ounces  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Other  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Selbaie                      100.00         33,000 tonnes (1)                                             54,000 tonnes (1) Pering (2)                   100.00         30,000 tonnes (1)                                              5,000 tonnes (1) Marketing                    100.00                       N/A and Trading Commercial &amp;                 100.00                       N/A Technical Services.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) In concentrate.

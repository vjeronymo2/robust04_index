			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (12): Better investment climate - Developments in the gold-mining sector The lure of Russian gold is finally paying off with a start to foreign investment in one of the country's most closely-guarded industries. Over the past month, two unprecedented gold-mining deals have cleared final hurdles to more than a third of a billion dollars' worth of investment. The Russian gold mining industry, previously a state-owned monopoly, found itself starved of capital following the collapse of the Soviet-era command-economy. As a result, gold output in a country which is the world's second-largest producer, has been steadily falling. This in turn has forced Russia, despite its deep-rooted fears of 'selling off the family silver', to look abroad for finance for bigger projects requiring sophisticated technology and vast amounts of capital. Dozens of Russian companies have already won contracts to develop smaller deposits concentrated mainly in Siberia. But the two foreign deals, for bigger and more difficult deposits, are the first of their kind following the successful conclusion of more than two years of negotiations. After altering its initial plan to meet objections from Russian authorities, Star Mining, a small Australian exploration company, has all but finalised a deal to develop Sukhoi Log (Dry Gulch), Russia's largest hard-rock gold deposit. It has promised to invest Dollars 250m in Lenzoloto, the local Siberian producer in which it holds 31 per cent, up from an initial proposal to invest Dollars 150m. The aim of the project is to raise Lenzoloto's annual production to 2m ounces in six years, about three-quarters of which would come from Sukhoi Log. Earlier this month, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (Opic) of the US and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development finally approved Dollars 110m in loans and investment guarantees for the development of the Kubaka deposit in Russia's Far East. The tender for the project was won last June by a joint venture between Cyprus Amax Minerals of the US and five regional mining companies. But, responding to companies' nervousness about investing in Russia, Opic will provide investment guarantees of Dollars 55m plus Dollars 150m insurance cover against expropriation and political violence. The EBRD will lend the project a further Dollars 55m. The aim is to produce 326,000 ounces of gold and 255,000 ounces of silver a year. The contrasting histories of the two deals speak volumes about the gradual improvement of Russia's investment climate since the launch of market reforms in 1992. While big companies remained on the sidelines, Star - invited by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, to scout for mining opportunities in Russia before it even became an independent state with the collapse of the Soviet Union - directly negotiated a joint venture with Lenzoloto, a local Siberian producer. But the project soon ran into trouble with Russian authorities who argued that the deal did not meet the requirements of either the nation's interests or its fast-changing legislation. A main objection was that the deposit should have been put to tender, while Star and Lenzoloto argued that they had concluded their deal before new legislation was passed requiring all new deposits to be put to tender. Coming in later than Star, Cyprus Amax Minerals faced a much smoother ride because ground rules making tenders compulsory were already clearly established. Mr Adrian Ball, Moscow representative for Morgan Grenfell, the investment bank which acted as adviser to the western parties, says the deal also received powerful support from local authorities of Magadan province, which stands to receive rich tax returns from the deal. Mr Ball points out that taxation is so high, however, that the deal is only just about profitable. Mr Boris Yatskevich, deputy chairman of the state committee which is responsible for issuing mining licences, agrees that taxation remains far too high by international standards. But having led objections to the Star deal, he said he had agreed to drop his legal quibbles after Star improved their terms. 'Today Lenzoloto, with 7,500 employees, is on the edge of bankruptcy. It is not possible to torture them any further.' The Russian government also stepped in to ease objections from local authorities in the eastern Siberian province of Irkutsk by giving them 10 per cent of the equity in the project. It is now up to the Irkutsk administration to finally endorse the deal.</p>

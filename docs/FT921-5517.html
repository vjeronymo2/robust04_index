			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Australian current account result prompts growth hopes AUSTRALIA'S current account deficit in January was below the psychological barrier of ADollars 1bn (Pounds 400m), fuelling further expectations of a gradual recovery from the recession. The statistics bureau yesterday reported a January deficit of ADollars 861m in seasonally-adjusted terms, up 44 per cent on December's ADollars 599m, but the provisional trend estimate shows a 5 per cent fall on the December estimate, representing a third successive monthly decline. However, both the government and the markets remained restrained in their optimism, preferring to wait for more definite signs in the national accounts due later this month. Economists generally see a very modest growth in domestic production in the quarter to December. A second set of figures released yesterday supports this expectation, showing that stock levels remained constant in the quarter to December after falling steadily in the past 18 months. Meanwhile, foreign debt at the end of December stood at ADollars 144.8bn, up 4.3 per cent on the level at the end of the previous quarter.</p>

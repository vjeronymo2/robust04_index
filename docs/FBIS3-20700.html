			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marie Koenigova and Katerina Perknerova: "Only </F> Czech Citizens Can Conduct Business in Weapons"]    [Text] According to the law approved by parliament, only  legal persons resident in the Czech Republic whose capital is  more than 50 percent domestic can conduct business in military  materials after 1 April. Two licenses will be necessary -- one  for business activity and the other for each separate  transaction.    They will be issued by the Trade and Industry Ministry with  the agreement of the Defense, Foreign, and Interior Ministries  only if the members of the company's statutory body and its  authorized officers are Czech Republic citizens over the age of  21 who have a clean record and were never employed by or  collaborated with the former State Security.    The law stipulates that the license application must  contain,  among other things, "the reason for the import or export or --  as the case may be -- other handling of the military material"  and the "name and address of the end-user." The application  must be accompanied by a "document on its final utilization."  In reply to a question from RUDE PRAVO on whether the licensing  procedure for specific transactions will also include  verification of the foreign trade partner to prevent the  possible re-export of weapons from the Czech Republic to areas  of conflict, O. Vychodil (Civic Democratic Party), the  parliamentary rapporteur on the law, said: "Consideration will  be given, from the foreign policy point of view, to whether the  region for which the weapons are destined is or is not a crisis  region. For this reason, the Foreign, Defense, and Interior  Ministries will also express their opinion on the application  for a license for this kind of business. Cooperation with the  information and intelligence services is also envisaged."  According to Vychodil, the bodies that grant the license will be  responsible for safeguarding the Czech Republic's interests.  "If a deal goes through and the weapons are re-exported because  the entity has not been verified, this may cause foreign policy  problems," said Vychodil to RUDE PRAVO.    Large and small-caliber weapons, ammunition, bombs,  torpedoes, shells, mines, military explosives, aircraft,  helicopters, aircraft engines, aircraft equipment and the ground  equipment associated with it, missiles, and warships are  considered to be military materials. The law states  unequivocally that weapons of mass destruction must not be  included in this kind of business. If the law is infringed and  the Czech Republic's vital interests are harmed by the deal, a  fine of up to 30 million korunas may be imposed. The specific  individual involved may also face up to 10 years imprisonment.  A fine of up to 5 million korunas may be imposed for a  commonplace infringement of the law.    RDP Group Director General J. Vlcek described the approved  law on the export of military materials as a good norm that has  created the demarcation desired by weapons exporters. The RDP  Group affiliates 40 Czech enterprises that produce military  materials. In Vlcek's opinion, it is fitting that the  appropriate ministries will make the decision on the permits and  licenses so that possible scandals -- caused, for example, by  competition -- will not be laid at the door of those who hold  permits and licenses to conduct business in weapons. In reply  to a question from RUDE PRAVO on whether the exporter -- who has  to submit a document on the final utilization of the military  material, including the name and address of the end- user -- is  capable of guaranteeing that the weapons will not be  re-exported, Vlcek said: "No. In my opinion, the Trade and  Industry Ministry must verify this. After consulting the  Foreign Ministry and other departments, it must determine  whether the end-user put forward by us is the right one and  whether, in his case, there is any risk of re-export to  so-called crisis countries and regions."    The law contains a strict control mechanism. For example,  staff from the Trade and Industry Ministry have the right to  demand from the exporter the appropriate documents, agreements,  and notification about using the licenses at any time. In reply  to a question on whether this may be abused for competitive  reasons and whether it could slow down the deals already  underway, Vlcek said that he has spoken to Minister Dlouhy about  this. "The question for us is to make sure that the officials  execute the authority accorded to them by law, but in no way  exploit it or hold things up artificially," said Vlcek.    According to him, detailed directives dealing with this  issue  -- and also, for example, permitting publicity for the  production and export of military materials -- will be adopted  soon. As he said, supplementary norms should deal with these  issues, "but, definitely so that the law really creates  conditions that do not hold back so-called clean trade,  conditions that do not activate unnecessary barriers."</p>

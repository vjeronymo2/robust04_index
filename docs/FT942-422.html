			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Complexities of gas market competition not to be underestimated Sir, Mr Ted Trafford and others (Letters, June 24) suggested that introduction of competition into the domestic gas market will result in winners only. However, solutions to many of the complex problems raised in the Department of Trade and Industry/Ofgas consultation paper have yet to be found. British Gas is certainly not against competition - provided the playing field is level. Competitors already hold 46 per cent of the non-domestic market. However, introducing competition to 18m domestic homes is a mammoth task and the complexity should not be underestimated. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission report warned against the rapid introduction of competition and the DTI/Ofgas consultation document confirmed that there would be price variations for different customers. Legislation will inevitably be complicated. Customers need to be guaranteed safety and security of supply. Arrangements also need to be put in place to protect the more vulnerable members of society, including the elderly, disabled and those with difficulties in paying their bills. Further investment in infrastructure is vital to maintain the pipeline system and to meet customers' future demands. We have connected more than 2m homes to the system in the last seven years and our total investment has exceeded Pounds 7bn. British Gas has delivered good value and good service at home, and this expertise applied overseas has enabled us to become the leading international gas company, directly benefiting the UK economy. The challenges of introducing competition into the domestic sector are extremely complex. We will be working to make it a success.

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Observer: Beastly Bodmin It's better than swigging sangria in Alicante; but probably not much. Paul Tyler, Liberal Democrat MP for north Cornwall, has been spending his summer hunting the semi-mythical Beast of Bodmin, recently 'sighted' less than a hundred yards from his home on the edge of Bodmin moor. Tyler has convened a meeting with farmers, police and government officials to decide how to deal with the beast. He was out of the Commons for 18 years after losing his last seat in Bodmin in 1974; so he knows all about being in the wilderness, rare sightings, beastly behaviour, etc, etc.</p>

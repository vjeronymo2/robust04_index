			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 20 May (UKRINFORM-TASS) -- A statement by the  Ukrainian Foreign Ministry press center was distributed today to  the mass media. It says:    "On 20 May, the Supreme Soviet of Crimea adopted a law on  `The restoration of the constitutional bases of the statehood of  the Republic of Crimea,' thus making an attempt to restore  Crimea's Constitution to its 6 May 1992 form. This law is  unconstitutional and illegal. It is leading to tension in  interethnic relations on the peninsula and in Ukraine as a  whole, and brings into question the legal status of the Republic  of Crimea as a constituent part of Ukraine, which represents a  direct threat to the territorial integrity of Ukraine and peace  and stability in the region."    In this connection A.M. Zlenko, Ukrainian foreign affairs  minister, has sent letters to the UN secretary general, chairman  of the Security Committee, CSCE chairman, NATO secretary  general, heads of other international organizations, and foreign  affairs ministers of other countries. In his letters the head  of the Ukrainian foreign policy department stresses, in  particular, that this unlawful decision, provoked by  irresponsible policies of the present Crimean leadership, is  aimed at undermining Ukraine's constitutional structures and its  territorial integrity, and cannot be qualified as anything other  than an open attempt by separatist forces to jeopardize internal  political stability in Ukraine and bring about tension in  relations between Ukraine and Russia. This puts in danger peace  and stability in the region and in the whole of Europe, which,  taking into account a complex current situation in this part of  the continent, can have grave negative consequences.    "Today, when the European countries participating in the  Conference on the Pact on Stability in Europe have agreed on the  exceptional importance of the unconditional preservation and  consolidation of the principles of territorial integrity, and  the inviolability of existing borders as a guarantee of peace  and security in Europe, such separatist strivings by the  leadership of the Republic of Crimea could lead to the further  erosion of these fundamental international legal principles,  upon which European stability is based.    "In the event of the situation escalating further as a  consequence of irresponsible steps by extremist forces in  Crimea, Ukraine reserves the right to adopt all necessary  measures to ensure unconditionally the territorial integrity of  the state in accordance with its constitution and existing  legislation, while observing the norms of international law."</p>

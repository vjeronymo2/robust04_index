			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: No longer the best form of attack?  -Political battles over defence TORY election chiefs deliberately held fire during Westminster's pre-election skirmishes yesterday. With the visit of President Boris Yeltsin grabbing the television lights, set-piece press briefings or big speeches were suspended to allow Mr John Major another electorally priceless stroll on the international stage. Today, too, the prime minister can continue the show in New York, where his chairmanship of the United Nations Security Council will provide more statesmanlike film for the Conservative Central Office archive. Yet, rather than kicking its heels in frustration, Labour's leadership believes, with some justification, that the new round of US-Russian arms cutting has knocked impetus from the Tories' efforts to push defence on to the electoral agenda. Tories vow Britain's security will be a central issue in the election campaign but, for Labour, defence has become less of a headache than in the party's unilateralist past. Walworth Road officials claimed yesterday that in private polling the end of the Cold War has dropped the issue well below the top 10 of voters' concerns. Less than three weeks ago Tory campaign chiefs were hopefully pushing defence - traditionally a 'winning issue' for the Tories - as the 'follow up' to their attack on Labour's tax and spending plans. However, Mr Neil Kinnock's now famous remarks on phasing in rises in National Insurance contributions persuaded them temporarily to abandon the defence tack. 'The very fact that they were raising it (defence) was an indicator that they only have tax and spending, John Major and defence in their list of 'winning' issues,' a Labour official commented yesterday. To neutral ears, that arguments may have some resonance. Yet there is little doubt that defence is still a useful vehicle for Tories to play their 'strong leadership' card. Few have failed to miss that Mr Chris Patten, the Tory chairman, never fluffs an opportunity to compare Mr Neil Kinnock and his shadow foreign secretary, Mr Gerald Kaufman, as Britain's potential representatives abroad with Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the patrician foreign secretary. To that, the Tory election machine adds the equivocation of Labour on whether it will cancel a fourth Trident-bearing nuclear submarine and the opposition's reluctance to produce a comprehensive policy paper on defence issues. But if those are the Tory bull points, the rapid acceleration of the disarmament process seemed to put the Conservatives on the defensive. While nobody would suggest defence has become a winning issue for Labour, the pace of events has allowed Labour and Liberal Democrats to suggest Britain is dragging its feet. In carefully moderated language, Mr Kinnock took up the theme after his meeting with Mr Yeltsin yesterday. Taking care not to carp too loudly, he made clear that Britain should be participating fully in the disarmament process - a message similar to that his party espouses about the UK's 'failure' to participate fully in Europe. Liberal Democrats also urge that Britain should not buck the international trend towards fewer nuclear weapons. Labour, in particular, is targeting the government's determination to press ahead with plans to deploy 512 Trident warheads in place of the 192 now in service. As Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's defence spokesman, points out: 'It goes against the grain of everything that is happening internationally and sends a very bad signal to nuclear proliferators.' Labour, meanwhile, is holding its cards close to its chest. It remains unclear whether it would commission a fourth Trident submarine, deemed essential for credible deterrence by the Tories, saying it would need to look at the books when it takes power. The party argues that there is a clear case for not deploying all the new warheads ordered by the government. Mr Alan Clark, the defence procurement minister, has characterised this standpoint as the equivalent of running a Rolls-Royce with a Morris Minor engine. Mr Major also emphasised yesterday that, with Russia still holding 27,000 nukes, Britain's 500 would not amount to a fifteenth of those it faces in even a decade of cuts. Yet to some extent, ministers are now boxed in by their insistence that what is already planned is the absolute minimum necessary. Any cut in the number of Trident warheads - still not inconceivable, although impossible before an election - would be tacit acceptance of Labour and Liberal Democrat arguments. On cuts in conventional weapons, too, Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, is not invulnerable. His handling of the 'options for change' review was regarded even by some Tories as ill-thought-out. He was stung, too, by a leaked internal armed services report earlier this month which strongly criticised interference by ministers in the conduct of Britain's role in the Gulf campaign a year ago. None of that is going to make defence a key factor at the ballot box. But it does inhibit somewhat Conservative attempts to emphasise defence as a election issue. Between them Mr Major's friends - presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin - have significantly diminished the old Tory adage that defence is one of the best forms of attack.</p>

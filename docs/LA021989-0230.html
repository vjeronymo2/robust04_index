			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION WRESTLING;  </P> <P> EL DORADO HOLDS OFF CANYON TO WIN 4-A CHAMPIONSHIP  </P> <P> Canyon High School's Zach Cooper and El Dorado's Brian Tomazic met in the  191-pound final of the Southern Section 4-A championships at Edison High. Six  minutes later, each of them walked off the mat part winner, part loser.  </P> <P> By the time Cooper and Tomazic stepped on the mat, El Dorado held a 128-122  lead in the team standings. Only a pin by Cooper, ranked No. 1 in the state at  his weight, would give Canyon the necessary six points to tie El Dorado.  </P> <P> Cooper won the match, but he didn't pin Tomazic. Cooper was the individual  champion, but Tomazic clinched the title for his team. The final was El Dorado  128, Canyon 126.  </P> <P> Canyon, two-time defending 4-A champion, came into Saturday's finals ranked No.  1 in the division; El Dorado was No. 2.  </P> <P> "I'm happy and disappointed at the same time," Cooper said.  </P> <P> Cooper knew coming in that pinning Tomazic was "a longshot at best."  </P> <P> Tomazic comes from one of the most distinguished high school wrestling families  in Southern Section history. Brother Todd was a two-time state champion, who  made his name on being able to wriggle out of any hold. He was so good that he  was dubbed Gumby.  </P> <P> "Brian has the same style as Todd," Cooper said. "They're looking for you to  make mistakes. Every move I tried, he stopped me."  </P> <P> It was the third Southern Section team championship for El Dorado, who also had  Pat Kinney reach the finals at 126 pounds. Kinney lost to M.T. Merickel of  Channel Islands, 10-7.  </P> <P> "This one is especially sweet since we beat Canyon," said Frank Gonzales, El  Dorado coach.  </P> <P> In all, six of the top 10 teams were from Orange County, including the top  four. After El Dorado and Canyon came Esperanza (99 1/2) and Edison (94).  Katella (83) was sixth and San Clemente (80) was seventh.  </P> <P> Edison's David Niedringhaus defeated San Clemente's Jason Booth, 6-3, to win  the 105-pound title. Niedringhaus had a 4-1 lead going into the third period,  but Booth got a reverse to pull within 4-3. But Niedringhaus pulled off a  reverse of his own late in the period to pad his score.  </P> <P> Esperanza's Rob Langenwalter provided the final's best finish when he performed  an escape with a second left to beat San Clemente's Chris Wilyard, 5-4, in the  117-pound final. It was the second Southern Section championship for  Langenwalter.  </P> <P> Another two-time winner was Katella's Joe Pastorello, who beat Westlake's Bill  Hunter, 8-1, to win the 175-pound championship.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo's Nathan Kerley had the only pin in the finals when he put down  Esperanza's Dan Shaffer 5:46 into their 138-pound match.  </P> <P> Edison's Kenny Richards squeaked out a 3-2 victory over Westlake's Neil Mason  in the 145-pound final.  </P></p>

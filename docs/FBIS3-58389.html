			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner at </F> NATO headquarters in Brussels by Paul Burkhalter in the 3SAT  studio in Mainz on 11 January--recorded]    [Text] [Burkhalter] Mr. Woerner, Partnership for Peace is  the magic formula for the Central and East European states.  However, it does not give a timeframe, nor is there any talk  about security guarantees. I would say there is too little meat  on the bones.    [Woerner] On the contrary, Mr. Burkhalter. There is a lot  of meat on the bones -- concrete military and political  cooperation, to include consultations in crises. This means a  lot. It means that their security will also be strengthened  through such cooperation. But, of course, there are not yet  security guarantees. This does not mean, however, that we would  remain passive in case they were attacked.    [Burkhalter] Mr. Woerner, Russia plays a special role in  NATO's considerations. Reduced to a formula, I would say --  neither NATO together with Russia, nor NATO against Russia.  What is Russia to NATO?    [Woerner] Oh yes, Russia is a very important partner, with  whom we are seeking a special partnership, including a strategic  partnership. What we want is to build a greater Europe, a  Euro-Atlantic community with the Russians, so that they do not  have to feel excluded or even surrounded. What we are doing is  a great historic attempt to include them. However, we do not  allow anyone to dictate to us to whom we should extend the  alliance.    [Burkhalter] What exactly do you mean by include, Mr.  Woerner?    [Woerner] What we mean by this is that we will not only  build such a Europe with them, but we will also make decisions  following close consultations and discussions with them.    [Burkhalter] Polish President Lech Walesa demanded that NATO  should test Russia's credibility.    [Woerner] Well, this is his formulation; I would put it  differently. I would say we expect the Russians not only to  respect human rights at home but also their neighbors'  sovereignty. Such cooperative behavior, or -- to put it this  way -- such respect for the neighbors' sovereignty and their  intention not to pursue hegemonic objectives again, are  certainly prerequisites and preconditions for fruitful  cooperation with NATO.    [Burkhalter] But such conditions do not yet exist.    [Woerner] Well, some people there are using language we do  not like to hear. I hope they will moderate their language. By  the way -- the coarser the language in Moscow, the more they  will drive some Central and East European states into NATO's  arms.    [Burkhalter] A few words on NATO's stance on the Bosnian  conflict, Mr. Woerner. Some NATO members are audibly thinking  about air raids against Serbian positions, and the U.S. side has  said -- I quote -- that one is ready to consider attacks, if the  siege of Sarajevo and the situation justify this. Is this not a  slap in the face to the people who are being killed there in a  war that has lasted for two years now?    [Woerner] Do not forget that we depend on the United  Nations. We can only do what the United Nations has mandated us  to do, and we have carried out that mission swiftly and  efficiently. We have now offered to use our air power if  Sarajevo or other cities are strangulated, or if Srebenica is  blocked. But here, too, we depend on the approval of the United  Nations and on the opinion of the UNPROFOR troops in the former  Yugoslavia.    [Burkhalter] This means that NATO is now embarking on a  tougher course.    [Woerner] The current mood here and the much greater  determination among NATO members indicate at least that things  cannot continue. This is what I felt last night when I had a  very detailed talk over dinner with the heads of state and  chiefs of government. Let us hope that this determination is  followed by deeds. We would like to see the responsible people  take notice of these signals, so that we do not have to take  such measures.    [Burkhalter] Mr. Woerner, I thank you very much for this  interview.</p>

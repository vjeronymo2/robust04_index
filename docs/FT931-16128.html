			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Contrasting debt figure for Evode NEW information on Evode passed to Wassall, which is bidding Pounds 113.2m for the chemicals and plastics company, shows that Evode's net borrowings will average more than Pounds 40m during the four quarters of this year. This contrasts with the latest available information released by Evode earlier this month when it published its balance sheet for the financial year ended October 3 1992. Divestments and a 17 per cent reduction in working capital reduced Evode's net borrowings from Pounds 46.1m to Pounds 28.5m, giving gearing of 50 per cent. The group also generated cash of Pounds 26.2m (Pounds 16.4m). Wassall, the mini-conglomerate, received the details on Evode's borrowings because under the rules of the Takeover Code it is entitled to ask for any new information given to other potential bidders. Laporte, the UK's second biggest quoted chemicals group, is at an advanced stage of discussions with Evode about making a recommended bid and had already received the new information on Evode's debt. Mr David Winterbottom, Evode's chief executive, dismissed the new information about his company's borrowings.</p>

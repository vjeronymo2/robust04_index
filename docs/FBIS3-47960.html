It also said efforts to reduce inventories were making  little  progress.    Domestic shipments of videocassette recorders, refrigerators  and washing machines in January recorded year-on-year increases,  however.    In the nonmanufacturing sector, the value of lease contracts  continues to decrease and domestic freight transport business,  other than home delivery of parcels, remains slow, the EPA said.</p>

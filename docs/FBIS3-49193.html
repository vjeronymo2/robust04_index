			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 6 January carries in  its regular 35-minute newscast three reports on fighting in the  republic.    The studio announcer reads a report by the 1st Corps  information service and says that "the Chetniks unscrupulously  continue to shell the city and the defense lines. From their  well-known strongholds on the hills surrounding the city, they  are pounding Zuc and the Jewish Cemetery with shells of the  heaviest caliber. In the course of the day, the enemy infantry  attempted to break through our defense lines in the vicinity of  the Jewish Cemetery, but they met with the firm resistance of  the defenders and retreated to their initial positions. The  Chetniks have been observed bringing in reinforcements of  manpower and equipment to Grbavica, Lukavica, Nedzarici, and  Azici."    Olovo correspondent Velid Djindo reports that "the mortars  from (?Bijelis) and (?Silajici) have been joined by howitzers  from Kotakov Han, which at the time this report is being filed,  around 1408 [1308 GMT], [words indistinct] the defense lines  from Krusevo to Musici. In the last few days, the aggressor has  been hastily regrouping his forces on the Olovo and Vares  fronts. The concentration of enemy forces that began yesterday  continued today on the Ajdarovici-Krivajici route. The  offensive of the joint aggressors has entered its third month  with constant enemy long-range artillery activity against  civilian targets and our defenders' positions. The defense  lines are stable."    The studio announcer says that "some time after 1100 Galeb  enemy planes overflew the Tesanj, Teslic, Maglaj, and Doboj  regions, and shelled a part of the Doboj free territory." Doboj  correspondent Mirudin Aldobasic says that "owing to this, an air  alert was sounded, while all antiaircraft units in the 7-South  Operative Group zone of responsibility are on alert."</p>

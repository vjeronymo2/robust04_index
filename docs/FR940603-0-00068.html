			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenter was concerned that all proposed special management measures that could impose increased costs should be adequately evaluated to assure that resulting benefits justify those costs, and that measures are implemented in the most cost-effective manner. The commenter suggested that effective alternative protection methods with significantly less cost may exist, although it did not provide specific recommendations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This commenter has joined together with others to institute an education and information dissemination plan designed to protect the right whale. The commenter believed that this cooperative effort is the method most likely to be effective in protecting the right whale at reasonable cost in northern Florida and southern Georgia coastal waters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS does not expect any additional restrictions on use of the areas as a result of this designation. Therefore, direct economic impacts associated with this designation are expected to be minimal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS agrees that there may be alternative protection methods. The possibility of such alternatives, however, does not eliminate the need to designate critical habitat. These should be brought to the attention of the Southeast Implementation Team, which can review and evaluate them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 18:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter was concerned about the potential effects of this designation on beach nourishment projects done in conjunction with the ACOE. Currently the commenter and the ACOE are studying the feasibility of beach nourishment at several eroding areas of the Atlantic shoreline. The commenter continued that the potential window for beach nourishment projects has already been limited by the presence of essential nesting habitat for endangered and threatened species of sea turtle. The nesting seasons runs from May 1 through October 1 of each year, limiting the timeframe for nourishment projects to the winter months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another Federal agency stated that any hopper dredge restrictions implemented to avoid the December through March time period of right whale calving and presence in the area would be burdensome. The commenter encouraged working out a timeframe that would allow use of a hopper dredge and take into account the winter right whale calving season and the summer period of high abundance for Kemp's ridley turtle ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lepidochelys kempii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and manatee ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Trichechus manatus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in the Kings Bay area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS realizes that the present dredging period was scheduled to accommodate the presence of several species of sea turtles in these waters, and also recognizes the seasonal limits for beach nourishment projects. The present seasonal restriction on dredging is an essential management measure, given the increased densities of sea turtles in coastal waters during the warmer months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The designation of critical habitat for right whales will not affect the scheduling of this activity. NMFS does not intend to alter the present schedule through this designation, but rather will continue to require the present level of monitoring of dredging activities during winter months to reduce impacts to northern right whales. Over the years, there have been several very near misses of right whales with dredges that were avoided due, at least in part, to observer coverage on the dredges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 19:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several organizations and individuals had comments regarding commercial fishing restrictions. One commenter recommended seasonal restrictions on set-gillnet fisheries and multiple trap American lobster,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Homarus americanus,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> fisheries within known right whale habitat, and felt that fines and enforcement procedures for individuals violating this and other restrictions should be mandated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter recommended that NMFS expand the rule to include conservation measures to reduce the likelihood of right whales being struck by boats or becoming entangled in fishing gear. Specifically, the commenter recommended that NMFS prohibit the use of unattended drift and sink gillnets in all three areas being designated as critical habitat during the seasons that right whales are likely to occur in the area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter suggested that unattended use of gillnets should be prohibited from December 1 through March 31 (the time that northern right whales are in the area), but that commercial fishing need not be restricted on the winter grounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS also received several comments from individuals and organizations recommending against designating critical habitat because they believed it would lead to further restrictions of fishing activities. One such commenter asserted that the desigation may eventually result in the halting of recreational fishing outside Sebastian Inlet, FL, and for that reason was opposed to designating critical habitat. Another commenter felt that the designation of critical habitat would increase regulation of commercial fishing and for that reason opposed the designation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter stated that commercial fishermen throughout the SEUS support efforts to protect the northern right whale through participating in whale sighting programs, and by radioing positions of whales to other vessels to avoid collisions. Thus, the commenter felt declaring this area as critical habitat was not necessary to avoid collisions, and may unnecessarily affect fishermen as well as other commercial activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in the proposed critical habitat designation, the only direct impact of a critical habitat designation is through the provisions of section 7 of the ESA, which applies only to those actions authorized, funded or carried out by Federal agencies. This final critical habitat designation contains no land use or fishing regulations, and will not directly affect private activities. Even where there is Federal involvement, NMFS anticipates that this final critical habitat designation, by itself, will not restrict private activities in a manner or to an extent that these activities are not already affected as a result of the listing of this species as endangered. If, in the future, NMFS determines that restrictions on human activities are necessary to protect northern right whales or their habitat, such action would be preceded by an opportunity for public review and comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 20:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that pollutant discharges in CCB may represent a continuous source of degradation to essential habitats. Sewage discharges, dredging activities, dredge spoil disposal and non-point sources all contribute contaminants into this relatively shallow and extraordinarily productive environment. The commenter further stated that the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) is in the process of combining, upgrading and relocating its outfalls approximately 15km out into Massachusetts Bay, or roughly 40km to the north of the critical habitat boundary. The commenter felt that research should be continued and broadened to address all aspects of the species' biology, behavior and habitat requirements, as well as the specific sources of pollution that threaten to diminish the quality of the habitat for northern right whales. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter stated that in CCB there is a need to establish a water quality monitoring program that focuses on endangered species and incorporates sampling of critical parameters at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As previously stated, NMFS is coordinating the development of a Right Whale Recovery Plan Implementation Team that will address the possible impacts to right and humpback whales from activities in Massachusetts Bay that may affect CCB (see Comment 5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Big media buyer supports planned television mergers Carat, one of the UK's largest media-buying groups, yesterday backed mergers between television companies in spite of fears that any further concentration of advertising sales might be to the disadvantage of advertisers. The Office of Fair Trading has extended its scrutiny of Granada's Pounds 700m hostile bid for London Weekend Television to take in an examination of the implications of the bid for the advertising sales market. Mr Ray Kelly, chief executive of Carat (UK), said yesterday: 'If the television companies we have in the UK are going to be able to compete vigorously with media owners outside the UK then there is an absolute need for them to start doing what they're doing now, which is to merge.' Advertisers want to see the quality of programming maintained, said Mr Kelly. TV companies are 'only really going to be capable of continuing to do that if they're strong companies', he added. Carat's clients include Abbey National, Cadbury, and United Distillers. The OFT's move follows a submission from the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers that a fall in the number of TV advertising selling points might drive up prices. Granada's and LWT's sales houses, which both sell for other TV companies, account for more than 40 per cent of the ITV advertising market. Zenith, another large media buyer, last night said TV ownership and sales-house arrangements were distinct. Ms Christine Walker, Zenith chief executive, said: 'A stronger ITV financially is a better ITV for the advertisers.' She added, however, that advertisers would be 'justifiably concerned' if advertising were concentrated.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Working Life: Binoculars: one man's view - Style It is hard to get by at Epsom, Ascot or a Test match without them. But binoculars are a bit like fire extinguishers - you only use them rarely and then in something of a hurry. And like fire extinguishers if they don't work immediately you won't get a second chance to deal with the matter in hand - whether it's picking out your horse, glimpsing a migratory Redwing, or identifying a yacht off Cowes. So binoculars must be sensible and easy to use. This automatically rules out some of the smaller pocket binoculars, made by Nikkon or Pentax and available in many high street shops; however cute and stylish they look they're too fiddly to adjust and too uncomfortable to hold for any length of time. This also goes for the Zeiss ladies binoculars, which look terrific but are awkward to use and cost over Pounds 300 (Zeiss' larger offerings are handier but come in at over Pounds 700). At the opposite end of the scale there is the Russian-made Helios range at less then Pounds 50 for an honest pair of binoculars. These are cheap but they're not the best optically and they're distinctly old-fashioned in use. The serious binocular user will probably go for something like a Viking or a Bresser - both of which despite their names are essentially Japanese. And this is the important part - provided that the optical equipment inside your binoculars is Japanese there's little difference in image quality between most makers, only one of price and usability. The Viking Firefly for instance, is a compact ladies binocular offering 10x magnification, a 24mm lens, anti-glare coating and a moulded grip. It is easy to use and highly effective. The larger Viking model, with 10x magnification but a 42mm lens (for a bigger, brighter view) costs around Pounds 200. It fits the palm nicely and can be adjusted for focus and eye postion almost without thinking. Bresser binoculars are of German design but Japanese manufacture. Its 7x50 Action model is tough and workmanlike at Pounds 128; while the heavy traditional 12x50 Corvette design costs Pounds 244 and will give a fine image, but at the expense of a little more shake. Indeed, a magnification of anything over 12x is likely to be unhelpful, since the bigger the magnification the more shake is transmitted. Officials at Cowes use vast binoculars with 20x magnification but they have to rest them on tripods to keep them still. Zoom binoculars offering variable magnification from 8x to 20x are fun, but (quite apart from shake) the extra lenses inside reduce image quality and the size of the field of view. Whatever you choose make sure you give it a reasonable trial first. Look for any curvature of straight lines in the field of view; and watch for imperfect colour correction - do whites come out yellow or bluish rather than white? You'll need a decent photographic shop or optical equipment specialist if you want to do it properly. Somewhere like Broadhurst, Clarkson and Fuller in Farringdon Road, London, is a good bet.</p>

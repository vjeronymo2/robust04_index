			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: 20% rise at Micro Focus ends growth speculation MICRO FOCUS, the computer software company, yesterday put an end to speculation which has dampened its shares in recent months with results showing a 20 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.63m to Pounds 11.6m for the six months to July 31. The growth, on sales up 33 per cent to Pounds 40.8m (Pounds 30.6m), of which more than half were in the US, was due to a weaker pound. In dollar terms pre-tax profits fell from Dollars 17.6m to Dollars 17.4m. The shares rose 8p to close at Pounds 18.23. Mr Paul O'Grady, chairman and, as of yesterday, chief executive, rejected as unfounded the recent speculation over a permanent halt in earnings growth. Analysts had misinterpreted signals over difficulties in the first quarter, he said. Micro Focus had suffered production support problems which had been sorted out in the second three months. 'I think we have turned the corner,' Mr O'Grady said. 'It was much better in the second quarter.' Net income per share was steady at 80 cents, which Mr O'Grady said had been well flagged in advance as a temporary consolidation. 'Our feeling is that the growth is there and we will give it a really good shot to make it happen in the second half,' he said. In sterling terms earnings per share were 55.3p (45.9p). As in previous years, and according to US practice, there is no dividend. Cash reserves were Pounds 53.3m at the end of the period, similar to last year. Spending on research and development increased Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 7.4m. COMMENT Fears over a halt in earnings growth at Micro Focus appear to have been over-hyped. Indications are that trading growth in the second quarter was substantially better than the first three months. However, the group still has to prove that it has fully recovered from the early hiccough. Perhaps this lies behind Mr O'Grady's decision to take to the road as chief executive and drive the sales growth himself. The numbers this time were disappointing enough to pull forecasts back from roughly Pounds 31m to Pounds 27m. On a prospective p/e of 14.5, the shares already seem to be carrying most of the bad news.</p>

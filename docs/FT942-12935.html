			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Edinburgh Investment Trust exceeds targets Edinburgh Investment Trust increased net assets per share by 14 per cent from 300.8p to 342.1p in the 12 months to March 31, its highest ever year end level. The increase fulfilled the trust's objective of beating the FT-SE-A All-Share index, which rose by 10.9 per cent over the period. It also achieved its aim of dividend growth above the UK inflation rate, having recommended a final of 5.8p which makes a total for the year of 8.75p (8.4p), a rise of 4.2 per cent. EIT, managed by Dunedin Fund Managers, reported net revenue for the year of Pounds 30m (Pounds 27.2m) for earnings per share up 10 per cent to 10.17p (9.25p). The figures benefited both from growth in investments and from enhanced scrip dividends, which added 0.54p to earnings. EIT said these dividends, which many companies paid last year for tax reasons, were often worth 50 per cent more than the cash distributions, but did not expect them to be repeated. The company borrowed Pounds 100m in 1992 to invest in gilts but took capital gains on its portfolio when gilt yields fell and in early 1994 transferred Pounds 50m into equities. EIT warned that the lower yields on equities, compared with gilts, and the expectation of fewer enhanced scrip dividends in the current year was likely to lead to a decline in earnings. It added, however, that this would not impair its ability to meet its dividend growth objective because of the strength of the revenue reserve which had risen to 7.31p per share at the year end. The company saw attractive prospects for capital and dividend growth in the UK, where 87 cent of its equities are invested. The rest of its investments are in North America with 3.7 per cent, Europe, 4.3 per cent, Japan, 4.2 per cent and the Pacific Basin (excluding Japan), 1 per cent.</p>

			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Riding a chariot of fire on the screen: Film maker David Puttnam wants a more dynamic and businesslike approach Mr David Puttnam, producer of such influential European-made films as Chariots of Fire, The Killing Fields and The Mission has, he believes, entered his 'fifth age' as a film maker. It is an age in which he is more likely to fly to Brussels to lobby members of the European Commission on the future employment potential of the audio-visual industry than to see one of his films in the making. With as much passion as he ever put into his films, Mr Puttnam has been trying to persuade the Commission, which last week published its discussion document (green paper) on the audio-visual industries, that no other industry offers such potential and that the need for action is urgent. On the present state of the economic battle between the European and the US industries, Mr Puttnam says: 'It's like going into the home-made lemonade business and wondering why you are not adequately competing with Coca-Cola.' An earlier Commission white paper on competitiveness and employment, he emphasises, identified only three areas which could create large numbers of new jobs for Europe - biotechnology, energy related to the environment and the audio-visual industry. But of these only the last offered, high employment potential, high economic generative potential, and cultural and informational influence. As US feature films continue to dominate at the European box office, Mr Puttnam says simply: 'Either you get into it (the audio-visual business) in a serious way or take your ball home and find another place to play.' In his 'fifth age', Mr Puttnam has divided his time between making films and other activities - seven years as president of the Campaign for the Preservation of Rural England, chairman of the National Film and Television School, professor of film at Bristol University training young European film producers under the Ace programme and trying to persuade Brussels that the time to intervene is now. 'I'm happy to say no one has noticed,' says Mr Puttnam of the fact that he is no longer a full-time film maker. His 'first age' in the profession was spent working in the advertising industry, followed by a period of juvenalia including rock music films. Then came the burst of frenetic energy that produced 10 films including the ones that made him famous and won Oscars. It was followed by the disastrous time from 1986 to 1988 as chairman and chief executive of Columbia Pictures, although it was a decision he does not regret. Hollywood was something he needed to get out of his system. But now Mr Puttnam is trying to find ways of doing something about a European audio-visual industry that he believes is hopelessly fragmented and often equally hopelessly whimsical. His ideas do not all involve intervention in the marketplace and the application of large sums of money. Mr Puttnam was a member of a European Think Tank of producers and directors that fed its ideas into the Commission green paper. They put forward three main proposals: The first was the creation of two or three significant European-wide film and television distribution organisations appointed by competitive tender. They would be capitalised at around Dollars 1bn each and have access to soft loans. The second envisages a levy on the entire audio-visual industry to fund new production. Mr Puttnam insists that the term 'audio-visual' is the correct one because it is one industry. The scale of the levy would be up to each European Union member country to decide. The third proposal is, he believes, the most important of all and involves a fundamental change of attitude in Europe rather than money. It is a move away from a supply-led industry to a demand-led industry. 'The first question you have to ask is: Who is the audience for this picture? It is the last question everyone asks in Europe,' says Mr Puttnam, who believes the European industry has been sidetracked by the conceit that cinema is 'different' without realising that the difference equalled a niche market. 'You create a generation of film and television makers who understand the marketplace,' Mr Puttnam says of the task ahead. He tells of a friend, a Hollywood marketing director who has four staff permanently dumping every piece of available information on every potential competing film on a computer on his desk. By comparison, he believes, the state of research in Europe is 'lamentable'. While it may be a daunting task to compete head-on with Hollywood, he believes the American industry can be outflanked and, anyway, there is also the hugh potential of the educational sector. He finds nowhere in the UK government either a sense of urgency or a sense of the scale of the issues involved. In Brussels, the audio-visual green paper followed the normal process - after a year's work it identified questions rather than options. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, Mr Puttnam warns that Sony has been putting up a new building to house interactive computer programming to try to dominate the emerging multimedia industry. For the European industry Mr Puttnam believes 'the next five years could be extraordinary or just a crushing defeat'.</p>

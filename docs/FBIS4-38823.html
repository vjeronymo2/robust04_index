			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Nikolay Geronin and </F> Vladimir Solntsev]    [Text] Moscow, 2 Jun -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin and  ROK President Kim Yong-sam "call upon the DPRK, as a signatory  of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to strictly and  consistently fulfil its commitments" under that document, and  with regard to inspections under the verification agreement with  the IAEA. This is stated in a Joint Russo-Korean declaration,  which the leaders of the two countries signed at the end of  today's summit talks in the Kremlin.    Boris Yeltsin, the declaration says, "confirms that Russia,  alongside other states, will in future also take an active part  in the efforts of the international community to ensure the  denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."    President Kim Yong-sam, the document points out, "highly  appraises Russia's proposal on convening a multilateral  conference on security and the nuclear-free status of the Korean  Peninsula."    The two leaders agree that "any attempt to manufacture  nuclear weaponry on the Korean Peninsula poses a serious threat  to peace and security, not only in Korea, but also in Northeast  Asia and throughout the world."</p>

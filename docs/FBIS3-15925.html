But when Aleksandr  Lifshits, head of the Russian Federation president's group of  experts, says that he fears to look into a future where the  actual use of depreciation deductions, which are essential to  compensate for wear and tear, will be 10 percent as against 90  percent for consumption, you begin to look at the situation in a  rather different way.    In simple terms, what we are saying is that we can say  goodbye to industrial development, to high-technology  production, and to reproduction in general unless, in the very  near future (according to Lifshits), the government proposes  measures to beat the crisis. The Russian Federation president's  expert believes that one effective method in this case might be  a slight relaxation of the procedure of regulation on the part  of the state. What he said was literally as follows: "We are  exchanging the absence of money for the presence of economic  freedom." That is, the enterprising must be given the  opportunity to fight for their own survival to maximum effect.  At least, we must not get in their way.    In the meantime, while producing little, we are wearing out  clothes that we did not make, we are finishing off a machine  tool pool that dates back to the five-year plans, and we are in  no hurry to work for the future, concentrating, as we are,  entirely on the present. Will we be able to curb the rate of  price increases in these circumstances? Aleksandr Lifshits  pointed out that the government's August program guidelines for  the rate of price increases by December 1994 were set at 3-5.  But, according to the expert's estimates, these indicators may  leap to 10-12. As a result many of the processes that are  destroying our economy would become simply irreversible.    According to Lifshits, unless the government goes for  fundamental measures the State Duma is bound to decide to do so.  He was not optimistic about the fate of the state budget -- the  figures laid down in it may not hold out for more than three or  four months. And then further adjustment will be needed.</p>

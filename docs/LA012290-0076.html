			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> HOTEL MARKS SIX DECADES OF HISTORY  </P> <P> Humphrey Bogart, Errol Flynn and Charles A. Lindbergh are among the luminaries  who dined and drank there while gazing at picture-perfect ocean sunsets. The  guest book bears the signatures of Myrna Loy, Faye Wray and Prince Theodore of  Russia.  </P> <P> The Hotel Laguna, the city's most significant historical landmark, celebrates  its 60th anniversary this year. The distinctive, Spanish-style building has  enjoyed a colorful past that has been documented by its current owners, Claes  and Georgia Andersen.  </P> <P> "A lot of things have happened here," said Claes Andersen. "If only the walls  could talk."  </P> <P> Andersen, 43, came to America from Denmark in 1969. His plans were to ski and  work as a chef for six months. Instead, he stayed and ended up buying the Hotel  Laguna in 1985. Since then, the Andersens have researched the history of the  68-room hotel, which dates back more than 100 years to when the first inn  opened in Laguna Beach. At that time, the city was an isolated seaside resort  with a year-round population of fewer than a dozen people.  </P> <P> Historical records differ on exact dates, but according to the Andersens, Henry  Goff built the first hotel on the site at 425 S. Coast Highway in 1888. The  inn, then called Alpha Hotel, was expanded when Goff moved another building to  the property. But in the early 1890s, an economic depression led to collapse of  the travel boom and land values plummeted. The hotel was sold and deserted by  all but squirrels, rats and polecats for a couple of years, the Andersens said.  </P> <P> In 1895, Joseph Yoch purchased the hotel's mortgage for $600 and reopened what  was then a 14-bedroom inn. Two years later, he expanded by combining his hotel  with the Arch Beach Hotel, a deserted structure that he moved from Diamond  Street in South Laguna.  </P> <P> The 30-room "New Hotel Laguna," now the largest building in town, was the  center of community life and a popular "Gay '90s" resort where guests such as  Madame Modjeska and "life-of-the-party" James Irvine walked the halls, the  Andersens said.  </P> <P> By the 1920s, Laguna Beach was an established art colony and growing rapidly.  In the midst of a building boom, the hotel, which had changed hands several  times, was condemned as a fire hazard and razed.  </P> <P> Today's Hotel Laguna, a white Early California Mission-style three-story  building with Spanish arches and bell tower, opened in 1930. But the hotel  struggled until new owners Lloyd and Gerta Seilset began a promotional campaign  aimed at attracting guests from the motion picture industry.  </P> <P> "The price of lodging was so low compared to other film locations and the  Laguna terrain was so varied and adaptable to movie-making, that the film  makers arrived in droves and the hotel was in the black again in no time," said  a city report.  </P> <P> From then through the 1950s, famous people such as Lauren Bacall, John  Barrymore, Joan Fontaine and Rosalind Russell patronized the hotel's Pier Nine  Bar.  </P> <P> "It was the center of town," said Andersen. "All the civic organizations met  here, and a lot of people stopped on their way from Los Angeles to the Del Mar  race track. It was the in place for movie people."  </P> <P> Today, the hotel with its old photograph-lined halls and panoramic views caters  to local sunset worshipers, corporate meetings, weddings and summer tourists.  </P> <P> "Some people were upset that we wanted to remodel," Andersen said of the  $2.5-million renovation that has taken place since 1985. "But we had no  intention of making a modern hotel. We went through all the historical records  before we made any plans." LESLIE HERZOG  </P></p>

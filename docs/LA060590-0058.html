			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> TRAILER PARK, CITY REACH RENT ACCORD  </P> <P> The city has reached an agreement with the owners of the Ventura Marina Mobile  Home Park, ending a lengthy court battle over the park's right to raise rents  above the limits imposed by the city's mobile home rent control ordinance.  </P> <P> The Ventura City Council voted 5 to 2 on Monday to uphold an agreement reached  last week between the city and the Peterson Family Trust, which operates the  park.  </P> <P> "We have preserved the ordinance, and that was the ultimate goal," said Mayor  Richard Francis, who voted with the majority. "Had we pursued the issue in  court I think it's very likely we would have lost."  </P> <P> The 1981 ordinance had restricted rent increases to the rise in housing  maintenance costs plus a portion of the annual increase in the consumer price  index. But under the agreement, the city will allow the mobile home park's  owners to raise rents by $36 over the next three years, starting in 1991, and  to increase rents by up to $35 each time a new family moves in.  </P> <P> In exchange, the Petersons have agreed to drop two lawsuits filed last year  challenging the city's rent control ordinance. They also will waive damages for  any injuries suffered as a result of the rent control ordinance.  </P> <P> City Atty. Peter D. Bulens said the city decided to seek a negotiated  settlement with Ventura Marina after a recent string of court decisions  nullified mobile home rent control ordinances in California and elsewhere in  the United States.  </P> <P> Council members John McWherter and Jim Monahan opposed the agreement. "We're  caving into pressures from attorneys," Monahan said. "Let our ordinance have  its day in court."  </P></p>

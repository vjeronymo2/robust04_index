			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Ermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- "The strengthening of mutual  understanding between the Russian Federation and Tatarstan, upon  which we were relying, was accomplished", according to Tatarstan  President Mintimer Shaymiyev, now in Moscow in his position as  delegate to the Federation Council.    Responding to an ITAR-TASS question about his main  conclusions after Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to his  republic, Shaymiyev said that, after the signing of the  bilateral treaty between the center and Tatarstan, "peace and  accord have settled in the republic. And it is very important  that Boris Nikolayevich (Yeltsin) saw the support for that act  on peoples' faces".    The creation of a bilateral commission headed by the  Tatarstan leader and Russia's first vice-premier allows the two  sides to monitor the fulfillment of the treaty's 12 articles,  Shaymiyev said. He continued on to say that the document makes  it possible to "develop a conception for the decentralization of  the federal economy, using the example of Tatarstan, and to  remove the petty tutelage of the centre".    Time has shown that "Tatarstan's economic course, which  differs somewhat from the federal one, has justified itself",  the republican president noted. The best indicator of that is  that "the population has not been impoverished".    "The republic's position in the fight against crime has also  been recognized", Shaymiyev said, explaining that his republic's  law enforcement bodies are "in control of the situation and have  overcome their fear of the underworld".</p>

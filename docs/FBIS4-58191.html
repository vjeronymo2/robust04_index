			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, secretary general of  the Arab League, yesterday evening held a news conference in  Tripoli, in which he expressed his happiness at visiting the  Great Jamahiriyah and his meeting with the brother leader of the  revolution. He underlined the positive results achieved by this  visit. [passage omitted]    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that his visit to the Great  Jamahiriyah had dealt with the so-called Lockerbie case and the  recent development that occurred at the meeting of the Arab  League council, at the level of Arab foreign ministers in Cairo.  He said: At the council we achieved a unanimous Arab decision  that the Arab League should put forward an initiative, with the  accord of member-states, for finding a peaceful settlement of  this artificial case. He pointed out that the idea of a trial  at the International Court of Justice in The Hague had won the  support of the Arab countries. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that  bringing the suspects before a neutral side accords with the  requirements of justice and with the discovery of the truth. He  said further: I have informed the U.S., Britain, and France of  this decision agreed upon by the Arab League, and I have also  informed the secretary general of the United Nations and the  chairman of the Security Council in March.    He stressed that there was nothing there to justify a  rejection by the Western states of this proposal, and he  underlined in this respect that the position of the Great  Jamahiriyah was founded on legitimacy and a sound legal basis  and that we must stick to it, insist on it, and call for its  implementation. He made clear that this issue was exhaustively  discussed, and that when he returned to Cairo he would make  moves in this respect. He said: We will carry on our moves  together with our eagerness at the same time to stress the  legitimate nature of the Libyan position and its tallying with  international law, because the Great Jamahiriyah had tackled  this crisis with the appropriate legal means.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid also said: Right is on our side and we  must stick to it, insist on it and discuss it, and the coming  stage will witness a coordination in order to explain the Arab  viewpoint on this position, which has become an all-Arab  position and not just that of the Great Jamahiriyah.    Concerning the possibility of the Arab states abandoning the  unjust measures imposed on the Great Jamahiriyah, particularly  now that much evidence has emerged that proved that the Great  Jamahiriyah was innocent of this accusation, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid  said: The Arab countries have the power of decision in what they  do, and he stressed that the decision taken by the recent  meetings of the Arab League council to back and support the Arab  Libyan position was now an all-Arab position that must be also  taken into account by the Western sides. The secretary general  reiterated the rejection by the Arab League of the unjust  resolutions, and he underlined that the so-called Security  Council had double-standards. He said: I have said frankly  that we did not accept this style and this situation. He said:  We will strive for a debate on this matter, and we will try all  possibilities to refute the position of the West in this  respect, and we will strive to clarify the issue to a number of  the Security Council member states. This will be done in the  coming weeks, he said. [passage omitted]</p>

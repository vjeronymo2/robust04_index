			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pelts: "Army Carries Out Its Tasks </F> Despite All the Difficulties and Problems"]    [Text] Yesterday Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian  defense minister, held a routine press hour for Russian and  foreign journalists. According to established tradition, at the  start of the discussion he briefed journalists on what has  happened in the Russian Armed Forces since their last meeting.  We would remind you that this took place late in December 1993.    First, the defense minister stressed that the process of  reform is continuing in the troops in accordance with the plans  and tasks set out in the president's Message to the Federal  Assembly. There have been systematic moves to improve the  system of command and control, create new groupings of troops  and mobile forces, improve the system of Army and Navy staffing,  and equip them with the requisite hardware and arms. The  defense minister singled out a few of the most important areas  of Armed Forces reform. Primarily, he stressed, the system of  military legislation has continued to be fine-tuned. The  Defense Ministry has already prepared over 20 draft laws.  Drafts of new laws -- "On Martial Law" and "On the Military  Militia" -- are also being formulated.    Other measures to reform the Armed Forces have gone strictly  according to plan. The problem of reducing the numerical  strength of troops and forces remains an important one. The  defense minister emphasized that it has been decided following  comprehensive analysis to propose that the strength of the Armed  Forces be ratified at 1.9 million men. It is thought that the  lower figure proposed previously is simply inadmissible.    At the beginning of the year it had also proved possible to  overcome the negative tendency with regard to nonfulfillment of  the draft plan. To date 88 percent of draftees (of the current  plan) are already performing their constitutional duty in the  Army and Navy. Toward the end of March it is intended to raise  the draft level to 95 percent.    A considerable improvement has also been recorded in the  state of troop discipline. Compared with 1993 the total number  of crimes and violations has dropped by one-fourth. There have  been 22 percent fewer cases of irregular relationships and 20  percent fewer cases of draft dodging. On the whole, the defense  minister stressed, the nature of offenses within the Army and  Navy reflects the situation in society.    The defense minister voiced the greatest concern in  connection with the problem of shaping the military budget and  funding the Armed Forces. According to him, if the adverse  trends continue and radical, determined measures are not taken  in the near future, it will be impossible to speak not just  about further reform of the Army, but even about the security of  Russia generally. To date the Finance Ministry is providing  less than 50 percent of the required funding to meet the needs  and ensure the normal functioning of the Army and Navy.  Naturally, that situation cannot suit us. The defense minister  underlined the fact that he would continue to try to obtain the  necessary budget for the Armed Forces. He did point out that  even in these conditions potential does exist for obtaining  additional funding for the troops. This potential primarily  arises from the Defense Ministry's right to set its own targets  and sell combat hardware itself and from its ability to sell  surplus military property to the national economy, cut the order  to the military-industrial complex, and also further reduce the  Armed Forces. Naturally the fact that this plan exists does not  mean that reform of the Army and Navy will occur in precisely  these areas. We will not permit a wholesale reduction in the  Army, the minister stressed, especially since that does not  benefit the state as a whole. The defense minister went on to  emphasize that the military budget under discussion will still  have an explicit social thrust. The intention is to spend over  50 percent of all budget funds, which the Defense Ministry is  allocated on social protection for servicemen.    During the press conference Defense Minister Pavel Grachev  answered numerous questions about problems of military  cooperation with countries both near and far. In particular, he  pointed out good prospects for cooperation with France, the  United States, and the FRG, as well as with Belarus, Uzbekistan,  Tajikistan, Turkmenia, and other Commonwealth countries.  Commenting on recent events in the Black Sea Fleet, Pavel  Grachev stressed that the current problems should not affect the  unconditional fulfillment of the Massandra agreements and that  he is hoping to cooperate closely with the Ukrainian defense  minister despite certain difficulties.    As at previous meetings with journalists, there was no  avoiding questions with a political slant. In particular, the  defense minister was asked whether his current presence in  Moscow was due to the need for a "strong hand" in the capital.  Pavel Grachev forthrightly rejected the political slant to the  question and stressed that the Army is engaged in performing its  tasks.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Abtrust raising Pounds 50m ABTRUST Fund Managers is attempting to raise Pounds 50m to invest in emerging markets in the Far East, Asia, Europe and Latin America in a new investment trust. Abtrust has received undertakings to subscribe for Pounds 27.5m from institutions and financial intermediaries. The initial net asset value will be between 95.5 and 96 per cent of the gross proceeds of the offer because of start-up costs. The new trust has a simple capital structure and offers a minimum investment of 2,000 ordinary shares at 100p each. For every five shares subscribed one warrant with a life of 15 years will be issued. The warrant gives its owner the right to subscribe for one ordinary share at 100p in any one of the years from 1995 to 2008. The offer opened yesterday and closes on October 27. Dealings are expected to begin on November 4.</p>

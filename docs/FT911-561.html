			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Battle over Nissan car sales moves to court NISSAN UK, the privately owned distributor of Nissan vehicles in Britain, will seek an injunction on Monday to stop Nissan Motor of Japan from terminating its exclusive distribution agreement. The long-running public battle between Nissan UK (NUK) and Nissan Motor moves to the High Court for the first time on Monday with Nissan UK also seeking substantial damages from the Japanese car maker. It is seeking a court order to prevent Nissan Motor from selling its vehicles in the UK to any company other than NUK. At the end of March Nissan Motor announced that it had established a new company, Nissan Motor (GB), to distribute all Nissan products in the UK from January 1 1992. If Nissan UK gains the injunction, Nissan Motor will be prevented from selling its vehicles to this new wholly owned subsidiary, which plans to run a new dealer network replacing Nissan UK's 380-strong chain. Nissan Motor wants the dispute to be arbitrated in Japan.</p>

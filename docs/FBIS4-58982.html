			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- Reliable Algerian sources  confirmed to AL-HAYAH yesterday that the large-scale military  changes announced by President Major General Liamine Zeroual  fall within the framework of bolstering the march to be staged  on Sunday in support of dialogue. The sources said that most of  the generals appointed in zone commands and the General Staff  "are advocates of dialogue, or at least, have adopted no  positions on it." The sources stressed that these generals are  loyal to Maj. Gen. Zeroual, who is also the defense minister.  [passage omitted]    The sources said that these changes means the beginning of  President Zeroual's real rule. The march to be staged on Sunday  will grant him a popular legitimacy he still lacks. The sources  pointed out that the replacement of Gen. Abdelhamid Djaouadi,  commander of the 5th zone (Constantine), confirms the decision  to reduce the powers of those advocating "all-out  confrontation." However, other sources said that his dismissal  is part of the decision to punish those who were accused of  negligence in connection with the great escape from Tazoult  prison, which involved over 900 prisoners.    The sources stress that these changes are a prelude to  further changes in the next stage.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Epsep suspends two year-old contract with Soviet Union THE Peruvian state fisheries company Epsep has decided to suspend a two year-old fishing contract with the Soviet Union, Sally Bowen writes. Epsep intends to sue for the Dollars 18m (Pounds 10.60m)it claims the Soviets owe. A delegation from the Soviet state fishing company Svibra is in Lima for talks but Mr Felix Canal Torres, Fisheries Minister, said in a televised interview: 'They seem not to have the slightest intention to recognise their debt.' The treaty with the Soviets came into force in January 1989. It permits 13 Soviet factory ships to fish outside Peru's 30-mile limit, turning over 17.5 per cent of the 400,000 ton quota to Peru. Mr Canal said there were several grounds for claiming breach of contract. The Soviets had delivered only about half the agreed catch, they failed to employ Peruvians as crew, the quality of fish landed was unacceptable and the Soviets had refused to supply invoices showing quantities of fish sold abroad on Peru's behalf. The final decision on the fishing treaty will lie with President Alberto Fujimori.</p>

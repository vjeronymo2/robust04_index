			<p>BFN     [Text] Cotonou, 26 May (AFP) -- Bertin Kangni Foli, an  exiled Togolese opposition activist suspected of having led the  holdup attempt on an armored bank vehicle in Lome on 13 May,  died in a Cotonou hospital on 20 May, morgue officials disclosed  today.    He was formerly a journalist but left Togo in September  1992.  He is said to be a close ally of Gilchrist Olympio, the radical  Togolese opposition leader in exile.    On 25 May, the Togolese Government accused him of having  masterminded the 13 May holdup on an armored Central Bank of  West African States van. The assailants fled, unable to lay  their hands on the 10 billion CFA francs the van was carrying.  A police officer was killed during the holdup, and, according  to Togolese authorities, Mr. Foli was wounded.    A source at the Cotonou hospital told AFP Mr. Foli was  admitted on the night of 13 May following "a road accident" but  died a week later. The source did not state the nature of Mr.  Foli's wounds. According to reports from other hospital  sources, Mr. Foli had previously gone to a private clinic to be  treated for "gunshot wounds" and registered under a fake name,  but due to the seriousness of his condition, he was transferred  to the hospital.    Some Togolese people claiming to be Mr. Foli's relatives  this  morning transferred the body from the Cotonou hospital to a  private morgue while awaiting burial.    They said their "relative" was a victim of an "attack" in  Lome on 13 May but managed to flee to Benin.</p>

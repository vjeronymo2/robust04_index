			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIRLINES;  </P> <P> UAL EXPLORES SELLING UNIONS 75% OF UNITED  </P> <P> The board of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, directed its advisers on  Thursday to explore the possible sale of a 75% stake in the company to unions  representing the airline's pilots, flight attendants and machinists. But it  also invited other acquisition offers -- including that of former suitor Marvin  Davis of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The board, under pressure to boost UAL's stock price, instructed its legal and  financial advisers to study a possible recapitalization of the company as well.  </P> <P> In a surprise move, the board cleared the way for a new bid by billionaire  investor Davis by freeing him from an agreement that required a minimum offer  of $300 a share. But such a bid appeared unlikely. A spokesman for the real  estate and oil magnate said Davis neither sought release from the agreement nor  was working on a bid.  </P> <P> Davis had triggered UAL's takeover turmoil with a failed $240-per-share offer  last August.  </P> <P> The board also released British Airways from a similar agreement, but the  airline said it is no longer interested.  </P> <P> The board faces pressure from the New York money-management firm of Coniston  Partners to raise the value of UAL shares. Coniston owns 11.8% of UAL's stock  and has threatened to oust the board unless it acts. The union proposal is  likely to appease Coniston, at least for now, because the firm favors an  employee transaction and has said it would help finance such a deal.  </P> <P> UAL's board said it would review all offers, including the union proposal, at  its next meeting on Feb. 22. It added that it may not receive an acceptable  offer.  </P> <P> The board also indicated that the current union proposal is too sketchy to  constitute an acquisition offer. Indeed, the union proposal is far from  complete and doesn't address significant details. For example, the unions have  not decided how much to pay for UAL, or what form the offer would take.  </P> <P> Stock traders on Thursday speculated that the unions would offer a combination  of cash and securities worth between $200 and $225 a share. They said a  recapitalization without union ownership would probably be worth $190 a share.  </P> <P> UAL common stock fell $3 to $158.50 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange  on Thursday. Traders were disappointed at the airline's dismal fourth-quarter  earnings and unhappy that the takeover drama remains unresolved.  </P> <P> Conspicuously missing from the union proposal is a role for UAL Chairman  Stephen M. Wolf, a proponent of employee ownership who led a failed employee  bid for the airline last fall. Wolf removed himself from buyout negotiations  shortly before Christmas, turning discussions over to UAL's legal advisers, and  hasn't met with the unions since.  </P> <P> Wolf's credibility with employees suffered after the $300-per-share  pilot-management bid collapsed last October, triggering a one-day stock market  mini-crash. Wolf and John C. Pope, UAL's chief financial officer, were  criticized for discouraging lenders from financing the deal by offering skimpy  profits.  </P> <P> Wolf also came under fire when it was revealed that he stood to make $76  million from his stock and options if the transaction succeeded.  </P> <P> People familiar with the situation said it it still possible that Wolf will  join the proposed union-led transaction, but union leaders have privately  discussed possible replacements for him should he choose not to participate and  resign.  </P> <P> Wolf was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Airline stock analysts said the union proposal might be difficult to finance,  despite the fact that the unions are willing to invest about 13% of UAL's  payroll, or $2 billion over five years, mostly in the form of wage concessions.  The unions haven't yet held discussions with lenders.  </P> <P> Mark E. Daugherty of Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, said lenders have grown  increasingly jittery about leveraged deals, especially since the collapse of  Campeau Corp.'s retail empire. In addition, he said, UAL, along with the rest  of the airline industry, is experiencing rising costs and softening passenger  traffic.  </P> <P> "It's a hostile environment all around," Daugherty said.  </P> <P> UAL also reported that fourth-quarter earnings dropped 67% to $6.8 million due  to rising fuel cost and expenses related to last October's failed takeover. On  an operating basis, the fourth quarter was a disaster, with UAL recording a  $31.3-million loss, contrasted with a $122.8-million profit in 1988.  </P> <P> For all of 1989, it said, earnings fell 14% to $324.3 million, excluding a gain  in 1988 from the sale of partnerships in its Covia computer reservation system.  Fourth-quarter revenue rose 9% to $2.4 billion, increasing the year's total to  $9.8 billion, an 8% rise.  </P></p>

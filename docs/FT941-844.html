			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Wall Street's list of woes grows longer - New York While a second rise in short-term interest rates was never an appealing prospect for Wall Street, there was a certain comfort to be drawn from the predictability of the Federal Reserve last week. Unfortunately, the Fed's seemingly inevitable move, which came as expected on Tuesday, failed to dispel the uncertainty which has depressed share prices since monetary policy began to shift in early February. Indeed, the sources of the market's unease seem to have multiplied. Mexico's political stability, President Clinton's political standing, tensions with North Korea and higher commercial lending rates are now competing with rising bond yields to top the list of Wall Street's worries. As a consequence, analysts say the odds are poor that stocks will make an early recovery from last week, when the bellwether Dow industrial index showed a net decline of 120 points. 'In the near term, the market is stuck at roughly the current levels,' says Mr Steven Einhorn, equity strategist at Goldman Sachs in New York. He sees the correction in the 'ageing bull market' (now down 5.1 per cent from its peak of 3,978 on January 31) continuing until it becomes apparent that the slide in the bond market is complete. The persistent influence of bonds on share prices was underlined on Friday. A relatively tranquil session on the NYSE ended in a rout when the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond climbed above the 7 per cent barrier in the late afternoon. The return on the long bond has stayed below that level for the past 10 months. The sell-off in stocks was all the more discouraging because the immediate impact of the Fed's tightening was mild. Earlier fears of a sharp downturn seemed exaggerated after Wednesday's close. But the sense of relief quickly evaporated with Thursday's 48-point plunge, set off by the shot which killed the leading candidate for the Mexican presidency. Perhaps the best hope of a rally this week lies in the approach of a long holiday weekend, which traditionally brings improved share prices. This year, however, the Easter calendar raises an unusual set of circumstances which could very well work against the market. Although trading screens will stay quiet on Friday, the wheels of the federal bureaucracy will churn out the important economic news of the month - the March employment figures. Mr Anthony O'Bryan, market strategist at A. G. Edwards of St Louis, expects investors to be anticipating Friday's figure earlier in the week. 'There will be more people trying to protect themselves against a bad number than people trying to capitalise on a good one,' he fears. The consensus forecast of Wall Street analysts is a 200,000 gain in non-farm payrolls. Anticipation of a stronger than expected reading could rattle the inflation-sensitive Treasury market, and stocks are likely to follow.</p>

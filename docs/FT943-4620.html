			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Labour party sweeps to power in Barbados Mr Owen Arthur, the new prime minister of Barbados, says his administration will not devalue the island's currency, despite charges made by his political opponents in the campaign for Tuesday's general election on the eastern Caribbean island. Mr Arthur, a 44 year-old economist, was sworn in last night after his Barbados Labour party won 19 of the 28 seats in the lower house, ending 10 years of rule by the Democratic Labour party. Mr David Thompson, leader of the DLP and finance minister in the outgoing administration, is the opposition leader. Responding to persistent charges from his political opponents that he planned a devaluation of the Barbados dollar, which has been under pressure intermittently over the past four years, Mr Arthur said the currency's parity, fixed by the government, would not be changed. The government's priority was a reduction in the island's 22 per cent unemployment rate, he said. The election was called 15 months before it was constitutionally due, after Mr Erskine Sandiford, the former prime minister, lost a vote of no confidence in parliament when rebellious cabinet members, critical of his leadership, sided with the opposition. Mr Arthur's immediate task will be finding measures to support the moderate growth which the economy is experiencing following three years of stagnation because of poor performance by tourism and sugar, its main pillars.</p>

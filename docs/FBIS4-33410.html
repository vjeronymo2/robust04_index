			<p>BFN     [Text] The Turks and Caicos Islands have agreed to  temporarily receive Haitian refugees. After Jamaica, it will be  the turn of the Turks and Caicos Islands to accept the Haitian  boat people on their territory for questioning by the U.S. Coast  Guard. This decision was made by the local government of the  Turks and Caicos Islands, a British colony located 90 miles off  Haiti. Rothschild Francois has details:    [Begin Francois recording] In the agreement concluded  between  Washington and the Turks and Caicos Island Government, it was  mentioned that the United States will provide facilities for the  questioning of Haitian refugees while they are being considered  for political asylum in the United States. These installations  will include the utilization of a desalinization factory, the  extension of the wharf to accommodate the landing of U.S. ships,  and the building of a landing runway. The United States will pay  all expenses for this operation and will also provide aid to the  Turks and Caicos Islands. One to two million dollars will be  spent for this program. The first U.S. technicians are expected  on the island within the coming days to prepare for the  launching of this program, which will be using a staff of 250.    According to the Press Society, the agreement between the  Turks and Caicos Islands and the United States indicates that  before the center for refugees is operational, the United States  could begin interviewing the Haitian boat people on board a U.S.  ship in the waters of Turk Island, more precisely, near Grand  Turk.    Since the announcement of this partial change in the U.S.  policy regarding Haitian refugees, more than 1,500 refugees have  been repatriated to Port-au-Prince. The new U.S. policy has not  yet been applied. This policy provides that Haitian refugees  will no longer be sent back directly to Port-au-Prince, but will  be questioned aboard U.S. ships. The qualified refugees who  receive political asylum could be admitted to the U.S.  territory, while other boat people would be repatriated to  Port-au-Prince by the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>

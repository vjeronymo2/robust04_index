			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Haitian justice minister shot dead ASSASSINS yesterday killed Haiti's justice minister and at least two other people in an escalation of the violence that has set the country's military leaders on a collision course with the US administration, Reuter reports from Port-au-Prince. Justic Minister Guy Malary was shot dead in Port-au-Prince, the capital, shortly after President Bill Clinton had warned Haitian military leaders to restore democracy. Mr Malary, a wealthy lawyer, was a supporter of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is intended to return to the country under a United Nations peace accord signed by General Raoul Cedras, the army chief. The Haitian government said that Mr Malary's bodyguard and driver were also killed and local radio said there were unconfirmed reports of a fourth death. The minister's car was found riddled with bullets beside a church where another supporter of President Aristide was shot dead last month. In another show of defiance against international pressure, members of a pro-military group marched into parliament, briefly held some legislators hostage and expressed their support for Gen Cedras, local radio reported. Nearly all cabinet ministers, who were sworn into office last month, have received death threats from civilian gunmen known as 'attaches' for their links to police and army. Mr Malary had been spearheading legislation to separate Haiti's army and police, a crucial step in the UN accord. Earlier yesterday, police chief Michel Francois, who controls Port-au-Prince, vowed he would not bend to international pressure and give up power. 'I'm Haitian and I've chosen to die in my country,' he said. His supporters said they would paralyse Port-au-Prince with a general strike on Monday, the day international sanctions imposed by the United Nations take effect. Mr Dante Caputo, the chief UN envoy to Haiti, said even the immediate resignation of Gen Cedras was not enough to call off the UN sanctions. He said he wanted hard proof that the army would halt growing street violence before the UN considered cancelling the planned oil embargo and freeze of Haiti's assets.</p>

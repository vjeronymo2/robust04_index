			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kozo Watanabe, acting secretary general of </F> Shinseito, by an unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter; place and  date not given]    [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party],  which supports its leader Tsutomu Hata who has become the prime  minister, made a severe start, didn't it?    [Watanabe] Since we are sailing in the all-time furious  storm, nothing is harder than the current situation. But the  weather clears up after a storm. If Mr. Hata does his job by  making good use of his characteristics of frankness, the people  will understand him.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Some say the way in which the group  "Kaishin" was formed was coercive.    [Watanabe] Shinseito's original view was that the ruling  coalition parties should get united before the upper house  election set for next year. We were thinking of the following  procedure: at first, parties which have similar backgrounds,  ideas, and policies come together, and then the realists of the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] join the force. A hitch  occurred when we did things very quickly.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Party members also expressed criticism.    [Watanabe] Some members argue that there are no internal  procedures in the party. Secretary General Ozawa briefed on the  proceedings at a joint meeting of the standing secretaries  council and the secretaries council, and they unanimously  approved the idea about forming "Kaishin." Probably, some of  those who are not party executives were not informed of it.  However, we did not avoid democratic process, but we put things  through based on decisions made at party bodies.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you think Shinseito's scenario for  realignment of the political world has changed now that the  coalition has become a minority?    [Watanabe] We believe the trend will move toward the  political system based on two major parties. However, as Mr.  Takemura (Sakigake [Harbinger] representative Masayoshi  Takemura) and others mentioned the force to be comprised of the  "Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the Democratic  Socialist Party [DSP], and liberals," now there is a move toward  building the tripolar structure. Under the situation, there had  been differences of opinion among the ruling coalition parties.  Although I do not know whether this is a temporary trend, I am  sure that the tripolar structure has become clear with the  SDPJ's secession from the coalition. It is not easy to clearly  say whether the current political structure will return to the  bipolar system in preparation for introducing the electoral  system for the House of Representatives combining single-seat  constituencies with proportional representation.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Hata administration is said to be a  "short-lived administration."    [Watanabe] When we formed the Takeshita cabinet, we thought  it would continue for at least four years. However, it lasted  only one and one-half years. The Nakasone cabinet, which was  said to be a short-lived administration at the beginning, lasted  for a long time. Taking these cases into consideration, I do not  care about this matter very much.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What is Shinseito's basic strategy in the  minority administration?    [Watanabe] By proposing concrete policies on the tax system,  diplomacy, and other issues which can be supported by the  general public, we will make efforts to gain support for the  Hata cabinet from Diet members who voted for "Tsutomu Hata" in  the prime ministerial election. That is all about our strategy.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Some talk about the possibility of the House  of Representative being dissolved. What is the outlook?    [Watanabe] The dissolution can be considered only when the  budget bill or other important bills are rejected at the Diet,  and when a no-confidence motion in the cabinet is approved.  However, if a no-confidence motion in the cabinet is approved  without any reason, the cabinet should not resign en masse  tamely.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Did the resignation of former Justice  Minister Shigeto Nagano give a blow to your party?    [Watanabe] It was really regrettable. Giving consideration  to the Asian people is Mr. Hata's basic policy. If a person  whose ideas are totally different from those of the prime  minister is asked to join the cabinet, he should not accept the  offer. From the viewpoint of democracy, once a person joins the  cabinet, he should follow the prime minister's ideas.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Shinseito has given a growing impression  that it is a "hawkish" party. What do you think of it?    [Watanabe] In the past, politicians who pushed forward the  normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China  were called doves while those who expressed opposition were  called hawks. We supported normalization when we were members  of the former Tanaka faction of the LDP. We have the consistent  belief that we are the doves within the conservative party. I  deeply regret that people call us the hawks.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Is there any gap between the image and the  reality?    [Watanabe] The image comes from our views on the  Constitution. We do not say the Constitution should be revised  soon. However, since the Constitution has provisions for its  revision, it is inappropriate to think the discussion itself on  revision of the Constitution leads to being hawks or ignoring  the Constitution. Discussion on amendment of the Constitution  should be taboo.</p>

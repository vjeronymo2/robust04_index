			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Management: A dogged all-rounder - Sir Owen Green, the outgoing head of BTR If the secret of management is timing, Sir Owen Green has it to perfection. Ten days ago he announced his retirement from BTR, the company he founded. He also announced that BTR's profits had passed Pounds 1bn for the first time. The share price rose to new heights, valuing BTR at Pounds 12bn. This made it Britain's seventh biggest company, handsomely ahead of Guinness, ICI and J. Sainsbury and a nose ahead of its rival conglomerate Hanson. But BTR is in another sense deeply out of fashion. As a conglomerate, it lacks focus. On the day of Sir Owen's announcement came the news that Glaxo's chief executive had been ousted, largely because he believed - unlike his chairman - that the company's focus should be broader. A few weeks earlier, ICI's chairman had said he was finally persuaded the conglomerate concept was finished and focus was everything. ICI would therefore split itself in two. Unsurprisingly, Sir Owen has no truck with any of this. 'If you're trained in the techniques of management, you ought to be able to apply them across an unlimited area of activity. There have been disasters when organisations have outgrown their strengths and talents. But that's because their reach was further than their grasp. It's another thing to preach that being diversified is a weakness.' Then again, ICI's decision was based on more than size. The company had come to realise that the technical complexity of its operations meant no individual understood them all. No-one was properly equipped to choose between investment proposals ranging from seed breeding to chlorine manufacture. 'I suggest that's because they must specialise to too high a point in their organisation', Sir Owen says. 'There ought to be a level at which special knowledge can be translated into more general terms. If it can't, I don't know what a board of directors is for. I'd reject the view that a business could ever be so technically specialised that an informed decision could not be made by a trained management.' The key to BTR, says Sir Owen, is not focus but contiguity: moving into areas next door. 'To start with, we looked for contiguity in manufacturing processes, particularly in rubber. But a common feature of the market was the automobile industry, so we started making acquisitions related not to rubber but to autos. So we got into contiguity of markets.' Underlying that was an absolute commitment to growth, whether organic or by acquisition. In the ecologically conscious world of the late 1990s, this might seem unfashionable as well. Sir Owen is unrepentant. 'The human condition seeks to better itself, whether materially or intellectually. And the most exciting period of life is one's teens. During those years, tremendous things are happening physiologically. If you can somehow capture that excitement and freshness in an organisation, you've got something. That's what I mean by growth. It isn't acquisitiveness, or size, or being in the top 10 in the beauty parade. It's the vivacity it gives to life in the company.' But must not a company eventually age, like the human organism? 'The fact is we have continued to grow. In percentage terms it's been declining, but it's still there. There must come a time when you can't acquire and you become unmanageable, but I don't know when. I don't think it would come through internal limitations. Internally, our system of management - decentralisation held together by financial control - is capable of any amount of expansion'. There is another heresy behind this. Governments in the developed world, from Tokyo to Brussels, agonise over the growth industries of the future, such as information technology and biotechnology. Sir Owen is happy to be in none of them. 'We're hewers of wood and drawers of water. It isn't the nature of any of our businesses to take a very long view technologically. I can't see anywhere where pure research funded by us would benefit either us or society.' Surely this risks being left behind in a changing world? Not if you pick your areas, says Sir Owen. 'In 10 years' time, an automobile will still have wheels and suspension. In packaging, the concept of wrapping things up will still be there, whether you're talking about paper or boxes or cartons or bottles. Or take the creation of electrical energy. It's been going for 150 years, and it's probably good for another 150. Or take valves. As long as you're going to conduct fluids, you're going to need valves. You get steady improvements in ways of shutting things off and turning them on, but nothing particularly revolutionary.' Pursuing his view of the world in 10 years' time, where does he think the UK will stand as a manufacturing base? 'If Europe maintains a commonality of markets, I think the UK could be more important as a manufacturing centre than it is today. That's provided we don't tie ourselves to a fixed monetary system, or commit ourselves to the Social Chapter. 'If I compare the productivity of our German operations with our British ones, I don't detect the advantage Germany's said to have. When you come to actual cost, clearly the UK has the advantage. And we still have the skills. I see no reason for us to try to force through a greater concentration on engineering, though it would be nice if we could re-establish the regard for technologists we had in the 19th century.' There is a final, classic question to ask an eminent industrialist on his retirement. What advice would he give to an aspiring young UK manufacturer today? 'You have to have a product. What you should then do, more than has been done in a good many years, is get around the world. My impression is that the large economies are more willing to buy from any source than they used to be. In the US, for example, there are tremendous opportunities for anyone who has a product. For the UK manufacturer, the important thing is that the world is your oyster. Your total capacity is tiny in relation to the available market.' And could he suggest a product? 'No, I couldn't. Wisdom and sagacity are things you only get with age, so their application has drawbacks. You're bound to be constrained by your own experience of setbacks. You'd fail to recognise the vital, energising stream of possibilities that young people can see. Wisdom and sagacity would rule out half of them.'</p>

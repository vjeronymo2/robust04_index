			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ke Yan (0668 0917): "Jia Qinglin Says Fujian </F> Must Accomplish New Feats"]    [Text] Fuzhou, 23 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Jia Qinglin,  party secretary and governor of Fujian Province, pointed out in  the forward which he has written for KAIFANG CHAO [Opening  Tide], a large-scale economic journal soon to be published in  the province, that if Fujian wants to accomplish new feats, it  must expedite the implementation of the free port policy in  Xiamen Special Economic Zone, appropriately and flexibly use the  special policy on the two bonded zones in Xiamen and Fuzhou, and  give full play to the role of the special and bonded zones in  being the "window" and "base" amid opening up to the outside  world.    He pointed out that at present, Fujian has a special  economic  zone, as well as some economic and technological development  zones, Taiwan businessmen development zones, bonded zones, and  nearly 100 small zones designated for comprehensive development  by foreign businessmen; Fujian is one of the provinces with the  largest number of opening spectrums, the most complete set of  opening functions, and the biggest area covered by opening up.  If Fujian wants to accomplish new feats, it must continue to  give play to its strong point in land and marine resources, as  well as its strong point in ties with overseas Chinese, Hong  Kong, and Taiwan; it must adapt to the situation in which China  is about to rejoin the GATT, and stretch its economic antenna to  the broader international market.    Among the 13 bonded zones in the country, two are in Fujian.  Fuzhou Bonded Zone has a planned area of 1.8 square km, and the  first-phase development, which occupies 0.8 square km, has been  in operation for more than a year; Xiamen's Xiangyu Bonded Zone  has a planned area of 2 square km, and the first-phase  development, which occupies 0.6 square km, was established last  November and began operation at that time. Fuzhou Port, home to  Fuzhou Bonded Zone, is only 149 nautical miles from Taiwan's  Keelung Harbor, and is one of the mainland districts nearest to  Taiwan; scholars generally hold that the bonded zone there  should become an important base for interactions between the two  sides of the straits.    KAIFANG CHAO, a large-scale bimonthly economic journal  jointly run by Fujian Province People's Government Opening  Affairs Office, Special Zone Office, and the Leading Team for  Foreign Investment Work, is mainly for research and exploration  into the theory and practice of opening up to the outside world.  The journal will be published on 28 of every even-numbered  month, and the trial issue to be published this month is a  special issue on Fuzhou Bonded Zone.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Tories set for gruelling infighting The Conservative party was bracing itself yesterday for a damaging leadership battle after Mr John Major warned that he would fight a threatened challenge from the right. Tired but defiant in the face of disastrous council results, Mr Major said he would be 'standing there waiting' if dissident MPs tried to force him from Downing Street. But Mr Tony Marlow, who last month urged Mr Major's resignation, said his 'credibility and authority are not going to be restored until there is a contest'. Some rightwingers also saw the poor election results as an opportunity for the right to increase its influence over the prime minister, particularly on European issues. A leadership challenge appeared almost certain after Mr John Carlisle, rightwing MP for Luton North, said he would 'reluctantly' stand against Mr Major if no one else did. Mr Carlisle's comments - the first public threat to force a leadership election - prompted outrage in his constituency, where two senior officials immediately resigned. 'If he wants to make a fool of himself, let him,' said Mr Joe O'Neill, chairman of the constituency association. 'We want nothing to do with it.' Rightwing MPs said they were certain that at least 34 Conservative MPs - the minimum required - were ready to call for a contest this autumn. 'Nothing is going to happen until after the European elections in June, but we have got the critical mass and we will force an election,' a leading rightwinger said. Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the 92 Group of rightwing MPs, said the Conservatives would be 'wiped off the map' in the Euro-elections if party support slid further. He urged a 'radical' reshuffle before the elections to 'cut out the dead wood' and increase the number of rightwingers in the cabinet. Several rightwingers said there was 'no point' in trying to dislodge Mr Major because the only credible alternative candidates - Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Heseltine - were on the pro-European left of the party. The three ministers likely to emerge as top candidates in any leadership battle all rallied to support the prime minister. Mr Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said Mr Carlisle's threat to stand against Mr Major was 'deplorable'. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, warned against treating Mr Major as a 'scapegoat'. Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, and the leading rightwinger in the cabinet, said the prime minister had his full support. Mr Major put part of the blame for the 'poor' election results on rightwing MPs who have been sniping at his leadership. Admitting that Tory voters had abstained because of the government's unpopularity, Mr Major said Conservative supporters were 'distressed when they see discordancy in the party'.

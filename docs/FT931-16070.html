			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Management: Engineers learn the value of training As the UK engineering industry looks ahead to the end of the recession, the effect of the downturn on companies' investment in the long-term requirements for competitiveness will become increasingly significant. Apart from product development, perhaps the most important internal investment a company can make is in training. But have British engineering companies maintained their skill levels as markets have fallen or collapsed and workforces are reduced? The answer is a qualified yes, according to an informal survey of the six engineering companies taking part in the FT's occasional series tracking the industry out of recession. Spending on training has not been cut significantly, although it may have been redirected, and in one or two cases it has even been increased. The smallest of the six, Posiva, is German-owned and has an embedded commitment to vocational training and engineering literacy. This starts with managing director Reg Bricknell and continues throughout the Scunthorpe-based gears and drives company. But the other five, all public or private UK-owned companies, have also resisted the temptation to slash training budgets despite sometimes heavy cuts in their workforces. Recession or no recession, says Peter Burton at Bloxwich Engineering, the Walsall vehicle parts producer, 'the main skill we have been working on is getting the entire workforce to be aware of the need for absolute quality.' There has, inevitably, been less need for engineering training because recruitment is on hold and manufacturing staff have been made redundant. 'It did not make sense to bring apprentices in when we were making skilled men redundant,' says Colin Gaskell, managing director of 600 Group. But that has shifted the emphasis on to commercial training, says John Bell, chief executive of Senior Engineering. 'We are acutely aware that the way we respond and handle customers, and the way in which we address short-term demand, is crucial to the way the business develops.' The survey underlines a number of issues about training that may strike a chord with other engineering companies. First, a relatively modest investment can achieve a great deal if it is accompanied by plenty of effort and commitment. Senior has done its commercial training almost 'on the cheap', says Bell, by avoiding mainline consultants and using smaller firms. Second, it suggests that companies are thinking hard before swallowing the latest buzzwords from consultants. At JCB, the main training initiative has been a customer quality programme introduced in 1990. Gilbert Johnston, deputy chairman, says: 'We felt that total quality management wasn't for us - it's too glib a method of management. We wanted our own banner which people can identify with.' The type of, and need for, training may vary among the six but they all believe they are either matching or exceeding the commitment to training and skills retention among domestic or overseas competitors. 'I don't think we'll be facing a skills shortage when the recession ends,' says Gaskell. The question, though, is whether the companies can continue this commitment during 1993. Peter Barker, chairman of Hull-based Fenner and also chairman of the Yorkshire and Humberside CBI, says three-quarters of its 40 members have either maintained or increased spending on training during the recession. But, he says, unless the recession eases attitudes towards training investment might change for the worse.</p>

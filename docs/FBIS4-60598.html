			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] In response to the remarks made by Fahd, the shah of  Arabia, on the Iranian islands of the Persian Gulf, the Islamic  Republic Foreign Ministry announced: These islands are Iranian  and will remain Iranian and nothing will alter this fact.    During a speech two days ago, while inviting the United  States to show a greater and more active presence in the Middle  East region, Fahd commented on Iran and its relations with the  neighboring states, saying: Iran should observe international  regulations and should return to the United Arab Emirates [UAE]  the three islands in the southern sector of the Persian Gulf.    Saudi Arabia, in view of the role it assumes for itself  among  the tiny states of the Persian Gulf, has always tried to present  itself as the leader of these states in the region by  interfering in their affairs. Therefore, while the Islamic  Republic is striving to remove the misunderstanding with the UAE  on the basis of a bilateral agreement, Arabia by raising and  exacerbating the issue is presenting itself as a claimant on  this matter. Fahd's remarks have no legal base either. For  Saudi Arabia is neither an acceptable source of arbitration with  sufficient credibility to express an opinion on issues of other  countries, nor should the head of state of a third country  comment fundamentally on the territorial possessions of others.    If we were to analyze Fahd's comments as a whole, we would  realize that he is raising these matters just to please those  powers which benefit from creation of discord among the Islamic  countries. This is a policy in line with America's policies and  is implemented to isolate Iran in the region.    Iran, in accordance with its independent policies, is  opposed  to the course of compromise, is opposed to the expansion of the  Zionist regime's presence, and is against the U.S. presence in  the region. Whereas the United States, by leading the compromise  course, is striving to open the gate of the Islamic countries to  the Zionist regime and to strengthen the foundations of its own  presence in the Middle East region. For the same reason the  United States has always tried to isolate Iran in the region and  to neutralize its role as a regional power.</p>

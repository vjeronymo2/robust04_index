			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: WB Pounds 2m sale as losses rise Shares in WB Industries,the west midlands-based spring maker, fell 7p to 14p after announcing increased losses for 1991 and the sale of Elson &amp; Robbins, its profitable unit spring maker. On turnover down 32 per cent at Pounds 9.67m (Pounds 14.2m) pre-tax losses were Pounds 1.86m (Pounds 1.59m). The company blamed the recession and its cash shortage. Elson is being sold to Wade Group for Pounds 1.94m as the first stage in the reshaping of WB. In 1991 Elson contributed profits of Pounds 75,000 on turnover of Pounds 5.47m. The sale gives rise to an extraordinary charge of Pounds 3.49m (Pounds 2.33m) relating to losses on businesses sold, of which Pounds 2.28m covers goodwill previously written off. A tax credit of Pounds 567,000 this time left losses per share at 70.88p (218.06p).</p>

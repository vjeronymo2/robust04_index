			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Yemeni parties jostle for votes and credibility / A look at contenders in first parliamentary elections YEMEN'S parliamentary elections on April 27 are viewed by some as a test case for democratic reform in the Arab world. But a weak economy, social unrest and political squabbling have clouded the electoral process and there are no guarantees of a smooth transition to the hoped-for democracy. At issue are the 301 seats in the Yemeni parliament. But the future of the present government is in doubt since the parliament must choose a new president. 'And that' said a Yemeni academic, 'is what the whole contest is all about.' The government was formed on May 22 1990 when the former North and South Yemens united. Essentially a coalition between the south's Yemen Socialist party and the north's General Peoples' Congress, the government was charged with effecting democratic elections by the end of November 1992. Elections were delayed because disagreements between the coalition partners held up the selection of a committee on electoral procedures. Since then, the country has witnessed continued wrangling between the ruling parties, riots which left some 15 dead and 100 injured, and a spate of bomb attacks which killed two people and narrowly missed 100 US soldiers quartered in Aden as part of Operation Restore Hope. Though partners in the transition government, the GPC and YSP are also contenders in the election. This has created tension and, according to Yemen's prime minister, Mr Haydar Abu Bakr Al-Attas, it is the lack of accord between the two ruling parties which has caused the recent troubles. Referring to 'differences' between the YSP and the GPC, the prime minister said in December that they 'had paved the way for erroneous action and behaviour and for all the damage these could cause to the economic, social and political situation'. Led by the President, General Ali Abdullah Saleh, the GPC was once considered the favourite to win any election. Seen as the architect of unification, a highly emotive issue in Yemen, Gen Saleh was at the peak of his popularity in the early days of the new state. But 36 per cent unemployment, 100 per cent inflation for the second year running, and widespread suspicion of corruption in his government, now mean Gen Saleh can not count on a majority in the election. The GPC has lost ground and is campaigning to regain voter confidence. The YSP has gained considerable ground in the past nine months. Headed by the vice-president, Mr Ali Salem Al-Beidh, the YSP was highly unpopular at the time of unification and generally considered a spent political force. Since then the YSP has used key positions in the government, civil service, the military and the labour unions to extract concessions from the president and to drum up popular support. And, in contrast to the GPC, the YSP is not under suspicion of corruption. Still, the more populous northerners harbour doubts about the Socialists and are unlikely to grant them a clear majority in parliament either. The other main contender for power is the Islah party, an uneasy union of tribal and Islamic elements, headed by the tribal leader Sheikh Abdullah bin Hussain Al-Ahmar and the fundamentalist preacher Abdul Mujeed Az-Zindani. Islah represents some of the most conservative elements in Yemeni society and has appeal in a country where nearly half the population of 14m live in villages of fewer than 250 inhabitants. However, Islah it is perceived as a party rooted in the past and although it will be a force in the elections, it is unlikely to carry a majority. Apart from the GPC, the YSP, and Islah the remainder of Yemen's 40 or so political parties are loosely grouped together in a rainbow coalition called the National Conference. Although it has become a political conscience, condemning the transition government at every opportunity, it lacks popular appeal and is unlikely to command much electoral support. But through its criticism, the National Conference will be a focus for public scrutiny of the major parties. So far there appears to be no clear victor in sight, but if the squabbles continue, democracy could be the loser. The recent troubles have at least brought recognition of the potential crisis facing the country and of the pressing need to do something about it.</p>

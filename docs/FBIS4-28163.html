			<p>BFN     [Text] It was revealed that North Korea is transferring  [chonsu haejugo issomi] manufacturing technology for up-to-date  biochemical weapons to the Middle East.    It is likely, therefore, that the German cabinet meeting  today will work out appropriate measures against the threat of  such mass lethal weapons imposed recently by North Korea.    Correspondent Yi Myong-ku reports from Berlin:    [Begin Yi recording] The German newspaper, DIE WELT, quoting  an intelligence source in the West, reported that North Korea is  selling nuclear-delivery rockets to radical states in the Middle  East and handing over technology on biological weapons and  chemical weapons to them.    This paper wrote that the nations to which North Korea is  selling weapons are capable of paying North Korea in foreign  currency at once, and Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Libya are included  in these nations.    A German intelligence source pointed out that the arming of  these countries with mass lethal weapons poses a direct threat  to European countries. The source expressed worries about the  possibility of Europe being taken hostage by these countries  even from next year.    This source also revealed that some business firms in  Europe,  including Germany, are involved in the Middle East nations'  manufacturing of weapons based on North Korean technology.    Another intelligence source pointed out, however, that  Germany effectively blocked the weapons produced in Germany from  being handed over to the Middle East nations, and transaction of  such mass lethal weapons is being carried out in a more skillful  and secret manner with each passing day. Therefore, tenacious  efforts are necessary to prevent Arab states from arming  themselves with such weapons.    Meanwhile, the German cabinet meeting to be held today will  discuss measures to cope with the issue of uranium produced in  the Former Soviet Union being brought into Germany and with the  issue of the armament of Arab states with nuclear-delivery  rockets and biochemical weapons. It was learned that a secret  report on the proliferation of such lethal weapons will be  submitted to today's cabinet meeting. In addition, the cabinet  meeting will also work out effective countermeasures for the  threat imposed by North Korea. [end recording]</p>

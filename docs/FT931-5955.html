			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Quiet session as rate hopes dwindle INTEREST rate hopes dimmed a little on the UK stock market yesterday after the Bundesbank disappointed the optimists with the announcement of its latest repo tender rate. With the governor of the Bank of England also warning that domestic rates would be raised if the pound, or the inflation rate, required defending, equities drifted into a pre-Budget torpor. Share prices, lacking a lead from stock index futures, moved within narrow bands. Having edged slightly firmer at first, the market turned down to show an 11-point loss on the Footsie at mid-morning after the Bundesbank had set its disappointing repo rate. The move was seen as virtually eliminating the chances of any serious reduction in German rates when the Bundesbank meets tomorrow. For the rest of the London session, the market rallied very slowly, receiving a final boost towards the close from a modest improvement in sterling, and from a steady opening by New York equities in spite of reports of some slight disappointment with the latest US leading economic indicators. The FT-SE 100 Index closed just 0.3 down at 2,882.3. Traders noted the evident unwillingness of the market to test the Footsie's trading high of 2,900.1, reached at the beginning of last month. With the Budget now less than two weeks away, there was a cautious response in the marketplace to a forecast by a leading institutional broker of a Footsie at 3,000 by Budget Day. Strategists expect a modest tightening of fiscal policy in the Budget speech, probably counter-balanced by a cut in base rates. But for the rest of this week the market is likely to be dominated by the flow of results from important UK companies. Abbey National, General Accident and Fisons all shaded easier after announcing trading results yesterday but gave the stock market no evident cause for anguish. Seaq trading volume increased to 573.2m shares from the 535.2m of the previous session, lifted by activity in a clutch of blue chip stocks in the financial and oil sectors. Non-Footsie stocks made up 62 per cent of yesterday's Seaq total, maintaining recent averages. The healthy level of retail business continued on Monday, when it was worth Pounds 1.15bn. Leading market indices were held back by weakness in a handful of major names. ICI remained under a cloud as both UK and US investors continued to assess the valuation prospects of the two new companies which will emerge when the existing group is demerged later this year. Glaxo was also out of favour, adding to the gloom which has clouded over the pharmaceuticals sector and thus over ICI's plan to demerge its pharmaceutical interests. BAT Industries gave ground sharply, with the early fall compounded by weakness in the US dollar later in the London trading session. London traders were puzzled by BAT's weakness, which appeared to be a delayed reaction to transatlantic pressures. The postponement, yet again, of interest rate hopes, brought some profit-taking in the construction and contracting sectors as some traders decided to withdraw from this area until the opening on Monday of the new equity account, which takes in Budget Day. Store and retail issues, also responsive to interest rate views, traded quietly.</p>

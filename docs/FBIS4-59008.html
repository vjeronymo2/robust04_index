			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Amir Hay] </F>   [Excerpts] Israel has notified the PLO that it will not  permit the entry of some of the Badr brigade troops, due to  deploy in Jericho, until it receives the names of the autonomy  council members.    Meanwhile, Israel this afternoon barred seven deportees, who  returned from Jordan, from entering through the Allenby Bridge.  Only the father of the seven men was permitted to return to his  village -- al-Rummanah in the Janin District. Our correspondent  in the territories Amir Hay reports:    [Begin Hay recording] [passage omitted] Some 300 members of  the Badr brigade today arrived at the other side of the border,  on their way to Jericho. Israel, however, announced today that  they will be denied entry as long as it did not receive an  autonomy council name list. [passage omitted]    In Hebron, the TIPH [Temporary International Presence in  Hebron] members assumed their duties today. They patrolled  Hebron and launched a telephone inquiry center for local  residents. In the course of their patrols, they stumbled into  violent clashes between locals and IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  troops. Four TIPH vehicles were damaged in stone throwing  incidents. The riots had been organized by Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad activists. [end  recording]</p>

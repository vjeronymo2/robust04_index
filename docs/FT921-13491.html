			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Tax relief move by Revenue NON-TAXPAYERS and those eligible for partial tax relief on income from bank and building society interest can claim repayments worth more than Pounds 50 immediately rather than waiting until the end of the tax year, the Inland Revenue said yesterday. Married women who are independently taxed and whose incomes are below the personal tax threshold can also claim back payments on share dividends without waiting.</p>

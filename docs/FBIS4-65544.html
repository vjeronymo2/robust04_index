			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with presidential candidate Roman </F> Herzog by Peter Heinacher in Karlsruhe on 17 May: "Herzog:  Overregulation Obstructs Economic Development"]    [Text] Roman Herzog, candidate of the Christian Democratic  Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] for the federal  presidency, has renounced "pessimism" regarding the economic  developments in the new laender. In an interview with  HANDELSBLATT, the president of the Karlsruhe Federal  Constitutional Court emphasized that all current economic  indicators were giving reason to be optimistic.    Herzog cited three main reasons for his optimistic  appreciation of economic developments in eastern Germany. On  the one hand, he pointed to the experience gained by the West  Germans after 1945. The dismantling of industrial plants  constituted a "terrible blow" for the West German economy at the  time. However, the effect was that the dismantled industrial  plants were replaced by new, much more efficient ones. "The  same will now take place in the new laender."    In addition, Herzog pointed to the economy in the  construction sector, which had picked up significantly over the  past few months. "I am not claiming that things are developing  in the same way as in the West after 1950. Yet, the fact is  that the construction sector has always been the driving force  for the economy in West Germany in the past few decades."    Finally, the CDU/CSU candidate pointed to the increasing  number of new enterprises that have been established in the new  laender. An economy is working best when "it can rely on this  grass-roots economy of small- and medium-sized enterprises and  industries."    Moreover, Herzog underlined the qualifications of the people  in eastern Germany and their readiness to work hard. In many  cases their knowledge went far beyond technical things. The  knowledge of East European languages, which many people in the  new laender possess, was still lying absolutely fallow. "If the  markets in East Europe recover, there is a great potential for  employment here. I think that we do not have to fear too much  about the economic development in eastern Germany. It is  certainly going to be a long haul but the upward trend is  indisputable."    Herzog commented most favorably on the role of the trade  unions in German society. The reaction to the economic  development, to the widening gap between economic developments  and the labor market can be acknowledged only with words of  praise, Herzog said. "I cannot judge whether this year's wage  agreements are watertight to the last detail or what the future  of the Volkswagen working week model will be. Yet, quite  certainly one can say that steps in the right direction have  been taken, and I have been following them with the greatest  respect."    The president of the Constitutional Court strongly  criticized  overregulation in the FRG. This was currently even obstructing  a positive course for the economy. As everybody knows, the  liberal law-governed state lives on the fact that the citizens  voluntarily behave in the way they are expected by the law.  Yet, if the legal system has become so intricate and  complicated that even the most loyal citizens no longer know  what they are expected to do, then this potential for loyalty is  not utilized. The development of the FRG legal system has  certainly also something to do with a certain German urge for  perfectionism. Yet, the essential thing is that in the last few  decades one has more and more abandoned the type of law "that  only sets out the general direction." Lawmaking today  increasingly often means to seek justice for individual cases  and to produce an ever increasing number of special regulations.  "I do not think that we can afford that in the long run. I  would prefer a somewhat less exhaustive legal system that leaves  a certain room for all parties involved -- including the  administrative bodies."    In this connection, Herzog pointed out that the Federal  Constitutional Court has always been very open in this respect.  He was sometimes wondering that the legislators were making  relatively little use of the possibilities that have become  possible under constitutional law.    Regarding his chances in the election of the federal  president, the CDU/CSU candidate said that he thought from the  very beginning that his election was not "absolutely certain."  Yet, at the moment he thought that his chances were bigger than  those of the other candidates. Nevertheless, the race was still  open. "I am preparing myself for both results."    The question whether in the future the president should be  directly elected by the people depends on the powers the office  will be entrusted with, Herzog said, adding that he discussed  this problem before in his commentary on the Basic Law. Under  the Basic Law, the federal president has only limited powers,  "one can say he is absolutely weak." Herzog emphasized that  there was the danger that a politician might be elected with far  more than 50 percent of the vote in a general election but lack  the necessary competence. "I find this discrepancy between  backing from the population and real powers to be too great."  That way "full-blooded politicians" would "burn out."    Herzog stressed that, according to the Basic Law, the  federal president had to examine all laws and, if necessary,  even withhold his signature if a law appears to be  unconstitutional. He argued that all federal presidents refused  to sign a document at least once. The Federal Constitutional  Court is indeed the real keeper of the constitution, which is  why all federal presidents have so far, quite rightly, only  reluctantly made use of their right to withhold a signature in  extreme cases.    In this connection, Herzog pointed to a "fact" that, in his  view, had gotten not enough public attention so far. If, in a  law of 200 paragraphs, one paragraph is dubious under  constitutional law, then the Federal Constitutional Court is  able to pick out this paragraph and declare it void if asked to  do so. Yet everything else in the law would stay the way it is.    The federal president can only sign a law in its entirety or  refuse to sign it. This was the real reason that the federal  presidents were very reluctant in many cases to withhold their  signature. Some presidents expressly emphasized in the past  that they had reservations regarding the constitutionality of  certain points of a law, but still wanted to put their signature  to it to clear the way for Karlsruhe. "I regard that as a most  reasonable practice that is basically consistent with the  rulings of the Federal Constitutional Court."    The discussion about shifting responsibilities from Bonn to  the Karlsruhe Federal Constitutional court is looked at with  certain skepticism by Herzog. "If I understand it right then  this happened only once, namely in connection with the  out-of-area missions of Bundeswehr units." The Federal  Constitutional Court itself did not regard the discussion as  being so "dramatic." He said he did not quite understand the  criticism of politics in this connection. There are certainly  examples for a shift in responsibilities, but there are only a  few.    Herzog noted that if he were elected he would mainly "do  what  in England they call warning, admonishing, and encouraging. The  federal president will be well advised not to interfere in  political controversies between the various camps." In  addition, and in constant agreement with the Federal  Government's foreign policy, particularly toward the outside, he  has to do a great deal for "all things that make up the  atmosphere." "I think that wherever the necessary political  discussion is not conducted, it is also his job if not to set up  programs at least to point to the issue," Herzog said.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Mr Kinnock's left luggage THE LABOUR party has gone a long way towards transforming itself into a modern social democratic party; but not far enough. Nationalisation and indicative planning are out, competitive market forces are in. Yet Labour remains encumbered by intellectual baggage from the past. Already its statutory minimum wage is withering in the heat of the election campaign; it does not belong in Labour's new market garden. A little more pruning is still required. The minimum wage is a notoriously blunt method of achieving the goals Labour has set for itself. The UK does have more poverty than a wealthy society should tolerate; it has more low skill-low wage employment than a developed economy should have; and it pays some public sector workers too little. Yet the minimum wage will leave most poverty untouched. Child benefit, however inefficient, does at least ensure that the poor families benefit as much as do the more wealthy. Not so the minimum wage. Most low paid workers are second or third income earners in higher income families. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that the gains to the richest 50 cent of the population will outweigh the gains to the lowest 50 per cent. True, the proportionate gains are larger for low income families where someone works, as a recent National Institute report points out. But the core poor - the unemployed, old and infirm - will not benefit. Only 13 per cent of the beneficiaries are in the poorest 20 per cent of households. Moreover, unemployment and therefore poverty will increase as a direct result of the minimum wage, as Mr Neil Kinnock implicitly acknowledged yesterday. He endorsed an earlier National Institute study which suggested that the gains in higher tax revenue will outweigh the higher public spending on wages. But it also estimated that upwards of 100,000 jobs would be lost. The market for chief executives may not be competitive; but the market for unskilled workers is fiercely so. There is still time for Labour to inject some sanity into its proposals without making a complete U-turn. The decision to delay its introduction until 1993 makes sense. By then unemployment may be levelling off while the proposed Pounds 3.40 per hour will be substantially less than half of male median earnings. But Labour should go further. If it must follow a European example, it should follow Germany and set separate minimums for different regions and industries. Moreover, an automatic link with male median earnings should be dropped, at least until the policy's employment effects have been assessed, while a sub-minimum should be added for people aged under 25. France has eschewed the sub-minimum option. Instead, it requires employers to pay the minimum wage to young people, and then subsidises their employment in a vain attempt to reduce very high youth unemployment. That is one continental practice Labour should try to avoid.</p>

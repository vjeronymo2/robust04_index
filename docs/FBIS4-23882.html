			<p>BFN     [Text] One UN soldier was killed and another one wounded on  Friday [17 June] when they were traveling near Shyorongi where  fighting was taking place between Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]  forces and government troops.    The RPF had earlier warned the UNAMIR not to use  Kigali-Ruhengeri road without the consent of the RPF forces, but  contrary to the warning the UN officers went through the roads.  Their vehicle ended up landing in an ambush where fighting was  taking place. The RPF soldiers fired at the vehicle and on  coming closer found it was UN soldiers.    One officer, a major by rank, died instantly and one more  was  injured. The injured was given first aid and later taken to  hospital.</p>

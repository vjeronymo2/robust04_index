			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Pensions - The White Paper: Insolvency risk remains serious matter - Barry Riley discusses the implications for pension-fund investment policies The minimum solvency standard in the white paper is not quite as tough as the one proposed last year by the Goode committee. But the 90-day rule - that solvency of under 90 per cent must be corrected through a cash injection or something similar within three months - will mean companies still have to take the insolvency risk very seriously. According to Ms Penny Webster of consulting actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow it is also surprising that no smoothing of market values or interest rates is to be permitted. A scheme that had an annual valuation on a particularly bad day for the market could be forced into an injection which would not be necessary on a broader view. It has been argued by Mr Alistair Ross Goobey, head of the PosTel pension fund management firm and a member of the Goode committee, that it could be a blessing in disguise to be forced to invest at the bottom of the market. But the threat of a cash hit in the middle of a national financial crisis is the finance director's nightmare. How might investment strategies be affected? The simple proposition is that the holding of a significant proportion of low-risk assets, such as short-dated bonds or index-linked gilts, will reduce the volatility of the fund compared with a normal pension fund portfolio, which has more than 80 per cent in UK and overseas equities. Therefore schemes with weak solvency will be prudent to buy lower-risk investments, but this will also reduce the expected return. Over the past 30 years the total return on gilts has been on average 5.5 per cent a year less than on UK equities. A high-gilt strategy would therefore involve significantly larger regular contributions. A complicating factor is that the maturity of many UK pension schemes, especially the large ones, is rapidly increasing. Many have substantially more pensioners and deferred pensioners on their books than current employees. So their liabilities are becoming more predictable and can be safely matched against fixed coupon or index-linked bonds, and are less easily matched against equities. On the other hand, this means that the concession compared with the Goode version, that cash equivalents could be based on high equity returns - and thus be much cheaper - for younger members, will be less beneficial in a maturing environment. There could thus be a double effect as the minimum solvency standard is phased in over the next six or seven years. Figures released earlier this week on the investment patterns of UK pension funds in the first quarter of the year already showed sharply higher purchases of gilts - Pounds 3.3bn, which was more than in the whole of last year. Tentative figures in the white paper suggest that the extra gilts required would be no more than Pounds 9bn. Funds would not sell UK equities but would run their holdings of overseas equities and bonds down by about Pounds 7.5bn instead, apparently because foreign assets would offer a less safe match for UK liabilities. This would be a comfortable outcome, posing no threat to the UK stock market and promising a slightly - but not dramatically - easier environment for the government to finance its deficits. There is, however, a quite different argument based on the proposition that it is highly risky for UK pension schemes to hold almost 60 per cent of their assets in a single asset class (UK equities). Diversification will be an imperative, and one that would require significantly greater holdings of overseas assets, as well as gilts. This could seriously threaten the UK equity market, of which UK pension funds own about a third. The government will play down the possibility of such a damaging strategic upheaval, but the danger cannot be dismissed at this stage. There is no getting away from the fact that providing effective insurance for schemes against the impact of securities market disasters is going to cost employers money. There may need to be further negotiations and adjustments before a final deal is struck.</p>

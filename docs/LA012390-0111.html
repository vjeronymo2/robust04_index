			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCENROE ANGERED BY PHOTOGRAPHER  </P> <P> On his way home, after being thrown out of the Australian Open for losing his  temper, John McEnroe directed his anger Monday at an Associated Press  photographer who was attempting to take the tennis player's picture as he and  his family arrived at Los Angeles International Airport.  </P> <P> "He stuck his finger in my face, swore at me and told me to get out of his  way," the photographer, Nick Ut, said.  </P> <P> "At first, I thought he was going to kill me. He kept yelling at me, swearing  at me. He was very angry at me, and so was his wife. I've never had anybody  angrier at me when I was trying to do my job."  </P> <P> Ut, a Pulitzer Prize winner in 1973, took several pictures and said he never  answered McEnroe. Ut also said he was the only photographer at the airport to  photograph McEnroe, who was accompanied by his wife, actress Tatum O'Neal, and  their two sons. The couple live in Malibu.  </P> <P> The AP said no charges were filed and Ut was unhurt.  </P></p>

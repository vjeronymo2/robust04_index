			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not a very reliable defence Sir, The hidden meaning of the seemingly absurd cautions (Observer: 'Ear we go again', August 4; 'Wet one', August 3) frequently seen in the US is: 'If you injure yourself by sticking this screwdriver in your ear (or trying to hang yourself with this roller tower) you can't sue me, because I warned you'] Needless to say, this does not stop the lawsuits. Cyril Sanger, 317 Lydecker Street, Englewood, New Jersey 07631, US</p>

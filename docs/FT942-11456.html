			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: PetroCan posts best first term since sell-off PetroCanada has posted its best first quarter since partial privatisation in 1991. Earnings rose to CDollars 73m (USDollars 52.9m), or 30 cents a share, against CDollars 40m, or 16 cents. The figure were struck on revenues of CDollars 1.1bn compared with CDollars 1.17bn. PetroCan is one of Canada's largest integrated oil companies. Mr James Stanford, president, said the strong performance may help to persuade the federal government to sell off its remaining 70 per cent interest in PetroCan. The group wants to develop the east coast offshore Terra Nova oilfield. The field, near the Hibernia project, about 200 miles east of St John's, Newfoundland, has an estimated CDollars 2bn initial development cost. Reserves total about 400m barrels of light oil. Mr Stanford said PetroCan wanted to reduce its 49 per cent interest in Terra Nova to 30 per cent, by bringing in more international partners. He said although PetroCan could absorb its 25 per cent share of a CDollars 1bn cost over-run expected at Hibernia, hopes of reducing its interest were now dim. PetroCan's Hibernia partners are Mobil, Chevron, Murphy and the federal and Newfoundland governments. Norwegian Contractors, a Norwegian consulting group, has assumed supervision of construction of the massive concrete gravity base in Newfoundland. Hibernia will now start up in 1998 with an initial capital cost of CDollars 6.2bn. Mr Stanford, speaking after PetroCan's annual meeting in Calgary, said Hibernia's long-term economics, based on output of 125,000 barrels daily, remained 'attractive' despite low international oil prices.</p>

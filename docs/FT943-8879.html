			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Architecture: Sense and sensuality - Italian designer Ettore Sottsass Ettore Sottsass started at the sight of a woman walking by in a pretty pink slip of a summer dress. 'Aaaaargh]' cried the septuagenarian designer with an animalistic groan. 'Look at that girl] Just look at her] She's almost naked]' It is a testimony to how charming Sottsass can be that he can utter such an unashamedly sexist remark without making you hate him. But Ettore Sottsass has a great deal of charm indeed. At 76 he has the serene, sunny air of a man who has spent his life doing, well, probably exactly what he wanted: first as one of the bright young designers and architects who made waves in post-war Italy and latterly as a grand old man of European design. He has just arrived in Paris in his grandee guise to open a retrospective of his work at the Pompidou Centre. He plays the role to perfection. He stood smiling at his opening party, looking like a sci-fi sorcerer, with his tightly-plaited ponytail, blowing air kisses at some guests and autographing catalogues for others. Now he is sipping a chilled beer on a cafe terrace opposite the Pompidou, ogling the Parisiennes as they saunter into his show. 'It's strange to have a retrospective of your work while you're still alive,' he says. 'At first I didn't like the idea at all. It made me feel old and empty. It was as if I was dead and people were peering into my grave.' How does he feel about it now? 'Sad, very sad. It's such a big exhibition. So full of things. I look at it all and think what a waste. Why did I spend so much time working? I should have spent more time living.' Sottsass is not at all convincing when casting himself as a repentant workaholic: particularly as he goes on to rattle off a list of the Chinese houses, Sevre vases and other projects vying for space on his drawing board. But the scale of his retrospective is undeniably impressive. It fills two floors of the Pompidou Centre, covering his entire career from the workers' houses he designed with Ettore Sottsass Snr, his architect father, in the late 1940s, to the post-modernist playpens he has been creating for his wealthy Japanese clients in the early 1990s. The exhibition might begin and end with his buildings, but Sottsass has been most influential as an industrial designer and it is his designs that steal the show. He dabbled in fine art and architecture during the late 1940s when he returned to Italy from the Sarajevo prison camp where he spent most of the War. But his interest in design was kindled by a 1956 trip to the US, where he worked with George Nelson, one of the most innovative furniture designers of the era. Sottsass's timing was perfect. The Italian companies of the 1950s saw design as an essential tool with which to establish themselves in the international market. They were eager to tap the talents of Sottsass and his fellow designers - Vico Magistretti, Marco Zanuso and the Castigilioni brothers. Sottsass was snapped up in 1958 by Olivetti, the electronics giant, to work as artistic director alongside Roberto Olivetti, the founder's son. Olivetti was then making the transition from mechanics to electronics. 'It was an era of great change,' says Sottsass. 'Some people in the company tried to resist those changes and mistakes were made. But it was an exciting time.' It was also a period that produced some of his best work, when he reinterpreted the ideas of the 1960s pop artists - Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol, whom he had befriended on his trips back to the US - into typewriters and calculators. One of his most popular products for Olivetti was the Valentine, a pretty red portable typewriter that he designed in 1969. Sottsass now says that he never really liked it. 'It's too obvious,' he pouts. 'It's a bit like a girl wearing a very short skirt and too much make-up. It's a perfect piece of marketing. After the Valentine I told Roberto that I'd only do office machines.' He feels happier about another high-profile project - Memphis, the group of furniture designers, including Michele de Lucchi and Robert Graves, with which he collaborated in the early-1980s. Memphis shared the same bright colours and bold forms as Sottsass's 1960s and 1970s furniture. But he was then seen as something of an iconoclast, whereas Memphis was absolutely in tune with its time. It provided the media with a very photogenic form of the post-modernist theories, then fashionable in academic circles. 'Memphis really meant something,' says Sottsass. 'It was clear and uncompromising. That's why it was important at the time and why it still pleases me today.' Memphis was also one of the clearest expressions of Sottsass's own ideology. He owes his importance as a designer partly to his direct influence over younger collaborators and partly to his indirect influence over others, notably Philippe Starck, as one of the intellectual 'guerrillas', whose ideas helped liberate post-war design from the tyranny of Bauhaus austerity. 'When I was young all we ever heard about was functionalism, functionalism, functionalism,' he says. 'It's not enough. Design should also be sensual and exciting: something that is really challenging.' The least successful aspect of the Pompidou retrospective is its attempt to express the theoretical side of Sottsass's work by displaying his photographs with accompanying essays. Some of the photography works, such as the 'Design for the Rights of Man' series of still lives that he took in the early 1970s and which even today are scathing satires on conspicuous consumption. Yet the random snaps of trees or doors are of no more than passing interest. And the entire exhibition would be better off without the post-coital shots of hotel beds recently rumpled by the great designer. 'I really wish I hadn't looked at those pictures now,' winced one young visitor after reading the explanatory text. Perhaps she should have taken heed of the title Sottsass had given to one of his latest glass pieces - the Naomi Campbell. The Ettore Sottsass retrospective is on show at the Georges Pompidou Centre, Paris until September 5.</p>

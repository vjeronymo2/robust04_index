			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Beirut, 23 May (MENA)--A political official in  Hizballah has warned that the Lebanese Islamic resistance will  respond violently to the abduction of Shaykh Mustafa al-Dirani  by Israeli commandos two days ago. The official predicted a  rise in effective attacks by the Islamic resistance in the near  future. Israel may be able to abduct hostages, he said, but it  cannot twist the arm of the resistance or dissuade it from  pursuing its strategic task of confronting occupation and  repelling aggression against the Lebanese people and land.  [passage omitted]    Reiterating Hizballah's position on the Israeli navigator,  al-Musawi said that Hizballah has no information about the  navigator's fate. He pointed out that Mustafa al-Dirani,  although a resistance figure, has no organizational link with  Hizballah.    'Ammar al-Musawi expressed doubt that al-Dirani has any  information about the Israeli navigator. He expressed his  belief that Israel, in carrying out the abduction, may have  benefited from some loopholes in the internal security  situation. Al-Musawi said that the Lebanese authorities have an  urgent duty to protect the resistance in every part of Lebanon,  north or south. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: Compaq to sell equity stake COMPAQ Computer, the US computer manufacturer in the throes of a strategy change, is selling its 20 per cent equity stake in Conner Peripherals back to Conner for some Dollars 241m. Compaq will book a pre-tax gain of about Dollars 80m on the transaction and plans to use the proceeds to speed up its own share repurchase plan. Conner will retire the shares, which will boost the group's earnings per share. Compaq made a Dollars 6m investment in Conner when the computer peripherals group was founded in 1986 and made an additional Dollars 6m investment later that year. Conner will buy Compaq's 11.6m shares for Dollars 20 3/4 each. Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's chief executive, said he expected the company's strong strategic relationship with Conner to continue.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Underpinning at BICC Yesterday's presentation by a triumvirate of Scotsmen - two of them chartered accountants - looks to have persuaded some in the City that the UK cables and construction group has merit in these turbulent times. The company's strong first-half cash performance is certainly reassuring, not least in view of the money squandered on housebuilding and commercial property in the past. But whether yesterday's 6 per cent rise in the shares can be sustained may depend largely on what happens to margins in the group's dominant European cables business over the next 12 to 18 months. That in itself is progress for BICC, which has long been dogged by balance sheet worries and the uncertain scale of further property provisions. The recent rights issue has allayed fears about the former, even if most of the Pounds 130m remaining off-balance sheet debt is guaranteed by the parent and treating the convertible as debt makes gearing less comfortable. A major write-down for Spitalfields can probably not be staved off much longer, but the rent roll achieved so far on completed developments suggests that current valuations are no longer wildly unrealistic. Provided it was not merely a negotiating stance for the benefit of Eurotunnel's Sir Alastair Morton, yesterday's insistence that there will be no more provisions for the Channel tunnel is the best news of the lot. Given that at least some of Balfour Beatty's markets will remain grimly depressed, prime responsibility for maintaining the pay-out beyond this year rests with European cables. Current difficulties are not wholly reflected in the 19 per cent reported drop in first-half operating profits, due to first-time consolidation for Spain. But a 9 per cent yield on the shares is surely adequate insurance against things getting worse.</p>

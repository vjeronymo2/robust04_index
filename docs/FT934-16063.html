			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Bus group warns of VAT threat VALUE ADDED TAX on bus fares could put many operators out of business and lead to 15,000 job losses in the industry, the Bus and Coach Council warned yesterday. The council, representing operators and manufacturers with a annual turnover of Pounds 4bn, said such a move in next month's Budget would drive passengers off bus services and force operators to raise fares by more than 30 per cent to maintain their profit margins. The bus industry, like British Rail, fears that the Treasury is planning to levy VAT on fares to help reduce the public-sector deficit. Industry executives yesterday told Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister, that increased taxation would make services operated by many companies unviable and leave no room for investment in new models. Mr Bill Cottham, president of the council, said: 'VAT would wipe out a lot of companies and would have a damaging knock-on effect on orders for manufacturers.' Speaking at the industry's trade fair in Birmingham, Mr Freeman said: 'It is a matter for the Treasury rather than the Department of Transport.' Although operators are likely to bear the brunt of any move to impose VAT on fares, manufacturers said yesterday there would be a damaging impact on orders just when they were beginning to show signs of recovery. Fare increases would leave operators with no resources to buy new models. Mr Sandy Glennie, managing director of Volvo Buses, the UK subsidiary of the Swedish automotive group, said: 'We've just moved back into profit after two years of losses. More taxation would be a setback and would undermine the fragile increase in orders.' His concern was echoed at Northern Counties, the Wigan-based manufacturer which was rescued from receivership last year by a management buy-out. Mr Lindsay Khan, finance director, said such companies had only won orders because of failures among other manufacturers. 'The market is too vulnerable to withstand reduced spending by operators,' he warned. Mr Freeman acknowledged the council's fears but refused to comment on whether such a policy change was being planned by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. The Treasury declined to comment on whether VAT would be extended to fares.</p>

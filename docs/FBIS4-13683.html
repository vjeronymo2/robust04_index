			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Positive Signals, Future Hopes"] </F>   [Text] The reported acceptance by Islamic resistance  Movement, Hamas, of a negotiated settlement to the Arab-Israeli  conflict is a welcome development. The apparent shift in the  movement's strategy was spelled out by one of Hamas's senior  members, the head of its political bureau, Musa Abu-Marzuq who  is based in Damascus. It was confirmed yesterday by Hamas  leaders in the occupied territories. Both Jordan and the U.S.  received this development warmly.    This shift in the hardline Islamist group's thinking, which  so far advocated a maximalist position, is an omen of goodwill  not only for the Palestinian-Israeli track of negotiations but  also for the wider Arab-Israeli Muslim-Western conflict.    On the Palestinian-Israeli track, Hamas occupies a leading  role both in the occupied territories, especially in Gaza, and  among the Damascus-based Palestinian rejectionists, the  so-called Alliance of Palestinian Forces that groups 10 factions.    If Hamas would join the negotiations that would certainly  lead to reduced tension in the occupied territories, would  strengthen Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat's hand both in the Palestinian camp and in his  quest for an accelerated process and would expose Israeli  hardliners. What matters now is how Israel and the PLO would  respond to the Hamas initiative. Any deal with Hamas now,  either on the Israeli or on PLO behalf, would smoothen  transition towards Palestinian self-rule and put to rest fears  of imminent Palestinian infighting.    On the Arab front, any involvement of Hamas in the peace  negotiations would lead to the mitigation of Islamists'  ideologies especially in Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan. The Muslim  Brotherhood movements in Egypt and in Jordan can only be  expected to lend support to their Palestinian brothers.  Likewise, Lebanon's Shi'ites will be watching to see if their  fellow Islamists in Palestine would be wrestling Palestinian  right from the Israelis through negotiations.    On the wider Muslim-Western front, Hamas's involvement in  peace negotiations with Israel and by extension the U.S. will  open a main channel of communication between Muslims and the  West that can only lead to an enhanced understanding between the  two.    We see in the development a precious opportunity that should  be seized by the Palestinians, Arabs, Israelis and Americans.  In light of that we see the response by the Jordanian  government and the U.S. administration as positive signs the PLO  and Israel should emulate.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Rightwingers want whip move reversed Rightwing Conservative MPs yesterday demanded the restoration of the party whip to nine Tory Euro-rebels to contain the political damage after Tuesday's defeat over value added tax on fuel. As cabinet ministers and backbenchers assessed the political implications of scrapping the second VAT increase a group of Tory MPs blamed the government's defeat on the recent expulsion of rebels who voted against the European finance bill. The rightwingers noted that eight of the nine MPs - including Mrs Teresa Gorman, Mr Richard Shepherd and Mr Nicholas Winterton - had failed to support the government on Tuesday. And they expressed fears that the group could rebel again. One MP said: 'I would like a clear sign that these people will be reinstated at the start of next year at the earliest.' He said the government would suffer if a group of populist MPs was allowed to fester as 'a party within a party'. Another complained that the expulsions demonstrated that a cabinet 'dominated by centre-left politicians' was keen to mete out punishment to MPs on the right. He said: 'We have recently seen people like Hugh Dykes manoeuvring to bring down the Post Office bill, which would have been one of the key items of legislation this year. But they have suffered nothing.' There was far less agreement in the party over the other main key issue now facing Mr John Major's government: how to plug the Pounds 1bn fiscal gap created by the climbdown on raising VAT to 17 1/2 per cent. Rightwing MPs called for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to announce more spending cuts in his 'mini-budget' today. But others hoped the chancellor would raise more revenue - possibly on wine or tobacco - amid signs that little more could be squeezed from a spending round that has already been tough. An MP who closely monitors economic strategy said: 'He has to replace a tax measure with a tax measure.' The chancellor would want to avoid altering the structure of fiscal planning in the Red Book. There were signs, though, that Mr Clarke might risk a new rebellion on tax if he were to introduce a half-percentage point increase in the general rate of VAT to 18 per cent. One mainstream MP said: 'He cannot guarantee getting the whole-hearted support of colleagues.' He said that the party had to move away from its tax-raising image. Another said the chancellor would need to resist taking his revenge on the party by introducing punitive taxation. 'He needs to avoid the temptation of saying 'I told you so' to the rebels,' the MP said. Above all, there was debate about the extent to which Tuesday night's vote had damaged the political future for Mr Major and Mr Clarke. Mr Major's prime ministership was widely seen as safe because the closing date for applications to the party's annual leadership contest closed last week. 'He is very lucky the VAT issue did not come up earlier than it did,' said one MP, claiming that this week's controversy would have been forgotten in 12 months. But some privately admitted that Mr Clarke's determination to take on the rebels and go through with the VAT increase in his Budget had damaged his chances of becoming leader. One MP said that Mr Clarke had had a faultless spell as chancellor, but that he had resisted repeated calls for VAT to be scrapped. 'It will be difficult for him to get over that mistake,' he said. Mr Jonathan Aitken, the chief secretary to the Treasury, was one of a number of cabinet ministers who expressed confidence that the party could restore its fortunes in the new year. But there were private concerns, too, that the government was so weak that it could soon face a new crisis.</p>

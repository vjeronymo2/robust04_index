			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / ITV to issue writ over soccer deal THE ITV companies last night said they planned to issue a writ today against the new Premier League for alleged breach of confidence. ITV failed yesterday in its attempt in the High Court to get an injunction to block the Pounds 304m five year joint British Sky Broadcasting-BBC deal for football television rights, which would have given ITV the chance to increase its Pounds 262m bid. But Mr Trevor East, ITV's executive producer for football said after the hearing: 'We are encouraged to hear that the High Court believes we have an arguable case for breach of confidence, and therefore we plan to issue a writ tomorrow against the Premier League for damages that we believe could be substantial.' ITV claimed it had been put at an unfair disadvantage because its bid had been leaked to BSkyB by Mr Rick Parry, the league's chief executive, just before the meeting on Monday last week when the Premier League clubs considered the offers. Mr Justice Ferris said the league had clearly indicated it would not be prepared to consider a new offer from ITV and it could not possibly be right to make an order forcing it to do so. The judge added that ITV could return to court for a full hearing of its case and the court might take a different view - 'although I very much doubt it'. Mr Frank Barlow, chairman of BSkyB, said the decision had confirmed his faith in British justice. Mr Barlow, who is also managing director of Pearson, which has a significant stake in BSkyB and owns the Financial Times, described the unsuccessful ITV attempt to obtain an injunction as 'an act of despair'. BSkyB rights to live Premier League games - the BBC will show recorded highlights - would 'open up a whole range of commercial options', Mr Barlow said. He declined to elaborate. One option is to make Premier League football available without extra charge on Sky Sport to encourage the public to buy satellite dishes. New revenue would then come from persuading them to subscribe to film channels. Another option is to scramble Sky Sport and charge a Pounds 5 per month subscription fee for it from the outset and move, at a later stage, to pay-as-you-view for top matches. After yesterday's hearing Mr Parry said he was relieved by the outcome. 'We have achieved a demonstrably better deal for the clubs and the league as a whole - and that was the only issue from our point of view,' he said. Mr Christopher Carr QC, for ITV, had argued that the contract with BSkyB had been procured by breach of confidence. Mr Parry had 'communicated sufficient of the terms of the ITV bid to enable BSkyB to formulate a new claim which took account of the ITV bid'. That had breached an implied term that ITV's bid would be treated in confidence and not revealed to a rival bidder. Mr Carr claimed that the league and BSkyB had finalised their contract 'with unseemly haste' on Thursday in an attempt to defeat any High Court action. In evidence read to the court, Mr Parry said he had told Mr Sam Chisholm, BSkyB's chief executive, of ITV's offer - though not the figure. Spitting contest, Page 17</p>

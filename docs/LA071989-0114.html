			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> COMPROMISE WATERS DOWN DURANG'S WIT  </P> <P> The Resident Theatre Company's production of Christopher Durang's "Beyond  Therapy" offers a case-study in compromise in the theater.  </P> <P> This time around, Durang's nasty appraisal of the state of personal  relationships is set in the early 21st Century but still is meant to be  symbolic of our generation.  </P> <P> The Muckenthaler Cultural Center in Fullerton, where "Beyond Therapy" is  staged, isn't used to such goings-on. Like most community theaters, typical  seasons have avoided confronting subscribers with controversy -- the themes  (homosexuality and promiscuity, among others) in Durang's black comedy aren't  often explored.  </P> <P> Tom Blank, the play's director, believes that it's about time for the  Fullerton-based RTC and the Muckenthaler to take a few chances. But in the same  breath, he admits that his handling of Durang is a compromise designed to put  the writer's words and attitudes on stage, but in a way most palatable to the  audience.  </P> <P> Blank has to be admired for wanting to move in a more challenging direction.  Trouble is, his approach, while capturing the essence of "Beyond Therapy,"  dilutes the acid that's supposed to seep through. Durang, a writer of uneven  talents, is all about shock and offense, but here his vaguely subversive  notions don't always register.  </P> <P> The production's attempt at accessibility primarily affects the play's tone.  Very little of the frank dialogue has been altered or excised, but the  delineation of characters comes with the broadest of comic strokes that reach  for guffaws rather than knowing grins.  </P> <P> While working on the play's pacing, Blank said he felt compelled to have big  laughs come often enough to keep the audience watching, despite the  provocations. The results are, for the most part, overly wild  characterizations.  </P> <P> Case in point: After we meet Prudence and Bruce (Carol Barbee and Patrick  Rowe), the lonely neurotics who embark on a bizarre relationship after  answering personal ads in the newspaper, we're introduced to her therapist  (Steve Porter), a sexually dysfunctional sleazeball.  </P> <P> Porter's therapist, with his rayon Melrose-Avenue duds and an unrequited desire  to bed Prudence, is all leers, groping and innuendo. He gets lots of laughs,  but he's a whoopee-cushion of a gag. "Beyond Therapy" isn't the subtlest  comedy, but it is more pungent and complicated than that.  </P> <P> This show works best during the scenes between Prudence and Bruce, especially  their first meeting when Bruce reveals too much of his twisted self and  Prudence reveals too little. Barbee shines, infusing Prudence with the needed  cloud of bemusement (which often slips into numbed disgust) that hangs over  everything she does. The fidgety, self-conscious Rowe reacts nicely to what  she's all about.  </P> <P> Bruce's male lover (Bruce proudly calls himself a bisexual) is given a clever  reading by Carlos Lacamara, an actor who has mastered the mortified take. It's  a fairly flouncing portrayal, but not over-baked.  </P> <P> As for the setting (the year 2021), it doesn't really hurt the play, but  neither does it add much. Besides the obvious point that finding love is sure  to remain a difficult business, even in a Brave New World, there isn't any  relevance to the decision. Of course, it does give Mela Hoyt-Heydon the  opportunity to dress the men (but not the women for some reason) in  semi-futuristic outfits, while allowing sound designer Brad Williams the chance  to use a few spacey noises. Gil Morales' revolving Tomorrowland-like set,  although crowded, is an adept solution to the play's needs.  </P> <P> 'BEYOND THERAPY'  </P> <P> A Resident Theatre Company production of Christopher Durang's comedy.

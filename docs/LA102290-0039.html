			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> Barber and Edwards in One Studio: Sportscaster Red Barber and National Public  Radio host Bob Edwards finally spoke face to face Friday after nearly 10 years  of conversing over the phone on NPR's popular sports segment. Millions of  listeners hear Barber in his distinctive Florida drawl talk by telephone with  Edwards at 7:35 every Friday morning on the "Morning Edition" program.  </P> <P> But the pair has never done a broadcast in person. Edwards was in Tallahassee,  which is Barber's home, for a fund-raiser to benefit an NPR affiliate. Barber,  82, has been in broadcasting for 60 years and is best known as the voice of the  Brooklyn Dodgers from 1939 to 1953 and his trademark "Oh Doctor!" marking big  plays. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

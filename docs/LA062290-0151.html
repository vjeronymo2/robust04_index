			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> 600 INTERVIEWED FOR CLUES TO GIRL'S KILLING  </P> <P> Sheriff's investigators say they have interviewed more than 600 people and  expect to talk to dozens more as they attempt to solve the gruesome slaying of  a 9-year-old girl.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department has set up a command post outside the Hudlund Drive  home where Autumn Wallace was slain.  </P> <P> Investigators on Thursday continued to scour the house for clues, Lt. Richard  J. Olson said.  </P> <P> Autumn's body was found in her bathtub last Friday by her mother, Linda  Wallace, 42.  </P> <P> Investigators believe that Autumn was killed when one or more intruders broke  into the Wallace home while the girl was alone. She was last seen by neighbors  playing in front of her home in an unincorporated area between Stanton and  Anaheim.  </P> <P> Autumn's 18-year-old sister, April, said she arrived home from work and noticed  that several items were missing from the house, including a TV, videotape  recorder, microwave oven and mirror.  </P> <P> Frightened, April went across the street to a neighbor's house and asked  whether anyone had seen anything unusual. About 20 minutes later, Linda Wallace  returned home and found her daughter's body in the back bathroom.  </P> <P> Since the slaying, the family has not been allowed back into the house because  of the continuing investigation. The Wallaces have been staying with friends.  </P> <P> Olson said investigators are using a laser-detection system that seeks out  fingerprints and clothing fibers that would otherwise be undetectable.  </P> <P> "How it works is that they spray something like super glue in the rooms. When  the fumes set, they go in with laser lights to see what they come up with,"  Olson said. DAVAN MAHARAJ  </P></p>

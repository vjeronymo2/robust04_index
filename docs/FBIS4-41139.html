			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Ambassador to Ukraine Vitaliy </F> Vladimirovich Kurashyk by M. Shymanskiy; place and date not  given: "I Am Ambassador; What Can I Do?"]    [Excerpt] [Shymanskiy] Well, Vitaliy Vladimirovich, what  can you tell me about your work at the embassy?    [Kurashyk] Our embassy is staffed by only three diplomats,  so  we are swamped with work. In addition, everything is  complicated and our bilateral relations are not so cloudless.  My situation, however, is rather secure because I am personally  acquainted with all the leaders of Ukraine. My previous work as  Crimean prime minister has served me well.    Hence, if I need a high-level meeting I have no problems  getting one.    [Shymanskiy] Are there many Belarusians residing in Ukraine?    [Kurashyk] Some 450,000. This is not a small number.  Approximately 52,000 Belarusians live in the Crimea, where the  situation is rather troubled. Our countrymen turn to our  embassy with various problems such as, for example, issuing  visas, helping with inheritance issues, and so on. Of course,  we do not turn their requests down and try to conscientiously  perform all consular duties.    [Shymanskiy] Ukraine is experiencing a rather tense social-  political situation. How would you characterize it?    [Kurashyk] The legislative elections are over, the corps of  deputies has been formed and has begun work. The Republic is  looking forward to the presidential elections. However, this  implies harsh political battles. Well, the same refers to  Belarus, which is also electing a president.    Ukraine has its own specific features. It is more  heterogeneous than Belarus. Its west differs from its south in  political sentiments and administrative organization. In  addition, it has the Crimea, which has its own president. All  this, along with a deep economic crisis, intensifies the tension.    [Shymanskiy] Belarusian-Ukrainian relations have  traditionally been strong, friendly, and diverse. We have  always been proud of this. Neighbors, brothers.... What about  current relations?    [Kurashyk] Currently, some politicians want to disintegrate  our brotherly relations. Let us take the economy, for example.  Our Belarusian economy is in many aspects closely connected  with the Ukrainian economy. We became independent states (of  course, this is a positive issue) but our economic contacts were  severed and this inflicted a lot of difficulties and problems on  us.    Of all CIS states, Belarus remained as virtually the only  state with which Ukraine could cooperate on a partnership basis.  What about our current foreign trade contacts? They do not  meet our demands. I can provide only two figures for you. Last  year, Belarus fulfilled only 41.7 percent of its deliveries to  Ukraine; Ukraine -- 44 percent.    [Shymanskiy] Let us be sincere: Are you willing to admit  that the two states simply do not want to cooperate with one  another?    [Kurashyk] Why? We simply cannot exist without one another.  We have signed some 20 intergovernmental agreements. This is a  considerable number. How are they being implemented? To my  regret, not properly. Our mutual deliveries do not meet the  demands of both Belarus and Ukraine.    [Shymanskiy] So, what is the problem?    [Kurashyk] I will provide you with only some of the  arguments. The mechanism of holding control over the  implementation of these agreements has not been worked out  properly. Both sides are responsible for this situation. In  addition, frequent changes in the Ukrainian leadership also  blocked the implementation of our pacts. During the past three  years, there have been four prime ministers in Ukraine. When a  prime minister quits, his entire team also quits. When I meet  with a minister and remind him that this or that agreement is  not being implemented, it often happens that he knows nothing at  all about this issue. It is as if he does not have to implement  the decisions adopted before him. However, the point of  discussion is bilateral agreements, the implementation of which  is not a prime minister's private business but an important part  of state economic policy.    [Shymanskiy] Well, let us assume that frequent changes of  leaders is a domestic matter of Ukraine. However, can both  states implement what they have already agreed upon?    [Kurashyk] In my opinion, we should establish -- both in  Ukraine and Belarus -- a sort of coordinating center to deal  with our trade and economic relations. In fact, we currently  lack an organization which is responsible for implementing these  agreements. Each ministry is responsible for its own narrow  interests. Even statistical data issued by the Ministry of  Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the Customs  Committee are completely different. Can this continue on this  way? Ukraine has already adopted a decision to establish its  own trading house in Minsk. Belarus should follow this example.    Belarusian and Ukrainian enterprises can resolve many issues  regarding their mutual deliveries. In fact, they will resolve  these issues on the condition that they have efficient managers.  This is good because you should not stand idly by and wait  until politicians make a deal.    [Shymanskiy] This opinion is expressed not only by you, as  Belarusian ambassador to Ukraine, but also by our Belarusian  managers. This is the voice of one crying out in the  wilderness. How long will this last? Can our embassy do  anything?    [Kurashyk] We can cry as long as we wish, however, no one  will resolve issues for us. We should join our forces and seek  real ways of stabilizing our bilateral trade and economic  relations. What does our embassy do in this regard? I am  sincere: We could not handle these issues before because we  lacked experts. However, our embassy has now hired Petr  Pyasetskiy as our trade and economic adviser. He is an  efficient and enterprising person, who well understands both the  system of production and economics. So, appropriate work is now  under way.    We chose a large group of Belarusian enterprises which are  leaders in their sectors and have a high export potential. They  have to calculate mutual deliveries in karbovanetses and  Belarusian rubles. They have already drafted an agreement on  this issue. We have high hopes that this agreement will soon be  signed.  <H5>  They Cut the Branch on Which They Sat </H5>   [Shymanskiy] I know that the Belarusian  Scientific-Industrial  Association and the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs do a lot in this direction. How do you assess  their efforts?    [Kurashyk] You properly defined their work as efforts. Of  course, I approve of their work and try to support those who can  do something in this regard. First of all, I am speaking about  Belarusian and Ukrainian managers of enterprises. They do  everything possible to draw our economies closer.    [Shymanskiy] This is a very difficult thing to do because  even the leaders of our states cannot solve this issue properly.  What can managers do?    [Kurashyk] Nevertheless, they have managed to do something.  Recently, Belarusian and Ukrainian industrialists met in Kiev  and discussed their business relations. I am referring to  direct economic relations between Belarusian and Ukrainian  enterprises. They decided to draft a program on mutual  cooperation to establish joint projects and develop new types of  competitive products... As far as I know, interesting proposals  will be submitted to our governments.    [Shymanskiy] Are Belarusian and Ukrainian politicians  keeping  themselves for themselves? Who listens to them?    [Kurashyk] Excuse me, but it is no fault of theirs if no one  listens to them. Let those people who -- due to their official  positions -- have to listen and react to them. I am holding out  hope that the Belarusian and Ukrainian Governments -- to which  participants in this meeting addressed their proposals -- will  behave in this way.  <H5>  Does our Ambassador Have To Wait Long in Ukrainian </H5> President's Admission Room?    [Shymanskiy] It seems to me that there are other arguments  negatively affecting our bilateral relations. They are of a  political nature.    [Kurashyk] The point is that neither the Belarusian nor the  Ukrainian Government has the patience to tolerate some political  developments. For example, I can hear some people in Ukraine  criticizing Belarusian-Russian economic relations, in  particular, their intention to unite in a single ruble zone.    [Shymanskiy] Why should Belarus coordinate its policy with  Ukraine? It is a sovereign state...    [Kurashyk] You are right. Belarus can choose its own  political and economic track in line with the wishes of its  people, legislature, and government. Next. Not all people  realize why Belarus decided to become a nonnuclear state. I have  to explain this often, primarily to foreign diplomats accredited  in Kiev. I am not boasting but they often meet me and talk  about Belarusian developments. As to the question of our  nonnuclear status, I explain to them that one Chernobyl -- the  consequences of which will have to be dealt with for several  decades -- was quite enough for Belarus. In fact, we are alone  in implementing the Chernobyl cleanup program. Who would even  think about nuclear weapons in such a situation?    [Shymanskiy] Are you often received by President Kravchuk?  How long do you usually have to wait to be received by the  president?    [Kurashyk] Why should I often visit the president? We should  not bother the president with various and sundry trifles. I  come to him only on urgent occasions to discuss important state  matters. In addition, there are no complications with being  received in the presidential office. I have never waited longer  than 10 minutes. In my opinion, the point is not in my  personality but in the president's attitude toward our Republic  and its people. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Kurdish MPs stand trial The treason trial of six pro-Kurdish former MPs resumes today in an Ankara security court where prosecutors will continue reading their 400-page indictment and presenting evidence to the judges. But the government now says the six may stand for re-election in December in by-elections called to fill their vacant seats. The six were arrested in March after the Turkish constitutional court dissolved their DEP party and lifted their parliamentary immunity. They are accused of membership of the outlawed PKK Kurdish Workers party and plotting against the state. The charges carry the death sentence.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES SHOPPER: RUGS LOOM LARGE AS EXCELLENT BUYS IN PORTUGAL  </P> <P> Among the most beautiful collectibles available in Portugal are handmade  Arraiolos rugs.  </P> <P> Hand-embroidered in beautiful, earthy and vibrant colors and intricate  patterns, the rugs are still created according to centuries-old techniques,  making them affordable treasures that will likely increase in value.  </P> <P> Although the rugs are available in specialized shops in the United States and  other countries, smart shoppers who buy in Portugal have a great advantage.  Prices in the United States are generally five or six times higher. Further,  the selection available in Portugal is better, and rugs can be specially  ordered for color and pattern.  </P> <P> Credit for initiating Portugal's rug-weaving tradition probably can be given to  the Moors who wove carpets to use as wall coverings and prayer rugs. When the  Moors settled in the village of Arraiolos (pronounced Ar-ray-oh-loush), where  fertile farming and grazing land was available, they taught their rug-making  techniques to local women and the town's name thereafter became synonymous with  embroidered rugs.  </P> <P> Now among Portugal's leading cottage industries, Arraiolos rugs are still  fashioned using the Moors' exacting techniques. Traditionally, the rugs were  made in the home, but recently the work has moved to small factories.  </P> <P> To make the rugs, a sturdy jute backing is covered with an elongated  cross-stitch reinforced by a double thickness of wool yarn.  </P> <P> Because manufacture of Arraiolos rugs doesn't require a loom, they can be made  in any size, shape, pattern and color.  </P> <P> Two grades of stitching are used: fine point and gros point. Fine point allows  for greater intricacy of design but requires more time to make and is,  therefore, more expensive. It also is more durable.  </P> <P> Rugs made during the 17th and 18th centuries were often rectangular and used  four basic design elements. Plants, including two dozen varieties of flowers,  were popular, as were geometric patterns based on intricate linear Moorish  designs. Animals and birds, hearts, crowns and amphoras were also used.  </P> <P> During the 19th Century, the Napoleonic Wars, the exile of Portuguese nobility  to Brazil and economic difficulties undermined Portuguese rug-making. But the  industry was revived in the early 1900s by Portuguese artist Jose de Quieros,  who researched ancient patterns and found bright, clear dyes. Rug-making spread  from Arraiolos to other towns in Portugal, especially to the north near the  city of Oporto.  </P> <P> Arraiolos rugs attracted international attention between 1920 and 1940 when  Europeans and Americans began collecting them. New design elements, based on  French Aubusson and English floral patterns, were introduced.  </P> <P> Today, some rugs are made with modified palette and patterns to suit the tastes  of contemporary buyers, but many traditional design elements, especially floral  and geometric patterns, have been retained.  </P> <P> Several people may work on one rug simultaneously. It takes a fast worker about  15 days to complete about 40 square inches of fine point, which has more than  40,000 stitches. Such work makes the prices sound like bargains.  </P> <P> Ready-made rugs cost from $12 to $28 per square foot. Special orders cost 35%  to 45% more. U.S. import duties will add 9.8% to the purchase price.  </P> <P> After purchase, the rugs are easy to transport home. A 9-by-12-foot rug can be  folded into a suitcase-size bundle. Or the rugs can be shipped.  </P> <P> In Lisbon, an excellent source of Arraiolos rugs is Casa Quintao, a  century-old, family-run business. The shop (at Rua Ivens 30) regularly exports  rugs to the United States.  </P> <P> On the first floor, you'll find antique furniture and objets d'art. The rug  treasury is on the second floor, up a palatial stairway that is often cluttered  with burlap-bagged rugs ready for shipment. The walls of the spacious gallery  are covered with exquisite and varied Arraiolos, many with grand dimensions. On  the floor are stacks of variously sized and shaped rugs. You can spend several  pleasant hours lifting rug corners to peek at items buried in the stacks.  </P> <P> If you're not sure of colors, you may request sample yarns to bring home for  comparison with other furnishings. Before you buy, check for quality: Place the  rug on the floor to make sure it lies flat and inspect the underside to see  that the pattern is as clearly defined there as it is on the top.  </P> <P> Casa Quintao also sells a limited selection of Arraiolos rug kits that include  all supplies and instructions. A 2-by-4-foot rug kit sells for about $65, a  4-by-6-foot for $150.  </P> <P> Another good Lisbon rug shop is Arraiolos Trevo (Avenida Oscar Montiero-Torres  33-A), which has a fine selection.  </P> <P> Or you might prefer to visit Arraiolos for the day. The town is about 90 miles  southeast of Lisbon. If you go, you'll still see women busily stitching rugs  along the town's charming cobblestone streets.  </P> <P> In Arraiolos, Tapetes de Arraiolos Condestaval has a fine collection of rugs  and will fill special orders. The shop also has a branch in nearby Evora. Both  shops are open 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 7 p.m. In Arraiolos, workshop hours  are 8 a.m. to noon and 1 to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday.  </P> <P>  Prices quoted in this article reflect currency exchange rates at the time of  writing.  </P> <P> </P></p>

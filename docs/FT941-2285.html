			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Pledge sought on Swan Hunter The French-owned company hoping to buy Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, said yesterday it would not bid for the company unless it received immediate assurances about the Ministry of Defence's future policy on awarding naval contracts. Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie said it wanted written confirmation that if it bought Swan Hunter: It would be allowed to tender for future MoD contracts. Its tenders, provided they were competitive, would be given equal consideration to those of rival UK yards. The MoD's Defence Export Services Organisation would support it in the export field. CMN is the only company to confirm that it intends bidding for Swan Hunter. But yesterday joint receiver Mr Ed James, of Price Waterhouse, said: 'Discussions are continuing with a number of parties working towards a deadline of March 24.' This date is the MoD's deadline for tenders for the Sir Bedivere refit, a contract worth about Pounds 30m for which there will be fierce competition. While in receivership Swans cannot win unless its tender is underwritten by a prospective purchaser. A bid for Swans from any company is likely to be conditional on winning the Sir Bedivere refit. Mr Fred Henderson, leader of the CMN bid team, said that in spite of receiving 'lots of verbal come-on' during months of talks with the MoD, CMN had not received categorical assurances on future policy. Unless this was obtained in writing by tomorrow CMN would not bid for Swan Hunter and would not underwrite its tender for the assault ship Sir Bedivere. 'There's no point making a final bid for the yard unless we get these assurances,' he said. Swans needed UK defence contracts to compete with credibility for overseas naval orders. Mr Henderson said: 'If it really is the situation that the British government would rather Swans did not survive we would want to know before we bought it.' The MoD said it had no objection to Swans in foreign ownership bidding for MoD work provided it was on a sound financial footing, could comply with national security arrangements and guarantee any MoD work would be done in the UK.</p>

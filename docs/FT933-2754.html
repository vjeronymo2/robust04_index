			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Japan's Economic Boost: Hosokawa's first economic package fails to excite - William Dawkins examines Japan's Y6,150bn stimulatory plan and what it is likely to achieve BOTH IN size and scope, the first important economic initiative of the new Japanese government headed by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa failed yesterday to excite. Even the prime minister could describe the package, a confusing mixture of short-term pump priming and long-term reform to Japan's economic structure, only as the best that could be expected at the time. At Y6,150bn (Pounds 37.3bn) the package is dwarfed by the previous two stimulatory initiatives - Y13,600bn was allocated in April and Y10,700bn laid out in August last year. Government officials argued that it is deliberately small. For a start, 90 per cent of the previous package remains to be spent, according to Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister. The bulk of this would be spent only in the second half of this year, senior officials added. On top of this, it is the first such package to include policy changes, with its proposals for 94 steps to deregulate the economy and plans to pass some of the benefits of the yen's rise to consumers. The stock market was not convinced and slipped 2.1 per cent ahead of the evening announcement, as details slipped out during the day. A chorus of business leaders appeared on television just after the announcement, complaining that Mr Hosokawa had not seen fit to respond to their demands to cut income tax and that the Bank of Japan had not reduced official interest rates. Instead, the package promises a review of the tax system, to be carried out by a government panel due to report by mid-April. The markets still think the central bank will cut its discount rate some time this month, though it is being cautious because it wants to see more companies get rid of surplus capacity before encouraging a further drop in borrowing costs. Private sector economic analysts estimated that the package includes between Y1,000bn and Y3,000bn of genuinely new spending, with the rest coming from existing government budgets or being shifted from one sector to another. 'It is just not enough,' said Mr Tom Hill, strategist at S G Warburg Securities in Tokyo. Mr James Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo, adds: 'Everyone should have known it was going to be disappointing. The politics are so complicated, there was never more than a one in three chance that Mr Hosokawa would have come out with something ambitious.' The government's Economic Planning Agency, often criticised for erring on the optimistic side, forecast yesterday that the package would add 1.3 percentage points to gross national product over the next 12 months. So which bits of the Hosokawa plan will have most effect? Most of the 94 deregulation proposals, which include and enlarge on the 60 deregulation measures announced by Mr Hosokawa two weeks ago, may harm some sectors in the short term, but bring important benefits in the long term, say analysts. A few promise instant relief, like a plan to deregulate part of the bond market, which should give companies easier access to funds. The most radical of the proposals to bring the rewards of the strong yen to consumers, is for the government to publish a monthly list of the import cost prices of basic goods, to exert moral pressure on high-priced retailers to trim their profit margins. The government also plans to urge importers to drop their prices, which will prove an interesting test of Japan's tradition of administrative guidance to industry. On spending, the package takes a similar approach to the previous economic stimulus plans, in that it seeks to improve Japan's creaking and heavily loaded public infrastructure. However, it does have more focus than previous plans on improving the quality of individuals' lives, with proposals for example to build parks, museums, and build slopes for wheelchair users. Cash is also being set aside for loans to small businesses, which complain of a credit squeeze, for tax incentives on machinery purchases and to enlarge government subsidies to companies in order to keep surplus workers on the payroll. It is, however, small beer. S G Warburg's Mr Hill estimates that the Y10bn increase in employment subsidy will cover a mere 5,000 workers. Meanwhile, few Japanese companies are likely to make much use of tax incentives for new equipment, since most are trying to follow the central bank's advice and slim capacity rather than increase it.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Clarke is aiming to lure new money - Personal equity plans / The options for expansion THE MEASURE: The range of eligible investments into a general personal equity plan (Pep) has been widened to include corporate bonds and convertibles of UK non-financial companies, and preference shares in UK and European Union companies from April 6 1995. WHAT IT MEANS: As their name suggests, Peps were designed to encourage equity investment. But, from next year, certain types of fixed-rate investments will, for the first time, also qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 general Pep allowance. Single company Peps, into which investors can put a further Pounds 3,000 a year, are not affected. The idea is to encourage the development of new sources of finance for companies, which is one reason why gilts - bonds issued by the government - have been excluded. The Pep industry has long lobbied for the inclusion of gilts and bonds into Peps, arguing that these would provide deposit-based savers with a bridge between the building society and equities. Paul Killik, of stockbroker Killik &amp; Co, says: 'The measure will bring another class of investor into Peps such as the elderly, who like the idea of a high and regular income but felt that Peps were not appropriate for them.' The reason is that bonds are often regarded as 'lower-risk' investments than equities. They are IOUs, where the borrower agrees to pay you a fixed rate of interest each year in exchange for a capital lump sum and returns your capital at the maturity date. Bonds issued by companies (corporate bonds) tend to offer a higher yield than gilts because of the higher risk involved; the government, after all, is regarded as better security than a company. But bonds, like equities, are risky investments if they are used speculatively to make capital gains. Since they can be traded, their market price is variable, so there is a risk of capital loss. 'I only occasionally recommend buying bonds for capital gain,' says Michael Dyson of BZW, the securities house owned by Barclays bank. 'They are best used for financial planning, since they pay a fixed rate of interest and have a fixed repayment date and price.' What are the characteristics of these types of fixed-interest investments? Corporate bonds. The new rules specify that corporate bonds eligible for a qualifying Pep can be ones issued only by UK non-financial companies. They must have a minimum term of five years to maturity and a fixed rate of interest. These bonds normally pay interest twice a year, with yields at present of 9 per cent gross and above. They are free of capital gains tax. The detailed rules have yet to be settled but the Inland Revenue says that Eurobonds (those structured to give them European-wide investor appeal) will not be allowed because they are in bearer form - the share certificates are like cash. The holder of the bond is assumed to be the owner but his name is not registered. The Revenue says that, under Pep rules, a registration facility must be available. Investments such as permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) do not qualify, either, since they are issued by building societies - which are 'financial' companies. Convertibles. These are bonds or shares which pay a fixed rate of interest. They differ from other fixed-interest investments by giving the holder the right, at a specified date, to convert them into the company's ordinary shares. The yield (normally quoted net of basic-rate tax) is usually less than that on bonds but more than ordinary shares. Once again, the convertibles must be in UK non-financial companies. Many convertibles are also preference shares. Preference shares. These company shares give the holder a better claim on its assets than ordinary shareholders (if the company is wound-up, preference shareholders must be paid before ordinary shareholders) but not the same participation in its growth. They pay a fixed dividend instead of a variable rate, linked to the profit the company makes. Yields are about 10.5 per cent gross for good-quality shares. The Pep rules allow the preference shares to be in UK and EU companies. All these investments must be in quoted companies if you intend to hold them directly. But if you hold them through a qualifying unit or investment trust, they can be in quoted or unquoted companies. Qualifying trusts are those which hold at least half their assets in UK or EU companies to qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 general Pep limit. The number of collective funds holding these types of investments is relatively limited now, but there are bound to be plenty by April.</p>

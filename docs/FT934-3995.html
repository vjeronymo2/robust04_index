			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Steel chiefs attack restructuring delay The chairmen of seven big European steel companies yesterday criticised the European Commission sharply for the lack of progress in its year-long efforts to restructure the industry by reducing overcapacity and ending state subsidies. In an outspoken open letter to their own industry ministers, steel leaders in six northern European countries - Germany, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg - launched a bitter attack on recent proposals to end the subsidies deadlock. 'There appears to be pressure to come to a 'solution' at any price, resulting in compromises which, regrettably, seem only to express a clear wish to get rid of a politically difficult issue,' they said. By supporting such compromises, Brussels would halt the momentum towards restructuring that it had itself endorsed by accepting the need to cut about 10m tonnes of hot rolling capacity in flat products. 'Unfortunately, the Commission, which is responsible for a strict application of the state aids code, seems to be showing a reluctance to apply it to those member states unwilling to abide by European law,' said the letter. Its tone underlines the private steel producers' exasperation, and echoes the UK's 'no deal is better than a bad deal' stance at last month's industry ministers' meeting. That meeting broke up after Italy rejected a Commission compromise on cuts in subsidies and capacity cuts at Ilva, the state steelmaker. Yesterday, however, Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said he was close to solving the Ilva dispute. The letter from the steel industry complained that, in spite of lengthy talks the result achieved by the Commission in the flat products sector was 'totally inadequate'. With the exception of the Ansio strip mill in Spain, no large flat products mill would be closed, and the creation of new capacity at Ekostahl, the struggling east German producer, could not be justified. In other areas, such as special long products, where subsidised producers were present, 'only small facilities seem to be facing closure while heavy loss-making, state-supported facilities continue to produce under the protection of a restructuring proposal'. The letters are signed by Mr Gerhard Cromme of Krupp-Hoesch, Mr Ernst Pieper of Preussag, Mr Brian Moffat of British Steel, Mr Francis Mer of Usinor-Sacilor, Mr Maarten van Veen at Hoogovens, Mr Joseph Kinsch at Arbed and Mr Jean Gandois at Cockerill-Sambre. Earlier yesterday, Mr Mer said 'industry members have been seeking to reduce production to support prices, while European governments have been acting irresponsibly'. He described the current situation in the industry as 'dire' and said next year was likely to be as bad.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Philip Bassett article: "CBI Sees No Need for Further Cut </F> in Rates"]    [Text] Business leaders yesterday saw no need for further  interest rate cuts after a leading industrial survey showed  manufacturing output rising at its fastest for five years.    But the latest Confederation of British Industry [CBI]  quarterly industrial trends report showed a weakening in  business confidence and investment intentions, and still more  job losses to come in manufacturing industry.    Government ministers will draw comfort from the CBl's  evidence of continuing economic recovery and from the unusual  statement by the CBI that business would prefer policy stability  rather than any further cuts in interest rates -- particularly  if they were small and likely to be reversed.    The Treasury saw the findings of the April trends survey as  encouraging, and in line with the general picture of an  improving economy. Officials pointed in particular to positive  signs on exports. They thought, too, that the 14-point slide in  business confidence largely reflected the changed timing of the  Budget and to some extent the impact of the April tax rises.    But City analysts saw the CBI findings as disappointing,  especially since April traditionally sees a seasonal surge in  confidence.    But the CBI stressed that the survey of 1,219 companies,  accounting for about half the UK's manufacturing employment and  exports, indicated continued recovery.    The survey's main findings included:    l. Confidence. The balance of firms declaring an increase  in optimism fell back from 27 to 13 per cent. The usual April  upturn did not occur for the first time in a decade.    2. Output. Expectations of increased output remain at a  high level -- at a balance of 16 per cent, the fastest rate of  increase since April 1989. The CBI said its figures pointed to  a growth of 0.8 per cent in manufacturing output over the second  half of this year.    3. Orders. Demand is expected to continue rising at its  current rate; a net balance of 16 per cent of companies reported  higher orders.    4. Exports. Export orders rose slightly more quickly than  in the four months to January, and a balance of 18 per cent of  companies forecast that they will continue to rise over the next  four months.    5. Investment. The balance of firms planning to invest more  slipped back from 7 per cent in January to 4 per cent. Kate  Barker, CBI chief economics adviser, said: "The lack of strength  in investment is worrying for the Government." The proportion  of companies saying they are working below capacity is slightly  up.    6. Jobs. Manufacturing firms are still pointing to a fall  in employment, in contrast to government figures. CBI officials  said a further 28,000 job losses were predicted for the second  quarter.</p>

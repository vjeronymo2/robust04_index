			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Safe custody of documents Because of the charges which her bank intends to make for the safe custody of her share certificates, an elderly widow is keeping them in her house. In the event of a fire or burglary, she would have to pay to get them replaced. Is there any other risk? Apart from the cost of replacing ordinary share certificates, there is simply the matter of the trouble and confusion that may be caused by their loss or destruction. If any of the certificates are 'bearer' certificates, then they are of value in their own right and should be protected as much as cash. We suggest that everyone makes a will. Very often, the solicitor that draws it up is happy to keep the original in the office safe at no charge. Such firms may well be prepared to offer safe custody of share certificates, too. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

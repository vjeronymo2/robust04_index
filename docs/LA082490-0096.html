			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE, DEVELOPER IN BATTLE OF THE SIGNS  </P> <P> After a dusty hike through Fryman Canyon with an entourage of environmentalists  and aides on Thursday, the head of a state parks agency accused developer Fred  Sahadi of illegally posting no-trespassing signs in the Studio City canyon, and  vowed to seek their removal.  </P> <P> Joe Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy,  also speculated that posting the signs on a heavily used trail was  "intentionally" designed "to ratchet up things to get more attention and more  money" as Sahadi jockeys to sell the canyon to the conservancy.  </P> <P> Sahadi could not be reached for a reply.  </P> <P> The conservancy, with help from the city of Los Angeles, has been negotiating  to buy the entire woodsy canyon just below Mulholland Drive in Studio City from  Sahadi and block his plans to build 26 luxury homes on the site.  </P> <P> But after weeks of talks, Sahadi informed Edmiston on Wednesday that he was  breaking off negotiations, convinced that the city was unwilling to contribute  $2 million of its own toward purchasing the canyon. Sahadi has said his  rock-bottom price is $8.7 million.  </P> <P> Yet Edmiston and Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo, who represents the  area, said that they believed Sahadi can be brought back to the bargaining  table. "It's just legal posturing," Woo said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Edmiston said he would ask the state attorney general's office today  to sue to prevent Sahadi from posting no-trespassing signs on 32 acres of  Fryman Canyon that Edmiston said should belong to the conservancy.  </P> <P> Edmiston spoke as he stood before two no-trespassing signs on a trail through  the canyon. Conferring with an aide over a detailed topographical map, Edmiston  declared that the signs were on property Sahadi was supposed to have deeded to  the conservancy in 1986, but never did.  </P> <P> His aide told Edmiston that a half-dozen other signs were posted on the same  disputed property.  </P> <P> The city had agreed to see that Sahadi donated the 32 acres to the conservancy  for open space as a condition of getting important city land-use approvals.  However, for reasons still unknown, the property never was deeded to the  conservancy.  </P> <P> Sahadi has said he will deed the property to the conservancy after he has  finished his project. Sahadi's plans show that he intends to build a temporary  road across the 32 acres. The road is needed for access for the major grading  work he plans for the site.  </P> <P> Edmiston said the conservancy also is likely to sue Sahadi in a separate  lawsuit to obtain title to the 32 acres.  </P> <P> The recent posting of no-trespassing signs, an armed guard at the canyon, and  the tagging of trees for destruction by construction crews have heightened the  anguish of environmentalists seeking to save Fryman. Several of them blocked  the road earlier in the week -- one woman parking her Mercedes Benz in front of  the gate -- to keep workers off the property.  </P> <P> "Sahadi is trying to antagonize and intimidate the neighbors and others out  here so they'll put pressure on the city to pay him whatever he wants for his  property," said Ann Rushton, staff counsel for the Conservancy.  </P> <P> It remains unclear whether such a strategy, if it exists, is working.  </P></p>

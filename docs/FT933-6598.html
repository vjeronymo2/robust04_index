			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The recent grip on the London Metal Exchange COPPER market by influential traders was not so evident yesterday and prices staged a downward correction. The cash premium over three months metal also eased back from above the Dollars 40 level it reached on Tuesday. The three months position closed at Dollars 1,937.50 a tonne, shedding Dollars 9 of Tuesday's Dollars 33 advance, while the cash premium closed in to Dollars 32.50 a tonne. The ZINC market continued Tuesday's late fall with the three months price dipping to Dollars 885 a tone at one point. But it steadied on profit-taking to end the after hours trading session at Dollars 889 a tonne, down Dollars 9 on the day. TIN prices fell back to the 20-year lows ruling before the recent spike and traders said the market was just reflecting the depressed fundamental situation, which had not changed. At the London bullion market there was another attempt to push the GOLD price through support at Dollars 370 a troy ounce just after the New York opening, but again professionals supported the market. PALLADIUM's recent decline accelerated, taking the price to Dollars 128.75 an ounce at the afternoon fix, the lowest since the end of June. Compiled from Reuters</p>

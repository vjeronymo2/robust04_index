			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Chrysalis tumbles to Pounds 32,000 and makes investment plans Mr Chris Wright, chairman of Chrysalis, the media and music group, warned shareholders yesterday of 'a sustained period of investment', which will have inevitable consequences for both financial performance and dividends. The Chrysalis chairman made his strategy clear yesterday as the company announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 32,000 on a turnover of Pounds 32.3m for the six months to the end of February. The modest profit compares with Pounds 104,000 for the same period last year, but a pre-tax loss of Pounds 14.6m for the year to the end of August 1993. The interim profit reflected a Pounds 1.4m credit from the release of provisions arising from closing down of MAM Leisure, the company's amusement machine manufacturer. Last year only a final dividend was paid with scrip alternative and Chrysalis said yesterday there would be no interim dividend. No decision has been taken on a final. Chrysalis has been building up its visual entertainment division by buying stakes in independent producers and setting up development deals for British film producers and directors. It has also been adding to its roster of songwriters for its music publishing activities. Mr Wright added that the company did not intend to change its accounting policies to capitalise the expenditure and financial performance, particularly for the current year, 'is likely to be compromised.' He pointed out however, that Chrysalis had made considerable progress towards achieving its long term goals and objectives - to become a broadly based media and music group. Earnings per share were 1.35p (0.2p), but following Pony Canyon's minority investment in the group's new Echo record label, net assets have increased to Pounds 53m, compared with Pounds 44m at the end of August. The share price closed up 4p at 175p.</p>

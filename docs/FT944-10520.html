			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Technology: Specialists come to the patient - Telemedicine may save time and money A pregnant woman lies on an examination table at St Mary's Hospital on the Isle of Wight. An ultrasound scan has picked up a potential abnormality in her baby. Eighty miles away, in Queen Charlotte's Hospital in London, an expert is watching the progress of the scan as it takes place on a TV screen. At intervals, he freezes the screen and takes measurements of the image. Within a few minutes, he is able to assure the sonographer and patient at the other end of the line that the pregnancy is normal. This system of transmitting scans at St Mary's to specialists in London via an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) link is now in the early stage of a six-month trial. Several benefits of the system are already apparent, according to Nicholas Fisk of Queen Charlotte's Hospital. It spares many women the anxiety of waiting for a consultation and the expense of travelling to a specialist centre. Because it is less stressful for the mother, sonographers are more likely to get a second opinion for borderline cases. The system may also save the specialist hospital time and money. The equipment - provided by BT for the trial - costs around Pounds 60,000. But it may allow the specialists to be more productive, reducing the Pounds 500 cost of the average consultation. The Isle of Wight experiment is not unique. The falling cost of equipment is encouraging hospitals around the world to experiment with telemedicine - transmission of medical data and images between medical centres - in order to improve services for remote areas or to make top specialists available to countries that lack a particular expertise. Last month, doctors in Saudi Arabia were linked to specialists in the radiology and pathology departments in the Massachussetts General Hospital, in what WellCare, the network provider, describes as the first international telemedicine link. The system works by digitising and compressing images of patients' X-rays, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and CT (computerised tomography) scans. These are then sent down telephone lines in the course of a few minutes to specialists at Massachusetts General Hospital, who can respond in minutes if the case is an emergency. Patients are charged the same fee as those who visit the hospital in person. The advantage is that this system depends on ordinary telephone lines. 'Doctors and patients most likely to need this service are those least likely to have access to sophisticated telecommunications,' says Ricky Richardson, executive vice-president of WellCare. Video conferencing is another increasingly important strand of telemedicine. Over the past year, a video connection between a community hospital at Peterhead in Scotland and the Accident and Emergency Specialist Centre in Aberdeen has saved many patients from having to make a 100-mile round trip to Aber-deen. A wide range of medical problems can be diagnosed in this way. Even psychiatric patients can be interviewed using video links, according to Steinar Pedersen, head of the department of Telemedicine at the University Hospital in Tromso, Norway. 'The patient feels in complete control,' he says. Doctors who have taken part in these experiments with telemedicine report that problems have tended to be related to administrative, rather than medical, matters. Telemedicine often cuts across existing funding mechanisms. It also raises issues of medical accountability and liability. But the champions of telemedicine believe these problems are surmountable and should be offset by its numerous advantages. They believe that telemedicine cuts the expense of consultations and so offers a partial solution to the spiralling costs of hospital care. It fits in with the ambitions of the UK government to decentralise the National Health Service. It should also make specialist services more convenient and accessible for patients.</p>

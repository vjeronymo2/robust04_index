			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Trading boost for Racal Electronics group Racal was the market's most heavily traded stock and one of its best performers after the group accompanied its preliminary figures with an optimistic statement on future prospects. The company's profits were affected by a near Pounds 20m write-down due to disposals and closure costs. But analysts and dealers focused on the company's optimism for the current year, particularly on profit margins, and a raft of profits upgrades are expected. Racal shares raced up to 251p as the market digested the good news from the analysts meeting, but subsequently came off their best to close a net 10 up at 248p. Turnover of 12m shares was the highest single day's business in the stock since its participation in Camelot, the consortium which won the race to control the UK's National Lottery.</p>

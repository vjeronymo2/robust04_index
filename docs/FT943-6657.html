			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Unit trust sales fall sharply - At a glance Unit trust investment fell sharply last month. Net investment fell to Pounds 646.4m in July from June's record Pounds 1.1bn. It was the weakest investment figure since January. Last month's figure was also down by almost one-third from net investment of Pounds 954.6m in July last year. The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds said one reason for the drop might be a switch by discretionary managers into direct holdings of UK equities at the expense of unit trusts. It also thought more people might be holding cash. Autif has released a new fact-sheet: 'Emerging markets: too tempting to resist or too hot to handle.' It is available from its information service on 081-207 1361.</p>

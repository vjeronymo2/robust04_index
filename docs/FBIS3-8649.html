			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by S. Padori: "The Alternatives `Covered' the </F> South"]    [Text] Three weeks after the Greek blockade of the border,  our state not only leads a normal life, at least regarding the  oil supply, but the established cooperation with, and the  understanding of, our eastern and western neighbors [Bulgaria  and Albania] inspired the eastern-western corridor. What is  even more important, compared to the August embargo in 1992,  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] met  this blockade with solid reserves of oil derivatives, therefore  there is time enough to make new agreements and activate new  alternative traffic directions without feeling the lack of oil  derivatives on the market.    The government appeal that panic was superfluous and that  the  "occupation" of the gas stations was unnecessary was fruitful,  at least during the past three weeks, because we saw that it was  possible to buy fuel with or without the concessions of the  Greek side!  <H5>  Reserves for Tranquility </H5>   According to yesterday's reserves of oil in the country,  consumers can remain calm. As Assistant Minister Tome Cemerski  stated for our newspaper, and as the government statement made  clear, the government is doing everything it can to ease the  situation after the blockade. Soon, a meeting will be organized  with Bulgarian representatives to sign an agreement on a faster  flow of petrol-carrying vehicles across the border. On the  other hand, the gas reserves are enough for a 70 days' normal  supply, diesel fuel for 82, crude oil for 60, and technical gas  for industry and kerosene for about 30 days.  <H5>  Alternative Warehouses </H5>   In the meantime, "Makpetrol" is working continuously on the  supply of new quantities of derivatives for its itself, and for  the Skopje Refinery. Thus, Ljubomir Janev, the general manager,  told us that an agreement has been already signed, and has  already been put in action, with the Bulgarian partners for the  supply of 10,000 metric tons of gas and diesel fuel, and for  3,000 tons of kerosene and technical gas. Between 50 and 70  petrol-carrying vehicles cross the Novo Selo border daily. In  order to facilitate the increased number of crossings of  vehicles carrying derivatives, it was agreed with the Interior  Ministry and the Customs Service to only use the Novo Selo  crossing.    After the blockade, some 52,000 tons of crude oil remained  in  the warehouses of "Jet Oil" and "Mamiddakis" in Thessaloniki,  31,000 tons of which are the property of "Makpetrol" and 21,000  tons belonging to the refinery. The value of the "plunder" is  about 7 million dollars, therefore the owners of the oil  ("Makpetrol" and the Skopje Refinery) insisted on the release of  the oil in a letter to the owners of the warehouses. According  to their agreement, when the crude oil has been accepted and  paid for, its loading and shipment to the users is guaranteed.  However, as we found out, the "answer" was that the owners of  the warehouses "are sorry, but we have to respect the government  decision."    As far as alternative warehouses are concerned, as we found  out, efforts are underway to activate two tanks of 5,000 tons  located in Vlora--Albania. There is not enough space in Drac to  store oil derivatives for Macedonia, and there have been  discussions with "Albatrans" about the two tanks in Vlora as an  alternative, which should now be emptied! If agreement is  reached, the tanks will be lent to the Macedonian distributors.  This alternative is quite favorable, because it could provide  derivatives from the Rijeka Refinery, which is very eager to  cooperate with "Makpetrol" and the Skopje refinery. In that way  it would be possible to have lower transport costs, and even  better, this alternative route for derivatives could be reopened.    Anyway, trouble caused by the blockage on the southern oil  route has contributed to the reopening of the eastern and  western transport corridors, which were looked on in the past as  a reserve that few wanted to become the main distributing  routes. However, now that it has become an imperative, it did  not turn out to be very difficult; it was just another  confirmation that life goes on, even without the southern  crossing.</p>

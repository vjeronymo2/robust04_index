			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCOUT INJURED, 6 ACRES BURNED IN BRUSH FIRE  </P> <P> An Explorer Scout was injured and six acres of brush burned in a fire believed  to have been deliberately set Tuesday on a Glendale hillside less than two  miles from the site of a disastrous fire that destroyed or damaged 66 homes in  June.  </P> <P> The fire broke out about 1:20 p.m. near Menlo Drive and Vista del Mar in an  area of expensive hillside homes, said Glendale Fire Capt. Steve Wood.  </P> <P> No homes were damaged, Wood said.  </P> <P> It took firefighters four hours to quell the blaze. The unidentified Explorer  Scout, who was working in a fire training program, was treated for heat  exhaustion and released from Verdugo Hills Hospital. The cause of the fire was  listed as suspicious.  </P> <P> It was the second brush fire in two weeks in Glendale. A faulty power  transformer was blamed for a 7-acre greater-alarm fire Aug. 20 in the Rossmoyne  section of the hills. The roof of one house was slightly damaged in that blaze.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Another power project will be constructed in the  Philippines. President Ramos, on Monday, led the groundbreaking  rites for the Masinloc coal-fired thermal power plant in  Zambales in northern Luzon. The $525.6 million project will add  600 megawatts of electricity to the Luzon grid by 1998.    In his speech, the president told the residents of Masinloc  to discard their fears of environmental pollution and hazards  that the project may bring. The president assured them that  this will not happen due to the rigid standards adopted by those  involved in the planning and construction of the new power plant.</p>

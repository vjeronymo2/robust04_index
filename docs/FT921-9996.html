			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Advice found wanting THE British consumer takes pot luck when seeking financial advice, according to a study in Which?, magazine of the Consumers' Association, this week. Two Which? investigators each visited 20 financial institutions - including banks, building societies, accountants, solicitors and insurance companies as well as independent advisers - giving detailed case histories and asking for advice.

A third of the FSA-regulated companies visited by Which? did not supply a guide. The investigators noted wide variations in standards of advice within the same class of institution. One investigator found that the Yorkshire Building Society thought it sufficient to deal with his requirements in a single 'phone call. The other found that 'Yorkshire conducted the meeting as a good adviser should.' Which? also reports a mixed performance from the life insurance companies. One investigator found that General Accident and Friends Provident gave very good advice, but the panel felt the advice given by insurance companies to the other investigator did not meet his needs. Banks were criticised, with the experts finding that they 'generally failed to get enough personal information.' The Midland adviser's explanation of a Tessa was described as 'inaccurate and misleading.' Independent advisers were praised for the suggestions they gave one of the investigators.

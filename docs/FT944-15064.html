			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Waging war over bread and baked beans: Neil Buckley on superstores' change of direction in their battle against the discounters Mr David Sainsbury, chairman of J Sainsbury, broke something of a taboo in the food retailing industry on Tuesday by admitting that big food retailers in the 1980s had allowed the prices of basic commodities to 'drift upwards'. Superstore chains such as Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway, owned by Argyll, have always strenuously denied accusations that they 'overcharged' customers, allowing them to make 'excessive' profits in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The accusations resulted largely from the fact that the retailers' operating profit margins at up to 8 per cent were three or four times those of continental European food retailers. But superstores did not achieve such margins by putting a few pence on a packet of sugar or a carton of milk. They achieved them partly by expanding their ranges to include a far bigger proportion of high-margin goods such as own-label products, fresh, chilled, and ready-prepared foods - the creme frache, guavas and microwaveable lasagne that have transformed the nation's eating habits. At the same time retailers reduced costs by exploiting the economies of scale of larger stores, centralising their distribution through large regional warehouses and investing in check-out scanning and powerful computer systems. However, as Mr Sainsbury told the annual convention of the Institute of Grocery Distribution, the industry body funded by retailers and manufacturers, allowing basic food prices to creep up opened a gap in the market for cut-price discounters such as Germany's Aldi and Denmark's Netto, which have expanded in the UK since 1990. His comments help explain the so-called 'price war' in the grocery market in the past year. While there have been promotions on other products, superstores have focused on cutting prices on basic goods in an effort to squeeze out the discounters. That such a war has been waging in certain product areas is beyond doubt. Cans of baked beans are selling for 4p in discount chains in some regions, and loaves of white bread for 9p. The competition has taken its toll - Shoprite, the discount chain operating mainly in Scotland, has issued two profit warnings and expects only to break even at operating profit level this year. While skirmishing on basic food prices goes on superstore groups are continuing to emphasise their 'added-value', ranging from choice and quality to big car parks and baby-changing facilities. Moreover, by continually adding higher-margin products and services, superstore groups are effectively limiting the damage done to overall gross profit margins by price competition on basics. Tesco last month said its gross margin in the latest half-year had recovered to 0.1 percentage points below a year earlier, compared with 0.7 points in the previous half-year - thanks partly to its introduction of clothing and leisure goods into stores. That ability to protect margins enabled Mr Sainsbury, with Mr David Reid, finance director of Tesco, and Mr Colin Smith, chief executive of Argyll, to tell the IGD convention that in spite of the short-term pressures on grocery retailers, the long-term outlook was bright for the big groups. All admitted that new superstore sites were dwindling and it was becoming more difficult to get planning consent for out-of-town stores following publication of new government guidelines last year. But they suggested superstores were moving from their 'expansion' stage to 'maturity'. The way forward, Mr Smith suggested, was to keep on improving product ranges, cutting costs and raising the performance of existing stores - emulating the example of Marks and Spencer, the UK's most profitable retailer. M&amp;S has increased profits in recent years with limited physical expansion in the UK. Moreover, with planning restrictions closing in, the fact that big grocers invested heavily in prime sites in the past decade left them in a dominant position in the market. Mr Reid said: 'I have no doubt that in 10 years' time we will be able to look back and see that superstores proved to be excellent long-term investments in a continually changing market.' But the big groups are finding new routes for expansion. Mr Sainsbury suggested they had been too eager to leave the high streets, where there was still business to be done, and where the retailers' new-found skills and efficiency enabled them to earn acceptable returns. Both Sainsbury and Tesco have opened revamped town-centre formats, called Central and Metro respectively. Mr Smith of Argyll also spoke of the need to 're-energise city centre stores and services'. Having conquered the edge-of-town areas, the big food retailing groups may start to reconquer the high streets.</p>

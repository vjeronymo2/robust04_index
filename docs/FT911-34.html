			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / TVS unveils plan to raise equity as it falls into red TVS Entertainment, the ITV company for the south of England, yesterday announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.3m and cancelled the final dividend at the same time as unveiling plans to raise new equity. The new equity will, however, only become available if TVS retains its lucrative and hotly-contested southern franchise. TVS declined to give any details on this before tomorrow's deadline for bids for new 10-year franchises beginning in 1993. The financial package will include a new shareholder and promises of further investment from the company's existing French shareholders, Canal Plus, the subscription channel and Generale d'Images, the communications company. TVS would need the capital injection to fulfil its programme obligations because of the losses sustained in the 1988 acquisition of MTM, the US production company, in a Dollars 320m (Pounds 189m) deal. At least three well-funded bidders are going for the TVS franchise - MAI, the marketing and financial services group, Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications and the David Frost/Richard Branson joint venture. TVS yesterday announced losses arising out of a poor performance from the US group. TVS made a profit of Pounds 16.8m in the year to end-December, compared with a profit of Pounds 20.8m in the 14 months to the end of 1989. However, an exceptional provision of Pounds 20.7m was made against US programme stock. MTM had four new series cancelled by the US networks last year - Capital News, FM, City and You Take the Kids. In addition, Pounds 4.4m has been set aside for further redundancies. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 4m, against an extraordinary gain of Pounds 30.4m a year earlier, resulted in a net loss of Pounds 10.1m, or 17.6p a share, compared with a net profit of Pounds 40m, or 8.8p per share. Turnover was Pounds 262.1m (Pounds 325.5m). Earlier this year, TVS tried to sell MTM, famous for programmes such as Hill Street Blues and St Elsewhere. Despite much interest, no one would pay more than Dollars 70m. MTM has been withdrawn from the market. In Britain, TVS increased its share of ITV advertising revenue to 11.4 per cent - the highest in its history. The decision that TVS is 'unable to pay further dividends' means that the interim payout of 3p in November is the final one.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Advertising revenue aids Grampian TV Increased advertising revenue and reduced costs helped Grampian Television, the independent broadcaster for north Scotland, to increase interim pre-tax profits by 17 per cent from Pounds 1.55m to Pounds 1.81m. An exceptional item of Pounds 340,000 represented Grampian's share of start-up costs associated with Scot FM, the central Scotland radio station launched in September. Mr Calum MacLeod, chairman, said yesterday that other significant contributions came from the hire of facilities, the news service contract with GMTV and funding from the Gaelic Television Committee for a range of programmes. Sales in the half-year to August 31 rose to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 9.87m). Operating expenses took Pounds 7.77m (Pounds 8.16m). The channel 3 licence payment was Pounds 366,000 (Pounds 360,000). The increased interim dividend of 2p (1.5p) is designed to reduce the disparity with the final. Earnings per share came through at 8.8p (7.4p).</p>

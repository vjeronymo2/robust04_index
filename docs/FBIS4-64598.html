			<p>BFN     [Text] The government of Finland has welcomed the outcome  of the vote of the European Parliament on Finland's EU [European  Union] membership. Prime Minister Esko Aho described the  outcome of the vote as a positive piece of news, and Foreign  Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen as a dramatically good result.  The government was delighted that a larger majority than  expected of European deputies voted for Finland's membership.  The government was following the voting by the European  Parliament at its evening meeting at the Prime Minister's  residence in Kesaeranta. The government agreed at its meeting  that the date for the EU national referendum and the size of  national subsidies will be decided by the 26 May.</p>

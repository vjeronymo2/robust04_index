This was stated on  Monday by a member of the State Duma Igor Bratishev at a Moscow  conference in a document entitled "Russia's road to popular  government and socialism".    Among other things the program suggests immediately freezing  prices, stopping privatization and invalidating the  privatization documents that "ignore the rights of workers and  the public interest."    The former chairman of the USSR Supreme Soviet Anatoliy  Lukyanov said: "Presidency in general is alien to Russian and  Soviet mentality." He is convinced that Russia needs "a strong  representative body and a strong government subordinate and  accountable to this body."    A former top-ranking official in the Soviet Communist Party  Yegor Ligachev announced that preparations have begun for the  second congress of peoples of the USSR due in September-October.  The first congress was held in Moscow on 20 September l993.</p>

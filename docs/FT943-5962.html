			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Observer: Tiny matter Getting rid of Tiny Rowland may be easier said than done. It's one thing stripping him of his executive duties, but it may be quite another persuading him to vacate his office. Dieter Bock, the German financier determined to sack his joint chief executive, was recently aghast to find Paul Spicer still firmly installed at the Lonrho's Cheapside headquarters. The former Lonrho deputy chairman was supposed to have retired early this year. But apart from having procured himself a new desk, Spicer was acting as if nothing had changed. Quite how Bock had overlooked Spicer's continuing presence for so long remains a bit of a mystery, but, now alert to the problem, he has apparently vowed he will make future personnel changes stick. We shall see.</p>

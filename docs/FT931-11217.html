			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Options pit move lifts Fox coffee trading TRADING VOLUME in robusta coffee futures and options contracts has soared at London Fox since its new options pit was opened at the end of last year. Mr Robin Woodhead, who took over as chief executive of the troubled exchange in October last year, said yesterday that he was extremely pleased with the increase in volumes, which had followed positive action by the exchange. Coffee options turnover hit a record 28,666 lots for January, the first full month of trading in the new pit. This marked a 63 per cent rise on December  -itself a record month. Trading in the underlying futures contract, which was only 63,000 lots last November, reached 112,524 lots in January. Cocoa options also showed strong growth, trading 11,925 lots in January, the best month since March 1991. Cocoa futures traded 142,178 lots, up from a figure of 83,515 in December and 136,737 in November. The options pit was moved to a position in between the coffee and cocoa futures markets on December 14, and a wall between the two markets was removed. 'We believe the relocation has resulted in a significant increase in both options and underlying futures trading,' said Mr Woodhead. The London Fox chief executive plans to focus on increasing business in the core contracts at the exchange, which was in the doldrums for more than a year after a scandal in its now defunct property futures market. The exchange has just received 'a detailed and exhaustive study' of the sugar market from Landell Mills, the commodity consultants. Mr Woodhead said that the exchange hoped to make a decision on the future of its raw sugar market by the end of March. The contract, which has switched from floor trading to screen trading and back over the past couple of years, has on some days registered no volume. The International Petroleum Exchange yesterday approved the extension of the forward trading range on its gas oil contract - widely used by airlines to hedge jet fuel prices - from nine months to 18 months as from March 12. The IPE said the move was made in response to demands from industry users.</p>

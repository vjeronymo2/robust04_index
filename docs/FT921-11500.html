			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: UAL posts largest quarterly loss UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, yesterday reported its largest ever quarterly loss - Dollars 252.6m - and warned that it planned to cut its capital spending by at least Dollars 2bn over the next three years because of the sluggish economic outlook. The capital spending cuts represent around 13 per cent of the Dollars 15.8bn the airline has budgeted for in the period 1992-1995, but it declined to specify just where the axe would fall. Other US airlines have also been trimming their capital expenditure plans for the next few years, but so far this has not impinged seriously on the order books of Boeing or McDonnell Douglas, the two large American civilian aircraft manufacturers. UAL, which had repeatedly warned Wall Street about poor fourth-quarter figures, took Dollars 130m of special pre-tax charges in the period. Some Dollars 64m was to cover what it called 'retroactive pay and benefits related to the settlement of labour contracts'. The rest covered expenses for the settlement of certain disputes, the write-down of parts due to the removal of DC-8s from its fleet, and increased accruals for employee benefits and purchased services. A spokeswoman would not elaborate. The fourth-quarter losses, which the special charges augmented by Dollars 85m, worked through at Dollars 10.69 a share. That compared with a loss of Dollars 123.5m, or Dollars 5.66 a share, in the same period of last year. The company's previous record quarterly loss, Dollars 157m, occurred in the first quarter of last year, when air traffic was badly hit by the Gulf war. In 1991 as a whole, the company lost Dollars 331.9m, or Dollars 14.31 a share, compared with net earnings of Dollars 94.5m, or Dollars 4.33 a share, in 1990. Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman, said the losses were an 'exceedingly unsatisfactory end to a very dismal year'. Pan Am, the US airline which ceased operations in early December, announced yesterday that it was suing Delta Air Lines for damages of at least Dollars 2.5bn. It alleged that Delta's breach of a funding agreement between the two had forced it to stop flying. A similar suit was filed last month by Pan Am's unsecured creditors.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading BUSINESS in the UK derivatives area increased smartly yesterday as markets respon-ded to predictions from German economists of a cut in the Bundesbank's discount rate today, writes Terry Byland. The September future contract on the FT-SE 100 re-established a good premium of around 10 points against cash, trading at 3,097 at best. At the close the contract stood at 3,080, a premium of 9 against cash and about 3 above estimated fair value - the quotation on the contract which allows for carrying costs and dividend payments on the underlying stocks. However, interest cooled off after the Bundesbank said it planned no press conference for today. More significantly, volume increased to 10,488 lots in the September contract, compared with under 6,000 on Tuesday and below 7,000 on Monday. The picture was the same in traded options, where volume jumped to 37,622 contracts from Tuesday's 22,382. Both the FT-SE 100 option (8,442) and the Euro FT-SE option (2,919) saw increased interest. Among individual stock options, oils were active, with Lasmo (2,390) still very busy as the underlying stock con-tinued to trade heavily on hints of a shake-up in the industry. But the most active spot was taken by Amstrad, the consumer electronics company, with 2,510 contracts dealt. Glaxo, the subject of US interest again, had 1,842 lots traded.</p>

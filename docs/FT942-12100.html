			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Heinz swaps TV adverts for direct marketing HJ Heinz, the food manufacturer that brought the British public such memorable advertising campaigns as Beanz Meanz Heinz, is planning to create a new slogan - Heinz Meanz Direct Marketing. Mr Tony O'Reilly, the flamboyant chairman and chief executive of the Pittsburg-based international food group, is planning to end UK commercial television advertising for his products this year and instead concentrate on direct marketing. Mr O'Reilly, whose career in marketing took off after he created the Kerrygold campaign for Irish butter in his early 20s, believes the era of mass marketing is giving way to more targeted selling techniques. The Heinz plan to give up television advertising would be one of the most radical marketing moves in recent years by a food manufacturer. It comes as manufacturers of branded food products are facing growing competition from cheaper, own-label goods produced by supermarkets. The Heinz account is one of the longest established in television advertising. Heinz has already built up a database of 5.6m homes in the UK that are heavy users of the company's products. Mr O'Reilly plans to send special discount vouchers directly to those homes, thereby bypassing conventional advertising media such as television and newspapers. The discount vouchers will be for individual Heinz products, such as baked beans, but also for groups of Heinz lines. Mr O'Reilly has decided that direct marketing is the most cost effective way of maintaining loyalty to the brands. He sees the plan as the start of a 'guerrilla' campaign against the increasing power of the large supermarket groups, which he believes sometimes treat branded products cavalierly. If Heinz goes ahead with its plan and proves that direct marketing to its best customers works, it could be a blow to ITV, which has depended heavily for its income on the advertising of mass market products, particularly fast-moving grocery goods.

			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Parties clash on taxation and benefits - Election campaigning THE TWO biggest parties yesterday struggled to hold the media spotlight with Labour switching its campaign to pensions and benefits and the Tories concentrating their fire on the opposition's tax and spending plans. At rival briefings in Westminster, Labour fielded Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, to challenge the government's record on child benefits and pensions while officials at Tory Central Office issued a new dossier entitled Labour's Tax Shambles. Mr Smith used his platform to contrast his commitments to increased benefits with the claim that the government's efforts to hold down child benefit had cost a family with two children Pounds 404 since 1987. Touching on this week's row over value added tax, he claimed that 1988 figures showed indirect taxation meant the poorest fifth of pensioner households paid nearly 40 per cent of their gross income in tax while the richest fifth of non-retired households paid just 34 per cent of their income in tax. Commending Labour's commitment to increase pensions by Pounds 5 for single people and Pounds 8 for couples and to increase child benefit to Pounds 9.95 a week, he said the differences in the tax burden were a direct consequence of 'bizarre and deeply unfair' Tory policies. He was backed by Ms Harriet Harman, shadow health minister, who claimed that government neglect had meant one in four British children lived at poverty levels - double the figure that the government had inherited in 1979. Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman, presented an eight-page assault on Labour's past statements on tax and spending. Claiming that Labour's charge that the government would lift VAT from 17.5 per cent to 22 per cent was a 'scare' story intended to distract the voters' from its own confusion on tax, he argued that 'the shambles' over the past few weeks had destroyed Labour's credibility. His attack was echoed by Mr Tony Newton, the social security secretary, who claimed his Labour shadow, Mr Michael Meacher, had committed his party to Pounds 15bn of unfunded expenditure on benefits. On National Insurance, Mr Smith would not say whether the removal of the ceiling on contributions would be immediate or phased. The decision could be taken only after the Budget or when Labour saw undisclosed Treasury figures after a general election. He went on to reject Tory claims that repayment of NI contribution overpayments to those earning below Pounds 21,000 would be costly or complicated.</p>

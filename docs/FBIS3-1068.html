			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos's spokesman,  Aldomiro da Conceicao, has reacted to Jonas Savimbi's address on  the UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]  radio station, VORGAN, by remarking that UNITA's deeds do not  match its words:    [Begin recording] [Conceicao] As far as UNITA -- and, in  particular, its leader -- are concerned, we have learned to pay  more attention to what is done than to what is said. Savimbi  has accustomed us to bombastic statements designed to impress  public opinion, and his actions after such statements are  totally at odds with them. Naturally we cannot agree with many  of his opinions on the present political situation in Angola and  also with regard to Portugal. At any rate his speech did not  impress us, and did not even have any bearing on the  negotiations, because we are less concerned with words than with  deeds and with the stances adopted by UNITA both at the Lusaka  negotiations and very especially on the battleground.    [Unidentified correspondent] Dr. Aldomiro da Conceicao.  Regarding Lusaka, Dr. Savimbi has expressed confidence and the  belief that a lasting peace agreement will be struck soon. Do  you share Dr Savimbi's optimism?    [Conceicao] We have always described ourselves as being  moderately optimistic. We have some hope that Lusaka may indeed  bring a peace agreement to Angola.

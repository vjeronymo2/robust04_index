DPR&hyph;77 and DPR&hyph;79 for the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Soddy Daisy, Tennessee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes would have modified the facility technical specifications pertaining to alternate steam generator tube plugging criteria that was designed to take into account the reinforcing effect that the steam generator tubesheet has on the external surface of expanded steam generator tubes referred to as Westinghouse Explosive Tube Expansion (WEXTEX) region. The new criteria was designed to reduce the need for repairing or plugging steam generator tubes having indications that exceed the current technical specification depth-based plugging limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 3, 1993 (58 FR 7006). However, by letter dated June 28, 1994, the licensee withdrew the proposed change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated November 18, 1992 (which was supplemented by letter dated January 8, 1993), and the licensee's letter dated June 28, 1994, which withdrew the application for license amendment. The above documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Library, 1001 Broad Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 5th day of July 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> David E.

			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: HUMAN ERROR PUT AN END TO THE SHORT LIFE OF RILEY  </P> <P> Ready for a real downer at Christmastime? Read on.  </P> <P> Each year at the La Jolla Christmas Parade, the county Department of Animal  Control brings a couple of dozen dogs that are up for adoption. The dogs are  said to be "marching for their lives."  </P> <P> Four years ago, Florence Lambert adopted an Irish wolfhound named Mickey from  the parade. Lambert, a retired nurse, belongs to Friends of County Animal  Shelters, or FOCAS.  </P> <P> This year she was chairwoman of a FOCAS bake sale held in connection with the  parade. She spotted a 10-month-old Australian shepherd puppy named Riley.  </P> <P> Riley was not among the 18 dogs adopted that Sunday. He put up a fuss when a  handler tried to put him into a cage.  </P> <P> "It was almost as if he knew what would happen to him if he wasn't adopted,"  Lambert said. "I couldn't stand it anymore."  </P> <P> An Animal Control employee started to fill out the forms so Lambert could adopt  Riley. But a paperwork hitch arose.  </P> <P> A deal was struck: Riley would be returned to the San Diego shelter and Lambert  would get him the following Thursday.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Lambert called the shelter. To her horror, she learned that Riley  had been put to death on Tuesday.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to let that little guy die in vain," said Lambert, her voice  breaking. She wrote county officials in protest.  </P> <P> Animal Control Director Sally Hazzard said Riley was mistakenly put to death  because an employee didn't put enough information in the computer to keep him  off the "euthanasia list."  </P> <P> The employee was disciplined, along with two employees who handle the  euthanasia chores, Hazzard said. She declined to specify the kind of  discipline.  </P> <P> She noted that, last year, Animal Control was forced to destroy 26,000  unadopted animals. She said mistakes like the one that killed Riley happen once  or twice a year.  </P> <P> "All we can do is offer sympathy and an apology," Hazzard said. "It's  devastating to all of us."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Back and Forth  </P> <P> Necessity is somebody's mother.  </P> <P> * Fountain Fresh Inc. of Del Mar plans to sell a line of disposable  toothbrushes and razors with gel-filled handles.  </P> <P> For the busy executive. To be called "On-the-Go Products" and mass-produced in  South Korea.  </P> <P> The gel substitutes for toothpaste or shaving cream. Doesn't taste bad, either.  </P> <P> * Wolf Freeman, a retired stockbroker living in San Marcos, has invented tennis  shoe laces that don't need tying. A tiny plastic barrel works like a cinch.  </P> <P> "Makes your sneakers feel like slippers."  </P> <P> * The San Diego Newspaper Guild is selling a 1991 wall calendar, with color  photographs from the Union-Tribune and daily labor history reminders.  </P> <P> * A San Diego company has been awarded the contract to provide limousines in  Southern California for parties, airport trips and such tied to Super Bowl XXIV  in Tampa.  </P> <P> Jon Chester, owner of Limousines by Linda, figures it will take 30 or so limos.  </P> <P> A dozen of those will be for rock performers being feted by MTV executives.  Rockers are big football fans.  </P> <P> * San Diego's first Alternative Care Hotline has been started for people  looking for a massage therapist, chiropractor, acupuncturist, hypnotherapist or  holistic health practitioner.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Manual Dexterity  </P> <P> Come fly with me.  </P> <P> USAir is offering its Fearful Flyers classes at Lindbergh Field starting next  month.  </P> <P> The white-knuckle, stomach-churning set will work with a clinical social worker  and a veteran USAir pilot to overcome their aviaphobia. Graduation is a  one-hour flight, complete with guests.  </P> <P> Some studies say one in six Americans is afraid of flying. Hence the search to  reduce airborne stress.  </P> <P> Here's my suggestion: Flight attendants should be instructed not to stroll down  the aisle at 20,000 feet carrying a highly visible Emergency Manual.  </P> <P> An attendant on a USAir flight between San Diego and San Francisco did  precisely that recently. Scared the bejeebers out of some of the passengers.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISTIANI'S PLEA FOR CONTINUED MILITARY AID  </P> <P> Thank you for your very timely and accurate editorial on continued military aid  for El Salvador ("Congress: Don't Fall for It," Sept. 25). Unfortunately,  neither you nor Congress has taken a strong enough position.  </P> <P> The war is not only, as you say, "ugly and unwinnable" -- but totally immoral.  You condemn the military as having "too much political clout" when, in fact, it  has total control of the politics of the country.  </P> <P> There is only one way to force the military to negotiate honestly with the FMLN  and to respect the human rights of the Salvadoran people, and that is to  discontinue all, not just half, of the proposed $85 million in aid.  </P> <P> Until Congress stops supporting the Salvadoran military, congressional hands  will be stained with the blood of the Salvadoran people.  </P> <P> MARY BRENT WEHRLI, Executive Director, Southern California Ecumenical Council  Interfaith Taskforce on Central America, Los Angeles  </P></p>

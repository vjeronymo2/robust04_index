			<p>BFN     [Text] A top-ranking official of the Chechen presidential  staff has said he doubted that a republican delegation would  soon arrive in Moscow for bilateral consultations. In an  interview with Interfax, he recalled that the Chechen government  had taken a resolution under which all contacts with Russia were  to be maintained solely through the Chechen Foreign Ministry.  This decision was made last week in order to regulate Groznyy's  relations with Moscow.    The chief of the staff of the Russian president, Sergey  Filatov, told Interfax that consultations with Groznyy were  supposed to involve both the republican authorities as well as  political parties and movements of the Chechen republic.  However, after a recent meeting of Russian and Chechen  representatives the Chechen side said further talks would be  inexpedient, for there were "no political forces in control of  the political situation" in Russia. In addition, the Chechen  leadership had been making statements that the opposition's  participation in the talks in any form would be unrealistic.    In the meantime, Interfax learned from reliable sources that  Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev consulted experts Monday on  the possible imposition of a moratorium on talks with Russia.  Interfax was told that the experts insisted on the moratorium  in view of Russia's unconstructive position.    The same sources said Dudayev had not yet made his choice.</p>

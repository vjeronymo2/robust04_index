			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "i.m., kps": "Dispute Over Sudeten Germans: </F> Prague and SPOe Against Mock"]    [Excerpts] Vienna/Prague -- Foreign Minister Alois Mock  finds the debate over the Charles IV Prize, which will be  awarded to him by the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft on Saturday  [21 May], sad: "This discussion reflects a tragic human  catastrophe of German history," Mock told DIE PRESSE on Thursday.    Mock said he thinks people can learn their lessons from  history; the European unification process based on German-French  reconciliation was one of these enormous learning processes, and  it still is today.    "In the case of Germans in the Czech Republic, I have always  spoken out for the protection of human rights, and I will  continue to do so in the future -- my commitment in the CSCE and  the Council of Europe also proves this," Mock added.    Mock finds the irritation about his comparison of expulsions  and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia especially incomprehensible: "I  only mentioned views of [Czech President Vaclav] Havel's that  are supported by quotes and which I found very impressive, which  I share and which have never been revoked." [passage omitted]    Karsten Eder, chairman of the Sudeten Germans in Austria,  cannot understand "why the Czechs are making such a fuss when  someone is awarded a prize for advocating a just order of  nations. I cannot understand how they can protest against this.  I also cannot understand how the Czech Government can react  with dismay and indignation to an invitation by the Sudeten  German Landsmannschaft," Eder said. Like Mock, he stressed that  problems can only be solved through talks. [passage omitted]</p>

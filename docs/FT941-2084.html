			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Waigel pours scorn on SPD's tax plan Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday denounced the tax reform plans of the opposition Social Democrats as wrongly calculated and grossly extravagant, claiming they would lead to substantial tax increases for the great majority of taxpayers. Seizing on the opposition plans for a fairer redistribution of taxation to pay for the cost of German unification, Mr Waigel plunged into the first real controversy of Germany's marathon election campaign with a welter of statistics, designed to terrify the country's property-owning middle classes, as well as average income-earners. He said the new spending plans outlined in the election platform of the Social Democratic party (SPD) would add around DM60bn (Pounds 23.3bn) to the government's annual DM480bn budget, and prove impossible to finance from the present level of taxes and social insurance contributions. SPD plans for a 10 per cent income tax surcharge on the better paid, instead of the current 7.5 per cent surcharge on all taxpayers, would have to begin at income levels of DM44,000 a year to produce the same revenues, he declared. The SPD hopes of levying the surcharge on taxable incomes of DM50,000 for single earners, and DM100,000 for married couples, would leave a DM6bn shortfall. He also singled out the SPD plans for increased taxation on property and savings as likely to add another burden of at least DM10bn on property-owners. 'It wants to punish the top performers of our society through a considerable tightening of the tax system, although the top 10 per cent of taxpayers already pay more than 50 per cent of tax,' Mr Waigel said. Mr Waigel's predictable intervention reflects the delight of the ruling liberal-conservative coalition in Bonn at the potential electoral dynamite in the SPD tax plans, in spite of the fact that they are intended to be neutral in their overall effect. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader, admitted yesterday that his presentation of the plans last week might have been mistaken, by failing to make clear that the 10 per cent surcharge would affect taxable incomes of DM50,000 and above, not gross incomes. The result has been a barrage of press criticism, and concern in his own party ranks, that the plans would affect many average income-earners. He insisted that more than 80 per cent of all taxpayers would actually be relieved of the present planned 7.5 per cent 'solidarity surcharge', and fewer than 20 per cent be forced to pay the higher rate. As for increased wealth taxes, he said they would not be increased across-the-board, and would exempt private pension and life insurance policies, as well as business property. He also promised a review of the present tax on interest incomes, which has caused a huge flight of capital from Germany to neighbouring Luxembourg. Mr Waigel said the SPD's proposals would drive investors to deposit billions of marks in foreign tax havens, undermining economic growth in Germany. 'What the SPD is presenting is an employment programme for Monaco, perhaps for Liechtenstein and parts of Switzerland, but certainly not for Germany,' he said.</p>

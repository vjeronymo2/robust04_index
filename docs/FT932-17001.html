			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: BNP fall reflects gloom in French banking BANQUE Nationale de Paris, the state-controlled bank which is poised for privatisation by France's new conservative government, saw net profits fall by 26 per cent to FFr2.17bn (Dollars 396m) last year from FFr2.94bn in 1991, reflecting the gloom in the French financial sector. The bank is also cutting its dividend to FFr7.50 from FFr10.50. BNP was affected by the general pressures on the French banking sector. Net banking income rose by 5.2 per cent to FFr39.92bn from FFr37.93bn, with operating profits up by 8.9 per cent to FFr11.81bn from FFr10.85bn over the same period. Mr Rene Thomas, chairman, said the group had been hit by the sluggish state of the banking market and by the sharp increase in bank borrowing costs towards the end of the year, when short-term interest rates escalated during the Bank of France's battle to defend the franc. However, the chief problem for the bank was the impact of the economic slowdown on its property portfolio and also on its smaller corporate clients. The group raised net provisions to FFr8.38bn from FFr8.08bn in 1991. It made new provisions of FFr10.14bn, but recouped FFr1.76bn of write-downs made in previous years on loans to developing countries.</p>

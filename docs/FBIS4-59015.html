			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rami Shani] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres yesterday reiterated  the government's commitment to safeguarding the security of the  Qatif Bloc Jewish settlers, even though they are a very small  group. The minister disclosed that the cost of the initial  security arrangements will stand at approximately 30 million  shekels, in addition to an annual outlay of 20 million shekels.  As an example, he cited the need to build a security system,  including a 7-km road to one of the settlements. "We are doing  it to keep the agreement from collapsing," the minister noted.  "The opponents of the agreement with the PLO are trying to  scare and unnerve the residents of areas through which Arabs  will drive," Peres said at a ceremony to mark the laying of the  cornerstone for a new 'Amal technological college near Ashqelon.  "It all depends on relationships, not security," the minister  stressed. "There is no fence between Elat and al-'Aqabah, and  relations there are excellent. Arabs live in Yafo, too. A new  relationship must be created."    Peres denied rumors spread two days ago that Israel is not  going to continue the talks with the PLO on the issues that  remained unresolved when the Cairo agreement was signed.  "Israel will adhere to its commitments," Peres stressed. With  regard to foreign labor hired by Qatif farmers, the minister  said it is preferable to employ Israeli laborers in agriculture.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article with no byline] </F>   [Text] In the second modified budget to be submitted by the  cabinet to the Diet on 30 November, the Science and Technology  Agency (STA) included the expedited construction plans for two  key projects -- SPring-8, a large radiating light facility,  which is being constructed in the Harima Science Park City in  Hyogo Prefecture, and the Communications and Broadcasting  Engineering Test Satellite (COMETS), which is scheduled to be  launched in FY96.    Both projects are being accelerated in the belief that they  will contribute to the enrichment of the citizen's life, which  is one of Prime Minister Hosokawa's key slogans. The STA  modification budget is expected to run up to &yen;16.1 billion.    The budget for the radiating light facility includes about  &yen;7 billion in electron beam accelerator construction costs.  The facility is being constructed through a joint effort of the  Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI) and the Institute  of Physical and Chemical Research (IPCR). It will accelerate  electron beams to a speed close to the speed of light with a  linear accelerator and a synchrotron, and the resulting  radiating light that will be generated when the electron orbit  is bent will be taken out as a beam line to be used for  materials experiments and medical diagnoses.    STA included &yen;7 billion for the expedited construction  of  said facility even in the first modified budget and is going to  allocate &yen;12.7 billion for the same purpose in the  preliminary budget request for the next year. The modification  budget this time will make sure at least a portion of it becomes  usable in FY97. About &yen;6.2 billion has been budgeted for the  development of COMETS to expedite the manufacture of the  engineering model and the actual unit. The development of this  satellite, intended for television broadcasting, was started in  FY90.</p>

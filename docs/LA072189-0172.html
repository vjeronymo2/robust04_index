			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TAIWAN REFUSES FISHING BOAT CHECK  </P> <P> Taiwan today refused to allow American personnel to board and inspect two of  its fishing vessels suspected of involvement in the sale of $1.3-million worth  of illegal salmon, a U.S. government spokesman said.  </P> <P> One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one of the two Taiwanese  vessels attempted to ram a government-chartered boat that was shadowing it in  the Pacific Ocean.  </P> <P> Reed Boatwright, spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, said the Coast Guard cutter Morgenthau and another vessel were  shadowing Taiwanese craft.  </P> <P> "The Taiwanese have refused permission to board," Boatwright said. "It was  fairly emphatic. Options are being prepared at the moment, but they are not  beyond the draft stage."  </P> <P> Earlier this week, federal agents arrested two Taiwanese men as they emerged  from a bank vault in Seattle carrying suitcases containing more than $1 million  in cash that they allegedly received as payment for 500 metric tons of  illegally caught salmon.  </P></p>

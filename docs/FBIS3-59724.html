Introduction </H5>   The characteristic of recent demand for electric power is  that while demand for the maximum level of power is increasing,  the amount of electricity in demand is not increasing  proportionately (Fig. 1). For instance, the demand for the  maximum power in the area supplied by Tokyo Electric Power for  1991 was 1.9 million kW, an increase of approximately  5.3&percnt;.  while an increase in the amount of electricity used was no more  than 3.5&percnt;. This is reflected in the load factor expressed  in  terms of facility use efficiency, which was reduced to  5.5&percnt; in  1991.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-32A>             Fig. 1. Growth in Maximum Electric Power and Amount of </FIG>       As for the maximum electric power, in spite of the  recessionary time brought about by the collapse of Japan's  bubble economy, demands still are climbing, recording 4.1  million kW (a 4.2&percnt; increase over the previous year's  figure).    This is translated into an increase investment costs,  putting  pressure on management; in addition, it creates problems from  the standpoint of efficient use of energy, as it reduces the  efficiency of power generating facilities used to adjust loads  for thermal and other forms of power generation.    Given this situation, in order to operate power generating  plant and electric supply facilities efficiently, utility  companies must level electric power load as much as possible.  Since the only method of storing power currently in use is by  pumping, the industry is hoping for a new storage technology to  emerge.    With this as a background, since 1984, Tokyo Electric Power  and NGK Insulator jointly have been developing a power storage  system, utilizing a sodium-sulfur battery. Since the NaS battery  has a higher energy density compared with those of traditional  batteries, it can be produced in compact size and installed in  metropolitan suburbs.    In terms of its capabilities, our R&amp;D effort was able to  produce satisfactory results. Based on this new technology, we  developed a 50kW battery for the practical prototype equipment  and began its validation test in November of last year. This  report, then, will deal with the 50kW NaS battery, focusing on  its properties.  <H5>  2. Summary of NaS battery </H5>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-33A>             Fig. Structure of Single NaS Cell </FIG>       As shown in Fig. 2, the NaS battery largely consists of  three  parts, viz., active sodium and sulfur materials and an  electrolyte and a separator, &bgr;'' alumina. &bgr;'' alumina is  a  fine ceramic through which only NaS ions can pass, and unlike  ordinary batteries, it is made of a solid electrolyte; hence it  does not discharge by itself. Moreover, sodium and sulfur used  as active materials have a high Clark number and are available  in abundance. as resource.    Since they normally must operate at high temperature of  300-350&deg;C, they are collected in an insulated container and  used in a module form. Temperature control inside the container  is performed by an electric heater.    Since open voltage near the charge end is 2.08 v., during  discharge, sodium ions move through the solid electrolyte to the  positive electrode, and during discharge, the reverse process  takes place. At that time, it is possible to convert 96&percnt;  of  change in entropy into electric energy. The remaining 4&percnt;  is  taken out or taken in in the form of heat. Heat generation takes  place during the course of discharge and heat absorption during  the course of recharge. The theoretical energy density expressed  in weight is 786Wh/k.g. and in mass, 1008Wh/l. Compared with  traditional batteries, it has much higher energy density.       Table 1.

Present State of NaS Battery Development </H5> <H5>  3.1. Development Goals and What Thus Far Have Been Achieved </H5>   Our present goal is to achieve in the battery the level of  electric storage capability equal to that achieved by a pumping  method, and toward this end, we have developed the necessary  specifications. Criteria used for index are durability,  efficiency, cost, and safety. (Table 2).       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

Validation Test Schedule </H5>   The field test of the NaS battery began in March 1990 at  Kawasaki Electric Power's storage-linked-system-test station.  The test was conducted in 3 stages (Table 3). During the first  stage (10kW/80kW/h), a battery grouping technology, designed to  group a large number of small batteries into one module, was  examined; during the second stage (100kW/400kWh), basic  technologies involved in systematization, designed to combine 25  modules to construct a system, were studied.    Testing of the 50kW battery, covered by this report, was  conducted as a validation test. Our purpose is to validate the  capabilities of the 50kW battery which will become a  commercialized prototype equipment using 300Wh-class large cells.       Table 3.

Performance Evaluation of 50kW/400kWh NaS Battery </H5> <H5>  4.1. Characteristics of 50kW Battery </H5>   The characteristics of the battery are as follows:    (1) A 50kW module will provide a basic structural unit of  transportation and construction in the future in constructing a  MW-class power storage system; and (2) By considering a  simplified system when put into practical use, we opted for a  simple construction involving only a few pieces of equipment.  <H5>  4.2. Summary of 50-kW Battery System </H5>   (1) Battery Specifications    We constructed the battery with the rated output of 50kW and  storage volume of 400kWh by combining four 12.5kW submodules in  line. As shown in Fig. 3, it has a four-layer submodule  structure, achieving a high-energy density through the  combination of a mass energy density of 73kWh/m&lt;sup&gt; 4&lt;/sup&gt; ,  weight energy density of 51kWh/t, and area energy density of  185kWh/m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; .    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-35A>             Fig. 3. Structure of 50kW NaS Battery </FIG>       One submodule houses 324 300Wh-class large single cells,  which are linked as follows: 6 in series x 6 in parallel x 9 in  series. Each string has a fuse attached, a structure designed to  limit a damage, such as short circuit, to a minimum. As has been  explained previously, since the NaS battery operates only at  high temperature, the submodule is insulated by a vacuum heat  insulation container, with internal temperature controlled by a  heater at 310&deg;C. In order to measure temperature and to  provide thermal control, 10 voltmetric wires and 4 thermocouples  are [toridashite] from the battery.    A 1-cycle per day design, with 8 hours each allotted to  recharging and discharging of the battery, resulted in a  discharge/charge efficiency of 8.8&percnt; when a loss  resulting from  the use of a heater is included, the efficiency rate is  8&percnt;.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4. 50kW NaS Battery Specifications                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Category                              |Specifications                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rated output                          |50 kW                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rated voltage                         |410 v                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rated current                         |122 A                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hour rate                             |8-hour recharge, 8-hour discharge     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Amount of rated electric power        |400 kWh                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Amount of rated electricity           |976 Ah                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Charge-discharge efficiency           |88%                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Same as above (includes heater loss)  |85%                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Weight                                |7.8 t                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Volume energy density                 |73 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt; 3&lt;/sup&gt;                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Weight energy density                 |51 kWh/t                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Area energy density                   |185 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      (2) Summary of Test System    The structure of the 50kWNaS Battery's validation test is  shown in Fig. 4. Since the battery is DC (direct current), in  order to link with AC (alternating current) commercial systems,  it will be necessary to have a DC-AC converter designed to  convert DC and AC currents in both directions. The battery is  connected to AC 210V through the AC-DC convertor and to a rear  distribution cubicle bus whose pressure is raised to 6.6kV using  a transformer. Since the test system is an industry-owned  electric utility facility, its link to the power system is  implemented in accordance with the Agency of Natural Resources  and Energy's ``Guideline for System Linkage,'' and because the  condition includes reverse power flows, we used a dedicated line  to link the test system to the distribution cubicle so that the  test system cannot be operated when the power system is without  voltage.    We used an FA computer to manage the total test facility. In  order to control battery temperatures and voltage, we installed  control equipment separately.    The 50kW battery systems arranged in parallel, on 9 November  1992, passed a pre-operational inspection on December 10 and  currently is in operation without any problems.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-36A>             Fig. 4. Block Diagram of Test System </FIG>      <H5>    4.3. Contents of Test </H5>   The validation test is designed to evaluate the basic  characteristics and long-range performance of the 50kW NaS  battery as a prototype machine at the time of its practical  implementation. Also examined will be its effects and a method  of efficient operations as well as appropriate maintenance  method. The contents of the test are summarized as follows:    (1) Evaluation of Basic Characteristics    *Rising temperature characteristics, falling temperature  properties *Constant current charge and discharge  characteristics *Constant power charge and discharge  characteristics *Self-discharge and stand-by loss  characteristics    (2) Evaluation of Long-term Operational Characteristics    *Evaluation of change in volume, efficiency, internal  resistance, etc., which will occur when the battery is operated  for a long period of time    (3) Evaluation of Characteristics of Malfunctioning Battery    *An external diagnostic method when internal battery  malfunction develops *Evaluation of battery behavior when  trouble occurs  <H5>  4.4 Basic Characteristics of 50kW Battery </H5>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-36B>             Fig. 5. 50kW Battery Constant Power Characteristics </FIG>       (1) Characteristics of Constant Power Operation    Fig. 5 shows electric properties of the 50kW battery when it  undergoes one cycle of charge and discharge at the rated output  of 50kW (January 19, 1993, 56 cycles), as well as temperature  characteristics inside a representative submodule (C submodule).  We used the pattern of operations involving the cycle of 8-hour  discharge, a 5-hour rest period, recharge until the battery had  been fully charged (approximately 9 hours), and a 2-hour rest  period.    Regarding the electric properties, when pure sulfur at the  positive electrode is depleted, a decrease in the battery  voltage from the certain level maintained at the time of initial  discharge begins to occur uniformly for the most part. Since it  is constant power operations, electric current increases when  the maximum level is reached at the end of discharge. The range  of voltage shift was between 382V and 471V, and that of current  shift between 116A and 131A at the time of discharge and between  118A and 105A at the time of recharge.    Although internal parts of the submodule are uniformly  controlled at 310&deg;C plus or minus 2&deg;C during a standby  period, the temperature begins to climb as a result of heat  generated by internal resistance and by discharge reactions. The  highest temperature registered at the center of the module is  328&deg;C, while the lowest was 319&deg;C on the plug side where  insulation performance was at its poorest, creating a difference  of approximately 10&deg;C inside the submodule.    As soon as discharge has been completed, temperature began  to  fall gradually, especially in places where this was easily done,  the temperature fell below 310&deg;C, making it necessary to use  a heater. Ultimately, temperatures of all places inside the  submodule fell down to 310&deg;C. It was verified that before  the next cycle of discharge began, the unit will return to a  standby state, thereby achieving good result insofar as  achieving good temperature equilibrium is concerned. Since the  module is constructed by layering four submodules, we were able  to obtain the identical temperature characteristics in all  submodules.

(2) Characteristics Observed during Continuous One-Week  Operations    We evaluated the characteristics based on the basic  operational pattern used in actual operations, viz.,  1-cycle-a-day recharge-discharge operations on weekdays, resting  on Saturdays and Sundays. The operations followed a set pattern  of 8-hour recharging with the rated current of 122A, a 3-hour  rest period, 8-hour discharging and 5-hour rest period (Dec.  14-20).    We obtained the battery efficiency of 90&percnt;, and, when  a  heater was taken into account, the efficiency was 83&percnt;.    (3) Stand-by Loss    During the 10-day period, 26 December 1992-4 January 1993,  we  continued to stop battery operations from time to time to  measure energy loss brought about by the use of a heater in the  standby unit. The total amount of electricity consumed by a  heater during the ten-day period was 549.5kWh, an average of  55kW (average electricity of the heater 2.3 kW) on a per-day  basis.    Fig. 6 shows relationship between the highest external  temperature and the amount of electricity consumed by a heater.  Effects of temperature, however, were not observed.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-37A>             Fig. 6. Loss Caused by Heater in Stand-by Unit and Outside </FIG>      <H5>    5. Summary and Future Issues </H5>   Since the performance evaluation of the 50kW NaS battery has  just begun, all we have only been able to accomplish thus far is  to cover the battery's initial basic characteristics. Our plan  is to continue with our validation test, evaluating the  characteristics of the battery's long-range performance.    The main problem associated with the NaS battery which must  be dealt with is that of cost. The materials used in this  validation test are for the purpose of research only and not the  kind of materials generally used in industrial production. Our  plan is to work on cost reduction through lower material costs  and the automation of mass production process.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jacques Pinto] </F>   [Excerpts] Lagos, June 23 (AFP) -- Nigerian opposition  parties held urgent consultations as international condemnation  poured in Thursday [23 June] after police arrested Moshood  Abiola, the opposition leader widely believed to have won last  June's cancelled presidential election.    Chief Abiola was arrested at his Lagos home after addressing  a rally in the business metropolis and taken early Thursday to  the federal capital Abuja, his aides said. The Moslem  millionaire had resurfaced just hours before after escaping  house arrest and going into hiding 10 days earlier on the  anniversary of the election cancelled by General Sani Abacha's  military regime.    A leader of the National Democratic Campaign (Nadeco) who  asked not to be named told AFP the opposition was meeting  urgently to decide a course of action and would "definitely"  challenge the arrest. "Street demonstrations either Thursday or  Friday in Lagos by supporters of Abiola...cannot be ruled out,"  the Nadeco leader said.    The embassy of the United States, first foreign power to  condemn the arrest, declared it raised "very serious questions  with respect to the Nigerian government's commitment to  restoring unhindered, civilian democracy and resolving the  political crisis created by the annulment of the June 12, 1993,  presidential election".    "The United States denounces this action and believes that  all parties to the political process should be allowed to speak  freely on all issues," said a statement made available to AFP.    In London, the Foreign Office said Britain was "very  concerned" at the reports from here and hoped the developments  would "not harm the search" for a way back toward "accountable  civilian government."    Abacha meanwhile pressed on with a tour of Nigeria's main  military bases begun Wednesday to assure himself of the armed  forces' loyalty, national radio reported.    The tour came ahead of a Constitutional Conference scheduled  for Monday in Abuja, which he has presented as the keystone of  his program to give up power by stages but which the  pro-democracy opposition grouped around Nadeco has dismissed as  a farce. [passage omitted]    He visited the Third Armoured Division stationed in Jos,  capital of the central Plateau state, and the Second Mechanized  Division stationed at Ibadan, 140 kilometers (80 miles) north of  Lagos, the Nigerian press said. The heads of the army, navy and  air force attended the meetings.    Abacha also announced special end-of-service bonuses and  deliveries of equipment and uniforms to the troops, the daily  Guardian said.    Abiola, who declared himself president and commander of the  armed forces on June 11 in defiance to the Abacha regime, had  pledged to some 2,000 cheering people on Wednesday that he would  present a government. It was his first public appearance since  he disappeared on June 11. [passage omitted]    Other opposition leaders arrested during a month of growing  resistance to Abacha's regime have been detained in Lagos and  charged with treason in the federal high court.

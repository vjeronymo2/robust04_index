There is normally some overlap from year to year in the stocks having the highest dividends yields in an Index and, therefore, between the portfolios of each Rollover Series and the New Series. In the case of the 1993 Spring Series of the Dow Series, 7 of the 10 securities were identical. To date each Rollover Series has, in connection with its termination, sold all of its portfolio securities on the New York Stock Exchange as quickly as practicable. Similarly, a New Series acquires its portfolio securities in purchase transactions on the New York Stock Exchange. This procedure creates brokerage commissions on portfolio securities of the same issue that are borne by the holders of units of both the Rollover Series and the New Series. Applicants, therefore, request an exemptive order to permit any Rollover Series to sell portfolio securities to a New Series and a New Series to purchase those securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. In order to minimize overreaching, Merrill Lynch shall certify in writing to the trustee of the Rollover Series and the New Series, following each sale from a Rollover Series to a New Series, (a) That the transaction is consistent with the policy of both the Rollover Series and the New Series, as recited in their respective registration statements and reports filed under the Act, (b) the date of such transaction, and (c) the closing sales price on the Qualified Exchange for the sale date of the securities subject to such sale. The trustee will then countersign the certificate, unless, in the unlikely event that the trustee disagrees with the closing sales price listed on the certificate, the trustee immediately informs Merrill Lynch orally of any such disagreement and returns the certificate within five days to Merrill Lynch with corrections duly noted. Upon Merrill Lynch's receipt of a corrected certificate, if Merrill Lynch can verify the correct price by reference to an independently published list of closing sales prices for the date of the transaction, Merrill Lynch will ensure that the price of units of the New Series, and distributions to holders of the Rollover Series with regard to redemption of their units or termination of the Rollover Series, accurately reflect the corrected price. To the extent that Merrill Lynch disagrees with the trustee's corrected price, Merrill Lynch and the trustee will jointly determine the correct sales price by reference to a mutually agreeable, independently published list of closing sales prices for the date of the transaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 17(a) of the Act generally makes it unlawful for an affiliated person of a registered investment company to sell securities to or purchase securities from the company. Investment companies under common control may be considered affiliates of one another. The Series may be under common control because they have identical or common sponsors, and Merrill Lynch as agent for the sponsors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Section 17(b) provides that the SEC shall exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) if evidence establishes that: (a) The terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company involved; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general provisions of the Act. Under section 6(c), the SEC may exempt classes of transactions if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants believe that the proposed transactions satisfy the requirements of sections 6(c) and 17(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Rule 17a&hyph;7 under the Act permits registered investment companies that might be deemed affiliates solely by reason of common investment advisers, directors, and/or officers, to purchase securities from or sell securities to one another at an independently determined price, provided certain conditions are met. Paragraph (e) of the rule requires an investment company's board of directors to adopt and monitor the procedures for these transactions to assure compliance with the rule. A unit investment trust does not have a board of directors and, therefore, may not rely on the rule. Applicants represent that they will comply with all of the provisions of rule 17a&hyph;7, other than paragraph (e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Sterling trade easier THE LIQUIDITY problem in the sterling cash market continued to ease yesterday after the Bank of England forecast a shortage of only Pounds 300m at the start of its money market operations, writes James Blitz. However, conditions in the D-Mark and French franc markets remained tight, following hints from Bundesbank officials that another cut in official German rates is unlikely at tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting. There was extreme volatility in the sterling markets early yesterday morning as dealers came in to work in London to find that the pound had slumped to a low of DM2.4070 against the D-Mark. The currency's fall encouraged dealers to believe that a base rate cut might not occur as quickly as expected, and the December sterling contract slipped to a low of 93.37 in morning trading. Two factors then firmed futures and eased rates. The first was the CBI's quarterly report on industrial trends, showing that the UK economy is sliding further into recession and raising speculation that the chancellor will ease monetary policy to 'go for growth.' The second factor was the Bank's forecast of a shortage of just Pounds 300m, far less than expected. Dealers assumed that the Bank had provided liquidity via foreign exchange swaps, selling sterling for foreign currencies. However, there was little doubt that the shortages will continue to affect the market until the Bank has built up its foreign reserves and pushed about Pounds 5bn back into the market. Money market rates generally closed easier yesterday, with 3-month money closing at 7 3/4 per cent offered from a previous 8 per cent, and the 1 month down at 8 3/4 per cent from a previous 9 1/4 per cent. The December contract closed at 93.60, pricing 3 month money in December at 6.4 per cent. The December Euromark contract fell back 3 basis points from its opening level, as dealers continued to assume that there will be no cut in German official rates this week. At a close of 91.77, the contract assumes that 3-month money will be at around 8.23 per cent at the end of the year. That prices in a cut in the discount rate by 50 basis points. The December French franc futures contract closed unchanged at 90.91.</p>

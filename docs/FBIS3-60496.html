			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 30 Nov (MTI) -- AIDS has so far claimed  81 lives in Hungary. There are 140 patients on record with  full-blown AIDS, and 360 people are known to have the virus.  However, estimates put the number of HIV cases at about  2,000-2,500, many of them foreigners living in Hungary.    The above figures were reported at a press conference in the  Ministry of Welfare in Budapest on Tuesday, held to mark World  AIDS Day, December 1.    AIDS in Hungary most frequently afflicts men, mainly  homosexuals and bisexuals.    There are relatively few hemophiliacs among the HIV positive  patients, and the number who received the virus through blood  transfusions or through drug use are also low.    The 20 to 39 age group is the most endangered.    Most of the HIV positive patients live in the vicinity of  Budapest. However, many infections were noted in the country's  western and north-eastern parts.</p>

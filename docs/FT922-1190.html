			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Halma moves ahead to Pounds 15.5m AFTER LAST year's blip in its almost unblemished 19-year growth record, Halma, the safety and environmental control group, returned to its upward path in the year to March 28 with pre-tax profits 17 per cent ahead at Pounds 15.5m. The rise from Pounds 13.3m was struck on turnover up 15 per cent from Pounds 81.9m to Pounds 94.5m. Furthermore the company was proud to point out that a survey on the size and consistency of dividend increases put Halma at the top of the list with 13 years of annual increases of at least 20 per cent. This 14th time the total dividend is lifted 25 per cent to 2.195p (1.755p) with a recommended final dividend of 1.332p (1.065p). Mr David Barber, chairman and managing director, explained that the previous year's 6 per cent slip in profits from Pounds 14.1m - due mainly to recession in the UK and the US - had in fact helped Halma this time. He said that when profits fell at a 'self-propelled' company like Halma, this ensured and encouraged management action which in turn led to growth in the following period. The spread of businesses helped protect the company which could target acquisi-tion possibilities within its area of management expertise and then move into those markets. Expansion by acquisition was the other factor behind the resumption of Halma's growth. All had gone well, said Mr Barber. It bought: Tradinco, the Dutch pressure calibration company, in April 1991; Palmer Environmental Services and Surveys, which detects water leaks in underground pipes, in November; Detection Instruments, the gas detection instruments company now integrated into Crowcon Detection Instruments, in December; and Perma Pure, which removes water vapour from gases, this January. The total cash expenditure on these was Pounds 2.96m, down from last time's acquisition cash bill of Pounds 4.5m. Halma was now more focused on Europe and would be looking to expand further there, Mr Barber said. The European operations were making almost as much profit as the well-established US side. Group sales in the UK, he said, were only 5 per cent up, against a 42 per cent increase on the Continent. Overall, direct exports grew 32 per cent to Pounds 23.7m and overseas sales accounted for 47 per cent of total group sales, against 42 per cent a year ago. On top of that, Halma's 'relatively green' areas of business - the water and air monitoring and treatment, and safety interlocking sides which accounted for about 40 per cent of group turnover - had been Halma's 'most buoyant' areas. Earnings worked through at 7.71p (6.81p) per share.</p>

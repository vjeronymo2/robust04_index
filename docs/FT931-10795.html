			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Personal insolvencies up 44%: Incidence of company failures showed decline in final months of last year THE NUMBER of personal insolvencies jumped 44 per cent to 36,794 last year compared with 1991, government figures showed yesterday. In a further indication of the effects of the recession on the British economy, company insolvencies grew 12 per cent during the year to 24,424. That meant 2.6 per cent of active companies became insolvent in the final quarter of last year, compared with 2.3 per cent in the same period of 1991. The figures showed a seasonally adjusted decline of 10 per cent in company insolvencies between the third and fourth quarters last year. Mr Richard Brown of the British Chambers of Commerce, which produces the statistics for the Department of Trade and Industry, said: 'It is good news that the figures have gone down in the largest quarterly fall for five years.' But he warned against drawing optimistic conclusions from the short-term downward trend. 'We are not becoming too sanguine,' he said. 'This may reflect the banks taking something of a more realistic attitude.' He said he was pessimistic given that fewer than 20 per cent of manufacturing companies and 10 per cent of service companies were working to full capacity. He said the rate of insolvencies typically rose during economic recovery as companies suffered a shortage of working capital which their bankers did not make good. Seasonally adjusted personal insolvencies rose 4 per cent to 9,795, compared with 9,391 in the third quarter of 1992. They were up 25 per cent from 7,831 in the final quarter of 1991. Separate statistics released yesterday by the Lord Chancellors' Office showed a substantial rise for the full year for corporate winding-up and personal bankruptcy petitions. Debtor petitions to the courts - presented by individuals rather than their creditors - leapt by nearly two thirds during the year. Creditors' petitions rose 22 per cent and company winding-up petitions grew 2 per cent. The petitions are not directly comparable with the Chambers of Commerce insolvency statistics because not all petitions are granted by the courts, and there is a delay before they are reflected in recorded insolvencies. The figures for the final quarter of 1992 were all up on the final quarter of 1991. Company winding-up petitions rose slightly from 4,112 to 4,121 between the periods. Creditors' petitions rose 16 per cent from 6,322 to 7,339 between the final quarters of last year and the year before, while debtors' petitions jumped 42 per cent from 2,911 to 4,140. Insolvency practitioners have attributed the rise in debtor petitions to the declining stigma attached to bankruptcy during the present recession.</p>

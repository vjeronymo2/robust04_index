			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Cracks in the franc fort: Europe The renewed wave of currency speculation which battered the French franc and the Irish punt last week was a sharp reminder that the European Monetary System (EMS) is not yet out of trouble. The central question is the future of the franc; for if the franc were to be forced out of the exchange rate mechanism, the heart of the European Monetary System would have disintegrated, and the credibility of the EC's target for economic and monetary union, already damaged by the explosion of Black Wednesday, would be holed below the water line. Many people no doubt expect the franc to come in for repeated speculative attacks right up to the French general elections in March. The markets are evidently unpersuaded that the Socialist government, which is facing a calamitous defeat at the ballot box, has the political strength to stand by its franc fort policy, with its punishingly high real interest rates. By contrast, the incoming conservative government will have a record majority in the national assembly; what is more, all their heavy hitters on economic policy have solemnly endorsed the franc fort policy, including former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of the centre-right UDF grouping, former finance minister Edouard Balladur of the Gaullist RPR party, and former prime minister Raymond Barre. So if the French authorities can hold the line until the second round of voting on March 28, the franc may be in the clear. This scenario may be dangerously misconceived. For the dynamic of the political situation in France means that the prospective change of government could trigger more speculation against the franc, not less. Recent polls suggest the UDF and the Gaullists will between them achieve a record majority, with perhaps more than 400 seats in the 577-seat assembly. Such a big increase almost inevitably means a disproportionate increase in the number of conservative Euro-sceptics, especially among the Gaullists. Last year half the Gaullists in the assembly, and all the Gaullist senators, voted to have the Maastricht treaty thrown out; after March 28 we must assume that the anti-Maastricht contingent will be substantially larger. By rights, the conservatives should be elated at the prospect of their smashing victory. In fact, they seem apprehensive at the difficulty of the situation they will inherit. Intellectually, their leaders are committed to a continuation of the present economic and exchange-rate policy. But they know that one reason for the prospective rout of the present government is precisely the franc fort policy: the Socialists promised that it would bring low inflation and sound growth, but so far it has delivered much more of the first than of the second. In other words, the political mixture after March 28 will be inherently volatile; the match which could make it explode will be the struggle for the 1995 presidential elections, which will become intense immediately after the parliamentary elections. In the first instance this will be a struggle inside the conservative camp, between Gaullist leader Jacques Chirac and UDF leader Giscard d'Estaing. Each of them is starting to stake a claim to be prime minister after March, as a vital spring-board for the presidency; each will seek to mark out an attractive and distinctive platform, which must include policies designed to promote economic growth and reduce unemployment. On character grounds, Chirac is the more likely of the two to break ranks with the existing franc fort policy. Giscard has for many years been publicly committed to the objective of Emu, but Chirac has few hard and fast political principles, he is a natural demagogue, and he may feel strong pressures to pander to the populist and nationalist wing of his party. Mr Chirac would not inevitably prefer to abandon the franc fort policy. By March the Bundesbank may have eased interest rates, and the French economy may be recovering. But unemployment will still be 3m, and it will take a lot of growth to bring it down. The Socialists do not have a voluntary option of abandoning the franc fort so long as Francois Mitterrand is president; but it must become a debatable alternative strategy for a conservative government with a 200-seat majority. The outlook helps explain recent waves of speculation. If a new French government could decide to change policy, it makes sense to bet on that change in advance. It also explains press reports that the French and German governments are thinking of an accelerated move towards monetary union by an inner core of states. The president of the Bundesbank has already poured cold water on this idea, but in any case it seems improbable that this pre-emptive action could take the form of a very rapid move to monetary union. The Germans would not surrender their monetary policy except to an independent European central bank, and that could not be set up in a hurry; and France could not formally surrender monetary policy to the Bundesbank. So if Paris and Bonn fear that their present monetary arrangements may become unsustainable, they need to look around for alternative political initiatives to ensure that any derailing of the EMS does not cause wider damage to the broad thrust of European integration.</p>

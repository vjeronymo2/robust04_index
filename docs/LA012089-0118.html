			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> HEART OF 'RAPPAPORT' BEATS STRONG AT HAHN  </P> <P> Old age can be a terrifying place.  </P> <P> The betrayals of the body -- the stiffening legs, the rheumy eyes, the wavering  hands -- all mirror an increasingly hostile environment. It's a world made up  of a triple threat: those who ignore the very existence of the elderly, the  street thugs who prey upon their weaknesses and relatives whose suffocating  kindnesses reduce them to children.  </P> <P> Into this inhospitable world enter odd couple Nat and Midge, characters in Herb  Gardner's "I'm Not Rappaport" at the Hahn Cosmopolitan Theatre through Feb. 26.  </P> <P> Nat, an 81-year-old Jewish man, and Midge, an 80-year-old black man, share a  Central Park bench, where they drive each other crazy because their coping  mechanisms are as different as the cultures they come from.  </P> <P> Midge, a superintendent who knows the score, clings to reality. If people don't  want to see the old, that's fine. He'll work the night shift and play the  invisible man. If a street punk threatens to beat him up if he doesn't pay him  3 bucks to be walked home, fine. He'll pay the toll and say, "Thank you."  </P> <P> Nat is more from the Blanche du Bois school of thought. He doesn't tell what's  true so much as what ought to be true.  </P> <P> Is someone trying to take advantage of his friend? He'll pretend to be a lawyer  with a powerful organization that protects the elderly's rights. Is the punk  trying to rob him? Like the good Socialist he still is, Nat will gladly give  the kid half the money he has on him -- $11 -- but he will not let the $3 be  taken.  </P> <P> Still, if Nat is Blanche, then the world is his Stanley Kowalski, beating him  down with reality. He may drive the punk off one day. But the kid will be back  the next.  </P> <P> "I'm Not Rappaport," a Tony-award winning Broadway hit, toured most of the  country with stars Judd Hirsch -- who picked up his own Tony for Nat -- and  Cleavon Little. It skipped San Diego, but the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre is  presenting the local premiere as its season opener.  </P> <P> The good news is that Don Alan Croll as Nat and Lance Roberts as Midge deliver  warm and winning performances that promise to grow over the run.  </P> <P> Croll, in particular, is a luminous study in the chiaroscuro of an indomitable  spirit with a swiftly deteriorating body. His grand schemes gain poignancy from  their contrast with the age spots on his forehead (kudos to Dianne Holly's  makeup job), the squint of his eyes, his hands quivering like hummingbird  wings.  </P> <P> Roberts, in contrast, could show Midge's age more. He has mastered the role of  comic foil; now he needs to take more time with the dramatic reactions. What  James A. Strait's direction needs to emphasize is that Midge, who has the  slightly smaller part, is nevertheless the all-important truth teller here.  </P> <P> The supporting cast varies in quality. The best are Allison Brennan as Nat's  daughter, Clara, and David Wright, as a loan shark known as the Cowboy.  </P> <P> The rest of the characterizations lack force. As Danforth, the tenant in  Midge's building who comes to the park to fire Midge, Ken Parratt is curiously  calm and non-reactive when Nat tries to pull one of his cons on him.  </P> <P> The biggest puzzle of the production is why the set, by Robert Earl, goes for a  two-dimensional Disney-like effect rather than the gritty reality of Nat's and  Midge's world. Where do these brightly colored, cut-out trees and clear,  well-lit tunnel come from, anyway? Hey, guys, this is supposed to be New York.  Where are the graffiti? But its flaws are mere scratches on the real star of  the show, which is the marvelous script.  </P> <P> For old fans of Gardner's "A Thousand Clowns," the good news is that even the  despair Gardner attaches to old age has not dimmed his belief in the redemptive  power of imagination. For those who still hold a place in their hearts for  crazy Murray, the comedy writer in "A Thousand Clowns" who ditched the 9-to-5  life in order to enjoy existence, and then returned to the grind because he  loved his child more than himself, he is back in the person of Nat.  </P> <P> Time can ravage the body. But the heart is the final arbiter of whether we are  old or young. "I'm Not Rappaport" is a magical tribute to the power of that  heart.  </P> <P> "I'm Not Rappaport"  </P> <P> By Herb Gardner. Director is James A. Strait. Costumes by Juli Bohn. Set by  Robert Earl. Lighting by Matthew Cubitto. Makeup by Dianne Holly. Stage manager  is Claudea Jardot.

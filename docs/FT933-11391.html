			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Fleece wool prices increased at the opening Australian wool sale in Sydney this week, and the Wool Corporation's market indicator at 459 cents a kg. was 15 cents higher then at the closing sale of the 1992/93 season at the end of June. The Increase has been expected after Chinese business in Australia and elsewhere, following a currency revaluation. This helped to bring out more business from other wool buyers. European interest rate reductions are seen as helpful especially if they lead to improved trading there.</p>

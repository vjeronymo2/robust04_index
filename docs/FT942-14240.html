			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Trio get the chequered flag - The dominant role the UK plays in motor racing Three export achievement awards in the motor sport sector, to Williams Grand Prix Engineering, race-engine designer and manufacturer Ilmor Engineering and precision castings specialists Zeus Aluminium Products, underline the dominant role played by the UK in the world motor racing industry. The industry accounts for more than three-quarters of all the world's single-seater racing car production; behind closed doors, it designs, develops and builds many of the cars raced or rallied by leading Japanese, German and other foreign car makers under their own names; it has an annual turnover of more than Pounds 1bn (of which exports account for more than 40 per cent) and employs around 50,000. Unlikely as it may sound, a diet of pasta, coffee and cigarettes has helped the Williams grand prix team, which employs more than 200 and is one of the top names in motor sport, collect its second award for export achievement since managing director Frank Williams founded the team at Didcot, Oxfordshire, in 1976. This year's award is based on the fact that Williams Grand Prix Engineering, six-times winner of the Formula One constructors' world championship, derives 70 per cent of its Pounds 30m quoted turnover from non-UK companies taking advertising space on its 700 horsepower, Renault-powered projectiles which carried Frenchman Alain Prost to his fourth world driver's championship title - and gave Englishman Damon Hill his grand prix debut - last year. That the Italian companies Divella (pasta maker), Sega Fredo (coffee) and tobacco multinational Rothmans are prepared collectively to spend millions to put their names on Williams' race cars might sound just cause for shareholder apoplexy - until global TV viewing figures are taken into account. On average, each of last year's 16 grands prix was watched by more than 439m in 121 countries. Williams' and a handful of other grand prix teams can attract particularly large sums because TV cameras almost invariably spend most time focused on the front-runners. Thus in fact, if not in name, the award is also a recognition of the engineering technology which for years has kept Williams at the front of the grand prix field, despite a poor start to the current season. In addition to their livery on the grand prix cars, overseas sponsors also capitalise on Williams' name in active marketing of their products or services. Renault itself has taken advantage of Williams' cachet, as well as its engineering capabilities, to launch a limited production version of its Clio hatchback - the Clio 'Williams'. Brixworth, Northamptonshire-based Ilmor Engineering is not quite such a 'household' name, but has made a substantial impact in both grand prix and IndyCar racing since it was founded in 1984. This season in particular, its engines have swept the Penske IndyCar team to victory in the first two races of North America's premier motor racing championship, leaving 1993 IndyCar champion Nigel Mansell's Lola Ford Cosworth in their wake. (It is indicative of the extraordinary strength of the UK motor industry that almost every car on the championship's grid - including Penske - is British-made. Lola itself is a past export award winner and has won the past five IndyCar championships in succession.) Meanwhile, the black Sauber-Mercedes cars have become a familiar sight to grand prix watchers - except that beneath their engines' camshaft covers, complete with three-pointed stars, lies not Mercedes' mechanicals but Ilmor's. And when Mercedes makes its scheduled entry into IndyCar racing as well in 1995, that engine, too, will be an Ilmor. Like many other leading car makers engaged in motor sport, Mercedes is using Ilmor not just because of the depth of its engineering expertise but because its relatively small size - fewer than 150 employees - gives it the speed and flexibility of response needed in motor racing and which it is very difficult for a large company to achieve. It is entirely engineering driven - its co-founders Mario Ilien and Paul Morgan are both former Cosworth engineers. Such is the closeness of the association between Ilmor and the German manufacturers that Mercedes has taken a 25 per cent stake in the company formerly held by General Motors' Chevrolet division. Longer term, it could lead to Ilmor-based high performance versions of some Mercedes cars. Zeus Aluminium Products is on a yet smaller scale, employing 16 at its plant in Dudley, West Midlands, where it produces precision sand castings in aluminium and magnesium alloys. The castings it makes - far removed, says managing director Peter Harpin, from the low-tech image of traditional foundries - find their way into competition vehicles across the motor sport spectrum. Nor are they minor components. Zeus's output includes both engine cylinder blocks and head castings. They and other cast components are to be found in Le Mans, grand prix, British and German touring cars and IndyCar racers. However, Zeus is not confining itself to motor sport activities. It is designing and developing new ideas and technologies for a wide array of thinwall castings requiring great accuracy. The company is also considering adding machining downstream of its casting processes to meet a growing demand for more finished products. Zeus was founded as a toolmaking business in 1974 by chairman Mr Brian Poade. Zeus Pattern and Tool Company and Bullock and Mills, also in tooling, form the biggest part of the group, which employs 140. The castings company turned over Pounds 3.5m last year, and Mr Harpin forecasts that it will exceed Pounds 4m this year. 'We want to be a Pounds 10m-a-year company by 1996,' he maintains.</p>

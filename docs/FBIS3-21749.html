			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on drug-related crimes, investigations, trials,  sentencings, and other activities in the PRC monitored by Hong  Kong Bureau during the period 15-28 February 1994. The source  and mode of processing are given in parentheses at the end of  each entry.    A German woman went on trial on 28 February in Tianjin on  charges of trafficking nearly five kg of marijuana. Doris  Wunsch, 37, was reportedly caught trying to board a ship to  Japan from Tianjin on 19 July 1993 with 4.84 kg of marijuana  concealed in a double-bottomed suitcase.    At the time of her arrest, Wunsch had, according to Chinese  press reports, admitted being met in Beijing by an Austrian man  who handed her the double-bottomed suitcase, telling her it  contained contraband. The man, later found to be Australian,  asked her to carry the suitcase to Japan and gave her an address  for a second rendezvous upon arrival. The Australian reportedly  left Beijing on 18 July. (Summary) (Hong Kong AFP in English  0457 GMT 28 Feb 94)    The Guangdong Department of Public Security broke up a large  drug-trafficking ring composed of criminals from Hong Kong,  Guangdong, Yunnan, and Guangxi through arrests over the last two  months of 1993. Police arrested a total of 26 suspects,  including three from Hong Kong, and seized 17.4 kg of heroin and  1.2 million yuan in cash.    Police in Zhaoqing ran an undercover operation on 2 November  and arrested drug traffickers from Hong Kong, as well as a local  drug-dealer. The police recovered 16.2 kg of heroin and 620,000  yuan in cash. Later the same day, two accomplices were arrested  in Shenzhen and two hideouts in Zhaoqing were smashed.    Further raids were carried out in Yunnan, Guangxi, and  Luoding in Guangdong, capturing the ringleader. The drug ring  was wiped out with the elimination of the drug route by which  the drugs were first brought in from Yunnan and transported to  Zhaoqing in Guangdong via Guangxi for later shipment to Hong  Kong drug dealers.

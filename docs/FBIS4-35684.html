			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Nasrallah al-Dawudi: "Ill-fate"] </F>   [Text] The current fighting between the agents in our  beloved Iraqi Kurdistan has revealed several facts.    First, it has revealed the enemies' real intentions behind  the creation of the so-called "security zone." The pages of  their scenario are being blown away one after the other. Having  plundered the gains made for the autonomy, which was engineered  by the symbol of national unity President Saddam Husayn; turned  the region into a den for Zionist espionage, and spread chaos  and ruination in that Iraqi paradise, the enemies have now moved  to the final page in that illusory scenario; namely, the  liquidation of Kurds by manipulating agents and turning them  against one another in fierce fighting in which thousands of our  innocent people are falling victims in accordance with a set  plan which is being implemented by these agents with the  recklessness of traitors, the lack of conscience of agents, and  the treason of criminals.    Second, the agents who are befriending each other today are  past enemies, and they will continue to be enemies despite their  common interests and evil designs against our dear Iraqi  Kurdistan. The Kurdistan Democratic Party cannot strike an  alliance with the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Their age-old  conflict cannot possibly be removed by a theatrical signing of a  treasonous agreement against the homeland and the people. The  conflict between the two sides has continued for decades. So,  it cannot simply be resolved on the table of negotiations even  if it is a table of treason and charlatanry on which these  agents have been brought up. Here are the facts being revealed  and here are the cities, streets, districts, and subdistricts of  Kurdistan streaming with blood caused by the fighting between  these agents over the illusory booty of treason and  mercenariness. Here is Jalal Talabani acquiring an additional  characteristic of "fear." He says he cannot enter the region  unless he is received by Mas'ud Barzani in Faysh Khabur and is  personally accompanied into the region as an expression of this  shaky reconciliation deal. Being birds of a feather, the  intentions have become known and have therefore been rejected.</p>

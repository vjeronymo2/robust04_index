			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: UAL blames fare wars for Dollars 95.1m loss in quarter UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, joined its two big US rivals in reporting a large loss for the second quarter of 1992, and warned it expects poor results for the balance of the year. The carrier also hinted that further cost-cutting measures may be implemented. UAL said it lost Dollars 95.1m after tax in the three-month period, against a profit of Dollars 52.7m in the same period of 1991. This takes UAL's loss for the first six months of 1992 to Dollars 187.4m, a sharp rise on the Dollars 104.3m deficit seen in the first half of 1991. At the operating level, UAL's deficit for the quarter totalled Dollars 73.9m, compared with profits of Dollars 63.7m a year ago. Revenues were up from Dollars 3.14bn, compared with Dollars 2.95bn in 1991, but yield, in terms of revenue per passenger mile, fell from 12.28 cents to 12.14 cents. In common with American and Delta - United's two main rivals - the Chicago-based carrier pinned the blame on the early summer's ferocious domestic fare wars. Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman, said: 'Our clearly unsatisfactory results reflect the severe impact of revenue-dilutive pricing activity in the US, as well as the effects of the recessionary environment throughout much of the world.' Ominously, Mr Wolf warned that this situation could persist throughout 1992: 'We expect these same factors to have a negative effect on our results for at least the balance of 1992,' he said. And he suggested action to reduce costs might be necessary. 'Unless this situation is reversed, alternative actions to reduce our expenses will have to be considered,' he warned. United has already announced it will cut at least Dollars 2bn from its Dollars 15.8bn capital spending programme planned for 1992-95. United is the third 'mega-carrier' to suffer large second-quarter losses. AMR, the parent company for American Airlines, reported a net loss of Dollars 166m - or Dollars 48m if one-off charges were excluded. Delta Air Lines followed with a loss of Dollars 180.2m. Delta accompanied its results with news of staff reductions, and a general pruning of costs. Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, also reported losses yesterday afternoon. The carrier, which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection since late-1990, saw an after-tax loss of Dollars 99.2m in the three months to end-June, against a Dollars 109.1m deficit in the same period a year earlier. Revenues were Dollars 1.37bn (Dollars 1.37bn). Continental's six-month loss now stands at Dollars 81.8m, against a Dollars 290.4m deficit in the first half of 1991. The figures, it said, 'reflected the impact of fare discounting programmes and relatively weak industry traffic'. But, despite the industry's widespread acknowledgement of damage done by fare wars, Delta Air Lines announced it was slashing 30 per cent off the price charged for 14-day advance purchase tickets. This 'Fall Sale' will last throughout August and cover domestic round-trip travel from September 14 to December 14. After September, Delta said it would raise all domestic fares by five per cent from their current levels. Continental Airlines, meanwhile, was reported to have cut coast-to-coast fares to as little as Dollars 99, while Swissair reduced its fares on round-trip travel between the US and Switzerland.</p>

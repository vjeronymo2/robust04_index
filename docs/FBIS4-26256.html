			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- The continuous high  temperatures in the past month or so in and around the nation's  capital city have left tens of thousands of ha [hectares] of  farmland parched.    Beijing has been dry for more than ten months. Water  reserves in the Guanting and Miyun reservoirs, the two main  water suppliers for Beijing, are decreasing, and the underground  water table is continuously dropping.    It is estimated that if the high temperatures continue,  during this summer the city will be short of 150,000 cu m to  230,000 cu m of water daily.    The municipal government has taken measures to control  industrial water use to ensure the needs of its residents.    Establishments which use more than the allowed amount of  water will be charged double the normal fee.    Beijing is promoting a household-water-saving drive among  its  city residents. Every household should be equipped with a water  meter. And residents are advised to use water more than once  before it is drained off, for instance, using the water in which  clothes have been washed to clean the floor.    Meanwhile, the high temperatures and lack of rain are  threatening the summer crop planting in the suburbs.</p>

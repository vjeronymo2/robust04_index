			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Arts: Two student Brittens - Opera So long as there is no indigenous opera company in Manchester, the Royal Northern College of Music will be able to claim a very visible share of the operatic scene. It has been particularly ambitious of late - Vaughan Williams's The Pilgrim's Progress last year, Massenet's Cendrillon at Christmas - and its summer-term offering comprised two wholly new productions: Britten's The Turn of the Screw and A Midsummer Night's Dream. For a music school this is quite an undertaking. One of the operas may be only small-scale, but that does not necessarily make a high standard of musical preparation easier to achieve. The orchestral playing on both nights was consistently good. There are professional performances of these operas that pass by without imparting as much character as the students did under their conductors, Timothy Reynish and Christopher Gayford. Like the operas, the two stagings were quite different. Sally Day's production of The Turn of the Screw became entangled in problems as to what to show on stage and what not, but it gave the audience something to think about. At the beginning it was made clear that the Governess was besotted with the children's guardian. When the ghost Quint and boy Miles later appeared, both with the same looks and red hair, all manner of inter-relationships was set up - a highly complex sexual equation. It was hardly surprising that Marianne Joseph as the Governness should get a lot out of her role, but she did so in a mature way, singing with care for the words and putting before us a composed and educated woman. Michael Bennett was an incisive tenor Quint and Mary Pope a strong, slightly raw Miss Jessel. The other producer, Geoffrey Saunders, saw A Midsummer Night's Dream in more conventional terms. The sets resembled the original Covent Garden staging (exhumed by the RNCM itself not so long ago). Nothing very sinister was lurking in its nocturnal shadows. This was a benign dream, merely fantasy and humour with a few moments of saccharine sweetness, as when Tytania settled down for the night in a rosy pink bower like a huge meringue, surrounded by flickering candles. The impressive feature was the all-round strength of the large cast. Singling out individual names seems unfair, but Elizabeth Campos made a sparkling Tytania and Wyn Pencarreg a touching Bottom, if not the gauche extrovert the role implies. Both pairs of lovers, Maureen Murphy and Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts, Louise Armit and Richard Whitehouse, included voices of some promise. A pity that Puck was taken in pantomime-style by a girl: not, I suspect, an idea of which Britten would have approved. Productions sponsored by Manchester Airport and Bailcast</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> NIXON'S LAW OFFICE GETS A FINAL APPEAL  </P> <P> Members of the Nixon Law Office Preservation Inc. appealed to City Council  members Tuesday in a last-ditch effort to save the former President's first  place of business from demolition.  </P> <P> "I have spent about 20 years of my life trying to keep that building there,"  said Lois Lundberg, a lifelong resident of La Habra.  </P> <P> "This is not something you can reconsider in a couple of years after it's torn  down."  </P> <P> Although it did not take final action, the council agreed to study the matter  and take it up again next month.  </P> <P> The appeal Tuesday came as the city was preparing to proceed with demolition  plans for a collection of buildings known as Old Settler's Plaza, where Nixon's  former law office is located.  </P> <P> Esther Cramer, recognized as La Habra's city historian, asked the council to  work with the preservation group to develop a plan to save the office and the  historic Wester Hotel in the same block. Cramer offered to volunteer her time  in coordinating the project.  </P> <P> But plans to renovate and restore the pre-1933 structures hit a snag this year  when cost estimates skyrocketed. Considerable damage was done by the 1987  Whittier earthquake, and they were rocked again this year in the Upland quake.  </P> <P> The cost of strengthening the brick buildings is prohibitive, according to City  Manager Lee Risner, who added that retaining one or two of the structures would  drastically limit the usefulness of the surrounding property.  </P> <P> Council members have discussed the possibility of moving the structure to  another location. But Risner expressed skepticism, saying that unreinforced  brick buildings cannot be easily moved.  </P> <P> After hearing the complaints, council members agreed to look into possible  methods of saving the building. Councilman William D. Mahoney has scheduled a  meeting with Cramer and others next month.DAVID F. BURKE  </P></p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / International Company News: How BT could boost shareholder value BRITISH Telecommunications could increase shareholder value by several billion pounds through a radical change in its dividend policy, according to a report to be published today by stockbrokers Robert Fleming Securities. Such a change could involve giving shareholders a one-off 'mega dividend', making large supplementary payments on top of its normal dividends. Alternatively, it could buy in its own shares. Larger distributions would benefit tax-free investors like pension funds. Those payouts or share purchases would also prevent BT accumulating a cash mountain expected to be Pounds 2.6bn by end-March 1997. According to Mr Laurence Heyworth, of Robert Fleming, it would be better to pay shareholders and allow them to recycle the cash to more productive investments If BT paid out cash, tax-exempt investors would be able to reclaim from the Inland Revenue advance corporation tax paid on dividends. There would, theoretically, be an advantage in distributing cash so long as ACT payments did not exceed BT's corporation tax liabilities. Because the company has for years paid out less than half its earnings in dividends and such shortfalls can be carried over for six years for tax purposes, the theoretical maximum scope for distributions would be Pounds 9.6bn. A maximum distribution would transfer tax credits of Pounds 3.2bn to shareholders. Those who are tax-exempt (they own about half BT's shares) would be able to reclaim their proportion from the IR. Even in the context of BT's stock market capitalisation of Pounds 23bn, these are large amounts of money. 'BT is the largest of a number of leading UK companies such as British Gas and Marks &amp; Spencer which could substantially increase the tax efficiency of their earnings to most shareholders,' said Mr Philip Shirley, a tax specialist of accountants Lewis Shirley. But such a move by BT might be controversial, Mr Heyworth warned. It might lead to complaints that the company was making excessive profits out of customers or that it was helping holders to recoup tax at a time when government finances were plunging heavily into the red.</p>

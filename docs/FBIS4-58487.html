			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo (AA) -- Ali Simsek report -- Foreign Minister  Hikmet Cetin has said that the Israeli-Palestinian agreement  signed in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, today is important for  the entire world.    Cetin, who is in Cairo to attend the signing ceremony of the  agreement, assessing the agreement said that it will affect the  region in many ways.    Stressing that the path taken has no return and that it will  lead to peace and stability, Cetin said: This region which  allocates all its resources to armament, clashes and war will  now, to a great extent, allocate them to the development of the  region and the peoples within the framework of cooperation.    Cetin noted that Turkey, which is a democratic and secular  country in the region, can make significant contributions to the  Middle East which is being restructured.    Pointing out that Turkey maintains good relations with all  the regional countries, Cetin expressed satisfaction over the  fact that the 45-year old war has ended in peace. He described  this day as a `historic' one.    In an appeal to all the peoples of strife torn regions,  Cetin  said: No matter how much you fight, every war ends in peace.  Let us secure peace before too much blood is spilled.    Pointing out that the agreement signed is just the  beginning,  Cetin concluded by saying that Syria, Jordan and Lebanon should  join the peace process.</p>

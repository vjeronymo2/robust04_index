			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Barclays says recovery can withstand tax rises The recovery is strong enough to withstand April's tax rises, says Barclays Bank, in spite of last week's poor economic statistics. In an upbeat economic review published today, Barclays says interest rates are close to their low point and are unlikely to go below 5 per cent. Mr Alan Davies, Barclays' chief economist, says: 'There has been little general appreciation of just how far the economy has moved away from the recession.' He says recent data 'should not detract from the fact that the overall recovery has been stronger than expected a year ago. Despite some disappointment with last week's statistics, the balance of evidence still suggests strengthening demand and output.' Barclays predicts growth in UK gross domestic product of 2.7 per cent this year, rising to 2.9 per cent in 1995. Inflation is forecast to reach 3.2 per cent by the end of this year and 4.2 per cent by the end of 1995. Unemployment is expected to fall to 2.55m by the end of this year. Mr Davies says resilient consumer spending and an improvement in the corporate sector's financial position point to a strengthening recovery. Also, 'UK exporters are well placed to build on the resilient performance of the past year'. Barclays' view of the prospects for the developed economies is the most optimistic for three years. Mr Davies says: 'Growth will be somewhat stronger in 1994, with the continuing upturn in the United States being joined by recoveries in Japan and Europe in response to lower interest rates.'

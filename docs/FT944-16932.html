			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Scottish TV shares slide after profits fall The share price of Scottish Television dropped by 44p yesterday to 430p after the company reported considerably worse than expected half-year results. The commercial television company, noted for programmes such as Taggart and Doctor Finlay's Casebook, said pre-tax profits had fallen from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 1.7m in the six months to June 30. Scottish TV put most of the blame on the chaos in television sales house operations - the intermediaries between advertisers and television companies  -after the spate of ITV takeovers and new government limits on sale house ownership. An advertising boycott by Unilever, one of its large clients, accounted for about one third of the setback. As a result, Scottish TV's share of total advertising revenue dropped from 5.2 per cent to 4.9 per cent in the period. Mr William Brown, Scottish TV chairman, yesterday issued what was in effect a profit warning by predicting that profits for the whole year would fall to about Pounds 9m from the 1993 figure of Pounds 13.1m. The figures came a week after The Mirror Group, publisher of titles such as the Daily Mirror and the Scottish Daily Record, bought a further 5 per cent in Scottish TV to take its total stake to just under 20 per cent. Last week's purchase and the original 15 per cent raid last month were both at 520p. Yesterday's drop in price means the Mirror, which has adopted a strategy of expanding into electronic media, is showing a loss of more than Pounds 8m on its Pounds 49m investment. The Mirror argued yesterday that the share price had merely returned to the level before its share purchase. Scottish TV has now signed up with advertising sales house Television Sales and Marketing Services and said it was looking forward to settled trading conditions. 'We are hopeful that 1995 will see a return to growth and progress,' Mr Brown said. Six-month turnover fell from Pounds 64m in 1993 to Pounds 58.4m this time and earnings per share dropped from 5.84p to 2.33p. The company is, however, increasing its dividend by 5 per cent to 2.2641p. The figures included Pounds 2.5m in exceptional restructuring costs, which it said would lead to Pounds 1m savings next year. Analysts, who had forecast full-year pre-tax profits of between Pounds 12m and Pounds 16m, yesterday took Scottish TV at its word and cut expectations to Pounds 9m.</p>

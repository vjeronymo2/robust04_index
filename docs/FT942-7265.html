			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Arts: Keeping up with Arcadia - Theatre A Nobel prize-winner said on the radio on Monday that he could keep up with all the talk about science and Romanticism in Tom Stoppard's Arcadia. I rather pity him. Trying to keep up with Arcadia is, for us lesser mortals, impossible, exuberant, and, finally, strangely touching. The play was exciting when new last year at the National Theatre; but returning to it, now that it comes to the West End, is even better - just that bit less bewildering but no less tantalising. For our failure to understand everything is part of the beauty of the play. Arcadia is all about knowledge - about the effort to know things, about the mutations of known things and our ways of knowing them, and about the ultimate unknowability of things. It suspends, shimmering in the air, both knowledge as a human epistemological endeavour and knowledge as an ultimate ontological fact. Its wit puts one in mind of Congreve and Wilde, but finally it comes closer to the forsworn, death-clouded scholars of Love's Labour's Lost. It says 'Lord] what fools these scholars be', and then, so tenderly, darts on to knowledge of life, death, and sex. Arcadia commutes between two eras: 1809-1812 and the present day. Lord Byron is forever offstage, much spoken of by characters in both periods. Romantic sincerity and Romantic artifice are all-important; and so is nature - nature as spoilt and reinvented and investigated by successive humans; and so is time. The play cast its spell with its marvellous original cast last year. This time I admire Trevor Nunn's direction even more because he has kept the play virtually as enchanting with a new and generally inferior cast. I miss some of the first cast dreadfully - we are lucky that Radio 3 has twice broadcast their performance - but I remain captivated. The best news is that the two most touching and complex roles, Thomasina and her young tutor Septimus - are still very well played by talented young actors. Lucy Whybrow has Thomasina's febrile intensity and charming precocity; and Edward Atterton has the smouldering intensity of the young Romantic's mind and emotion. The worst news is that Thomasina's mother and the revisionist scholar Hannah are acted terribly - busily, over-emphatically, weakly - by Julie Legrand and Joanne Pearce. Roger Allam is a more languid, classy lecturer than was Bill Nighy; Charles Simpson a more affected young aristo than Sam West. Yet any flaws are minor, for Nunn has elicited pacing so lucid, and pointing so natural, that this astonishingly complex play remains rich in suspense, laughter, and the excitement of thought. Jeremy Sams's music, brilliantly crossing historical periods, is perfect and moving; and so is the beautiful Georgian round room of Mark Thompson's set. In this post-modern work, every rococo embellishment makes its telling contribution. Theatre Royal, Haymarket</p>

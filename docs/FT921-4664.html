			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Budget 92: Borrowing prospects set City nerves jangling - How economists view the chancellor's options AS Budget day ap-proaches, the City is getting twitchy. A week ago the consensus was that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, could risk a 'give-away' Budget next Tuesday in the cause of strengthening the Conservatives' re-election chances. Now many private-sector economists are not so sure. Reflecting this sentiment, financial markets in the past few days have looked jittery. Sterling has slipped, while and gilts have lost about 2 points over the week. One worry is that Britain's public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) looks certain to rise sharply during the next two years, partly because of tax cuts likely to be announced on Tuesday. Another concern for the markets is that opinion polls have shown strong support for the Labour party. Many economists think a Labour government would push up borrowing still more, jeopardising sterling's position in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). Mr Peter Spencer, UK economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, says: 'From a City perspective, a high PSBR is all very well if a Tory government is re-elected. But if it simply opens the door to new borrowing under Labour, then it's a different kettle of fish.' The view among many economists remains that Mr Lamont will inject up to Pounds 4bn into the economy, with Pounds 2bn of this coming from a 1p cut in the 25p standard rate of income tax. Other sweeteners could include a rise in child allowances, aid to industry through increased tax relief on investment spending and a cut in the 10 per cent special car tax to help hard-hit carmakers. With Britain suffering the longest recession for 50 years, and the possibility of a general election in the next month, generosity of this sort is not hard to justify. But while Mr Lamont could argue that such a stimulus is needed to revive the economy, the effect on the long-term PSBR trend has started to worry some financial analysts. Britain's need to borrow on financial markets by issuing gilts is rising anyway, partly because of the Pounds 11bn extra public spending for 1992-93 which Mr Lamont unveiled in his Autumn Statement last November. The recession has reduced tax income and pushed up spending in areas such as unemployment benefit. Any additional government spending will increase its need to borrow. Consequently, the PSBR is thought likely to rise from about Pounds 12bn in the fiscal year ending on March 31 to about Pounds 25bn in 1992-93. In 1993-94 it could reach about Pounds 35bn. Many economists are not too uncomfortable about such figures, arguing that they represent only 4 per cent to 5 per cent of gross domestic product, which is not high historically. Also Britain's ratio of debt to GDP is less than in many other comparable economies, giving it more leeway to relax controls on spending when the economy is under strain. Others say Mr Lamont is virtually forced to follow an active fiscal stance if he wants to boost the economy, as large cuts in interest rates, now at 10.5 per cent, are ruled out by ERM membership. Sir Fred Atkinson, a former chief economic adviser at the Treasury, says: 'Britain still has fiscal freedom. Mr Lamont might as well use it.' Added to this is the likely political effect of a generous Budget. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, the US investment house, says: 'A give-away Budget runs less of a risk of unsettling markets than one that is lacklustre or modest.' Looking further into the 1990s, however, some economists see little likely improvement in the PSBR figures. Mr Malcolm Roberts, a bond specialist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the Swiss-owned bank, thinks the PSBR could shoot up to Pounds 40bn in 1993-94 and Pounds 50bn in 1994-95. If this happened Britain might have trouble finding buyers for the gilts it would need to issue to fund the borrowing. Interest rates might have to rise to make the gilts more attractive. Some argue that if the PSBR rose to unacceptable levels, sweeping tax cuts - the goal of many Tory supporters  - could become still more difficult to push through. Professor Patrick Minford, a monetarist economist at Liverpool University, says: 'The government has given up trying to control public spending; they've let the horse rip.' The debate remains, too, about to what degree next week's likely cuts in income tax are appropriate from an economic point of view, rather than as a vote-winning gambit. Ms Ruth Lea, UK economist at the London office of Mitsubishi Bank, the Japanese investment house, says: 'If you want a quick economic kick, a tax cut is probably appropriate. But for the longer term, extra money on public-sector investment (in areas like roads and railways) might be a more sensible way of putting money into the economy.' For all the talk about figures, many in the City will be looking next Tuesday not so much for the statistical detail in Mr Lamont's Budget statement but for the way he presents it with a view to influencing voters. Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, the UK investment group, says: 'Make no mistake, this will be straightforward electioneering Budget.'</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> The Malaysian government is putting a lid on racy television advertisements and  commercials that show only non-Malaysian models. Beginning July 1, Caucasian  and other non-Malaysian models can appear in commercials only if the ads also  include Malays, Chinese, Indians or other races that predominate in Malaysia.  Commercials with women in swimsuits and scanty clothing also will be banned.  Michael Tang, president of the Association of Accredited Advertising Agents of  Malaysia, called the ban "a little too harsh and debatable" and asked for a  review. Malaysia's population of 17 million is 55% Malay, 37% Chinese, with the  remainder mainly Indian. The country has three TV channels, two owned by the  government and the other belongs to the ruling party. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

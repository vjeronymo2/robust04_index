			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Gold bars out - but turkeys stay in Gold bars may be out, but paying employees in antiques and turkeys remains an option for companies attempting to minimise employees' tax bills, a leading firm of accountants said yesterday. Ms Leslie Ferrar, a tax partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, said draft legislation in the finance bill issued this week had failed to clamp down as far as many practitioners had feared. Only employees who receive assets that are capable of being sold on a recognised investment exchange or are provided in a way that they are convertible into cash are covered. Rules for other payments, which commonly include Christmas gifts to employees and incentives to sales staff such as televisions and food hampers, are not covered by the bill. The effect will be to allow payments on many in-kind payments to remain untaxed until the next return is filed, rather than become subject immediately to pay-as-you-earn.</p>

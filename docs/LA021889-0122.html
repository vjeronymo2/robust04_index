			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION 5-AA BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> MATER DEI GETS STIFF TEST, BUT PASSES BY 20  </P> <P> When Upland High School came into Rancho Santiago College's Cook Gymnasium  Friday night, the Highlanders didn't have fancy warm-up suits with names on the  back, like the ones worn by Mater Dei.  </P> <P> The Highlanders' numbers were ironed onto their uniforms, not sewn, and Upland  didn't even have matching high-tops.  </P> <P> Upland didn't look stylish, but for the first 16 minutes, the Highlanders -- in  their first basketball playoff season in 11 years -- played right alongside  Mater Dei.  </P> <P> A run of 16 points by Mater Dei at the start of the second half put Upland away  for good, and the Monarchs pulled away to an 85-65 victory in the second round  of the Southern Section 5-AA playoffs.  </P> <P> But Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight, whose Monarchs are 25-2 and aiming for their  fifth consecutive large-school championship, admitted that he was a little  worried. Especially when Upland guard Rick Brodbeck started raining down  three-pointers in the first half.  </P> <P> Brodbeck made seven three-pointers and led all scorers with 32 points. One of  Brodbeck's long-range shots brought Upland (18-10) to within one early in the  second period.  </P> <P> "I was waiting for them to cool off," McKnight said. "An eight-point lead at  the half just isn't enough against a team that can shoot like that."  </P> <P> Fortunately for McKnight, his own long-range sharpshooter -- Dylan Rigdon --  was right on the mark all game. Rigdon, a senior guard headed for UC Irvine,  made 10 of 15 shots for 25 points, including five three-pointers.  </P> <P> Senior Mark Morris had a trio of three-pointers in the third period to pad  Mater Dei's lead and finished with 16 points.  </P></p>

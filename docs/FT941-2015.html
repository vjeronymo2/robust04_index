			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Repackaging is needed to shift Red Star: Why a British Rail offshoot is proving difficult to sell Red Star, British Rail's express parcels delivery service, is proving one of the most troublesome parts to privatise. It is not the only division of BR to make losses, but the size of its deficit - Pounds 9m last year on turnover of Pounds 43m - has proved a barrier to sale. One rival said: 'You would have to give me the business plus Pounds 20m to make it worthwhile.' It was put up for sale last June and taken out of the shop window in December when a suitable offer failed to materialise. Earlier this month BR was forced to acknowledge that a sale would be impossible without big changes. Red Star, which claims to be the UK market leader in same-day deliveries, is to shed 500 of its 1,280 staff and drop a large chunk of its next-day business, which accounts for 30 per cent of turnover. It has fallen victim to a general retrenchment in the Pounds 1.8bn parcels sector and to its own high cost base. Rapid growth generally in express deliveries in the late 1980s led to overcapacity and fierce price competition. Growth has slowed to between 2 per cent and 3 per cent a year while prices have been falling. Of particular concern to Red Star was the shift away from premium services promising delivery on the same day or early the next day. Customers whose margins were under pressure opted for cheaper services providing delivery the next afternoon or later. Red Star is gambling that, with the UK recession apparently ending, this period of cheap-rate buying has come to an end. It is planning to exploit its main advantage, the use of the BR rail network which allows rapid deliveries across the country on the same day or by 9am the next day. It will drop its slower services providing next-day delivery by noon or 5.30pm. Other parcels groups are not barred from using rail and some do for occasional deliveries. But they have to use the Red Star service and either slap a charge on top of the Red Star rate or take a smaller cut themselves. Mr Bill Tyler, head of BR's vendor unit, said: 'No one can match us on same-day city-to-city business.' Red Star may regard the rail link as its main advantage but others are less convinced. One rival which used Red Star on a trial basis said it had dropped it because of the poor level of service. Red Star is not the only victim of the pressure in the parcels sector. Elan International, an express freight and parcels company with turnover of Pounds 28m, collapsed last month with debts of Pounds 6m and the loss of more than 700 jobs. Other companies are rethinking their strategies. Parcelforce, the parcels arm of the Post Office and the largest company in the parcels market, is streamlining its depot network and merging some services. A survey of express delivery services by Marketing Strategies for Industry, a consultancy, forecasts modest growth for the sector with a 9 per cent increase by 1996 in the number of packages delivered. But profits will improve only if the industry can provide more high-value services, it warns. MSI says simple deli-veries are no longer enough. Companies are increasingly carrying out processing and printing of despatch documents, inventory management and invoicing. Mr Tyler remains optimistic about finding a buyer for Red Star. He said: 'The move to premium services will lead to a significant improvement in profits.' But he was unable to say when Red Star would move into the black. Rail privatisation, Page 23</p>

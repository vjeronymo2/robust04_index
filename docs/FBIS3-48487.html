The  decision was made following STRI's success in developing an  experimental high-temperature superconducting IC. They plan to  start this project in fiscal 1995. Technology for very  high-speed optical communications, the area in which Japan lags  behind the United States, is the key to realizing a multimedia  society. MITI hopes to catch up with the United States in this  area through the development of superconducting ICs.    Technology for terabit communications enables one fiber  optical cable to have a capacity equal to that of more than 15  million telephone lines, or to that of 30,000 wires for  high-definition television images. It is expected that if  terabit communications eventuate, the cost of communications  will drop to almost zero and multimedia businesses such as  interactive visual and data communications will bloom.    Lasers for optical communications have a high frequency of  more than 200 terahertz. This makes it theoretically possible  to transmit 1 terabit of data through fiber optics, but in  actuality the amount of data that can be transmitted through  optical communications is limited to about 1 gigabit.  Similarly, the amount of data that can be transmitted through  the information superhighway which the U.S. Government is trying  to develop is no more than 10 gigabits.    The higher the transmission speed, the greater the  electrical  resistance inside receiver semiconductors. This makes it  difficult to receive the data transmitted and is the reason for  the limited amount of transmission data. STRI turned its  attention to a superconducting element whose electrical  resistance was almost zero, and succeeded last autumn in  developing an experimental superconducting IC made of  high-temperature superconducting material. The development of  such an IC was the first in the world.    This experimental IC has a simple structure. It is made of a  superconducting antenna and six Josephson junction devices. The  STRI has confirmed that the IC is capable of receiving a  23-gigahertz high frequency electric wave. STRI Director Shoji  Tanaka said if the integration of the IC is raised, it would  become possible to transmit and receive 100 gigabits or 1  terabit of data.</p>

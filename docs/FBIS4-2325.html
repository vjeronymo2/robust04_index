			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President  Jiang Zemin and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji respectively met  visiting French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and exchanged  views with him on promoting Sino-French relations here this  afternoon.    Jiang emphasized that it is very important to maintain a  sound cooperative relation between China and France in a complex  and volatile world.    Zhu said it takes time and energy to restore and improve  Sino-French trade and economic relations. He believes they will  grow quickly through joint efforts.    Balladur said the two countries have identical or similar  views in many fields, and there is a large room to improve  bilateral ties.    Jiang hailed the normalization of Sino-French relations, and  appreciated Balladur's efforts in restoring and improving  bilateral ties after he took office.    Jiang believed that Balladur's current tour will lead to  further development of Sino-French relations.    Jiang said China and France, with long history and splendid  cultures, have contributed greatly to the world civilizations,  and the two peoples enjoy traditional friendship and friendly  cooperations.    Jiang said since China and France established diplomatic  ties  some 30 years ago, effective cooperation in the fields of  politics, economy and trade, science and technology and culture  have been conducted, despite the difficulties and bumps facing  the two countries.    "We consider it very wise and foresighted decision made by  late Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai and General de  Gaulle to cement diplomatic ties when looking back the  development of Sino-French relations," Jiang said. [sentence as  received]    He emphasized that as permanent members of the UN Security  Council, China and France should contribute more to safeguarding  world peace and security, he said.    China and France have good basis of cooperation given that  they have no fundamental interests conflicts while holding  identical or similar views on many major international issues,  he said. [sentence as received]    The two countries are complementary economically, which  provide good conditions for trade and economic cooperation,  Jiang said, adding that he believe Sino-French trade and  economic cooperation will rise to a new height and a lot more  concerned will be done once a favourable political atmosphere is  created and bilateral political relations improved.    Balladur extended President Mitterrand's greetings to Jiang  and invited him to visit France on behalf of Mitterrand.    Balladur said Mitterrand looked forward to further  development of France-China relations.    Jiang thanked for the invitation and asked Balladur to  convey  his greetings to Mitterrand.    In another meeting, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji told Balladur  that China appreciates his speech in Paris that France-China  relations have entered a new phase.    Zhu added that China is willing to exert efforts to develop  its relations with France.    Balladur said his talks with Premier Li Peng yesterday  indicated that France and China share many identical or similar  views, there is a great potential for improvement of bilateral  cooperation.    Zhu and Balladur exchanged views on how to develop  Sino-French trade and economic relations in a sincere and  friendly atmosphere.    He also briefed the guest on China's reform and opening-up.    Among those present at the meeting were chairman of the  Chinese Government Reception Committee and Minister of Power  Industry Shi Dazhen, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and  Minister of Industry, Posts, Telecommunications and Foreign  Trade Gerard Longuet.

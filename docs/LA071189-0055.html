			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Japan's leaders agreed to provisionally budget for hefty increases in defense  spending and overseas aid for the next fiscal year, government officials said.  They said defense outlays will increase as much as 6.35% in the year that  begins April 1, 1990, and overseas aid by up to 9.4% over the current fiscal  year. Japan has been under pressure from the United States to recycle some of  its huge trade surplus back to the Third World by increasing its spending on  overseas aid, and this year Japan passed the United States in total overseas  aid expenditures. Washington has also been pressing Tokyo to take up a greater  share of the burden of defending itself.  </P></p>

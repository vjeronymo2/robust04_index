			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Share fraud hits Jakarta market A FRAUD involving forged certificates has led to the suspension of dealings in the shares of five of Indonesia's top companies. The transactions involving forged certificates occurred between March 15 and March 19, leading the Jakarta stock exchange to suspend until April 1 trade in Indah Kiat and Indorayon, two of the region's leading wood-pulp companies, Inco, a nickel producer, H M Sampoerna, a cigarette company, and Semen Gresik, a cement producer. When the suspension is lifted, brokers must obtain stock exchange clearance of the companies' share certificates as part of any transaction. Brokers doubt, however, the exchange's ability to verify certificates within the four days in which trade must legally be completed. Mashill Securities, a local brokerage company, alerted the stock exchange 10 days ago to the fraud but, with the market on holiday last week, trade in the affected companies was not suspended until Monday. At least five foreign broking houses have been left holding fake certificates and face possible losses, brokers say. The two people implicated in the crime have fled the country, reportedly to Hong Kong, and Interpol has been alerted. While the fraud's size, estimated at Rp12bn (Pounds 3.8m), is not substantial, its details have alarmed brokers who fear more scandals may unfold. The suspects had been dealing in the market for a year, making single trades of up to Rp1bn prior to the 'sting', say brokers who fear forged shares in other companies may await discovery. The forged certificates are also of exceptional quality, passing tests required by brokers such as ultra-violet checking of watermarks and carrying brokers' stamps recording former transactions. Details on the forgeries have also led brokers to speculate the criminals may have had access to confidential company share registers.</p>

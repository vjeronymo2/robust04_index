			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Time to cut it out - US manufacturers are questioning the value of money-off coupons Americans get more than news when they pick up a weekend newspaper. The typical Sunday morning edition, already requiring a specially reinforced breakfast table to bear the weight of its numerous sections, is further fattened by the inclusion of supplements containing page after page of clip-out coupons offering money off specified goods. Interleaved among the 13 sections of last Sunday's New York Times, for example, were three inserts containing nearly 100 coupons inviting readers to save money on products as diverse as bleach, tea bags, cat litter and anti-flatulence tablets. It is the same story across the country. Indeed, coupons are found in newspapers, magazines and other printed matter everywhere. Almost incredibly, some 298.5bn coupons were distributed in the US last year, with a face value totalling Dollars 177.6bn (Pounds 121.6bn) But has the whole thing gone too far? General Mills, the US food group, thinks so. From next month, it is sharply reducing the number of coupons it issues against its cereal products like Cheerios and Wheaties, preferring to cut its prices of the products by 11 per cent instead. General Mills's reasoning is straightforward: coupons are too often a waste of money. They cost a great deal to print, distribute and handle, yet last year barely 2 per cent of those issued were redeemed. 'Because of this inefficiency, the 50 cents that the consumer saves by clipping a coupon can cost manufacturers as much as 75 cents,' says Steve Sanger, General Mills's president. 'It just doesn't make sense.' General Mills is planning to reduce its annual promotional budget by 30 per cent - about Dollars 175m - by cutting back on coupons and in-store promotions. That means it will lose sales. But it reckons the net effect on revenues will be a loss of only Dollars 110m, so it will still be much better off at the bottom line. Apparently, General Mills is not the only US company questioning the efficiency of coupons. According to NCH Promotional Services, the promotion information division of Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the 298.5bn coupons issued last year represented a 4 per cent decline on the previous year's peak of 310bn. And because companies cut the average period of validity of their coupons, the number redeemed went down from 7.7bn to 6.8bn - a fall of nearly 12 per cent. So is this the beginning of the end of the coupon? Hardly, says Jane Perrin, NCH's senior vice president of marketing. While it is true that one or two companies - notably Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products group - have cut back on coupons in favour of everyday low pricing, a more significant trend is that companies are trying to improve the efficiency of coupons through better targeting. Inserting coupons in newspapers, while relatively cheap, is a scatter-gun technique. Instead, says Perrin, companies are experimenting with more sophisticated ways of reaching their audiences. One example is the targeted mailshot; another, the machine at the supermarket check-out that detects when shoppers have bought a Diet Coke and automatically dispenses a coupon offering them money off a Diet Pepsi. This said, many companies would be glad to see an end to coupons. Josh McQueen, director of research at the advertising agency Leo Burnett, says the logistical cost of meeting a sudden upturn in demand caused by a coupon issue can be great - and all to little purpose if most of the increased volume comes from existing customers stockpiling goods while prices are low. Another risk is that money is wasted on loyal consumers, while those who switch will move on to the next cheap product once the offer is over. Then there is the opportunity for fraud - for example, by stores allowing the redemption of the coupons against products other than the one named, or through reproduction of coupons on a colour photocopying machine. Notwithstanding the reaction of Hans Storr, chief financial officer of Philip Morris, the food and tobacco group - 'I hate coupons, with a vengeance' - they are not going to go away quite yet. Perrin maintains that many people enjoy clipping coupons, regarding it as an inherent part of the planning stage for a shopping expedition. 'The danger for manufacturers is that other promotional vehicles may not be as rewarding or as motivating for the consumer,' she says. And quite apart from anything else, it is a brave company that gives up such a powerful promotional tool while its competitors retain it. For that reason, if for no other, a lot of eyes will be fixed on General Mills's cereal sales figures from next month.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Treasury seeks tough NHS curbs: Portillo warns of hard decisions on public spending THE TREASURY is pressing for effective withdrawal of the National Health Service from dental care and the scrapping of free prescriptions for all but the poor in its fundamental review of public spending. The proposals - under consideration by a Whitehall committee set up by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary - foreshadow a fierce Whitehall battle during coming months as ministers prepare the government's spending plans for 1994-95 and after. The proposals emerged as Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, pledged to keep public spending within its preset ceilings in the next two financial years even though this risked 'courting unpopularity'. In a speech last night to the Association of Investment Trust Companies, he warned that the fundamental reviews being conducted by the Treasury of spending by the health, social security and education departments and the Home Office would 'throw up difficult decisions'. Mr Portillo said the government could not and should not reduce its public sector borrowing requirement solely by raising taxes. Higher taxes would blunt incentives, erode competitiveness and create upward pressure on interest rates, he warned. However, in comments to Independent Television News, Mr Portillo appeared to downplay the idea of limiting free prescriptions. 'I don't think it is one of the leading options,' he said. With Mr Portillo also demanding radical cuts in some social security benefits, the Treasury proposals will add to concern among Conservative MPs that the government's spending squeeze is pushing it towards an onslaught on the welfare state. The health committee is examining options to reduce the number of services provided by the NHS and at the same time increase its revenue base. Ministers believe some suggestions, such as the introduction of 'hotel charges' for hospital stays, will be dropped. And despite Mr Portillo's insistence that spending ministers must be ready to take hard decisions, the government's slim 18-seat majority may persuade Mr John Major, the prime minister, that such cuts would prove politically damaging. Mr Major made much in last year's general election campaign of his determination to maintain the NHS as a free service at the point of delivery. The Treasury argues the NHS will not be able to meet demand for healthcare without the proposed changes for prescriptions and dental care. Only 20 per cent of people pay the Pounds 4.25 prescription charge. The Treasury wants to increase this proportion to 80 per cent by limiting exemptions to people on income support and thus cut the Pounds 3bn NHS drugs bill. It also wants to take up a British Dental Association proposal that the NHS should pay only for dental treatment for children and the poor. Last night, Mr David Blunkett, Labour's health spokesman, said the government was preparing the ground for a major extension of NHS charges. 'Mrs Bottomley is clearly losing her battle with the Treasury. This is an outrageous attack on the sick, both old and young, and should be stopped in its tracks.' The cabinet is expected to meet in June to set the framework for talks on public spending before November's first unified Budget. The Treasury's aim will be to secure unanimous agreement that spending in the next three years should be tightly controlled. Mr Portillo has been meeting spending ministers in recent weeks to stress the need to hold the government's 'control total' for public spending within the planned Pounds 253.6bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 263.3bn in 1995-96. In his speech yesterday, Mr Portillo said public spending was expected to have risen nearly three times faster than tax revenues in the five years to April 1994. Estimated tax revenues would rise by Pounds 38bn while public spending would go up by Pounds 101bn. Spending had risen 17 per cent in real terms since 1988 while output had not grown at all.

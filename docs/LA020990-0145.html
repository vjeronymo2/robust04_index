			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISNEY ORDERS THEATERS TO DROP ON-SCREEN ADS;  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT: THE STUDIO SAYS IT WILL PULL ITS MOVIES FROM EXHIBITORS THAT  FAIL TO COMPLY. THE BAN IS APPARENTLY A FIRST FOR THE INDUSTRY.  </P> <P> Walt Disney Co., in a get-tough move aimed at movie exhibitors, said it will  stop showing its films in any theater that runs on-screen advertising with  them.  </P> <P> The ban is apparently the first such move by a major movie studio. It includes  advertising by newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times, which for about 40  years has run promotional spots on movie screens in exchange for discount rates  on movie directory listings in the paper.  </P> <P> On-screen advertising "is a turn-off. Audiences don't like it. They hate it,"  said Richard Cook, president of Disney's Buena Vista distribution unit.  </P> <P> On announcing the new policy Thursday at the ShoWest exhibitors' convention in  Las Vegas, Cook was greeted with applause by some theater owners, but others  responded angrily to what they saw as high-handed behavior by the studio.  </P> <P> "We can't keep raising ticket prices to offset increasing costs. . . . This is  a very serious problem," Allen Karp, president of Cineplex Odeon Corp., said of  the Disney move. Cineplex, which is 49%-owned by MCA Inc., parent of Universal  Pictures, is among the biggest theater chains that regularly use advertising.  Karp said he was talking with Disney about a "mutually acceptable" way of  meeting the studio's concerns.  </P> <P> "Disney thinks it's swinging a pretty big bat right now," said another theater  manager, who declined to be identified. He said he received a letter from  Disney on Wednesday telling him not to bother bidding on "Pretty Woman," a  Disney film set for distribution in March, if his chain wasn't prepared to  comply with the advertising policy.  </P> <P> One of the biggest purveyors of on-screen advertising is New York-based  Screenvision Cinema Network, which claims to have placed ads on about 6,000 of  the nation's approximately 23,000 theater screens. Screenvision officers didn't  return calls seeking comment on the Disney move.  </P> <P> Lured by the desirable demographics of movie-going audiences, companies have  turned to on-screen advertising for products such as Toyota and Mitsubishi  automobiles, Kodak film and Dr Pepper soft drinks.  </P> <P> "No one has put a number on (the amount of such advertising). But it's gone way  up. . . . The biggest category is automotive," said Marcy Magiera, a reporter  for Advertising Age.  </P> <P> Some movie executives have complained privately that the ads alienate  audiences. But none has so far been willing to take a step similar to Disney's  -- and risk seeing its films kept off some screens by exhibitors who want to  continue advertising.  </P> <P> Distribution executives from 20th Century Fox Film Corp. and Paramount Pictures  didn't return calls seeking comment. Fred Mount, Universal Pictures'  distribution head, said he wasn't aware of any company that planned to follow  Disney's move immediately.  </P> <P> One Los Angeles exhibitor, who declined to be identified, said he believed that  Disney could enforce the policy without much difficulty, particularly if a  second major distributor followed suit.  </P> <P> "Given the choice between a Chevy ad and a Disney movie, you're going to take  the Disney movie," the exhibitor said.  </P> <P> Disney angered some theater owners a year ago by going to a so-called  per-capita system, under which it takes a fixed dollar amount for each ticket  sold rather than a percentage of the box-office take. The system tends to  discourage the sale of discount tickets in first-run movie houses but didn't  apply to discount theaters that normally show a film after its first run is  over.  </P> <P> Paramount followed with a per-capita system that applies to discount theaters.  </P> <P> "We're not going to lose theaters," Disney's Cook insisted Thursday in  discussing the new advertising policy. "We're trying to preserve the  movie-going experience. Attendance has been almost level for 10 years, and this  industry can ill afford any erosion."  </P> <P> Cook said Disney would ask theater owners with existing advertising contracts  to make a "good faith" effort to have Disney films exempted from the  agreements. But he said Disney would allow exhibitors to honor those contracts  if no exemption could be obtained and would only expect compliance with the  studio's no-advertising rule on renewal.  </P> <P> Disney has said it will make exceptions for slide advertisements shown during  intermission and for "approved" charitable ads. Asked whether advertising by  The Times and other newspapers, such as the L.A. Weekly, would be included,  Cook said: "It is. That is an advertisement. We're not splitting fine hairs  here."  </P> <P> A Times spokeswoman said: "Our arrangement is with the theater owners. We  haven't been contacted by them, so there's not much to say."  </P> <P> One individual familiar with the paper's ad agreements with exhibitors said the  "economic burden (on theater owners) is going to be enormous" if they are  forced to pay the paper's normal ad rates when advertising Disney films.  </P> <P> Still, several exhibitors contacted at ShoWest said they favored the Disney  policy. "Even if it costs us money, I'm for it," said Bruce Corwin, head of  Metropolitan Theatres, a major Southern California chain.  </P> <P> Corwin said he briefly experimented with advertising but dropped it from many  of his theaters because of an audience backlash. "The response was so loud and  so negative, it was clearly not appropriate for us. You have to go with the  culture, and the culture said no commercials," Corwin said.  </P> <P> Metropolitan continues to show ads in its Spanish-language theaters, because  audiences in those theaters didn't object, Corwin added.  </P></p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Saudi prince buys stake in Saks store group A SAUDI prince who acquired a sizeable minority stake in Citicorp two years ago has become a large investor in Saks Fifth Avenue, the US department store group which was bought by Investcorp, an Arab-led investment consortium in 1989. Investcorp said yesterday that United Saudi Commercial Bank had arranged for some of its Saudi clients to buy a stake of approximately 11 per cent in the retail group, for Dollars 100m. The principal investor in the transaction was said to be Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, United Saudi's chairman. Prince Alwaleed became chairman of the Saudi bank after he bought a controlling interest in 1987. But he is probably best known for his stake in Citicorp, the largest US commercial bank. The prince surfaced as an investor in the US bank in early 1991 when he snapped up Dollars 590m-worth of convertible stock, one of the largest placements of stock with a private individual in the history of US banking. However, he was already a large ordinary shareholder in the bank, and is now reckoned to have invested about Dollars 800m in Citicorp's preferred and ordinary shares. United Saudi Commercial Bank said yesterday that the Dollars 100m investment did not represent new money for Saks, but the placement of a portion of an additional Dollars 300m investment which Investcorp made in Saks last year. Investcorp, which acquired Saks from Britain's BAT Industries for Dollars 1.6bn, disclosed the Dollars 300m injection last February. Although the capital infusion came at a time when adverse rumours about the condition of Saks' finances were circulating, Saks maintained that it was essentially a refinancing, designed to help the retailer shed its highly leveraged transaction status, and borrow funds more easily and cheaply.</p>

"We may have to consider first pushing reform bills through  in the current Diet session and then modifying the laws in the  next session," said the official of the largest party in the  coalition government, speaking on condition of anonymity.    He said the coalition has to "make a political promise" to  the opposition on future amendments of the laws in return for  securing passage of the bills in the current Diet sitting, which  ends January 29.    The political reform measures won approval of the House of  Representatives in mid-November and are pending in the House of  Councillors.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has vowed to get the bills  passed in the current extraordinary Diet term, but the main  opposition Liberal Democratic Party is trying to prevent their  passage.    The proposed reform legislation is intended to introduce a  new system for lower house elections and tighten controls on  campaign funding.</p>

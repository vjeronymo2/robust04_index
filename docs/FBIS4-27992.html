			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia and  Britain will look into the possibility of signing a memorandum  of understanding (MOU) between trade organisations of both  countries for further collaboration in trade services, Deputy  Minister of International Trade and Industry Chua Jui Meng said  Monday.    He said the MOU between Malaysia External Trade Development  Corporation (Matrade) and British Board of Trade (BBOT) would  allow exchanging information on areas such as market  intelligence and training. If the MOU is signed, we would be  able to have the British assistance in exporting our trade  services abroad as the country was considered as a significant  trade in services, he told reporters this after holding  discussion with British Trade Minister Richard Needham at his  office here.    Needham is on a four-day official visit to Kuala Lumpur  beginning June 4, his third official visit in nine months. He  is accompanied by three officers and 19 senior British  businessmen.    Chua said that Malaysia is a strong importer in services and  as at last year, its imported services amounted to US $7.7  billion, which put Malaysia on the number 21 spot as the world's  largest importer of services.    Since we do not rank in the top 25 countries that export  trade services, we have been encountering deficit in trade  services, he said adding that Malaysia's deficit in trade  services was RM [Malaysian ringgit] 14.4 billion (about US $5.76  billion) last year.    Chua said the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) scheme  which urged Western nations to source for automotive parts  abroad, also augured well for Malaysia's automotive industry.    Malaysia's automotive industry had been making an important  on the local front as well as abroad especially with the  production of the first national car and the second national  car, said Chua.    This new policy will be a boost for our automotive trade as  we have exchanged ideas with the British on the possibility of  setting up an automotive parts and components industry in  Malaysia, he added.    He said with the set up, the two countries could work  together in terms of joint venture or technology licensing  whereby the British would transfer their technology to Malaysia.    It would also enable Malaysia to be the regional centre for  production and export of automotive parts and components, he  added.    Meanwhile, Needham said the British Government would  continue  to send trade missions here regardless of the action taken by  Malaysia not to award government contracts to British companies  recently.    We are determined to continue to show our interest in  Malaysia and the best way of doing that is to continue sending  trade missions here, he said adding that there will be another  six trade missions on the way.    He said Britain had vast interests in Malaysia and what  other  way of showing that than by setting up joint ventures between  companies of both countries, form British companies in Malaysia  or any other possible way.    Understandably, with our history of long relationship, we  encountered problems but I believe that it can be worked out for  the benefits of both countries, he added.</p>

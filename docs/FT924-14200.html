			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Food and Drink: Fine wines from the Chilean heartland GILBERT ROKVAM, Chateau Lafite's chief oenologist, casts a worried glance at the darkening sky that promises rain. As the first heavy drops begin to fall, Rokvam resigns himself to the fact that there will be no grape-picking this afternoon - a minor irritant towards the close of a vintage that has otherwise gone like clockwork. But this is April and Rokvam is in the wine heartland of Chile, 8,000 miles away from Bordeaux. Five years ago, a small, family-owned vineyard called Los Vascos caught the eye of Baron Eric de Rothschild. He bought half of the estate, joining a select group of foreign vintners who are quietly awakening Chile's potential to produce fine wines. Miguel Torres of Spain was the first to declare Chile a 'wine-makers' paradise.' He owns more than 500 acres in the Central Valley. Torres was followed by Baron Eric, California's Franciscan Vineyards, and most recently by Bruno Prats of Chateau Cos d'Estournel with Paul Pontallier of Chateau Margaux. A survey by the Wine Spectator found Chile to be the most popular destination for foreign wine investors. They are being lured by inexpensive land, the virtual absence of vine pests and an ideal climate. The narrow Central Valley, bounded by the Andes to the east and rolling hills by the Pacific coast, has hot, dry summers cooled by ocean breezes at night. This, according to the experts, brings out the best flavours in the fruit. All that was missing was expertise and technology to modernise an industry as old as the Spanish conquest itself. Back in the 16th century, soldiers marching south from Peru brought grape seeds in their saddle-bags and Jesuit missionaries planted the first vines just south of Santiago. Admiral John Byron, the poet's grandfather, found solace in Chilean wines after being shipwrecked off Cape Horn in 1768. 'The haciendas, or country homes, are very pleasant, having fine olive groves and large vineyards,' he wrote. It was around this time that the Basque forefathers of Jorge Eyzaguirre and his wife founded their vineyard at Los Vascos. And although wine-making is synonymous with blue-blood in Chile, Eyzaguirre says the industry was moribund 10 years ago. 'We produced heavy, old-fashioned wines. When I started travelling abroad in the early 1980s, I discovered that my wine was unsellable,' he recalls without shame. His search for a white knight led him to Baron Eric. The partnership was sealed in January 1989, but not before Rokvam had tested Los Vascos against 167 other Chilean wines during a frantic week in Santiago. The pace has not slackened since. A new winery was built in 60 days, in time for the March harvest. 'I got rid of everything,' says Rokvam. 'The large wooden vats, very quaint but useless, the old wine presses, the concrete tanks.' The shining steel structure that houses Los Vascos' state-of-the-art winery and cellars may lack the romanticism attached to wine-making, but it has alerted Chile's wine aristocracy that viticulture today has much more to do with science than with traditions handed down through generations. They have been quick to learn. Technological innovation and vineyard management are now the buzz-words throughout the Central Valley. At Los Vascos, maceration takes place in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks. Rokvam brought French oak barriques made at Chateau Lafite to age the Cabernet Sauvignon. He introduced cold fermentation for the Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay. Only the grape-harvesting is done by hand. The revolution has been so complete that Eyzaguirre refers to his pre-89 vintages as 'Old Testament.' Rokvam says he was at first cautious about applying the methods used at Chateau Lafite so far away from home. After his fourth vendime at Los Vascos, he no longer has any doubts. 'We are creating a French chateau in Chile in the tradition of great Bordeaux wines,' he says. The Domaines Barons de Rothschild calling card has also opened up foreign markets. Almost the entire production from Los Vascos' 550-acre estate is now exported to 24 countries. There are only two ways of tasting their wines in Chile: an invitation to lunch at the Eyzaguirre's hacienda, or dinner at Balthazar, Santiago's most exclusive restaurant. Los Vascos is one of only four vineyards which produce 100 per cent estate-bottled wines in Chile. Eyzaguirre plans to keep it that way, though demand now far outstrips the 150,000 cases he can supply each year. He is expanding his vineyard, but, he reflects, even the race to produce world-class wines requires patience. Los Vascos wines are available from Fortnum &amp; Mason and branches of Bottoms Up.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Qu Zhihong (2575 1807 4767) and Guo Xiaolan </F> (6753 1420 5695)]    [Text] Beijing, 6 Jun (XINHUA) -- Despite being a late  beginner, China is making rapid progress in developing copyright  protection undertakings. Within three years, China has not only  set up a fairly complete copyright protection system in the  country, but also has taken a giant step into the big  international family of copyrights and achieved the link-up of  domestic copyright protection system with international ones. A  young and modernized copyright protection system has basically  been set up in China.    As the spring tide of reform and opening up rose, China  began  building its copyright protection system from naught. In 1979,  the drafting of the "PRC Copyright Law" began and over repeated  discussions and revisions, New China's first "Copyright Law" was  adopted at the 15th Session of the Standing Committee of the  Seventh National People's Congress [NPC] in 1990, and officially  took effect in June 1991. Meanwhile, the "Regulations for the  Implementation of the PRC Copyright Law" and the "Regulations on  Computer Software Protection" were promulgated one after  another; China's copyright protection legislation had taken  shape.    This significant progress in the field of intellectual  property right protection aroused enthusiastic responses from  various social circles, and the Chinese intelligentsia were  particularly elated.    In fact, as a world-acknowledged high-level "Copyright Law,"  the law has not only reaped the rewards it deserves, but has  also offered an overall legal protection to copyright holders  through various levels. Over the past three years, courts  around China have accepted over 500 copyright-related cases.  More and more people engaged in literature, arts, and science  and technology are walking to the solemn court with perfect  assurance to declare war against the infringements on their  signatory rights, rights to preserve the integrity of, and  rights to use their works.    Over three years of practice has proven that the enforcement  of the "Copyright Law" has not only offered a legal basis for  the protection of undertakings in literature, arts, and science  and technology in China, which then greatly inspires the  enthusiasm of people creating such works and directly promotes  the development of spiritual and material civilization, but has  also shown the whole society its respect for knowledge, creative  works, and human dignity. Many experts believed that this would  be of profound influence on the long-term development and  progress of Chinese society.    While establishing and improving the domestic copyright  protection system, China also actively promoted the progress of  joining the international copyright protection system. As early  as the beginning of the drafting of the "Copyright Law," China  had been paying great attention to absorbing the experiences and  strong points of international copyright circles, and had been  fully aware of the requirements of the international copyright  convention, so as to make corresponding preparations for joining  international copyright organizations. On 1 July 1992, the NPC  Standing Committee made a decision on joining the Berne  Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and  the Universal Copyright Convention; on 7 November, it made the  decision to join the "Sound-Recorded Products Convention." In  October 1992 and April 1993, the three international copyright  conventions took effect in China successively. Thus, China has  become a member of major international conventions on copyright  and relevant rights, set up relations with over 100 countries  for mutual copyright protection, and basically normalized  relations with foreign countries in copyright. It can be said  that within a couple of years, China has walked a path that took  many countries decades or even more than a century to walk.    China's rapid advances in the work of copyright protection  have drawn attention from the international community. Bogsch,  director-general of the World Intellectual Property  Organization, termed China's accession to the Berne Convention  "an important historic achievement" and "a tremendous success of  the international copyright circles" and China. He maintained  that this would be a significant matter to the Chinese culture,  science and technology, and social development, as well as to  the entire international community.</p>

In a paper published today, the commission, which the party set up to advise on policies for the welfare state, recommends options to focus pensions and benefits on those with little or no income from occupational pensions. The options include integrating benefits with the income tax system for pensioners. The Pensions Dilemma. Commission on Social Justice, 30 Southampton Street, London WC2E 7RA. Pounds 2.95.</p>

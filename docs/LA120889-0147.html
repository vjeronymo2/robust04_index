			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KEHRLI GROWS INTO HIS JOB AS CORONA DEL MAR LEADER;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: SOPHOMORE QUARTERBACK FELT THE PRESSURE TAKING OVER AN EXPERIENCED  OFFENSE. BUT HE SILENCED THE CRITICS WHILE LEADING THE SEA KINGS INTO THE  DIVISION VI FINAL.  </P> <P> Todd Kehrli slugged down the last of his chocolate milkshake, wiped the bubbly  mustache from his lips and slowly began to put the world of football, as he  knows it, into perspective.  </P> <P> "In the beginning, I didn't feel like a QB. I felt more like a robot," said  Kehrli, a sophomore quarterback at Corona del Mar High School.  </P> <P> "I was always thinking, always trying to think of all the things I was supposed  to be doing. I didn't want to let down the team. I didn't want to let down the  seniors. I knew they had faith in me, but inside, I was wondering if they were  sticking with me 100%. Inside, I knew I could do it if I had the chance."  </P> <P> Kehrli uses the phrase "in the beginning" often, as if he is looking back on a  long, storied career.  </P> <P> Actually, Kehrli, who has yet to receive his driver's license, has played in  only 13 games of organized football. He didn't play Junior All-American or Pop  Warner, nor did he play in junior high.  </P> <P> Last year, as a freshman, Kehrli was a member of the varsity -- backing up  senior Ty Price -- but his sole priority was to carry the coach's clipboard.  Although he did manage to get in on a few plays -- in late-game, sure-win  situations -- his playing time would be most accurately measured in seconds,  not minutes, as it consisted of one simple motion:  </P> <P> Take the snap, hand off and get outta the way.  </P> <P> Despite all this, Kehrli will be at the helm tonight when Corona del Mar (10-3)  faces La Quinta (9-4) in the Southern Section Division VI championship game at  Orange Coast College.  </P> <P> For Kehrli (pronounced kurr-lye), it has been a strange and wonderful season.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar, the defending Division VI champion, came into 1989 with high  hopes, especially the seniors. Coming into this season, the senior players had  lost just one game -- as freshmen -- in their tenure. They were undefeated as  sophomores, and last year helped the Sea Kings to a 12-0-2 record.  </P> <P> And so Kehrli knew that once Price graduated, the pressure to win would fall on  his shoulders.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar lost its season opener, 19-6, to Huntington Beach -- the game  was later forfeited by Huntington Beach because of to the use of an ineligible  player -- and Kehrli, who had a rough night, continuously overthrowing his  receivers, began to hear the whispers around campus:  </P> <P> "What's wrong with the football team?"  </P> <P> "People didn't remember that that game was Todd's first football game ever,"  receiver Warren Johnson said. "He was really nervous."  </P> <P> Although the next four games -- all victories -- quieted Kehrli's critics  momentarily, the wrath started again once Corona del Mar entered Sea View  League play. Estancia beat a listless Corona del Mar, 16-3, in the league  opener, and Kehrli could only blame himself.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar, the two-time defending league champion, finished fourth in the  league.  </P> <P> "I started doubting myself," Kehrli said. "I went into a slump. It started  around the Estancia game and didn't end until (the league finale against)  Newport. I felt I was a big factor (as to) when the team would get moving. In a  way, I knew I was holding them up. Coach (Dave) Holland just kept saying, 'Give  it time, just give it time.' "  </P> <P> Although his passing suffered earlier from control problems, he began -- thanks  to a few tips from his receivers -- to put more touch on the ball, and to play  more by his instincts. His improvement would have been for naught, though, had  Corona del Mar not received a wild-card playoff berth.  </P> <P> As he did in the regular season, Kehrli has shown marked improvement through  the playoffs.  </P> <P> With 1,499 yards this season, Kehrli already has established a single-season  school passing record, breaking Price's mark of 1,473 set last year.  </P> <P> "It would be nice, I think, to be remembered as one of the best to come out of  Corona del Mar," he said. "But that's not the big thing on my mind right now.  The game Friday night is about the only thing I'm thinking about."  </P> <P> Spoken like a true veteran.  </P></p>

Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that a closure was also  clamped on Qiryat Arba'. In practice, however, it is not being  observed and every two hours a convoy of cars and a bus to  Jerusalem leave Hebron and Qiryat Arba'. The convoys are  escorted by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops due to  stone-throwing incidents in the area of Halhul. [passage omitted  on rioting]</p>

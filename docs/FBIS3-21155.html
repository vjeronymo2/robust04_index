This reduces the cost of  separation and recovery, and is another step toward practical  application. Kansai Electric screened over 200 types of absorber  liquids, conducted tests on about 40 types, then developed an  absorber liquid that requires little energy. Until now, 900  kilocalories were needed to recover 1 kilogram (kg) of  CO[.sup]2[/], but 700 kilocalories is enough with the newly  developed absorber liquid. The absorber liquid is  alkanol-amin-based. The required energy is expected to be even  less if the absorber liquid is heated by steam bleeding from the  steam turbine, and Kansai Electric will continue to concentrate  on developing technology for separation and recovery of  CO[.sup]2[/] from exhaust gas.    Kansai Electric has carried out research on a chemical  absorption method as a technology to separate and recover  CO[.sup]2[/] for use in thermal power plants because this  method facilitates capacity expansion. In 1990, small-scale  basic testing equipment was set up in the Sakai Harbor power  plant and from April 1991, research using actual exhaust gas was  carried out at a pilot plant (processes 600 normal cubic meters  of gas per hour) that was built at the Minami Harbor power  plant. The pilot plant uses technology introduced from the U.S.  firm Floa Daniel [phonetic]. Paralleling this, absorber liquid  screening tests were carried out at the technology research  institute.    In the past, it took 900 kilocalories to separate and  recover  1 kg of CO[.sup]2[/] from exhaust gas. This is about 20% of  boiler heat input. With the newly developed absorber liquid, 700  kilocalories is sufficient, and the percentage of boiler heat  input also drops to about 15%.    Even greater conservation of energy can be realized by using  steam bleeding from the steam turbine to heat the absorber  liquid.    CO[.sup]2[/] separation and recovery by the chemical  absorption method entails absorption of CO[.sup]2[/], which  comprises about 9% of exhaust gas, into a liquid in an  absorption tower, then heating the liquid in a regeneration  tower, which releases the CO[.sup]2[/]. Absorber liquid that  absorbs CO[.sup]2[/] well and has little heat of reaction is  sought. Kansai Electric has experimented with various types of  absorber liquids, testing for absorption rate, heat of reaction,  corrosion and degradation. The new absorber liquid reduces  separation and recovery energy, which also lessens the  percentage of power generation cost taken up by the cost of  CO[.sup]2[/] recovery.</p>

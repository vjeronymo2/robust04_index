			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Venezuela's rally fades on disappointed hopes - Political instability and high inflation continue to dampen investor sentiment Venezuela's economy, which posted the highest real growth in Latin America last year at 10.4 per cent, continues to expand vigorously in 1992 but the Caracas equity market is lagging far behind. In spite of occasional rallies, share prices on the Bolsa de Valores de Caracas have been unable to recover to levels reached last February 3, the day before a group of army officers staged the first coup attempt seen in Venezuela since the early 1960s. The day prior to the putsch, the Caracas Stock Exchange index set an all-time high of 34,142, up 16.5 per cent from the end-1991 close of 29,316. By June 30, the index was off 23 per cent from the February 3 high and down 10.2 per cent from the end of last year. This week prices picked up slightly on Tuesday, but the general trend in recent weeks has still been clearly downwards. Mr Alex Dalmady, editor of InvestAnalysis Stock Guide, which examines Venezuelan stocks, talks of disappointed hopes: 'There were great expectations that we might have a late-year boom, but everyone anticipated and the rally disappeared.' He notes, however, that many price/earnings ratios have dropped to more attractive levels in recent months. He estimates that Venezuelan industrial shares are now trading at around 21 times earnings, while financial issues are standing at around 18. Earlier in the year, some leading stocks were being dealt at an average of 38 times earnings. While the political instability following last February's military uprising may have had a depressing effect on stock prices, it is also the case that more new issues have been launched this year than at any time in the history of the Caracas exchange. The debutantes include Mavesa, a leading food processor; HL Boulton, a family-held company that decided to sell shares to the public; and Ventane, an industrial concern owned by Enron, of the US. Three important industrial companies - Venprecar (part of the Sivensa steel group), Corimon and Venepal  -launched Global Depositary Shares (GDSs). These companies were traded on the Caracas exchange before they sold GDSs abroad. Mr Dalmady said that while these new listings widen the Venezuelan stock market and will strengthen it over the long term, the immediate effect of their appearance this year is a dampening influence on any general rally in stock prices. Several other Venezuelan companies are planning to offer shares to the public in the near future. The biggest is CANTV, the national telecommunications group which was privatised late last year. A group headed by GTE, of the US, paid Dollars 1.89bn to the Venezuelan government for 40 per cent of CANTV's shares and operating control over the company. The government is now planning to place some of its remaining shares on the block, perhaps in 1993. Although Venezuela's inflation this year is expected to be as bad or worse than last year's 31 per cent, the country's currency, the bolivar, has not weakened to anything like the same extent. Strong government monetary reserves and an unstated policy of avoiding any excessive drop in the bolivar's value vis-a-vis the US dollar has kept the currency's slide thus far this year to 11.9 per cent (at 69 bolivars per dollar). An important unknown factor is how Venezuela's political uncertainties will affect the stock market during the remaining months of 1992. The government of President Carlos Andres Perez obtained two months of relief from nagging student protests during August and September. But classes will soon resume and it is expected that university and high school students will renew their demonstrations against the government's free-market policies and continue to press for the resignation of President Perez.  -------------------------------------------------------------        MOST ACTIVE STOCKS, FIRST EIGHT MONTHS OF 1992  ------------------------------------------------------------- Company                         Shares traded (million)  ------------------------------------------------------------- Mantex                                   219.2 Sudamtex                                 140.5 La Electricidad                          120.8 Sivensa                                  109.9 Envases                                   50.0 CADA                                      23.1 Vencemos                                  18.8 Corimon B                                 17.9 Dominguez &amp; Cia                           14.1 Corimon A                                 13.6 Mavesa                                    12.6 Sudamtex B                                 1.9  ------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Caracas Stock Exchange  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Safety body holds 21 foreign ships A total of 21 foreign ships were detained in UK ports in July after failing safety inspections, the Marine Safety Agency said yesterday. The figure comes in the second monthly report on defective vessels arriving at British ports. The first survey, in June, led to the detention of 17 vessels, three of which were still being held last month. The government began inspecting foreign ships in UK ports in June after an inquiry headed by Lord Donaldson into marine pollution incidents produced a report which heavily criticised marine safety standards. Mr Robin Bradley, chief executive of the agency which was set up April, said: 'The response from the shipping industry to our June detention list has been encouraging. The publication of a monthly list will strengthen our campaign against unsafe ships.' Ten of the vessels detained in July had significant defects in their life-saving and fire-fighting equipment, while six had defects in their radio installations. Two were held because of shortcomings in their crews, while one was held because it had serious structural problems. Five of the ships were registered under the Maltese flag, three were registered in Liberia and two in Cyprus. Four had been inspected and approved by the American Bureau of Shipping, three by Bureau Veritas, a French classification society; and two each by the Norwegian body Det Norkse Veritas, Germanischer Lloyd, and the Japanese Nippon Kaiji Kyokai. Of the remaining vessels, two had not been approved at all. One ship, the United Trust, a Greek-owned general cargo vessel flying the Maltese flag, had badly corroded bulkheads, decks and support struts. The chief officer had no papers and the radio receiver did not work. The ship made temporary repairs and was then allowed to sail to Germany for permanent repairs. The failure of some countries that register vessels under their flags to impose adequate controls has led to a shift towards inspections in the ports where vessels call.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Rabin predicts treaty with Jordan by end of this year Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday predicted a full Israel-Jordan peace treaty by the end of the year, and urged the electorate to back his readiness to trade land for peace with Syria. In a speech at the opening of the winter session of the Israeli Knesset, Mr Rabin gave the first detailed public exposition of his position on a possible accord with Syria, offering a 'very limited' initial withdrawal from the Golan Heights, to be followed by a three-year trial period of normalised relations, and then a more substantial pullout. Significantly, he did not rule out a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan. Indicating that the 13,000 Jewish residents of the Golan had now outlasted their usefulness, the prime minister declared that sending Jews to settle the Heights after their capture in the 1967 Arab-Israel war had been 'the right act, at the right time, in the right place'. But now, he said, there were signs that, in return for the Golan, Syria was ready for peace. 'I want to ask you, friends on the Golan, what should we do? Shouldn't we try?' Mr Rabin emphasised that, in contrast with Jordan, where he was hopeful of a peace treaty by the year's end, negotiations with Damascus were still in their earliest phases, with big gaps between the two sides' positions. The prime minister was followed at the rostrum by Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the main opposition Likud party, who accused the government of abandoning cherished Zionist values by contemplating a 'selection' process for would-be immigrants from the former Soviet Union, to weed out the elderly and sick. Incensed, Mr Rabin denied the claim, demanded an apology and stalked out of the hall.</p>

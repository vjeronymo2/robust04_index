			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 92: Roof falls in on the Tories' dream - The Issues, Housing HOUSING may not be an issue to rank with health or education in the last lap of the election campaign. But if Mr John Major ceases to be the occupant of 10 Downing Street on April 10, the workings of the housing market will have had a great deal to do with it. At one end of the market many voters have discovered that the joys of ownership - still trumpeted in the Tory manifesto - confer no more than the right to a negative return on their investment and an obligation to pay the highest real rates of interest since the Depression. At the other, cardboard cities stand as a disconcerting reminder to the electorate of such hard-edged legacies of Thatcherism as the withdrawal of income support for youths aged 16 and 17. Home ownership, which once made huge inroads for the Tories into the ranks of floating voters, has become a liability for them. It is wreaking havoc in just those areas where they are at their most vulnerable - the squeeze in owner-occupied housing is largely a southern affair. In Scotland, and in the north and north-west of England, home owners have on average seen increases in the value of their property since 1989. The south-east and Greater London saw year-on-year falls in the final quarter of 1991 of 7.5 per cent and 7 per cent respectively, while the comparable figures for the south-west and East Anglia were 6.6 per cent and 4.7 per cent. More than two thirds of the housing stock is now owner-occupied and, says James Barty of Morgan Grenfell, about three quarters of the owner-occupiers are reckoned to have been Tory voters in the 1980s. Those in the north of England were less vulnerable, he adds, because houses were cheaper so northern home owners incurred less debt. In the south it feels very different. Since the Tories came to power in 1979, mortgage debt has gone from about 30 per cent of personal disposable income to more than 70 per cent. That indebtedness is disproportionately weighted to the southern half of Britain. Those who bought at the peak of the boom in 1988 were confronted soon afterwards by a 50 per cent rise in interest rates. While rates have since come down, they remain sky-high in real terms, thanks to the government's one great economic success story: disinflation. The more Britain's inflation falls, the higher the real rates of interest imposed through the exchange rate mechanism threaten to become. The chief victims are the baby-boomers, the products of the high birth rates of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Britain's inflationary psychology meant that they were disposed to buy at a much younger age than their French or German counterparts. The Tories' rhetoric and their carrot-and-stick policies - financial deregulation followed by the withdrawal of tax reliefs in 1988 - helped stampede people aged 25 to 30 into premature financial commitments. Today many of them have no equity in their home; some have seen the value of their house fall below that of the outstanding mortgage; others have had their homes repossessed. The government's attempts to stem the tide of repossessions and kick-start the market with temporary relief from stamp duty appear so far to have made little economic or political impact. It would probably be wrong to assume that low-income home buyers have been uniformly hit. A recent survey by the Council of Mortgage Lenders found that former council tenants showed a better-than-average record on arrears and repossessions. They tend to be older; and as well as having a more significant equity in their home because of the sale discount, they did not have to spend heavily on setting up a new home. Yet there seems little doubt that the famous C2 voters are over-represented in the group of home owners who have suffered most from the squeeze and fear most for their jobs. The negative wealth effect in housing and the related overhang of debt largely explains why the consumer has failed to spearhead a recovery. Shell-shocked borrowers helped propel the savings ratio from little over 4 per cent before the peak of the housing boom to more than 10 per cent last year. While the poll tax is on its way out, high mortgage rates leave many feeling overtaxed. None of the main parties is proposing to offer relief for the housing market except through modest tinkering. But Labour will undoubtedly make things worse for the top segment of the market with its proposed income tax reforms. There is a clear relationship between real income growth and house prices. Morgan Grenfell estimates that by squeezing top people's incomes Labour could reduce their house prices by 5-10 per cent, while simultaneously reducing their ability to service the related debt. This could well hamper the emergence of a consumer-led recovery in the south-east. None of the main parties has more than piecemeal remedies for problems of the housing market, including the shortage of rented accommodation. Labour commits itself not to legislate retrospectively in the private rented sector and to consult fully before making reforms. The Liberal Democrats, like Labour, have measures to address the specific problems of the homeless in finding rented accommodation. The Tories already have their Pounds 100m scheme for those sleeping rough in London, though there is no explicit commitment to continue with it. But there are no specific targets. And in none of the manifestos do the issues appear to rank particularly high on the list of priorities. Yet Dominic Byrne of Shelter, which campaigns for the homeless, points out that the results of its Mori poll suggest that the public thinks of homelessness and housing as being at least as important as health and education. From the top to the bottom of the market, people's expectations appear low. Not a happy omen for a visibly flagging Tory campaign.</p>

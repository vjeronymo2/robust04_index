			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government  intends to tighten controls on prices of basic goods and  services.    The State Council has issued a circular announcing its  decision to strengthen the supervision and examination of prices  of people's everyday necessities and services.    The aim is to meet the needs of establishing a socialist  market economic system but to standardize price behavior and to  ensure stable living conditions for people, the circular said.    The goods and services referred to are those basic ones  whose  price changes would greatly affect ordinary people's living  standards.    According to the circular, the intention is to supervise  trends of prices through a price adjustment record system, to  examine some of the price adjustments and to intervene only when  necessary.    The goods and services whose price adjustment will be  subject  to supervision and examination cover 20 varieties, including  flour, rice, edible vegetable oil, pork, beef and mutton, eggs,  milk, salt, sugar, soybean sauce, detergents, coal for household  heating and cooking, gas, rent, running water, tuition and  assorted fees, nursery charges, health care expenses and urban  transport fares.    Local governments will decide what items to supervise or  examine in line with local conditions, the circular said. They  must report any price adjustment to higher administrative  departments for the record.    The circular pointed out that the means of adjustment and  control must be strengthened and improved.    It said that a storage system should be established for  important goods, including grain, cooking oil and meat. Grain  risk funds should quickly be established at central and  provincial levels and the fund system for price adjustments of  non-staple food should be improved and popularized as soon as  possible.    Price administration departments should set guide prices for  some major goods to give enterprises a reference in pricing, or  demand that the enterprises adhere to the prices when necessary,  according to the circular.    Price administration departments may carry out temporary  price control measures when prices of the basic necessities  change too much, the circular said. The departments must  regularly check the prices of the listed commodities and  services.</p>

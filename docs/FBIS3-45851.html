This province, which enjoys special legislative power as the  largest special economic zone in the country, claims to lead the  way in economic reform legislation.    From 1988, when the province was established, to the end of  1992, Hainan promulgated over 24 sets of regulations to ensure  the smooth and healthy development of a market economy. In 1993  the province's legislative work speeded up, with 18 sets of new  legislation put into effect.    The regulations provide simplified procedures for the  application and registration of enterprises, and so far over  19,000 enterprises have been registered, among which 3,889 are  foreign funded.    The provincial people's congress recently passed three  regulations on insurance to get everyone, employed or  self-employed, covered by social insurance.</p>

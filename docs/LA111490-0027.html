			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ARCHDIOCESE TO ENROLL GIRLS AT CANTWELL  HIGH  </P> <P> Dwindling enrollment has forced the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles  to begin allowing girls to enroll next September at Cantwell High School, a  44-year-old all-boys school in Montebello.  </P> <P> Cantwell will consolidate with nearby Sacred Heart of Mary, a privately owned  all-girls Catholic school across the street that will close, said Bill Rivera,  a spokesman for the archdiocese. The new school will be called Cantwell-Sacred  Heart of Mary High School.  </P> <P> Cantwell's enrollment has dropped about 50% over the last five years. Sacred  Heart of Mary's policy of keeping tuition costs low to allow more students to  attend school was creating increasing financial burdens, administrators said.  </P></p>

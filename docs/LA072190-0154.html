			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GOOD MOVIES?  </P> <P> Attention filmmakers and movie industry people: Why I will not pay $7 for a  movie in 1990:  </P> <P> * The quality of current movies is terrible compared to the pre-VCR days.  </P> <P> * The violence, sex and lack of plot and imagination are appalling.  </P> <P> * Movies should be made for theatergoers, not VCR viewers. Make the movie  enjoyable the first time. Forget about the after-market VCR profit. Lower your  ticket prices. It's no bargain paying $3.50.  </P> <P> * Fix up one-screen theaters. Don't tear them down. Multiscreen theaters are  not fun, and they are small, with no wide-screen effect.  </P> <P> * What has happened to Hollywood? Where are great movies like "South Pacific,"  "To Kill a Mockingbird," "How to Murder Your Wife" and "Butch Cassidy and the  Sundance Kid"?  </P> <P> * Why are you catering to teen-agers instead of adults?  </P> <P> I can't remember any movies since "Out of Africa," "Peggy Sue Got Married" and  "The Color Purple" that are worth my time. Please bring back humorous,  intelligent movies with plots and great moral messages.  </P> <P> R.J. RAMSAY  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

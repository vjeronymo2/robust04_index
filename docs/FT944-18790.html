			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: I trust my broker, but . . . I hold a small portfolio of shares registered in my name. Following recent shortening of the period for settlement after any share transaction, it appears sensible to follow my broker's recommendation that my holdings be transferred to a nominee account registered at the address of his employer (an associate company of a European bank). To effect this change, I was sent a bundle of stock transfer forms for my signature with the broker's assurance, as follows: 'I confirm that the transfer of your securities into . . . nominees will not affect the beneficial ownership. Each valuation that we send you will include a list of those stocks which are owned by you, held to your order in our nominee company.' I have complete trust in the integrity of my broker. But is this informal statement of my interest all that I should require as a reasonable but prudent investor? The broker is correct that a transfer of your securities into a nominee name will not affect the beneficial ownership. The legal ownership of the shares is held by the nominee company in trust for yourself, and it has all the obligations and fiduciary responsibilities of trustees towards you. You have, it appears, already assured yourself of the integrity and company standing of your broker. You might be interested to acquire the booklet entitled Self Defence for Investors.

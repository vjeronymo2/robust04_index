			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Arts: Weekend recitals - Queen Elizabeth Hall Sylvia McNair has achieved her leap into the affections of the London public with remarkable speed. A single appearance each at Glyndebourne and Covent Garden and several more in various South Bank and Barbican concerts served to introduce her; last Friday's song recital at the Queen Elizabeth Hall completed the picture. It was a delight from beginning to end. In common with her fellow American Barbara Bonney, she uses a light-lyric soprano of ravishing quality with a forthrightness unusual in the breed. This was not just a sustained demonstration of words and notes purely uttered, of phrases cleanly traced with not an ounce of waste or cloudiness in the delivery - though all of those virtues were abundantly in evidence. It was a recital by a sharply honed artistic personality, with grace, wit and intelligence as its particular characteristics. In the opening Purcell group, Miss McNair's way of gracing the words, while holding her line immaculately taut, showed off the lineaments of her imagination quite as much as attributes of her voice. In a selection of Hugo Wolf's Morike songs, her infusion of dramatic vitality into every poetic and musical image betokened a keenly personal, individual perception of Wolfian scale. This was a bouquet of pleasures out of all proportion to their length, especially with so admirably responsive a pianist as Roger Vignoles to support their inspiration. In Strauss, the voice, free of all 'Viennese' mannerisms, can nevertheless shine and soar with all the needed lissomeness of movement. Perhaps most appealing of all was her closing selection of Leonard Bernstein songs: the I Hate Music and La Bonne Cuisine cycles, the two Rilke love songs and 'Somewhere' as tenderly unsentimental finale. In such material is all too easy to go coy, sassy or plain mushy; instead, Miss McNair's cool tones and flick-of-the-eyelid comic underplaying opened out unsuspected dimensions in all the songs. She has made many people extremely impatient for her next recital. * On Sunday afternoon, Piotr Anderszewski crept sullenly on to the same platform, threw his audience a cursory bow, and proceeded to offer just about the most worrying display by a talented young pianist that I can remember. Mr Anderszewski is the young Pole who sparked interest at the last Leeds piano competition by suddenly departing the second round in mid-performance. This indicated a refreshing capacity for self-criticism; the main quality demonstrated on Sunday was a debilitating combination of eccentricity and narcissism. The hall lights were plunged low while Mr Anderszewski communed with himself at length in Bach's E minor Partita, stroking the melodic phrases with hyper-romantic delicacy and reducing even the most vigorous dances to a slow crawl. It was a personal vision of Bach - obviously sincere and achieved with the most fastidious technical control - that quickly proved tedious. Mr Anderszewski seems to lack the intellectual toughness that redeemed Glenn Gould's similar eccentricities in Bach: he moons over the music. After the same dynamic effects and extremes of tempo had been operated on Beethoven's Op. 119 Bagatelles, to even more irritating end, I fled from the hall, thus sparing myself his Beethoven Op. 110. I pray this outstandingly gifted young man acquires a mature mentor on the art of recital-giving before doing his reputation any further damage.</p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The crew of the shuttle Discovery flew to Florida's Kennedy Space Center for a  practice countdown amid work to remove the first of three suspect engine turbo-  pumps that must be replaced before a delayed blastoff in March. Discovery's  crew -- commander Michael Coats, 43; co-pilot John Blaha, 46; James Bagian, 36;  Robert Springer, 46, and James Buchli, 43 -- flew to the spaceport to  participate in a dress-rehearsal countdown scheduled to end Tuesday with a  simulated engine ignition. Engineers working in Discovery's engine compartment  were disconnecting a high-pressure liquid oxygen turbopump from the shuttle's  three main engines.  </P></p>

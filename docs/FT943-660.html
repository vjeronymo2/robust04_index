			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Prudence and pragmatismin German reporting It is just a year since Daimler-Benz decided to break ranks with the German corporate establishment and seek a Wall Street listing. Now there are glimmers of a compromise approach to bridging the gulf between Germany and the rest of the global equity market. Last year a weakened Daimler-Benz wished to tap the US capital market. It also aimed to become a truly multinational enterprise, an ambition only attainable if it broke free of its restrictive legal and accounting base in Germany. The group was exploiting a huge wave of US investor interest in foreign companies. Since 1991 some 370 foreign companies have listed in the US, and the peak 1993 annual total of 110 is likely to be exceeded this year. These companies include many emerging markets. The US Securities and Exchange Commission considers that it has been flexible in responding to the demand, but it has a formidable rulebook to impose. Whereas emerging markets with few capital market traditions of their own have no hang-ups about conforming with US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Germany has its own deep-rooted conventions. In particular, financial reporting is dominated by the requirements of creditors, who care little about the profit and loss account but want a conservative balance sheet while corporate taxes are levied on the basis of the published accounts, again encourages understatement. Things have looked up considerably at Daimler since the group reported a German-style net profit of DM168m (Pounds 69m) for the first half of 1993, but a US-style net loss of DM949m. Those figures not only emphasised the group's trading problems but blew the gaffe on the idea that German accounting techniques are always conservative. In fact, they are used to smooth out awkward dips; in recessions they are flattering. This year car production has soared and is likely to be up by 15 per cent, effectively to full capacity of 585,000 vehicles. First half net profits are unambiguously positive at DM462m on the German basis and DM369m under US GAAP. A herd of regulators is attempting to address these problems. The International Accounting Standards Committee has been promoting its international standards for more than 20 years, but it is a private sector body backed by the big auditors and has little direct authority. The European Union has developed a harmonised framework for Europe, but its older legislation - in the Fourth company law directive - is now becoming dated. More recently the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) has developed as a network of powerful statutory bodies. It is working closely with the IASC. But individual national bodies ranging from the SEC to the German Ministry of Justice are jealously guarding their own patches. Thus the Germans continue to promote the 'prudence principle' which encourages the understatement of asset values and the building of reserves which can be used to smooth over setbacks. This approach clashes directly with the provision of accurate information to shareholders about an enterprise's short-term economic performance. But Daimler-Benz is optimistic that it can use options within the German Commercial Code to reduce the differences between the US and German systems. For the time being a compromise solution to the German problem will apply. Companies wishing to tap the international markets will prepare global consolidated statements according to US GAAP (or other international standards) but non-consolidated statements according to German rules. This will leave their domestic tax position unaffected, but it will also limit their potential for paying dividends. This might lead to confusion, not least for the managers trying to measure their achievements according to different and conflicting principles. In practice, though, the domestic statements would probably be largely ignored even by domestic investors. Eventually, perhaps, a kind of inverted Gresham's Law of Financial Reporting would apply: the good financial statements would drive out the bad.</p>

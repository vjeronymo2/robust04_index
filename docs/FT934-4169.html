			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Arts: A black day for the arts - Off the Wall The Heritage Minister, Peter Brooke, with his ingrained gentility, managed to keep his temper when quizzed about his department's Budget allocation this week. He could, with some justification, claim a small victory. His expenditure next year will be Pounds 21m higher than in 1993-94, at Pounds 955m. OK, so Pounds 7m of that is statistical jiggery-pokery provoked by that insatiable cuckoo in his nest, the British Library, now due to open in 1996, but even so he fared better than many forecasts. Unfortunately the big loser, in fact the only obvious casualty, was the Arts Council, provider to the vociferous performing arts lobby. Despite the fact that the Council did better than anticipated - a 1.7 per cent reduction in grant instead of the 2 per cent pencilled in a year ago, all hell let loose. Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Council, declared it 'a black day for the arts and a national disgrace'. Richard Eyre, director of the Royal National Theatre, called the cut 'pointless and mean spirited.' And these were some of the more positive reactions. It does seem odd that the Arts Council, notwithstanding the generous grants it received in the early 1990s, should be singled out for misery. For the Minister must know the broader background. The bad news for the arts in the Budget was not in his grant but the fact that local authorities, an equally important revenue source, are suffering Pounds 750m cutbacks in government aid, and that the middle classes were being financially walloped with tax increases. Already in 1993 box office takings have started to fall dramatically; 1994 could be a very bad year indeed for the arts. As a microcosm of the crisis facing arts companies you might look at Manchester. In 1994 it is City of Drama, but one theatre, the Forum, is already dark, and another, the Library, has been warned that Manchester City Council is likely to withdraw funding, not because of doubts about its quality but because it is a choice of saving a theatre or an old folk's home. Even Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre, one of the main initiators of new plays in the UK, is contemplating a season of commercially safe, small cast, productions. It will persist with a new, ambitious production of The Count of Monte Cristo, but around it there will be more pot boilers than the city anticipated when it won the opportunity to be the national face of British drama. The arts does protest too much, but really a couple of million more for the Arts Council would help to cheer the nation up during what looks like a rather depressing patch. Can you imagine London without a permanent professional opera company? Well, it could happen. Both the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and the English National Opera at the Coliseum are planning to close for renovation. Both expect to be open to welcome in the new Millennium, and unless there is careful planning soon their closures could overlap. Covent Garden, with its ambitious office and shop development, will be out of action for around two years. So it needs to close in 1997. It still has to raise Pounds 150m for the venture but has promises of around Pounds 50m from its rich friends, Mrs Vivien Duffield, and Lords Sainsbury and Rothschild. It hopes that Lottery money and the general public will provide the remainder. The ENO has been quieter about its plans but unless around Pounds 25m is raised soon its early 20th century building could decline into squalor. It is sounding out its supporters before launching its public appeal, probably in 1995. It, too, would anticipate Lottery aid. It needs the money for such unglamorous but essential improvements as better air conditioning and more ladies' loos. It is hoped that the two opera companies, and perhaps the Royal Ballet, will temporarily move into the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, during the repairs. Yesterday Mr Justice Hoffmann gave the Arts Council's music panel his decision on the future public funding of three of London's symphony orchestras. He is believed to have recommended that only one should be supported. And there are rumours that he could have come down in favour of the Philharmonia. However, all is still to play for. The full Arts Council could decide at its December meeting to support a package, assigning the LPO to a more independently funded South Bank; making the Philharmonia the new super orchestra; and bribing the RPO to become a Nottingham based orchestra serving the East Midlands. This one will run and run and run.</p>

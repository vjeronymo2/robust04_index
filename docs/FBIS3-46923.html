Concerning the national economy the  government started functioning at the level of intersector  correlation as compared to the previous years.    The period of extraordinary emergency measures is over, he  considers. In the next year there would be laid down basis for  restoration of national economy and there is a danger of  stagnation.    The process of legislatively ensuring the achievements in  the  sphere of protection of human rights and freedom is going on.  In this regard we are committing errors sometimes and taking  wrong decisions but it is not intentionally he noted.    The opposite opinions on this matters were expressed by  leaders of the opposition parties Dabaadorjiyn Ganbold an B.  Batbayar. Leader of the National Democratic Party (MNDP)  Dabaadorjiyn Ganbold said that the process of reforming is still  continuing in the country but a lot of questions to be solved  urgently are still out of field of vision of the government.  The ruling party experiences a lack of civil and political will  for taking really burning measures which is in its turn  connected with the absence of a clear cut conception on  reforming the society. It seemed that we are going on the path  of extremely underdeveloped countries not having a weighty voice  even in their own region and dragging out a miserable existence  by receiving humanitarian assistance of other countries.    Owing to efforts of the present leadership we have entered  ourselves to the ranks of the most under-developed countries.  The ruling party and the government are being guided by  momentary needs. As a whole we begin to fail in all positions  having been reached during the previous years leader of the MSDP  [Mongolian Social-Democratic Party] B. Batbayar said. It is  time to understand that the way back is a fatal way, he stressed.</p>

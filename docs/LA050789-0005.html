			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Are advertising agencies purposely scuttling their clients? An automobile  manufacturer allows its agency to couple its car with a pig in the minds of TV  viewers and potential customers. Another TV ad splashes pictures of sloppy  people chomping on barbecued ribs. Not an appetizing image for the average  viewer. I'll buy a carton of ladybugs to protect my garden from insects rather  than purchase a product that uses magnified sounds of someone crunching an  apple to advertise a safe pesticide. The apple growers should be sore about  this one; it gives fruit lovers another reason for switching to raspberries.  </P> <P> Margaret W. Romani, Los Angeles  </P></p>

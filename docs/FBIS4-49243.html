			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Chun (0491 6511): "Li Lanqing </F> Inspects Zhuhai, Says Zone Should Plan To Open Border Crossing  for 24-Hour Traffic"]    [Text] Zhuhai, 2 May (WEN WEI PO)--While inspecting Zhuhai  City, Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and vice premier, stressed that the special economic zone  [SEZ] should be "different" from the rest of the country, adding  that the zone should bring changes to traditional modes of  thinking, throw convention to the wind, and carry out  experiments so as to set an example for the hinterland. The  plan to open the border crossing for 24-hour traffic tabled by  the Zhuhai government should be put into effect. Consideration  should be given to the government's plan to set up a bonded  area. It is necessary to adopt advanced and scientific  management techniques from abroad, but gambling and vice must be  forbidden, he said.    Accompanied by Guangdong Vice Governor Liu Weiming, Li and  his entourage arrived in Zhuhai on 30 April.    While commenting on whether the SEZ should be "different"  from the rest of the country and on ways to become unique, Li  pointed out: The SEZ's should be "unique" and their uniqueness  should manifest itself in setting an example to others. It is  essential to explore ways to revitalize state-owned enterprises.  The SEZ's should bring changes to traditional modes of thinking  and carry out bold and useful experiments in setting up a  socialist market economy so that they can provide successful  experiences to the interior. It is necessary to adopt advanced  and scientific management techniques from abroad. However,  gambling and the practice of "offering female attendants to  customers to accompany them in drinking, dancing, and singing in  entertainment establishments" must be forbidden.    Li said that a plan for customs to provide round-the-clock  service put forward by the Zhuhai government is a good one. The  plan should be brought into effect. The Zhuhai government plans  to set up a bonded area. I believe the plan warrants  consideration, but the government must act in line with  international practices and standards, he said.</p>

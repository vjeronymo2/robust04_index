			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Helical Spring Lock Washers from the People's Republic of China (58 FR 48833; September 20, 1993) (Lock Washers), the Department determined that if an exporter is not owned by the central government the Department will consider issuing a separate rate. This is because the opportunity for the central government to manipulate the exporter's prices is less than its opportunity to control the prices of enterprises owned by the central government. However, as in the case of exporters owned by the central government, it would still be possible for enterprises under common ownership (e.g., provincial governments, local governments, collectives, etc.) to have their prices manipulated by the common owner. All firms under common ownership which produce or sell subject merchandise during the POI must cooperate in the investigation to enable the Department to calculate a weighted-average dumping margin for them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this investigation, MOFTEC has informed the Department that the central government does not own any of the responding exporters of sebacic acid. Furthermore, the responding exporters stated for the record that they do not share ownership with each other or with any other exporter of sebacic acid. Because non-responding exporters of sebacic acid are located in the same municipality as Sinochem International and in the same province as Guangdong, we requested separate rates information from the Beijing municipal government and Guangdong provincial government. We also requested similar information from the Jiangsu provincial government. Though we have received a response from the Guangdong and Jiangsu provincial governments, we received a response from the Beijing municipal government too late to consider for the preliminary determination. After examining the responses submitted by the Guangdong and Jiangsu provincial governments, we are concerned that the PRC government agencies have not provided information requested by the Department in an NME investigation. Because the responding companies have stated on the record that they are not owned by the central government or any other jurisdiction or entity that owns other exporters of sebacic acid, the lack of information in the two local government responses to our questionnaire should not control our separate rates decision for the preliminary determination. However, we encourage provincial and municipal government entities to respond, with the assistance of MOFTEC if appropriate, because this issue will be reconsidered before making the final separate rates determination in this investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given that each of the four responding exporters states that it is neither owned by the central government nor owned by another jurisdiction or entity that also owns other exporters of the subject merchandise, we have determined that these respondents are eligible to be considered for separate rates. The criteria the Department relies upon to establish whether or not separate rates are appropriate are those put forward in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers from the People's Republic of China (56 FR 20588; May 6, 1991) (Sparklers). Under the Sparklers criteria, the Department issues separate rates where respondents can demonstrate both  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a de jure <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de facto <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  absence of central government control over export activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this investigation, each of the four cooperative exporters has documented that its business license provides that its ownership is distinguished from central-government ownership. In addition, MOFTEC has stated that it does not own or control the exporters or producers of sebacic acid. This information indicates that there is a de jure absence of central government control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each of the four cooperating respondents has asserted and provided evidence such as sales contracts that it establishes its own export prices and keeps the proceeds of its export sales and that its management operates with complete autonomy. This information indicates the de facto absence of central government control with respect to exports. Consequently, we have determined that these four cooperating exporters have met the criteria set forth in Sparklers and we have used their information to calculate a separate rate for each of them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Surrogate Country  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 773(c) of the Act requires the Department to value the factors of production, to the extent possible, in one or more market economy countries that are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the non-market economy country, and that are significant producers of comparable merchandise. The Department has determined that India and Pakistan are the most comparable to the PRC in terms of overall economic development, based on per capita gross national product (GNP), the national distribution of labor, and growth rate in per capita GNP. (See memorandum from the Office of Policy to David L. Binder, dated September 29, 1993.) The Department has also determined that India is a producer of the subject merchandise. Because India fulfills both requirements outlined in the statute, India is the preferred surrogate country for purposes of valuing the factors of production used in producing the subject merchandise. In cases where we were unable to obtain surrogate values from India, we have used values obtained in Pakistan. Specifically, we have resorted to Pakistan for two surrogate values, where publicly available published values in India were either significantly outdated or not obtainable. We have obtained and relied upon publicly available published information wherever possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 10 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai-based  Bank of Communications has taken the lead in extending foreign  exchange business among city residents, international business  reported.    The local branch of the bank, starting the service on  December 28, 1993, anchored a total transaction of 500,000 U.S.  dollars through new year's eve. Resuming on January 4, the  trading is running smoothly.    For each transaction, 300 U.S. dollars or an equal amount of  other foreign currencies is required. The trading hall is well-  equipped with a computerized quotation, trading and clearing  system, flashing the latest exchange rates.    Through free trading, clients can make money not only from  interest differentials, but also from exchange fluctuations.    Now Shanghainese have found a way to apply foreign exchange  in hand, besides depositing the money in the bank.    Foreign exchange deposits made by Shanghai citizens are on  the rise. Figures show that the city had more than one million  depositors by last February, with foreign exchange totalling 1.3  billion U.S. dollars.    Major sources of the money are Shanghai citizens residing  overseas and businessmen and students based abroad.</p>

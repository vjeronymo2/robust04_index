After several hours of tallks with  Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union Bundestag group, SPD Chairman  Rudolf Scharping said that domestic nursing care will be  introduced on 1 April 1995 and in-patient nursing care on 1 July  1996.    Contributions of 1 percent are to be collected as of 1  January 1995. In the representation of Rhineland-Palatinate in  Bonn, Scharping said he hopes that the mediation committee will  agree to the result. The Social Democrats will agree to the  abolition of one holiday. An exemption was explicitly defined:  Should one land not abolish one holiday, the employer would  have to completely take over all contributions.    Moreover, according to Scharping, it was further agreed that  in the course of next year, the Bundestag and the Bundesrat will  examine what has become of this provision in order to draw  legislative conclusions if necessary. "It is important the  laender are now free to consider the whole year what holiday  they want to cancel," Scharping said. The agreement that has  been achieved will result in a considerable improvement for the  affected people. The compromise contains all Social Democratic  ideas about nursing care benefits, including domestic and  in-patient care, he said.</p>

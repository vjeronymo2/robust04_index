			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Toyo Sash slides 28% TOYO Sash, Japan's top maker of aluminium housing products, revealed a 14.6 per cent drop to Y32.5bn (Dollars 244.36m) in non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the year to end-March. Net profits also fell sharply, by 28.6 per cent to Y14.8bn, although sales climbed a modest 4 per cent to Y481bn. A sharp drop in demand in the second half - reflecting the nation's stock market troubles - and a private sector spending downturn were behind the profit retreat, the company said. Sales of housing sashes, which account for over half of company sales, grew 1.1 per cent to Y280bn. Building sash sales increased 10.6 per cent to Y148bn, due largely to the introduction of new products for high-rise structures. Turnover of housing equipment and other products also gained 11.5 per cent to Y14bn. But construction material sales were off 0.2 per cent to Y38.7bn.</p>

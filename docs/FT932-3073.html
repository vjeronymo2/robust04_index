			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Growth trend in manufacturing 'up from 4% to 5%' MANUFACTURING output recovered in April and is growing faster than at any time since May 1989, the government reported yesterday. The Central Statistical Office said manufacturing production grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent between March and April after a 0.3 per cent decline in March. This prompted CSO statisticians to revise upwards their estimate of the annual trend rate of growth from 4 per cent to 5 per cent. All manufacturing sectors increased output in the three months to April compared with the previous three months, lifting the manufacturing production index out of its previous narrow range. The Treasury welcomed the figures as a further sign that economic recovery is under way. A breakdown of the figures suggests that recovery is being led by investment, and possibly exports, rather than by consumer demand. The CSO said manufacturing production increased by a seasonally adjusted 2.2 per cent between February and April compared with the previous three-month period. It was also 2.2 per cent higher than in the three months to April last year. Manufacturing production in April was at its highest since January 1991. April's figures were buoyed by strong growth in the output of steel, metals, and computers. Taking the latest three months' figures, which the CSO's statisticians consider a better guide, the office reported strong increases in the production of cars, computers and aerospace equipment, as well as materials for the building industry and packaging. Production of cars and parts rose 8.1 per cent in the three months to April compared with the previous three months, while output of computers increased by 14 per cent over the same period. Overall production of investment goods grew strongly, with output up 3.4 per cent in the three months to April compared with the previous three months, reflecting increases of 5.7 per cent and 5.3 per cent respectively in the production of the electrical goods and transport equipment industries. Investment goods production in the three months to April was 5.4 per cent higher than the year before. Consumer goods output was less buoyant, in spite of the sharp rise in car production. It rose 1.1 per cent in the three months to April compared with the previous period, and was 1.3 per cent higher than a year before. Extended maintenance work in the North Sea caused a 5 per cent drop in oil and natural gas production in the three months to April compared with November to January. Other energy production dropped by 2.4 per cent as mild weather caused a decline in gas and electricity output. Coal output fell 8 per cent between March and April as lower supply contracts between British Coal and the big electricity generating companies took effect. The drop in energy production offset the rise in manufacturing output so that total combined production of the manufacturing and energy industries was unchanged between March and April. Overall industrial production rose 0.6 per cent in the last three months.</p>

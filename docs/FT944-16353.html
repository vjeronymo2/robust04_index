			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US maize estimate increased again The size of this year's US prospective feedgrains harvest grew again yesterday, with the US Department of Agriculture now saying that the maize crop will be 9.6bn bushels, higher than trade estimates of 9.5bn, and 345m bushels more than the agency's own forecast a month ago. The government's estimate for soyabean production also rose, to 2.45bn bushels, from last month's 2.3bn. The report normally would have prompted a steep plunge in grain prices at the Chicago Board of Trade. However, grain futures markets were steady to slightly higher yesterday morning as traders concentrated instead on the USDA's forecasts for much bigger export sales of grain. 'The USDA finally has some breathing room,' said Mr. Joe Victor, a grain analyst with Allendale, Inc. 'Last year we had prices up, but nothing to sell. This year, we've got a big crop and the USDA is saying we're going to export more of it.' The agency estimated yesterday that the US would sell 1.625bn bushels of maize overseas this crop year, and would export 740m bushels of soyabeans. On Monday, the USDA said that 44 per cent of the US soyabean harvest had been completed, and 27 per cent of the maize crop was in. Farmers said that despite ideal conditions, the large crop would take longer than usual to harvest.</p>

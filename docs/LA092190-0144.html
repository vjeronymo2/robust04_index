			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> AROUND THE NFL;  </P> <P> LIONS' TAYLOR BANNED FROM LEAGUE  </P> <P> Cornerback Terry Taylor of the Detroit Lions became the seventh NFL player to  be banned from the league for life when the league banished him after he tested  positive for illegal substances for a third time.  </P> <P> However, Taylor, who is in his seventh season, can apply for reinstatement in a  year.  </P> <P> He was suspended for four games in 1988 while playing for the Seattle Seahawks.  </P> <P> A first-round draft pick in 1984, Taylor, 29, was a starter for most of his  seasons with the Seahawks before being traded to the Lions in 1989.  </P> <P> The Atlanta Falcons released quarterback Gilbert Renfroe for the fourth time  this season when they re-signed defensive back William Evers.  </P> <P> Evers, a rookie from Florida A&amp;M, was signed last week and played against  Detroit because cornerbacks Deion Sanders and Charles Dimry were injured. He  was released and Renfroe re-signed this week when it appeared the two defensive  backs were healing. But with safety Brian Jordan now hobbling, the numbers game  got Renfroe again.  </P></p>

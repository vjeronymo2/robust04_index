			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUCKS SINK BEAVERS, 30-21, TO WIN THE BATTLE OF OREGON  </P> <P> Derek Loville and Terry Obee made the big plays in the final quarter Saturday  as the Oregon Ducks beat archrival Oregon State, 30-21, to wrap up their best  season in a quarter of a century.  </P> <P> Loville rushed for 111 yards and scored two touchdowns and Obee caught six  passes for 125 yards and one score as the Ducks finished the season at 7-4  overall and 5-3 in the Pacific 10. Even though the record is Oregon's best  since the Ducks went 7-2-1 in 1964, they aren't expected to get a postseason  invitation. Oregon hasn't been to a bowl game in 26 years.  </P> <P> Oregon State is 4-6-1 and 3-4-1 with a game remaining next Saturday at Hawaii.  </P> <P> The Beavers trailed 16-0 at halftime but rallied to pull within 23-21 on a  24-yard scoring pass from backup quarterback Nick Schichtle to Pat Chaffey with  7:51 to play.  </P> <P> Then Loville, who moved up to No. 10 on the Pac-10 career rushing list, scored  on a two-yard run to make it 30-21 with 4:41 left.  </P> <P> Oregon's Bill Musgrave completed 19 of 38 passes for 267 yards to break the  single-season passing yardage record set by Chris Miller in 1986. Musgrave, a  junior, passed for 2,761 yards this season.  </P></p>

BIA, as trustee for Tribal trust resources, will participate as co-lead agency with BPA. The Nez Perce Tribe (NPT) is the primary cooperating agency. The EIS will evaluate the potential environmental effects of the proposed action to construct and operate the NPTH and alternatives to the proposed action. This action may involve floodplains and wetlands located in the State of Idaho and within Nez Perce, Clearwater, and Idaho counties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with DOE regulations for compliance with floodplain and wetlands environmental review requirements (10 CFR part 1022), BPA and BIA will prepare a floodplains and wetlands assessment and would perform this proposed action in a manner so as to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplains and wetlands.

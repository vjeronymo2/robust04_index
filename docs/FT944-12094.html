			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / M&amp;G raises fears over market plan M&amp;G, the independent unit trust company, says the London Stock Exchange's proposed Alternative Investment Market will not be suitable for the investors who buy its retail products because of the low level of regulation and disclosure. M&amp;G is one of several leading managers of unit trusts which have expressed concern over the proposed market, which is intended to replace the Unlisted Securities Market at the end of 1996. M&amp;G's objections are significant because it has developed expertise in small-company share investment. Mr Jonathan Bartlett, who manages M&amp;G's smaller companies unit trust, said: 'We don't believe it is right for unit trust holders to invest in these kind of stocks. There may be investors there but they won't be M&amp;G unit holders.' Professional groups of institutional investors, including the Association of British Insurers, have told the Stock Exchange of their concerns that the proposals offer too little investor protection to encourage significant investment in the smallest companies. However, small companies have been urging the exchange to devise a mechanism to replace the USM which will help them raise capital at a lower cost than seeking a place on the exchange's official list.</p>

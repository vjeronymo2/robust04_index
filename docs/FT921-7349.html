			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Russians clear way for foreign energy investors: New law encourages exploitation of Moscow's vast underdeveloped mineral resources THE Russian parliament yesterday approved a long-awaited law on mineral rights, taking an important step towards encouraging foreign investment in the country's rich but badly managed oil, gas and mining sectors. Mr Yuri Sergeyev, head of parliament sub-committee on natural resources, said the law would go into effect by March 1. Although Russia has huge amounts of undeveloped or neglected mineral resources, potential investors have been frustrated by a lack of rules on ownership and taxation. 'This is a step in the right direction. We are beginning to define what the parameters are for doing business in the Russian republic,' said Mr George Reese, senior managing partner of consultants Ernst &amp; Young in Moscow. He also urged the Russian government to cut export taxes in order to encourage investment. But Mr Peter Aven, Russia's minister for foreign economic relations, said yesterday that while unspecified export duties on other products would be reduced, the government had no intention of cutting taxes on oil exports. The law's main points are: It allows concessions and production sharing; Licences for exploration and operating rights are to be awarded through tenders and auctions. Permits are to be issued jointly by the relevant local authority and the geology committee of the Russian ministry for natural resources and ecology. It fixes the sharing out of royalties among federal and local authorities, although a different allocation of revenues from strategically important wells and mines can be negotiated by federal and local authorities. Payments are to be divided as follows in the case of hydrocarbons: 30 per cent to city budgets, 30 per cent to regions and 40 per cent to the republic. For other minerals the breakdown is 50 per cent for cities, 25 per cent for regions, and 25 per cent to the Russian republic. For resources in the Continental shelf, the division is 60 per cent to the region and 40 per cent to Russia. There is an upper ceiling of five years for exploration permits, and 20 years for exploitation rights. The law was passed in spite of attacks from former hardline communists such as Mr Nikolai Maltsev, who claimed the law would 'permit the plundering of mineral resources by private enterprise'.</p>

Box 591, Ra'anana, Israel]    [Text]  <H5>  Abstract </H5>   Over the last 15 years steam injection has been the only  method capable of significantly enhancing oil recovery in the  German and Dutch oil fields producing a highly viscous crude.  However, the steam injection has a negative impact on the oil  reservoir pressure, since the steam to oil ratio is about 4.  This means that for each produced barrel of oil, there is an  accumulation of 4 barrels of condensed water coming from the  injected steam.    The outcoming oil and water mixture is separated in  decantation tanks. The oil is further processed and the  remaining brine is a disposal stream.    The conventional method to dispose of the produced water is  to pump it to separate reservoirs, such as a depleted  underground gas reservoir, but this is limited to the available  disposal capacity. Any other means to dispose the produced water  to lakes or to rivers is prohibited by environmental  regulations. The re-injection of the water back to the depleted  reservoir is prohibited too based on the following:    -- Contamination of the potable quality ground water with  oil  through cracks in the formation because of the increased  pressure of the reinjected water.    -- Raising the water table in adjacent residential areas due  to the pressure of reinjected water, leading to the closing of  ground water wells due to contamination.    -- Irreversible changes in underground locked crude pockets  which may damage future oil exploration.    Based on careful investigations prepared by the oil  companies  operating in the German/Dutch oil fields it was decided to  install a mechanical vapour compression unit to desalinate the  produced water and use the distillate for boiler feed water,  thus recycling the produced water and eliminating the previously  mentioned drawbacks.    This paper outlines the process which allows the production  of high quality boiler feed water for steam generation from  produced water, eliminating the ecological dangers mentioned  above. This is achieved by ensuring a permanent water balance in  the oil reservoir in the form of a closed water cycle, thus  preventing the excessive volume of injected steam and creating  the continuous addition of water to the system either from the  fresh water wells or other available water resources.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   Steam enhanced oil production is a well established  technology. In the thermal methods heavy crude oil is extracted  by injecting large quantities of steam into the oil formation.    Continuous steam injection during a long period of time  continuously disturbs the volumetric balance of the oil  reservoir. At a steam oil ratio of 4:1, the injection of 4  volumetric units of steam brings to the surface one volumetric  unit of oil and four unit volumes of water in addition to the  naturally present water in the oil reservoir. The produced water  may be reinjected. However to avoid pressure increase in the  reservoir an excess of three volumes has to be disposed to an  empty gas reservoir or to environmentally allowable special  disposal areas.    Three new additional volumes of fresh well or river water  have to be used after treatment to generate the steam for  injection.    A solution for the permanent water imbalance in the oil  reservoir is to use treated produced water for boiler feed  water, to control a closed water cycle in the oil production  facility. The ``closed water loop'' does not add any extra water  from water wells, rivers or any other fresh water sources.  <H5>  2. General Process Description </H5>   The process is shown in the attached process block diagram.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-14A>      Figure 1. Steam Enhanced Oil Production Process Block Diagram </FIG>     The enhanced steam recovery method brings to the surface not  only the oil but also significant quantities of formation water  which are discharged back to the reservoir.    The mixture of hot oil and saline water is fed to oil/water  separation plant.    After cooling the oil fraction is separated. The saline  water  fraction leaving the separation tank is treated in cascade for  separation of residual oil and suspended solids. Before the  produced water enters the MVC units to produce high quality  boiler feed, it goes through a treatment stage to remove gases  and dose an oxygen scavenger in order to keep the iron in  soluble form. The distillate of the MVC unit is used as feed  water to the steam boilers, whilst the brine is disposed to an  injection well. Thus a permanent water balance is kept in the  oil reservoir by forming a closed water cycle.  <H5>  3. Process Description </H5>   3.1 General    The vapour compression unit, which separates the feed into  two streams -- distillate and brine is the heart of a system  which transforms the produced water, originating from the  oil/water separation tanks to boiler feed quality water.    The central position of the vapour compression distiller  results from the fact that it represents the major investment in  the system, and that its operation is far more sensitive than  the rest of the system blocks.    Therefore, the design philosophy was to install a series of  pre-treatment steps, each aimed at the removal of a certain  potential risk to the smooth and trouble-free operation of the  vapour compression distiller.    3.2 The Evaporator    The evaporator is classified as an open loop heat pump. It  is  composed of two main components, the heat transfer tubes and the  compressor. The compressor sucks vapour from an evaporating  falling film on the exterior of the heat transfer tubes and  discharging them to the interior of the same tubes. The lift of  the compressor supplies the needed thermal gradient for the  evaporation of the falling film and the condensation of the  vapour inside the tubes.    The heat transfer is the latent heat of condensation  supplied  via the tubes' wall as the latent heat of evaporation. In the  temperature enthalpy diagram the process is described as two  parallel lines (parallel to the enthalpy axis) at constant  temperature. The top line represents the condensation and the  bottom the evaporation. The conventional name of the evaporator  is mechanical vapour compression (MVC). The mechanical structure  of the MVC is explained as follows:    The main element of the unit is a horizontal, 10 m-long  cylindrical vessel with a diameter of 4.5 m mounted on a 4  m-high support structure. Within the vessel there is a nest of  almost 7,500 horizontal heat transfer tubes (Figure 2).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-16A>      Figure 2. MVC -- Process Schematic </FIG>     The water is sprayed on the heat transfer tubes by a number  of spray nozzles thus covering the whole surface of the upper  tubes with a thin water film. The tubes are arranged in such a  way that the water drops by gravity from the upper tubes evenly  distributing over the tubes below continuously forming thin  films. The brine recirculation pump guarantees a continuous  efficient circulation. After passing through the feed heat  exchanger and the auxiliary condenser/vacuum degasser the feed  water is added to the circulation flow.    A turbo-compressor sucks the vapour which has evaporated  from  the falling film. The vapour enters the vapour duct through mesh  type mist eliminators and flows to the compressor suction port.  From the compressor the vapour is discharged at higher pressure  and temperature to the interior of the heat transfer tubes.  There it condenses supplying the latent heat required for the  evaporation process.    The condensate and the concentrated brine are pumped out  after exchanging heat with the feed. Non-condensible gases (NCG)  are first concentrated in the auxiliary condenser and then  exhausted by means of a rotary vacuum pump, which also serves to  create the initial vacuum.    The directly coupled compressor is tank-head flange-mounted  to the vessel in a support frame.    The most important components are integrated into the  support  structure of the unit. These components are the brine and  condensate pumps, brine recirculation pump and liquid ring  vacuum pumps, the feed heat exchanger, which is divided into two  sections, the control cabinet as well as all necessary control  units, switchboards and display units.  <H5>  4. Field Experience </H5>   The first MVC of 600 m[.sup]3[/]/day distillate capacity  unit went on stream in December, 1990 and the second during  September, 1991. Both units were successfully commissioned and  since then have been in continuous operation in the oil  extraction facility.    The first unit was opened and thoroughly inspected after  3,500 hours of continuous operation. The findings were as  follows:    -- No performance decrease of the units due to deterioration  of the heat transfer.    -- No scaling was found during the inspection of unit I.  Heat  transfer tubes, demister and compressor blades have not shown  any fouling.    -- There were no corrosion attacks in the MVC unit itself.    -- Checks of the compressor bearings have not shown any wear  or balance errors.    -- There are no particular changes in the vacuum tightness  of  the MVC plant.    As we can see from the table, the design parameters of the  MVC units are conservative compared to the real test  performance. The distillate production capacity of the units is  up to 10 percent higher, and specific energy consumption is 6  percent lower. Temperature is by 2.5C to 4C lower than  the comparable designed parameters.    4.1 Operating Results       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

The results were:    -- The distillate is of constantly good quality.    -- TUV has not recommended any further treatment to the  distillate other than the regular chemical conditioning where  the residual hardness is sequestered.    The inherent simplicity of the MVC unit, as well as the  automatic controls and instrumentation, enable quick start up  and shut down, and allow unattended round-the-clock operation.    Maintenance required is on a routine and normal basis for  rotating equipment such as pumps and motors and for instruments  and electrical equipment.    Lubrication is carried out on a preventive maintenance  schedule as given in the operational and maintenance manuals.    The scale cleaning which is recommended by IDE after every  6-12 months of continuous operation was found to be unnecessary  to date.    The units consume, according to the design, moderate  quantities of consumable materials such as hydrochloric acid,  sodium hydroxide, scale inhibitor, oxygen scavenger and lube oil.    The units have been in continuous operation since their  commissioning and allow the oil production company to continue  to be an on-going facility for exploration of oil by steam  injection, leaving the operation site ecologically safe.  <H5>  5. Conclusions </H5>   -- The mechanical vapour compression units have solved a  major environmental and production problem by eliminating the  volume of disposal of excess waste water (usually four times  that of water per one volume unit of oil).    -- The closed water cycle operation no longer required a  continuous consumption of fresh water (from wells or rivers) due  to the recycle of produced water by desalination to obtain  distillate in high quality to be used as boiler feed to generate  steam for the oil production facility.    -- The installation of the MVC has been economically  justified for enhancing oil production by steam injection.    -- The performance data of the units in operation are above  those which were taken in consideration in the design phase.

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> 77-ACRE TRACT, MALL PROJECT TO BE STUDIED  </P> <P> A proposal to build a 77-acre residential and retail project on the northeast  corner of Oxnard Boulevard and Gonzales Road is scheduled for consideration  today by the Oxnard City Council.  </P> <P> The project would include 454 single-family homes and condominium units, and a  51,275-square-foot retail center.  </P> <P> In order to approve the project, the council must rezone the entire site and  amend the general plan.  </P> <P> Last month, the Planning Commission narrowly rejected the project. Although the  vote was 4 to 3 in the project's favor, general plan amendments require the  support of at least five commissioners.  </P> <P> The three commissioners who voted against the project said they believed the  proposed residential development is too dense.  </P> <P> The Rio Lindo Neighborhood Council, a group of nearby residents that has met  several times with the developer, Warmington Homes of Agoura Hills, opposes the  commercial portion of the project. In a letter to the commission, neighborhood  council Vice Chairman Jay Holsinger said the group fears the retail center  would increase traffic congestion. HUGO MARTIN  </P></p>

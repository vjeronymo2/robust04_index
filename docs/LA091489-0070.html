			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAT AND MOUSE;  </P> <P> POINT MUGU NAVAL ENGINEERS PLAY HIGH-TECH HARDBALL IN TEST OF WEAPONRY  </P> <P> On the ocean's edge at Point Mugu, a giant metal door slowly rolled open in a  secret laboratory where the Navy tests its most advanced warplanes.  </P> <P> As heavy surf pounded a seawall four stories below, a test model of an F-14  Tomcat poked its nose out and began scanning the horizon for a target.  </P> <P> Behind the Tomcat, in a room with metal walls and roof to block electronic  eavesdropping from Soviet spy ships, a high-level team of Pentagon observers  watched as $20 million worth of computers went quietly to work.  </P> <P> On this Friday morning, the Navy was beginning one of the thousands of tests it  conducts each year at Point Mugu on the missiles, planes and Space Age laser  weapons providing its current and future air-strike capability.  </P> <P> There was a high-tech glamour to the morning's test. But on other projects of  equal sensitivity at the Pacific Missile Test Center, there were contrasting  scenes of nuts-and-bolts practicality.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sgt. York Tanks  </P> <P> Elsewhere at the test center, Navy engineers were working on projects involving  discarded $32-million Sgt. York anti-aircraft weapons picked up at Army salvage  and even one homemade device designed to help U.S. pilots duck enemy missiles.  </P> <P> As the Tomcat peeked out from its high-security perch, however, the Navy's  focus was on a new infrared tracking system designed to locate enemy planes by  the heat of their engines. It is scheduled for installation on all U.S.  fighters in the next decade.  </P> <P> Scanning the test center's vast ocean range, the Tomcat homed in at random on  military and civilian aircraft flying along the Southern California coast.  </P> <P> The new system -- a backup for times when heavy electronic jamming makes radar  tracking difficult -- stayed with every target. For the Navy, the test was one  with a happy ending.  </P> <P> Normally, the details of such matters at Point Mugu are never publicly  revealed. But last week the Navy provided a rare glimpse of what goes on inside  its most advanced air weapons test center.  </P> <P> Much of the secret work is on the cutting edge of U.S. and Soviet technology,  and many of the most sensitive projects involve electronic warfare -- the  countermeasures and counter-countermeasures that dominate modern military  strategy.  </P> <P> In a sense, Point Mugu is the setting for an endless military game of cat and  mouse -- where the Navy's top civilian engineers spend lifetimes devising war  scenarios continuously testing U.S. weapons against Soviet capabilities.  </P> <P> One of those engineers is Allen Dahl, 42, who arrived at Point Mugu as a high  school graduate in 1964 and literally grew up working on the computer software  programs of the F-14, the Navy's primary air-to-air combat plane.  </P> <P> Dahl, who now heads the computer software branch for the F-14D, an advanced  version of the Tomcat just emerging from the development stage, is assembling  the engineering team that will be responsible for the new plane during the next  decade.  </P> <P> Sent by the Navy to the UC Davis for his engineering degree, Dahl says most of  his education has come from on-the-job training. "Unfortunately, all you can  get from college is an engineering degree," he said. "You can't get an  education in weapons systems or warfare."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nicholson Painting  </P> <P> The father of six, Dahl keeps a daughter's giant painting of actor Jack  Nicholson in his office, where he and others will map war scenarios testing the  more than 30 on-board computers on the newest Tomcat fighters.  </P> <P> With Nicholson looking demonically down from the wall during a recent  interview, Dahl outlined some of the war games played by Point Mugu's  Electronic Warfare Directorate in the center's high-tech Systems Integration  Test Station, known as the SITS lab.  </P> <P> Already inside the lab are two test models of the original F-14A Tomcat, Dahl  said. Construction is under way on an adjoining $50-million laboratory where  additional F-14D models will be placed.  </P> <P> Hooked up to the most sophisticated electronic gear and military computers  available, the planes can be made to perform inside the labs just as they would  in actual flight conditions, Dahl said. The planes in the labs, in other words,  are often made to think they are in actual combat.  </P> <P> "The most sophisticated stuff we do, where the rubber really meets the road, is  associated with electronic counter-countermeasure testing," Dahl said. "That  would be where we have a jamming simulator and two or three attacking targets."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Modifying Plane  </P> <P> The primary role of the F-14 is defense of Navy aircraft carriers in combat,  Dahl said. About 500 F-14As are in use throughout the Navy, and about 300 of  those will gradually be redesigned to meet F-14D configurations.  </P> <P> In one typical combat scenario anticipated by Pentagon planners, Soviet bombers  flying outside the Tomcat's range could turn on powerful jamming devices,  allowing planes and missiles to be launched down the jamming path toward Navy  ships, hoping to blind U.S. radar during the attack.  </P> <P> Confronted with such an attack, one option for the Tomcat would be to maneuver  itself into a fresh angle on the attack area so its radar or other tracking  sensors could lock in on enemy planes and missiles, enabling the F-14 to  destroy as many targets as possible.  </P> <P> "In real combat, there could be dozens of planes and hundreds of targets coming  in, including bombers, fighters and cruise missiles," Dahl said. "In our  jamming scenarios, we use very controlled tests. Maybe one bomber. The point is  to study how the plane performs and pass that along to pilots.  </P> <P> "Nobody really wins most of these tests," he added. "That's where the glamour  goes away. You don't have an easy way of scoring."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Constant Updates  </P> <P> Engineers at Point Mugu run electronic jamming tests on their F-14 models about  twice a week, Dahl said. At the same time, they are constantly updating the  computer data that go into the F-14. Near the end of every such update, a  full-scale, multitarget combat scenario is played out.  </P> <P> "That's the most glamorous stuff," Dahl said. "You fire 20 closely spaced  targets at the Tomcat and see if you can overload the computer, watch the  computer degrade. In actual combat, under ideal circumstances, the Tomcat might  take out six incoming missiles or planes. Others could take the rest."  </P> <P> While Dahl's work at the missile center represents a high-adventure, high-tech  side of the Navy's various research projects at Point Mugu -- complete with  theoretical dogfights and missile battles -- there is another side to the  weapons testing work that at times can be decidedly lackluster.  </P> <P> Not far from Dahl's sophisticated lab, for example, is another building that  houses Point Mugu's Electromagnetic Systems Division. While the work that takes  place there on ultraviolet rays, gamma rays and lasers is at least as sensitive  and sophisticated as the programming of Navy jet fighters, the surroundings in  some respects resemble little more than a military salvage yard.  </P> <P> Just behind the building is a fenced area holding what appears at first glance  to be some abandoned Army tanks. In reality, they are four Sgt. York mobile air  defense units, built for the Army in the early 1980s at a cost of $32 million  each and then given away when the Sgt. York program was junked because of cost  overruns and other problems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Simulating Soviets  </P> <P> The Electromagnetic Systems Division was attracted to the Sgt. Yorks because  they resemble Soviet antiaircraft weapons capable of shooting down Navy planes  and they came with a stabilized optics package and laser equipment that could  be used at Point Mugu.  </P> <P> Acquiring four of the Army's 82 Sgt. Yorks two years ago for $5,000 each -- the  cost of moving them from Alabama -- the Navy now uses them routinely at Point  Mugu in training helicopter and fighter pilots during air-to-ground combat  simulations and has made considerable highly classified use of the laser and  optical equipment on board.  </P> <P> Unlike Dahl, who seemed happy at the chance to discuss the capacities of the  F-14D in war games, the head of Point Mugu's Electromagnetic Systems Division,  Milton Olson, was reluctant to talk about the most important research programs  now under way in his area of command,  </P> <P> "We do some work with lasers," he said. "That's all I can say."  </P> <P> In addition to showing off the Sgt. York, however, Olson was willing to discuss  another piece of military hardware recently developed by his engineers for use  in training U.S. pilots to avoid being hit by heat-seeking missiles during  combat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tracking Flares  </P> <P> In a workroom not far from the Sgt. Yorks, Olson pointed to a long, white tube  faintly resembling an elongated water heater with a rotating top.  </P> <P> The giant pod, called the Airborne Turret Infrared Measurement System can be  attached to airplanes. The system, the only one of its kind in the world, has  become operational in only the last two weeks, Olson said.  </P> <P> Known as ATIMS III, it is used in testing one of the first and simplest of all  U.S. aerial warfare countermeasures -- the dropping of highly volatile chemical  flares by jets to decoy heat-seeking enemy missiles.  </P> <P> Equipped with radiation devices and television cameras, the ATIMS III records  the dropping of flares, which helps Navy engineers determine which flares are  most effective and is useful in developing tactics that pilots can use when  being chased by an enemy missile.  </P> <P> Standing beside his new ATIMS III, Olson made the point that -- despite the  super-sophisticated technology involved in much of the work at Point Mugu --  some of the most important programs still come in relatively simple packages.  </P> <P> "In Vietnam, heat-seeking missiles were responsible for 90% of the kills on  both sides," Olson said. "They are a very formidable weapon. Flares have been  one of the most important countermeasures. They may seem to be a pretty simple  solution. But they are also very important."  </P></p>

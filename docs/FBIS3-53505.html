Opening the meeting, a few verses were read out by one of  the  ulema and then esteemed Mawlawi Ataurrahman introduced members  of the decision-making council to the esteemed president of the  Islamic State of Afghanistan.    Then, Hojjat ol-Eslam Walmoslemin Khodadad Erfani spoke  about  the coup attempt by a group of criminals and said:    Criminal communists once again, in collaboration with the  hypocrite Golboddin, soiled their hands with the blood of the  innocent and Muslim people of Afghanistan. Hekmatyar is a  hypocrite element of our era who destroyed Kabul due to the  existence of militia in the past. Distinction between the  militia and Golboddin is now difficult to make.    Hojjat ol-Eslam Erfani also said that the Sunni and Shi'ia  ulema of Afghanistan have expressed support for the declared  jihad by the president of Afghanistan. He considered jihad  against militia and communists as the duty of every Muslim.    Then esteemed Mawlawi Ruhani and Mawlawi Kefayatollah spoke  in turn and considered jihad against the militia as a duty to  God.    The esteemed president then praised the role of ulema during  the era of jihad and said: It is without any doubt that, under  the present conditions, the faithful ulema have taken their  resolute stand. This means that the conscience of our nation is  awake and your meeting is indicative of the national and  religious unity of our country.</p>

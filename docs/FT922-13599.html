			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / S African miners' union changes negotiating tack THE annual wage round in the South African mining industry has started, with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) apparently backing away from the historic performance bonuses negotiated last year. The key demands from NUM, which represents 200,000 black miners, are that there should be a 20 per cent minimum wage increase on gold mines and a 55 per cent average increase on coal mines. The miners' pay negotiations are closely watched as a bellwether of union militancy. Last year's agreement, which included a small basic increase, with performance-based bonuses on top of this, was hailed as a breakthrough, with unions recognising that the difficult economic climate required flexibility in their wage demands. In late January, however, the NUM's central wage committee resolved not to renew productivity agreements and this week restated its concern that the schemes have been abused. Productivity agreements run contrary to a core NUM demand - that wages should be standardised. They are unhappy that productivity agreements have benefited workers on some mines, but not on others. Mr Rob Gillan, mining analyst at stockbrokers Mathison Hollidge, says: 'They're a function of where you work, not how you work.' The NUM's position would appear to be that while not rejecting performance agreements outright, it wants to ensure that they are better monitored. One of its proposals is that an independent body be set up to monitor agreements and to promote their effective implementation.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIFFERENT SPOKES FOR DIFFERENT FOLKS;  </P> <P> RECREATION: BIKES ARE CHANGING FOR THE BETTER. THE 10-SPEED YOU ONCE DREAMED  ABOUT MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU WANT NOW. MAYBE YOU NEED A MOUNTAIN BIKE, OR HYBRID.  </P> <P> So you thought you'd buy a new bicycle. Run down to the local bike shop, check  out the 10-speeds, spend maybe $125 and be riding by the afternoon.  </P> <P> My, how things have changed. In case you don't know it, the standard-spoked  bicycle has gone through a revolution of sorts since your youth. Thanks to  technology, new designs and radical new features, the old two-wheeled steed has  undergone a dizzying number of changes, making it easier, and more enjoyable,  to ride than ever before.  </P> <P> It's never been this much fun -- or this costly.  </P> <P> In a word: If you haven't bought a bicycle recently but are eager to take  advantage of Orange County's ideal biking weather and myriad bike trails, be  ready for a shock the next time you drop by your local bike shop. You might not  even recognize some of the machines on display, and worse yet, you might not  know how to operate them.  </P> <P>  But first, discard the idea of dusting off that old 10-speed in the garage. It  may still work all right, but if the biking industry standard a decade ago was  a Volkswagen beetle -- sturdy and dependable -- today it's more of a Volvo,  equally durable but capable of so much more. So unless that relic in the garage  was a collector's item when you bought it, consider it garage-sale fodder and  let it go.  </P> <P> And if you're still intent on going on the cheap, consider this: by the time  you take your old bike in for a tuneup, replace the tires and a few cables and  get it overhauled, you'll have a bill upwards of $150 -- if it's done right.  And even then all you'll have is a spruced-up antique. What is it they say? You  can give a bum a shave and a haircut, but he's still a bum.  </P> <P> Like anything -- cars, computers, stereos -- you're better off knowing what is  out there, and what your needs are, before you set foot in the bike shop. A  good salesman will walk you though the new lines and what is available, but a  little knowledge goes a long way.  </P> <P> Which bike you select depends on what kind of riding you plan on doing, but  generally there are three basic types of bicycles on the market.  </P> <P> * Road bikes: This is the much-beloved classic 10-speed, the European-designed  import that was so popular during the bicycle boom of the early 1970s. This  skinny tire, drop handlebar machine was designed for speed and remains popular  with traditionalists and those who have taken to biking for fitness and racing.  </P> <P> But some industry experts, including Bicycling magazine, already seem prepared  to write its obituary. The problem: the drop handlebars, designed to put the  rider in the most aerodynamic position possible, have proved too uncomfortable  for the mass market and the tires, while great for speed on the road, are prone  to flats. Still, if you're looking to drop a few pounds or stay in shape, there  is nothing that beats a road bike for overall versatility and plain, aesthetic  beauty. Purists will ride nothing else, and think nothing of spending $2,000 to  $5,000 for a custom model.  </P> <P> Road bikes generally come with 12, 14 or 16 speeds -- the term 10-speed has  hence become a misnomer -- and feature steel, aluminum, carbon fiber or  composite frames. Prices for entry-level production road bikes start around  $350 to $400. Mid-range road bikes, those with higher quality brakes, gears,  frame tubing and components, run around $650.  </P> <P> * Mountain bikes: This particularly American invention burst onto the scene 10  years ago and has single-handedly changed the way the world looks at the  bicycle. Immensely popular, these fat tire bikes featuring upright handlebars  were designed to go off the road but have proved popular on asphalt as well.  </P> <P> Dealers say most people who buy mountain bikes rarely leave the road. Mountain  bikes comprise about 70% of the total bike sales in the United States, and they  currently are the rage of Europe. Even some of Europe's most revered names in  racing bikes (Colnago and Pinarello among them) have broken with tradition and  are marketing their own version of the American mountain bike.  </P> <P> The advantages: The fat, knobby tires rarely give way to flats, and the upright  handlebars and padded seats make for a generally more comfortable ride for the  recreational cyclist.  </P> <P> Mountain bikes also feature a third "granny" gear in the front, giving riders  an additional set of gears -- most come with 21 gears -- to take the steep  hills with ease. On the downside, these bikes, like a four-wheel-drive Jeep,  were not designed for the street, and they can be clearly limiting on longer  rides.  </P> <P> Prices for good quality mountain  </P> <P> bikes begin around $300. Look for mid-range models, again featuring better  grades of chromoly steel and superior components, in the $500-$600 range.  </P> <P> * Hybrids: Perhaps the most interesting, and promising, development of the past  few years has been the introduction of what is known as the hybrid bike.  </P> <P> Sensing the public's desire for a more comfortable ride but the ability to go  greater distances, manufacturers took the best of both the road and mountain  bikes and came up with the hybrid, which is known by a number of names -- cross  trainers, cross terrain, multi-track, to name a few. Most of the hybrids come  with upright handlebars, allowing the rider to avoid the hunched-over racing  position of the classic road bike. The tires are thinner than the mountain  bike's but still thicker, and therefore more durable, than the road bike's  standard slicks.  </P> <P> Some industry experts see the hybrid as the bike of the future, one that avoids  the extremes of the road and mountain bikes while providing a clean, fast,  trouble-free ride. Prices begin around $300 and escalate from there.  </P> <P> If the prices scare you, take heart. The bike of 1990 is nothing like its  distant cousin of a decade ago. Like computers, the technology has moved so  fast that it is almost unthinkable to be riding anything but one of the new  generation of bikes.  </P> <P> They are lighter, faster and feature superior designs and frame materials. And  -- this can't be emphasized enough -- they also are easier to handle.  </P> <P> Take, for example, what has happened to shifting. Thanks to a Japanese company,  SunTour, most bikes now come equipped with what is known as "indexed" or  "click" shifting. A simple click of a lever or push of a button throws the bike  into a new gear. No more looking back at the rear freewheel to make sure the  chain hits the right cog. Want to go up three gears? Click the lever three  times.  </P> <P> What this does is render obsolete that tired old question: Why do I need 21  gears? Do you ever use all of them? Thanks to trouble-free shifting, riders are  zipping through the gears with healthy abandon.  </P> <P> Equally important (but probably overemphasized by those who know no better) is  weight. Advances in design and construction have made bikes lighter than ever  before. Pick up any new bike if you doubt it. Aluminum bikes are even lighter  and new materials (carbon fiber, composites) are taking this quest for  lightness to new extremes.  </P> <P> But weight should not be the only consideration. More important are the  components -- brakes, derailleurs, gearing, chain rings, etc. -- and the frame.  If you want a better bike, pay attention to the frame and components and don't  be reluctant to pay an extra $75 to $100, or even $200, for a superior bicycle.  In the highly competitive world of bikes, you truly get what you pay for.  </P> <P> Pedal systems have also been vastly improved, cranks are more durable and  lighter and brakes have never been as sure. Good quality name-brand bikes (we  are excluding department and discount store models) will also come with  knock-off wheels, meaning that removing the front or rear wheel can be done by  releasing a simple lever. The height of the seat post is also adjustable with a  lever.  </P> <P> The final, and perhaps most important, aspect of bike shopping is finding the  right shop. Unfortunately, all bike shops are not equal. Shop around. Find a  shop that carries name brands with solid reputations (Trek, Specialized,  Centurion are three) and has a mechanic who knows what he's doing.  </P> <P> Ask for references. How long has he been in business? Does he race? Look around  the shop. Check the prices. Generally, the better shops offering more expertise  will carry a number of higher-end models catering to racers or serious  recreational cyclists.  </P> <P> And lastly there is the fit. Ten years ago people paid little attention to  sizing, but today the size of the frame, the height of the stem, the width of  the handlebars and the position of the seat post are all important in providing  the most comfortable ride possible.  </P> <P> Good shops will fit you for the right size bike at no cost (this involves  measuring the inseam, upper body, shoulders, etc). Others will sell you a bike,  no matter how big or small, to move it off the floor. A good bike shop should  be like the family doctor -- the expert to which you go with your problems.  </P> <P> Bikers have a name for dilettantes who think they know what they're doing but  don't. You see them on the road riding bikes too small or large for them and  spinning along in the wrong gear. They're called Freds. So shop around, find  the right shop, buy the bike that suits your needs and stay out of Fred's shop.  </P></p>

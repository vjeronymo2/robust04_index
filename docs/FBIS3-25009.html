"The count  must be done correctly. That is where there is the most trouble.  And my first impressions have not been good," said Kodjo, head  of the Togolese Democratic Union. He charged that candidates  were having trouble obtaining copies of official reports from  polling station officials, as was their right under the  electoral code.    Shortly after his complaint national radio broadcast a  statement calling for electoral rules to be respected.  Burkinabe Minister of State Herman Yameogo, head of an  international monitoring committee grouping representatives from  Burkina Fasso, Egypt, France, Germany and the United States,  minimized the problems, attributing them to poorly informed  polling officials. Earlier Sunday Kodjo said he had been  "satisfied" with the way the elections had been run.    The results of the first round -- in which two million  voters  were eligible to take part -- are due to be released on  Wednesday, with a run-off poll scheduled for February 20.

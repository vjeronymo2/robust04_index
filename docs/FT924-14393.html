			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: Retail sector paints a brighter picture SHARES in most of the leading US retail groups rose yesterday after the retail sector painted a brighter sales picture for September. The figures, showing presentable same-store sales gains at most major retailers last month after relatively drab figures for much of the summer, suggested there may be a modest improvement in consumer confidence. However, industry participants also cautioned that the relatively late date for Labor Day pushed some 'back-to-school' spending from August into September. Among the big department store groups, Dayton Hudson - which takes in the Marshall Fields chain as well as the Target discount retail operation - showed a 6.2 per cent gain in sales from stores which had been open for a year or more. The Federated Department Stores group - incorporating the likes of Bloomingdale's and The Bon Marche - posted a 6.6 per cent improvement in same-store sales. Neiman Marcus registered a 3.3 per cent advance in same-store sales, and J. C. Penney a 14.4 per cent gain from mainline stores. At Sears, Roebuck, there was a 5.3 per cent advance in comparable domestic store sales - with major appliances, home office equipment, clothing and hardware doing well, but car products and services still lagging. At Woolworth, same-store sales in the US were up by 5.5 per cent. Wal-Mart Stores - the nation's largest retailer in sales terms - posted a 12 per cent advance in same-store sales, lifting eight-month sales 26 per cent to Dollars 33.5bn.</p>

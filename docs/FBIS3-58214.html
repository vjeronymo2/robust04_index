No one has yet claimed responsibility for the bomb, which  was  placed next to one of the marble columns supporting the  two-storey building and left a crater about 1.5 meters deep.    Security at all NATO offices in Europe was immediately  tightened in response to the bombing, Italian officials said. A  NATO summit begins Monday morning in Brussels.    The NATO Defense College is in the EUR neighborhood, on the  southern outskirts of the capital, in the same building as a  branch of Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura [National  Agricultural Bank] and some municipal offices. The building has  a closed-circuit camera security system and 24-hour guard  service but no one reportedly noticed anything suspicious before  the explosion.    Eyewitnesses reported seeing four men leaving the site of  the  attack aboard a gray Alfa Romeo shortly before the bombing.</p>

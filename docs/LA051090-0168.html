			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INNOVATION: A TINY SOLUTION FOR TODAY'S BIG PROBLEMS  </P> <P> The palate of pseudomonas aeruginosa is discriminating without being fussy,  robust without being ravenous, and curious without being intrusive. This is  clearly a microbe with panache.  </P> <P> "They seem to be a very flexible bacteria," says Bio-Care Chairman Bob Larvie,  whose young Campbell, Calif.-based company packages and sells them to  restaurants at $20 a pop to help manage garbage disposal. "They eat most of the  biological, animal and oleaginous waste materials of any kind: detergents,  shampoos. . . . Grease is a feast for these guys, a four-star meal." You can  buy these Agriculture Department-approved microcritters for your septic tank  too.  </P> <P> Similarly, Exxon and the Environmental Protection Agency discovered that  there's nothing like a dash of Inipol -- a French-made fertilizer -- to  stimulate the growth and appetites of hydrocarbon-munching microorganisms on  the oil-stained beaches around Alaska's Prince William Sound, the inlet where  the Exxon Valdez tanker dumped its crude. "There were much more dramatic  surface results than anyone had predicted," enthuses the University of  Louisville's Ronald M. Atlas, a biologist who has been a pioneer in bacterial  bioremediation for more than 20 years.  </P> <P> We've built microprocessors to process data; we can now build microorganisms to  process waste. "Everyone's back yard is filled with billions of bacteria that  are capable of degrading pollutants," says Louisville's Atlas. The trick is to  identify, cultivate and nurture the right ones. The beauty of this approach is  that, in most cases, we can work with naturally occurring bacteria -- bacteria  that have already been tested by the rigors of evolution.  </P> <P> "It's the back-to-nature pollution cure," says Atlas. "Bioremediation is taking  advantage of natural processes and stimulating them to help them along." But at  the same time, the clever design of microbial intervention could be used as  much to limit pollution as clean it up. What we have in bioremediation is the  opportunity to craft macroecologies of microorganisms -- self-regulating  environments that strike a new and better balance between society's ability to  generate waste and nature's ability to accommodate it.  </P> <P> Smokestacks belching pollution? Install membranes of sulfur-hungry  microcritters to leech out the noxious gases. Landfills about to burst? Seed  the sites with microbial cocktails that will accelerate the processes of  natural decay. Toxic waste sites? Don't dig up the soil and incinerate. Douse  it with the microorganisms capable of cracking its compounds into substances  less harsh and more easily manageable.  </P> <P> Ground-water problems? The right bacteria in the right doses could solve them.  Cost-effective? Heck, yes! This product replenishes itself with waste.  </P> <P> Picture how chemical refineries, semiconductor plants and materials processing  sites would be redesigned as -- at various points -- living, dynamic microbial  screens. The screens could be used to strain out and metabolize the guck and  grunge that would otherwise end up as potentially toxic pollutants, which would  have to be either burned or buried.  </P> <P> Obviously, not all substances are vulnerable to microbiological assault.  Plastics and PCBs may need super-microorganisms endowed with special powers  granted only by skilled genetic engineers. One could build in "suicide genes"  that would kill them off once their work was done. "Actually," says Atlas, who  serves on the National Institutes of Health's Recombinant DNA Advisory  Committee, "the need for genetically engineered organisms to manage waste is  limited."  </P> <P> However, it would be neat to design a microcritter that could live in the  hostile environment of an automobile exhaust system and help cleanse the smoke,  because automobiles are a major source of air pollution. Or maybe some bacteria  that can live in the gas tank and help rid the fuel of potentially noxious  impurities.  </P> <P> The point is obvious: We're at the beginning of an explosion of what might  prove to be an exceptionally powerful and pervasive technology. There's not yet  a regulatory framework; the EPA, NIH, USDA and Office of Management and Budget  can't decide who's responsible (or not responsible) for what. Atlas estimates  that there are literally a thousand companies out there -- each organized  around its own microbe du jour. "I must have been contacted by venture  capitalists at least a hundred times last year," he shrugs. There's a lot of  ignorance and uncertainty.  </P> <P> "People ask, 'What happens when you create teen-age mutant ninja bugs? Will  they come out of the sewer and eat me?' " notes Bio-Care's Larvie.  </P> <P> Obviously, the environmental impact of densely concentrated colonies of  microbes is not a trivial matter, although Atlas stresses that "the presence of  that pollutant creates an ecology of its own, too." The questions become even  more clouded when you begin to intermix multiple ecologies of microbes --  genetically enhanced or not -- into supra-ecologies. The ability to make  meaningful predictions about bacteria growth and mutation rates decays. It's  clear that even seemingly "natural" solutions to waste pose stubborn  challenges.  </P> <P> But it's equally clear that, with billions of kinds of bacteria out there,  there are bound to be a couple of hundred that can deliver a lot of spic and  span for comparatively little risk. I think the prospects of bioremediation  become a fascinating challenge to the environmental movement too: Is this a  technique that it can embrace as ecologically sound because it attempts to  augment and enhance what nature does anyway? Or is it too "technological" and  "artificial" to win the Green Earthkeeping Seal of Approval?  </P> <P> Given the astonishing rate at which our knowledge of molecular biology expands  and our ability to understand the inner mechanisms of microorganisms grows,  there's no question that we will be able to explore a wide array of  cost-effective bioremediation approaches within the next three to five years.  What I find most exciting is that if this nascent technique can work well in  even one domain -- smokestacks, ground water, landfills, toxic waste sites --  the global impact will be extraordinary.  </P> <P> But as the English critic and cynic Cyril Connolly once remarked, "Those whom  the critics wish to destroy, they first call promising." The ingredients for  success seem right: The technological infrastructure is there, the problems are  there, the economics are tilting in the right direction. Yet, potential isn't  achievement. However, when Bio-Care's Larvie says, "If this isn't a business  for the '90s, I don't know what is," I can't help agreeing.  </P></p>

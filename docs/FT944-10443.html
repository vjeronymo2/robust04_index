			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Electrolux posts seven-fold improvement A seven-fold rise in profits at Electrolux in the first nine months was powered by cost-cutting, big capital gains, and economic recovery in western Europe. The world's biggest manufacturer of household appliances saw income after financial items jump to SKr5.08bn (Dollars 698m) from SKr712m. The sale of three non-core industrial units produced capital gains of SKr2.77bn and lifted operating income to SKr6.26bn from SKr2.01bn. Without the gain, operating income was 73 per cent higher at SKr3.48bn while income after financial items was up 224 per cent at SKr2.31bn. Earnings per share climbed to SKr19.8 from SKr2. Electrolux B shares closed SKr9.5 higher at SKr365.5. Mr Leif Johansson, chief executive, said the underlying improvement was mainly due to the group's restructuring and cost-cutting programme which has lifted productivity by 10 per cent over the past year. However, he said market conditions in Europe and the US were better, reflected in an 8 per cent underlying increase in sales to SKr79.8bn. The recovery has been driven by household appliances, the biggest of the group's four divisions. The group said there were signs that the pace of increase in demand in North America was slowing, while momentum was increasing in most European markets. 'We are also starting to see some price increases in the European household appliance market,' he said, although he noted that the group's own raw material costs were also rising. Sales of household appliances rose 9.2 per cent to SKr47.6bn. Operating income showed 'a marked improvement' driven by a strong performance from the group's US and European white goods units. The group's three other divisions, commercial appliances, outdoor products and industrial products, improved operating income. In the third quarter, group income after financial items climbed to SKr650m from SKr107m after an 8 per cent rise in underlying sales to SKr24.2bn. There was a stronger performance from the group's commercial appliances division, which suffered from weak demand in the first six months.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Finance will open the underwriting  of nonlife insurance for artificial satellites to foreign  insurance companies not holding a Japanese license as early as  before the end of 1994. The opening of satellite insurance to  foreign companies has been announced in light of an agreement at  the GATT Uruguay Round, and will be implemented as soon as the  Uruguay Round accord is ratified. As to insurance for  oceangoing vessels and aircraft, the ban on foreign  participation will be lifted in fiscal 1995, together with the  reform of the insurance industry, because this requires  amendments in the relevant laws.    The underwriting of insurance by foreign insurers is known  as  a "cross-border transaction." This has not been allowed for  insurance companies not holding a license to operate in Japan,  except for international cargo and a limited number of other  items. Due to strong demands to open the market from Western  nations, the opening of insurance for oceangoing vessels and  aircraft has been included in the "outline of external economic  policy reform" announced on 29 March, apart from the Uruguay  Round agreement. Implementation of this policy in artificial  satellites is being frontloaded because this does not require  any legal amendment.    Insurance fees for artificial satellites sometimes cost  several billion yen due to the high risk of failure in launching  satellites. In Japan, when the National Space Development Agency  launches its satellites, Japanese nonlife insurers usually  underwrite insurance jointly, and reinsure with foreign  insurers. By opening the market to foreign companies, foreign  reinsurers can now underwrite insurance directly.    With regard to ships and aircraft, the selling of insurance  policies is prohibited for foreign insurers not holding a  Japanese license under the "Foreign Insurance Companies Law."</p>

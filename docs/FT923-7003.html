			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Iraqi Shias suffer systematic repression: Destruction of centuries-old culture - Marshland home threatened THE decision by the US, Britain and France to impose an air exclusion zone over southern Iraq was made against a background of persistent repression of the Shia population which accounts for more than half the country's estimated 18.5m population. For nearly 18 months their suffering at the hands of Saddam Hussein's regime in Baghdad has been well known to the western intelligence community and reported on by the few correspondents who had access to the region. Mr Max van der Stoel, special rapporteur of the commission on human rights at the UN, issued a devastating report earlier this year on the measures which had been taken against the Shia and followed up last week with a further statement to the Security Council which drew particular attention to the Marsh Arabs. What has emerged is the all-too-familiar pattern of events through which Saddam Hussein has sought to control dissident ethnic and religious groups opposed to Baghdad. In his original report, Mr van der Stoel pointed to the systematic destruction of the centuries-old culture of the southern Shia, the desecration of buildings and graves, and the the disappearance of clergy. In 1970 he estimated there were up to 9,000 clergy in the city of Najaf alone. There were only 800 remaining before the start of the Gulf War. After the 1991 uprising of those 800 almost all were under arrest or had disappeared. The report estimated that in addition to widespread executions and torture, some 150,000 people may have been arrested, of whom some 15,000 came from Najaf. While that repression continues unabated, Mr van der Stoel has drawn attention to an increased threat to the Marsh Arabs who live in the network of island and waterways to the north and west of Basra, an area of outstanding natural beauty. He reported that he has a videotape of Iraqi generals being instructed to 'wipe out' three specific Marsh Arab tribes who are referred to as an 'un-Iraqi' people. In addition, many Marsh Arabs were being forcibly relocated in a way which recalled similar operations among the Kurdish population in the late 1980s. And the report to the Security Council indicated that perhaps the gravest long-term threat was the 'Third River Project' which would drain huge areas, destroy the natural habitat and force out remaining centres of population. Reuter adds: There is no final agreement among Gulf War allies on a plan to shoot down Iraqi military aircraft over the southern part of the country populated by Shia Moslems, a White House spokesmen told reporters at the Republican convention in Houston. Mr Marlin Fitzwater said consultations with the allies were initiated by the US several days ago but that 'a lot of details have yet to be worked out'.</p>

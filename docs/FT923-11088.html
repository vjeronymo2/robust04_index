			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (17): Patchy recovery on the farm - Dairies are the bright spot, while exports have improved AGRICULTURAL exports, including fish, are playing a major role in returning the New Zealand economy to better health. While a 10 per cent currency devaluation over the past eight months has been significant, exporters' confidence has been buoyed by the growing international acceptance of New Zealand products of all types. The primary producing sector was hardest hit by the economic reforms between 1984 and 1990. A combination of a high exchange rate and interest rates that sometimes hit 25 per cent forced many farmers to leave the land. A remarkable return in farming confidence has followed the arrival of minimal inflation, coupled with more competitive exchange and lower interest rates. But it is a patchy recovery. Sheep farmers, while better off, are still struggling. To be profitable the average farmer needs a return of NZDollars 40 for lamb but he is getting only Dollars NZ22, according to the Meat and Wool Board's economic service. Yet viewed across all farming sectors, profitability is rising. The rate of return on total farm capital has historically been in the range of 2 to 4 per cent for sheep and beef farms. But the top group of farms (12 per cent) now show a return of 10 per cent or more on capital and 34 per cent of farms achieve a return of between 5 and 10 per cent. The major characteristics of the top farms are high stock performance and more livestock units per person. Mr Rob Davison of the Meat and Wool Board's economic service says gross farm incomes could be boosted by a third over the next five years, which would restore profitability to the levels of 15 years ago. The tough times that New Zealand farmers have faced are reflected in the fall in the numbers of animals farmed. In 1984-85 New Zealand exported 40m lambs, but this year only 26m will be available. In 1982 there were 13m more sheep and cattle on farms, and declining profits have forced many farmers to cut back on maintenance, allowing parts of many properties to start reverting to bush. Despite this, a better-than-expected 1991-92 wool season ended on June 25 on a more confident note. Morale had been low at the start of the season after the suspension of the Wool Board's minimum price scheme left the board holding a stockpile of 565,000 bales, and prices were low due to the international recession and because of the absence of two major buyers, the Soviet Union and China. However, China resumed buying again, and some improvement in world demand saw a gradual pick-up for the wool market indicator from 370 cents a kg in late November to peak at 535 cents in early June. Then prices weakened again, in line with falling international demand to 468 cents. However, it was a considerable success to reduce the stockpile by around 156,000 bales: this was seen as a great achievement in a world recession. New Zealand is the world's largest producer of crossbred wools, used in carpets, and is meeting success in selling to growing markets making hand-knotted carpets in China, India, Turkey and Iran. The industry hopes that a new marketing plan will boost real returns, which are at a 25-year low. Returns from sheepmeat have been good, and profitability is being boosted by a growing trend for added processing of carcases before export. This year for the first time, more lambs will be exported in processed form than in carcases. The live sheep trade to Saudi Arabia has also been buoyant. Beef prices, which hinge on US demand, have eased due to rising worldwide production and recessionary trends which have seen intense competition from pork and chicken. Exports to Korea and other parts of Asia are developing rapidly. Dairying is the one really bright spot. Nine months ago there were serious concerns within the industry that another low payout, similar to last year's Dollars 3.75 a kg of milkfat from the co-operative dairy board would force farmers to walk off their land. However, an unexpected lift in demand from October saw the pay-out from the board rise steadily to end the season at Dollars NZ5.20, and farmers will receive additional payments from their local dairy companies which could see them earn Dollars 6 a kg. With forecasters expecting another good season, dairy farms are undergoing a resurgence of interest. In some provincial districts, such as Southland and Canterbury, beef and sheep farmers are converting their properties to dairy cattle. There is some nervousness over further trade reform and protectionism within the EC, as well as worries that EC export subsidies will increase. However there are hopes that the Gatt round can be satisfactorily settled, as an agreement could avoid a further round of negotiations over access to the important British market. New Zealand's current access is restricted to 55,000 tonnes, but under the present proposals it could be lifted to 76,000 tonnes, the average for the three years between 1986 and 1988. The dairy industry is meeting good demand for cheese and dairy powder in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. A good wet season has encouraged farmers to boost output, and there is substantial investment in new technology. Fishing has turned into a winner: helped by a worldwide shortage of white fish. This industry now accounts for 5 per cent of the country's exports. Last year New Zealand's extensive 200-mile economic zone handled 2.5 per cent of the world's tinned fish catch. In the year to December, it earned 30 per cent more - at over NZDollars 1bn than in 1990, and is said to be on target to do even better in this calendar year. The Fishing Industry Board expects it to earn over Dollars 2bn a year by the end of the decade. While most varieties have met strong international demand, there are hopes for a strong resurgence of interest in squid, which could earn as much as Dollars 400m a year. The board says the industry has improved its competitiveness by 16 per cent in the past 18 months and believes the outlook remains promising .</p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> REPORT SAYS HUD FIGURE SHREDDED FILES  </P> <P> Deborah Gore Dean, a key figure in the ongoing investigation of political abuse  of HUD programs, stated in a deposition that she had her office files shredded  as she was leaving her job as executive aide to former Housing and Urban  Development Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., the New York Times reported. "I  gave them to the inspector general and had them shredded by the inspector  general," Dean said in the April, 1988, deposition, according to the newspaper.  But Inspector General Paul A. Adams, HUD's chief internal investigator, told  the newspaper he did not know what Dean was talking about. Federal agencies  differ on their rules for saving office files and there was no indication of  any wrongdoing by Dean in her handling of the documents, the newspaper said.  Dean, Pierce's assistant from 1984 to 1987, gave the deposition in a civil  lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Chicago which involved developers accusing  HUD of reneging on an agreement to renegotiate the terms of a mortgage on a  large housing project.  </P></p>

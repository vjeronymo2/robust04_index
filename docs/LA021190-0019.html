			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE MAN'S EXPERIENCE STRIKES FAMILIAR CHORD  </P> <P> To be sure, Bruce Bean's "To Be Young, Black and Endangered" touches a  sensitive public nerve. Granted, the condition exists. More positively, what do  we do about it? If blame is to be assigned, we all must confess a share.  </P> <P> Often, I have declared that if I had been born black, I would have been the  most obnoxious of the racial protagonists. Now, it would seem, the worst course  would be to finger blame.  </P> <P> The biggest hurdle to overcome is the universal human inclination to  stereotype. . . . To cancel out the effects of aggregate or stereotypical  impressions, we have to focus on positive racial intercourse and experience.  This requires that blacks soft-pedal blaming their fate on the accident of  their birth -- which they have every right to do, but, that's a given, not  subject to change. Too, they must brush off misguided whites who exhort them to  a course of confrontation and violence. One course might be to resist a  tendency to regard every affront or restraint as racially motivated.  </P> <P> I hope Bruce Bean realizes that the vocation he's chosen, the printed word, is  the strongest weapon yet known to address inequity.  </P> <P> BILL KUBICK, Oceanside  </P></p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Builders fear lost business from stamp duty changes Changes to stamp duty rules announced in the Budget are causing alarm among housebuilders and commercial property companies, which fear that deals currently being concluded may be disrupted. Accountancy firm Price Waterhouse says the changes will mean that, for the first time, stamp duty will be applied fully to part-exchange house sales, land swaps between builders and internal leases agreed between parent companies and subsidiaries. Until now stamp duty on exchanges of property or land has been levied only on cash paid to make up the difference in the value between the properties. With the threshold for stamp duty set at Pounds 60,000, this has meant that little or no duty was paid. Price Waterhouse claims that the Pounds 70m the Treasury has estimated it will raise in 1994-95 is small compared with the disruption and extra costs to industry from additional property valuations. The Law Society has written to the Inland Revenue seeking clarification of the changes, which have already come into effect. It wants any subsequent modification of the rules by parliament to be backdated to allow companies and individuals to reclaim stamp duty paid unfairly. About Pounds 55m of house sales involve part-exchange deals. The Housebuilders Federation fears that some purchasers who had not expected to pay stamp duty will pull out or seek to renegotiate terms. The changes will also affect land swaps, in which builders with too much land in one region exchange with a builder with excess land elsewhere. Mr Roger Humber, director of the Housebuilders Federation said: 'These transactions do not create any immediate profit for the companies but improve the efficiency of the industry. Any subsequent gain can be taxed in the normal way when properties are sold. 'Stamp duty on part-exchange house sales will raise only Pounds 3m but will add an unnecessary complication to transactions.' The British Property Federation is concerned that companies which negotiate leases with subsidiaries for 'good internal accounting reasons' will be penalised by having to pay stamp duty on these deals. It says companies renegotiating terms of lease arrangements will have to pay stamp duty on the full market value of the building even though there has been no change in ownership or occupation. Mr Don Draper of Price Waterhouse said: 'The government may find it has no alternative but to withdraw the proposals.'</p>

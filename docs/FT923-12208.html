			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Inkatha calls for defiance of ANC over 'mass action' THE Inkatha Freedom party (IFP) yesterday called on its members to defy an African National Congress (ANC) call for 'mass action' against the government of President F W de Klerk. In a move likely to reinforce the already bitter rivalry between the two parties, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's mainly Zulu backed movement said its supporters should 'exercise the right to work' and urged employers 'not to close their businesses during any mass action campaign'. A resolution passed at the IFP annual conference this weekend said the party was 'appalled that the ANC and its allies are planning protest action which includes marches, strikes and stay-aways which will cripple the economy at the time we most need to build it up to provide the wealth the first government after apartheid will need to make democracy work.' Among other measures, the ANC and trade union allies have called for a general strike to begin on August 3, marking the start of a week of disruption. Employers' representatives and union officials are close to agreement on a compromise in which business and unions make a joint appeal for an end to the political stalemate. Normal economic activity would be suspended on August 3 but business would continue as usual. Many businessmen, however, are uneasy about forming an alliance with unions to put pressure on the government to concede to the ANC demand for a majority rule constitution. The prospect of damaging relations with Inkatha will add to their unease, for Chief Buthelezi's opposition to economic sanctions and advocacy of a market economy has always been appreciated by the business community. Inkatha also called on the ANC to disband its guerrilla force, Umkhonto we Sizwe, and said it would do all it could to ensure that the force was disbanded by the September 14 anniversary of the signing of the national peace accord. It did not elaborate.</p>

According to the reports, all other mainland hijackers are  still under trial and they are prohibited to apply for permanent  stay in Taiwan.    Since the first mainland airliner was hijacked to Taiwan  this  year, the Taiwan public has showed deep concern, saying that all  hijackers should be repatriated to the mainland and those who  employed violent and coercive and other means to hijack aircraft  should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without  probation in accordance with relevant regulations.    On December 18 this year, a vice-chairman of the "Mainland  Affairs Council" of Taiwan had expressed the view that all 12  hijackers staying in Taiwan would be repatriated if the  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits from the  mainland and the Straits Exchange Foundation from Taiwan reached  an agreement on this issue.    It is also reported that Gao Jun, who hijacked a Chinese  mainland airliner to Taiwan on December 8 this year, had  attempted to kill himself on early December 23 in a jail. Local  reports said he has been in low spirits there.</p>

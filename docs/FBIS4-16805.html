			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM-TASS] </F>   [Text] Minsk 19 April, TASS -- An IMF delegation arrived in  Minsk on Tuesday to discuss articles of the IMF Charter and hold  talks on granting Belarus the second part of the credit from the  fund of system transformations.    "The Belarussian [Belarusian] Government has taken all the  necessary measures to obtain the second half of the credit worth  98 million U.S. dollars," said Natalya Prokopyeva, chief expert  of the department of international financial organisations of  the Belarussian Council of Ministers. The first part of the  credit was granted to Belarus in July, 1993. The credit was  intended "for leveling the balance of payments" and using the  money mainly to repay Belarussian debt to Russia.    The credit was granted by the IMF for a term of ten years,  allowing a delay of 4.5 years. The interest rate is 5.67 per  cent a year.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Letter: Tradition of women health workers still maintained Sir, In 1924 it took a 'personal note' from a former Health Visitors Association president, Gertrude Tuckwell, to TUC general secretary, Fred Bramley, to persuade the TUC to accept an application for affiliation from the Women Sanitary Inspectors' and Health Visitors' Association. Even then women trade unionists were having to battle to take their place alongside their male colleagues. We won then - and the Health Visitors' Association is still here now, thanks to merger with our parent union MSF. Far from 'subsumed' ('Calling time on drinking with the boys', March 16), the HVA has been protected from extinction by merger. It has allowed us to keep our professional autonomy. Just as important, it has kept alive a tradition of nearly 100 years of women health workers organising together politically and professionally. Margaret A Buttigieg, Health Visitors Association, 50 Southwark Street, London SE1 1UN</p>

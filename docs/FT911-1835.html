			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Politics and agriculture facing up to growth in world appetite THE PROSPECT of having half as many people again, in 30 years time, eating at a world table that is wobbling all over the place is beginning to concentrate wonderfully the minds of agriculturalists and politicians. 'By the year 2025 the world will have to feed an additional 3bn people from a natural resource base which is already seriously threatened by unsustainable farming practices and environmental pressures arising from other human activities.' So reads the opening sentence of the "Den Bosch Declaration" on sustainable agriculture and rural developments, agreed last month in the Dutch town of s-Hertogenbosch, at an international conference organised by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the government of the Netherlands. Conviction appears to be widening that a great deal of farming in both developed and developing countries is not sustainable and must change if yields are to be maintained on a more permanent basis. And although existing farming methods are producing enough food for the world, millions cannot afford to buy what they need and are caught in a poverty trap which forces them to eke out a living at the expense of natural resources which are their sole means of survival. The Bruntdtland Report 'Our Common Future' spoke of short sighted policies which are leading to 'the degradation of the agricultural resource base on almost every continent; soil erosion in North America, soil acidification in Europe, deforestation and desertification in Asia, Africa and Latin America.' FAO estimates suggest between 5m to 7m hectares of arable land is lost each year through soil degradation. The Worldwatch Institute, the Washington based study group, says the annual loss of top soil is running at 24bn tonnes, roughly equivalent to the amount on the Australian wheat lands. Soil is also overworked in some areas, losing the nutrients which feed plants, as little attention is paid to conservation measures. Mr Edouard Saouma, FAO director-general, told participants at the conference from 124 countries that the threat to the environment was intensified by 'indebtedness, unfavourable terms of trade and falling world prices for export commodities'. Agriculture will have to meet the challenges, says the Den Bosch Declaration, 'mainly by increasing production on land already in use and by avoiding further encroachment on land that is only marginally suitable'. Changes are necessary to create the conditions of sustainability. 'This is particularly the case in the rural areas with a high population density and on marginal lands where small farmers and landless people can barely subsist.' The declaration was accompanied by an 'agenda for action' which urges the study of diverse forms of agriculture including low external inputs and organic farming systems. But it avoids the controversial issue as to whether the use of chemical fertilisers increase the acidity of certain soils, reducing their ability to sustain plant growth. At a recent international conference on permaculture (permanent agriculture) in Nepal, speakers pointed out that chemical fertilisers are increasing the acidity of soils in mountainous areas, putting many farmers on a downward spiral as far as crop yields are concerned. This was leading to a growing interest among Nepali farmers in organic methods such as intercropping, the use of green manures, planting trees and crops on the same land and the integration of crops and livestock.</p>

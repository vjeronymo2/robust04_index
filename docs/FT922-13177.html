			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / World Trade News: Brussels sets steel duties The European Commission is imposing provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of alloy engineering steel billets from Brazil and Turkey, it said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. The duties, equal to 16 per cent on imports from Turkey and 15 per cent on Brazilian steel, were imposed after an investigation following a complaint from the EC steel industry. EC governments have four months to decide whether to make the duties permanent. Producers said imports had increased sevenfold, their market share rising to 7.8 per cent in 1989 from 1.2 per cent in 1985.</p>

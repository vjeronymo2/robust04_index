			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries go through the roof as Fed cuts interest rates US TREASURY prices rocketed yesterday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in response to an extremely poor set of June employment figures. When the market closed early in mid-afternoon for the approaching July 4 weekend holiday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 13/32 at 104 9/32 , yielding 7.626 per cent. The two-year note was also sharply higher, up  15/32 at 100 13/16 to carry a yield of 4.552 per cent. Prices rose sharply soon after 8.30am, when the Labor Department announced that the civilian unemployment rate rose from 7.5 per cent in May to 7.8 per cent in June, the highest level since 1984, and that non-farm payrolls fell by 117,000. Forecasts had centred on a rise in payrolls and little change in the jobless rate, and analysts described the figures as terrible. It was no surprise, therefore, when soon after the data was released the Fed announced it was cutting the discount rate from 3.5 per cent to 3 per cent. Then, at 11.30am, the central bank lowered its target rate for Fed funds from 3 3/4 per cent to 3 1/4 per cent by engineering a big round of system repurchase agreements in the credit markets. Although the markets had been expecting a Fed ease all week, the unemployment figures really shocked investors, and contributed more to the price rises than the interest rate reduction. UK government bond prices surged by more than half a point yesterday due to the combination of a stronger pound and the US Treasury bond rally. The 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 climbed from 116 31/32 to 117 9/16 , while the most recent auction stock, the 9 per cent gilt due 2012, rose from 36 1/32 to 36 23/32 as dealers reported further buying interest at the long end of the yield curve. 'Talk of further company growth downgrades is helping to enhance the attractiveness of the gilt market over equities right now,' said one dealer. Traders suggested the Bank of England may announce further issuance in the form of tap stocks today if the gilt market remains firm. EUROPEAN government bond markets jumped on news of the 0.5 percentage point cut in the US discount rate and the US Treasury bond rally. German government bonds, which had started the day on a dull note, showed a strong rally in the afternoon. The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 87.86, reached a high of 88.16 after the US interest rate cut, but ended the day at around 88.14. The market had expected to hear further news on the question of a withholding tax on interest income yesterday, but a group of parliamentarians failed to reach a compromise on the proposed 25 per cent tax. The meetings are due to continue next week. The government's proposed tax package would require banks to withhold 25 per cent of the interest payments on bonds and other investments. French government bonds also picked up on the US news, but traders said the market's gains were held back by yesterday's auction. A total of FFr5.75bn of 10-year bonds was sold at an average yield of 8.77 per cent, a total of FFr4.21bn of the bonds due 2023. On the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the September bond futures contract closed at 107.66, up from 107.34 on Wednesday. THE Italian government bond market suffered another turbulent day as devaluation worries persisted, but the rise in the US market helped to lift Italian bond prices in the afternoon. The futures contract, which opened at around 95.00, fell to a low of 94.15, but recovered some of the losses and traded at 94.73 by late afternoon. JAPANESE government bonds rallied in London trading as the US Federal Reserve's decision to cut the official discount rate by a half point yesterday raised hopes that the Bank of Japan may soon follow suit. The government bond market rose in Tokyo trading on hopes of an easing in the US, although heavy profit-taking by investors later in the session wiped out the gains. The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue opened at 5.22 per cent and moved to 5.21 per cent before closing at 5.25 per cent in Tokyo. However, once news emerged in London that the US discount rate had been cut from 3.5 per cent to 3.0 per cent, Japanese government bonds rallied again and the yield on the No 129 moved to 5.18 per cent. Dealers said market expectations of a cut in Japanese interest rates ahead of the G-7 meeting next week are strong, despite warnings from Finance Ministry officials that a cut in US rates may not have an immediate influence on Japanese monetary policy. Separately, the Finance Ministry accepted bids of Y373bn in its sale of 20-year bonds with a coupon of 5.9 per cent yesterday. Deutsche Terminborse, the German options and futures exchange, will change the specifications on its bund futures contract, allowing bonds issued by the Treuhand privatisation agency to be deliverable into the futures contract. Treuhand, the government-owned institution charged with reorganising and privatising the former East German state-owned assets, has not yet issued any long-term debt but is expected to start borrowing long-term in the international capital markets. Liffe, the London-based futures exchange which also trades a bund contract, has not yet altered its contract specification to allow delivery of Treuhand bonds. However, Liffe said yesterday that it is currently reviewing its March 1993 bundfutures contract specification. Daewoo Group of South Korea plans to set up a joint venture securities house in Hungary by the end of this year, Reuter reports from Seoul. The venture will be capitalised at Dollars 2m and will be South Korea's first securities house in eastern Europe.</p>

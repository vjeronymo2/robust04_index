			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Fuel duty changes raise fears for EU energy plan The Budget may have jeopardised European Union plans to ratify the global warming treaty agreed at last year's Rio Earth Summit, Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, has acknowledged. At the two-day EU environment ministers' meeting beginning today in Brussels, the UK will reaffirm its opposition to a co-ordinated Europe-wide tax on fuels. The steady annual increases in fuel duties announced in the Budget emphasise the UK's determination to go its own way in setting taxes, Mr Yeo said. Proposals for a co-ordinated energy tax, weighted towards high-carbon fuels, have been at the heart of the EU's plans for meeting its commitments under the Rio convention. The EU pledged to bring carbon dioxide emissions, implicated in global warming, back to 1990 levels by 2000. For the EU to ratify the convention, its member countries need to agree a plan for cutting carbon emissions. 'It is inconceivable that the Treasury will change its mind,' Mr Yeo said. The Treasury has opposed a carbon-energy tax because of fears that it would put a heavy burden on industry. 'It will be interesting to see if the EU can find a way through that,' Mr Yeo added. If the meeting fails to agree on a plan to cut carbon emissions, the UK may ratify the Rio treaty on its own, he said. The government has indicated that it might support a 'framework' which allowed countries to adopt a carbon-energy tax if they chose.</p>

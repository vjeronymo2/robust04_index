			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Language training limits BPP's rise A STRONG performance in professional training services helped BPP, the education and training group, increase pre-tax profits by 12 per cent to Pounds 3.34m on sales ahead just 3 per cent at Pounds 24m for the first half of 1993. That compared with profits last time of Pounds 2.97m on turnover of Pounds 23.3m. Mr Richard Price, chairman, said the first half had been held back from being extremely good by losses at Linguarama, the language training business. He was optimistic about prospects for the rest of the group. 'In the last three years we have increased profits each year against a rotten UK recession,' he said. 'We are determined that 1993 will see BPP continue its unbroken record.' Linguarama incurred an operating loss of Pounds 40,000 against profits of Pounds 620,000. Mr Price said he expected it to return a profit for the full year following last year's restructuring. He warned, however, that Linguarama faced a tougher time in continental Europe, where economies were deteriorating further. Professional training, which offers courses in accountancy, law and banking, returned profits of Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 522,000). Mr Price said BPP was beginning to reap the benefits of introducing courses in banking and law within the last 18 months. Publishing recorded a 28 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 1.09m), while academic training showed an Pounds 84,000 rise to Pounds 584,000. Net cash at the end of the period was more than Pounds 10m. The interim dividend is increased from 2.7p to 3p from earnings up 0.4p at 7.6p.</p>

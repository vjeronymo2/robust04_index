			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> It's hard to call Larry Gray's paintings landscapes. They are really skies.  Luminous, misty, sfumato atmospheres all translucent color, with just the hint  of a horizon line running along the bottom of the canvas to help us relate the  swirling Turneresque effects to something in the natural world.  </P> <P> Gray is a superb colorist celebrating nature in the tradition of the Hudson  River School. Paintings here focus on the conflict between industry and  wilderness as seen metaphorically in burning towns and war-scarred landscapes.  In these pictures, more than in the past, the smoke from ruined cities huddled  in the mud rises to color and thicken the sky's clear vastness into an almost  tangible membrane. There is an overwhelming sense of awe to these images, both  in the enormity of the sky and in the potency of the man-made impact. Like  sunsets made vibrant by polluted air, there is a delicate dichotomy in  appreciating their beauty -- a sense of their fatal magnificence. (Karl  Bornstein Gallery, 1658 1/2 10th St., to April 15.) SUVAN GEER  </P></p>

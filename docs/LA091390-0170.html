			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BANNING HIRES PAEZ AS BASKETBALL COACH  </P> <P> Three months after he resigned as a coach and teacher with the Los Angeles  Unified School District, former Cleveland High basketball Coach Marc Paez is  back doing both -- at Banning High.  </P> <P> Paez, 30, who left Cleveland in June after guiding the Cavaliers to a 21-6  record and into the City Section 4-A Division semifinals in his only season as  coach, was hired last week.  </P> <P> Paez, who cited external distractions and the pressure to win at the Reseda  school as a prime reason for resigning, said he does not expect to encounter  similar problems at Banning.  </P> <P> "Obviously, time will tell, but I suspect that it'll be closer to what I hope  to find at the high school level," said Paez, a former assistant coach at St.  Bernard. "I anticipate less off-the-court distractions. It should be closer to  what I think high school basketball is all about."  </P> <P> Paez replaces Gary Cain, who coached the Pilots for four seasons. A Banning  administrator said Cain was forced to resign by the district in order to devote  more time to his job as a counselor in the dropout prevention program.  </P> <P> Paez said he had turned down several offers -- including professional coaching  positions in Ireland and Turkey -- before Banning Principal Augie Herrera  called him last month.  </P> <P> Banning contacted him at the recommendation of City Section Commissioner Hal  Harkness. Herrera had contacted Harkness to discuss possible candidates for the  position.  </P> <P> "From what I know about him and from the endorsements from (Cleveland Principal  Ida Mae Windham), I thought that if somebody of his caliber and character was  available, we should try to keep him around," Harkness said.  </P> <P> Paez said he welcomes the job of building a program that has struggled.  Banning, a perennial City power in football, has fielded .500 basketball teams  in recent years. The Pilots were 11-13 last season.  </P></p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Taylor Nelson expands Taylor Nelson AGB, the largest market research group in the UK, is boosting the 1993 dividend by 50 per cent from 0.3p to 0.45p after lifting pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.17m for the year, writes David Blackwell. This compares with a previous Pounds 994,000, restated for FRS 3. At the operating level profits were up at Pounds 2.93m (Pounds 4.15m). Turnover improved by 18 per cent from Pounds 47.2m to Pounds 55.7m. UK turnover improved to Pounds 53m, representing 20 per cent of the total UK market, which grew by 8 per cent in the year. Earnings per share rose from 0.38p to 1.26p while directors are proposing a final dividend of 0.32p compared with 0.2p. Mr Tony Cowling, chief executive, said that continuous contract business represented about 50 per cent of group turnover. The other half was made up of ad hoc business, which had grown by 11 per cent in the year. The consumer sector, which makes up most of the group's business with turnover of Pounds 30.2m, had a mixed year as clients cut their budgets. However, retailers had started to spend more on research, and this in turn had attracted business from City analysts. Orders for ad hoc research in the healthcare sector, with a total turnover of Pounds 8.7m, were up by 35 per cent as domestic pressures forced UK and US pharmaceutical companies to address wider markets. The business services sector also improved, but the media and television research markets suffered from the concentration of ownership.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The Serbian regime continues to  concoct new trumped-up trials against Albanians. Meanwhile, the  pursuit of Kosovar youths with the aim of forcefully sending  them to the army of the Serbian aggressor do not cease. Mehmet  Haziri reports from Prishtina:    [Haziri] The Serbs installed in the Prishtina District Court  filed a suit against a group of Albanians who had allegedly  received out special training in Albania during 1992-93.  According to the articles published today by the Serbian  newspapers JEDINSTVO and BORBA, this group is made up of Femil  Estrani, Shkelzen Bajrami, Nexhmedin Sabriu, Lul Heti, Beqir  Muleti, Hysni Oranca, and Bajram Galapeni, inhabitants of the  communes of Gllogovc, Shtime, Istog, Ferizaj, and Lipjan. They  are accused of having allegedly prepared, in collaboration with  several other persons, the violent secession of Kosova [Kosovo]  and other areas in former Yugoslavia that are inhabited by  Albanians in order to form an independent state or to annex it  to Albania.    The indictment also stresses that this group of Albanians,  on  the initiative, as it is claimed, of the illegal government of  the Republic of Kosova and even of its prime minister, Dr. Bujar  Bukoshi, had allegedly taken part in a special intelligence and  military training in Lac and Labinot near Elbasan.    The fabrications by the Serb Investigation Office and Court  also stress that wearing the uniform of the Albanian Army, these  youths from Kosova, after taking the oath, had allegedly been  trained to use all kinds of arms and explosives, as well as to  utilize all the military skills to carry out, as asserted,  diversionist and terroristic acts.    The Serbian mass media state that all the members of this  group had nick-names and acted in full conspiracy. The  trumped-up trials of Albanians on charges of having received  military training in Albania have recently been held in Gjilan,  Peje, and in several other centers of the republic of Kosova.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE STOCK index futures sector finally boiled over yesterday, at least for a while, and a hurried shrinking of the premium on the March FT-SE contract brought some rapid footwork in the stock market by leading securities firms, writes our markets staff. The March contract opened firmly, showing a premium of about 26 points compared with an estimated 22-point premium on fair value, the calculation which allows for financing and dividend flows. Sellers quickly appeared, as London traders noted the fall in Tokyo, and the future came back smartly, driving the stock market down. By midsession the March contract was close to fair value, and a few buyers appeared again. This was the pattern for most of the session, until in the final minutes of stock market trading the March contract advanced again, taking share prices with it. Traders doubted whether the premium could avoid further selling this morning. In traded options, business was reduced and only 18,384 contracts traded, compared with 24,779 on Friday. The FT-SE contract remained busy, however, recording 4,832 deals against 4,988. British Airways topped the active stocks list with 1,779 contracts traded.</p>

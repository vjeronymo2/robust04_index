			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dino Vaiano: "The Second Republic Is Born With </F> an Austerity Finance Bill -- Ministers on a Strict Diet"]    [Text] Rome -- The Second Republic's finance bill is taking  its first steps. With a strict diet for ministers who, next  year, must keep their budgets riveted to 1994 levels. Entities  such as the Post Office and the Railways will be able to cover  "further demands" only through price and tariff increases. The  basic objective is to ensure a stable relationship between  public indebtedness and GDP until 1995. The outlines of the  next three years' austerity program are contained in a circular  which has just been completed by the Treasury Minister, setting  out strict criteria for preparing budget forecasts for 1994 and  for the 1995-97 three-year period. The document issued by the  State Audit Office also anticipates certain alarming figures  with regard to this year's government accounts: "The latest  development of the main indicators leads us to believe that it  will not be easy to achieve the forecasts of economic growth  previously formulated for the present year.    ``The reduction in the average rate of inflation from the  4.2  percent achieved in 1993 to the 3.5 percent figure programmed  for 1994 could prove problematic. Problems are also possible  relating to the impact on domestic prices of the monetary  devaluation. The recent impressive fall in interest rates could  well flatten out and even come to a halt.''    It will be up to the quarterly cash report to set out, in  the  coming weeks, the official government forecasts on public  finances. It is unlikely to depart substantially from the figure  of a 15 trillion lira deficit put forward by the Monetary Fund,  which has scaled down the growth of our economy to a rate of 1.1  percent. The Treasury warns: "The restrictive approach taken  in recent years to budget forecasts must be maintained." There  are no short cuts. The Audit Office indicates as a reference  point the objectives set out in the monitoring procedure agreed  to with the European Union. Under attack are the acquisition of  goods and services, investments, and transfers to decentralized  entities. The watchword for the next maneuver will be "nominal  nonvariance." Expenditure on goods and services may not be  higher than those of 1994, and with an expansion of no more than  2 percent in 1996 and 1.5 percent in 1997. The Audit Office is  assuming that a hatchet will be taken to amounts earmarked for  studies, inquiries, reports, committees, commissions, special  assignments, and publicity, in order to "arrive at their  elimination or at least to a significant scaling down." The  strictures will also apply to defense: "It is necessary to  proceed to redefine the various plans and projects, taking  account of the changing international context and the coming  into operation of the new defense model, with a concomitant  postponement of expenditures for modernization and development,  compatible with the implementation of the new programs."    But ministers' slimming cure will not be enough. The next  finance bill will also have to "freeze," for three years, at  1994 levels, the special funds for new legislative provisions.  On its last page the circular fixes the broad lines for the  three-year maneuver: For tax income one can assume a nominal  GDP growth on the order of 4.5 to 5.0 percent in 1995 and 4.0 to  4.5 percent in 1996 and 1997. Current 1995 expenses will have  to be contained within the levels set by the 1994 adjusted  budget, while expenditure on personnel and the acquisition of  goods and services essential for the operation of government may  not grow by more than 2.0 percent in 1996 and 1.5 percent in  1997. Investments over the three-year period may not grow by  more than 2.5 percent, 2.0 percent and 1.5 percent respectively.</p>

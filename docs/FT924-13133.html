			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Mercedes trebles purchases of British parts MERCEDES-BENZ, the German car manufacturer, says sterling is undervalued and the British economy underrated. The company nearly trebled its purchases of UK-produced motor components last year and expects them to grow further. Two other German companies, BMW and the Volkswagen/Audi group - now embracing SEAT of Spain and Skoda of Czechoslovakia - are also expanding their purchasing of components made in the UK and say they, too, expect further growth. All three say this growth would take place even without the devaluation of sterling following its withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism last month. Any beneficial effects from the devaluation are, in any case, unlikely to show up for several years because of the long lead times involved in granting supplier contracts for new vehicles. What amounts to a minor vote of confidence by the German vehicle industry in the UK components sector comes during a week in which Lucas Industries, one of the UK's biggest aerospace and motor components groups, has announced 4,000 job losses and sharply reduced profits. But in spite of poor UK car sales and weakening continental car markets, Lucas profits from motor components were virtually unchanged from 1990. Mercedes-Benz raised its purchases of UK-produced components last year to Pounds 72m from an annual average of around Pounds 25m. Purchases outside the automotive sector by Mercedes' sister companies, AEG and Deutsche Aerospace, lifted last year's total to about Pounds 310m. This increase pre-dates sterling's devaluation against the D-Mark and is thanks to significant quality and efficiency improvements by the UK components industry, according to Mr Hans Tauscher, managing director of Mercedes-Benz (UK). 'British industry is showing itself well able to deliver the goods at competitive prices,' he said. Mercedes, BMW and Volkswagen have each set up a full-time purchasing office in the UK. Volkswagen/Audi, Europe's biggest vehicle maker, also expects increased component orders. Mr Werner Svetlik, VW management board director with responsibility for purchasing, has told UK component companies that they have the opportunity to increase sharply the Pounds 86m-worth of parts they supplied to the German company last year. BMW, the most conservative of the German carmakers in terms of UK component purchases, is increasing its spending, albeit from a very small base. From DM25m in 1988 it is increasing to an expected DM95m (Pounds 39m) this year, and is forecast to rise to DM120m next year. Lucas Industries is one of the beneficiaries, having just won some of the engine fuel-injector business BMW once reserved exclusively for Robert Bosch, the German engineering group. Mercedes-Benz, like other German carmakers, acknowledges it is benefiting from the UK industry's growing ties with Nissan, Toyota and Honda plants. Meeting Japanese criteria for cost and quality is understood to have increased UK competitiveness.</p>

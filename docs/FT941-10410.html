			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: NFU warned against protectionism The European farming industry must abandon protectionism against agricultural imports from eastern Europe, Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, said yesterday. Sir Leon, addressing the annual meeting of the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales, said relations with eastern Europe were one of the most important issues facing agriculture in the EU in the next few years. He warned of 'disastrous consequences' if the EU failed to help its east European neighbours to make a peaceful transition to mature democracy and stability. 'In the longer term, it is likely that parts of central and eastern Europe will be able to benefit from exporting onto the world market without subsidy, because they have the potential to be tremendously efficient,' he said. 'This is a prospect which has to be confronted with courage and generosity, not with fear and protectionism.' Concern about an influx of cheap imports from eastern Europe has maintained restrictions on farm products in the association agreements which give preferential trade treatment to Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak republics, Romania and Bulgaria. The UK soft fruit sector is currently worried about Polish imports of fruit pulp for processing. Mr David Hadley, a senior agriculture ministry official at the meeting, admitted certain sectors faced problems but said EU trade concessions to eastern Europe were 'pretty small'. Sir Leon, speaking by video because he was detained in Brussels by the foreign ministers' meeting, said Poland, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria depended heavily on agriculture. But these sectors were undergoing upheaval. 'Production levels have fallen, privatisation is changing the size of holdings and the type of farming which is practised, previous markets and distribution networks have disappeared,' he said. The EU must help efficient restructuring by offering expertise and funds and by gradually increasing market access and refraining from harmful practices. 'For example, we need to look carefully at our system of export refunds,' said Sir Leon. 'We have recently ended refunds on apple exports to the Czech and Slovak Republics because our exports were causing serious problems for local apple producers.' Sir Leon sought to reassure EU farmers that the Gatt deal would allow common agricultural policy support to continue unchallenged for nine years, thanks to the 'peace clause' agreed between the US and the EU. But he said one of the main aims of future direct aid to farmers must be to protect the environment.</p>

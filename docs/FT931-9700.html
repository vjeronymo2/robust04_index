			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Cheque tax protest in Brazil: Business and unions united against proposal THE powerful business community and trade unions of Sao Paulo state, Brazil's industrial hub, yesterday began a campaign against a new tax that is central to the government's fiscal reform. The government hopes to raise the equivalent of Pounds 4.6bn through the controversial 0.25 per cent tax on cheques, recently approved by the House of Representatives and due to be voted on next Thursday by the Senate. The honeymoon that President Itamar Franco has enjoyed since he took office in December ended yesterday when some 50 leading business and union organisations, with the mayor of Sao Paulo city, participated in a rally to call for a nationwide protest movement. Demanding that the government sort out its finances and crack down on evasion, rather than increase taxes, the protestors called on the Senate to vote against the cheque tax and warned that it could result in price increases of as much as 50 per cent. Mr Carlos Eduardo Moreira, head of the Sao Paulo industries federation, said: 'The new tax will not help anybody. It's time we did away with these blood-sucking measures by Braslia that bring no benefits for society,' The Sao Paulo rebellion is likely to have a considerable impact on the Senate and comes as a blow for Mr Franco. The new tax is the main plank of government strategy to plug a Dollars 13bn hole in the budget this year and is seen as vital for a new Brazilian accord with the International Monetary Fund. Mr Franco said yesterday: 'I respect the right of anyone to demonstrate against anything, including the tax. But I hope these businessmen will also respect the right of society to protest against the high cost of living caused by their outrageous prices.'</p>

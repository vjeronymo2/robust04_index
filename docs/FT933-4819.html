			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / France demands changes to farm trade agreement FRANCE made official its long-standing threat to block a deal on farm trade between the US and the EC when the government of Mr Edouard Balladur yesterday formally demanded modifications to the Blair House agreement. The agreement was reached last November in a paper sent to the European Commission and Germany. It was not clear if the demands would require a reopening of the accord. The only alternative to these 'modifications' is a blanket rejection of any restraint on the volume of subsidised food exports, the French government stated in the paper. France's determination puts at risk the possibility of concluding the Uruguay Round world trade negotiations by their mid-December deadline. Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is expected to tell Mr Balladur of this risk tomorrow. At a separate meeting, Mr Rene Steichen, the EC agriculture commissioner, is expected to tell Mr Sutherland that Brussels - which negotiates trade agreements on the EC's behalf - is determined to avoid reopening Blair House. The French paper complains that the accord's provision for a 21 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised food exports over six years 'responds to a logic of administered trade'. Cuts should be limited to the amount of subsidy paid out. Blair House foresees cuts of 36 per cent in total export subsidies. Under last year's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, the EC should comfortably exceed this. Paris is still contesting the Commission's assertion that the Blair House accord is compatible with CAP reform. Brussels says reform will cut the exportable surplus of cereals - the most inflammatory part of the accord for France - to 19m tonnes after three years. In its paper, France claims the surplus will be 15m tonnes above this after six years. It claims Gatt commitments will require a further overhaul of EC beef regime, which CAP reform, by general consent, does not do enough to bring into balance. The Commission is now trying to come up with a formula which addresses the concerns before the September 20 special council of foreign and agriculture ministers. On course for recovery, Page 3</p>

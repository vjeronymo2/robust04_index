			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON ART MUSEUM FUNDING  </P> <P> Re: "Architectural Design on a User-Friendly Scale," Jan. 10.  </P> <P> It came as quite a surprise to read in Leon Whiteson's otherwise informative  review of an exhibition at the Gallery of Functional Art that the Santa Monica  Museum of Art is a "privately funded" institution. Quite the contrary.  </P> <P> The museum is a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization dependent upon public  support. We are wholly supported by contributions from our membership and board  of trustees, and through grants from governmental agencies, corporations and  charitable foundations. A great many individuals have generously lent their  time, expertise and money to making the museum a reality. It is this collective  effort and public good will that supports the Santa Monica Museum of Art.  </P> <P> THOMAS RHOADS  </P> <P> Director  </P> <P> Santa Monica Museum of Art  </P></p>

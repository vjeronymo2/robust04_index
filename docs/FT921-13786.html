			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Harare rules out land appeals to High Court ZIMBABWE'S commercial farmers, facing compulsory land acquisition by government, have been told they will have no right of appeal to the High Court over compensation. The latest draft of the Land Acquisition Bill, which sets out government proposals, may be opposed by western donors who are likely to tie future aid pledges to a demand that farmers be allowed recourse to the court should they believe compensation to be inadequate. The government is expected, at a meeting scheduled for mid-February in Paris, to seek aid pledges of USDollars 1bn (Pounds 571m) required to see it through the next two years of its economic structural adjustment programme. The draft provides for a six-man compensation committee, chaired by the permanent secretary for agriculture, which will decide how much to pay a farmer whose land is being ac-quired. The draft also provides for appeal to the Administrative Court, but this will not have the authority to set aside the committee's decisions, unless the committee has failed to observe the principles laid down in the bill or has awarded excessive compensation. President Robert Mugabe has promised the bill will come before parliament during its next session, opening towards the end of February. There has been no official comment from the Commercial Farmers Union, but individual farmers who have seen the draft say it is 'as bad, if not worse,' than the original. Ten years ago the government committed itself to resettling 162,000 families by 1985; to date it has relocated fewer than 60,000, and even the government-owned media have described some resettlement schemes as a failure. Farmers are particularly upset at the reported existence of maps targeting farms to be acquired, including some prime tobacco growing areas. Tobacco is the country's leading export, worth more than USDollars 500m last year. Compulsory land acquisition is politically popular with the black majority. Political analysts believe Mr Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party sees the land bill as its best hope of recapturing grassroots support, which has crumbled over the last year.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Greenpeace in Thorp challenge GREENPEACE, the environmental pressure group, will today challenge the government's recent decision to allow radioactive testing at the Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria. It will ask for a judicial review, on the grounds that allowing testing to go ahead prejudices the eventual government decision on whether to grant the plant a licence.</p>

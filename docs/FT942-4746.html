			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Tricky timing in the alternative markets Commodity market fever has cooled off slightly in the past few days, but portfolio strategists are still tempted to dabble in real assets. As for equities, commodity-related sectors such as oils and mineral extraction are among the few showing gains (albeit modest) in the London stock market since the beginning of this year. Gold mining stocks, though, have been having an indifferent time. With commodities, of course, you have to pick your moment. In general they have been rotten investments over the long run, with a steady fall in real values stretching over the whole century, and particularly in the 1980s - although there have been spectacular upsurges from the trend, such as during the Korean War and the inflationary scares of the 1970s. There are one or two exceptions, such as timber, which has been sustaining a fairly rapid real rate of increase - of close to 5 per cent a year in some cases, according to a recent World Bank study. Nevertheless the general trend is downwards, probably reflecting consistent declines in costs of production and transport, both for agricultural and mineral commodities. The point, however, is that in cyclical terms the time for commodities to shine ought to be just about now. Last March Mr Sushil Wadwhani, of Goldman Sachs, noted that the year after the US Federal Reserve begins to raise short-term interest rates tends to be a strong period for commodity prices. Since the 1970s such 12-month periods have produced average price rises of about 15 per cent, depending on the index used, while equities and (especially) bonds have struggled. It might seem odd that commodity prices should rise when the carrying cost has just been increased, but of course there are much more powerful influences involved. Inflationary fears that may have stimulated the interest rate rise are negative for bonds but positive for commodity prices. Stronger economic growth is likely to be affecting the supply-demand balance. Moreover the transfer of speculative activity from the securities markets to commodities in search of richer pickings will itself tend to push up prices for a while. At any rate, the pattern appears to be repeating itself. Many commodity prices have been quite firm this year. The indices vary considerably, but the Economist index is up 17 per cent while Goldman's own index is up a more modest 7 per cent. Curiously the CRB Futures Index, which so terrifies the US Treasury bond market when it strengthens, is scarcely changed on balance, after retreating from a late May peak. Such rises are entirely in accordance with the historical cyclical patterns, and do not imply any general rise in the rate of inflation globally. It is notable, for instance, that gold has played little part in the recent revival of the commodities markets. Gold had its own speculative run a year ago, when it reached Dollars 405 an ounce before the Soros/Goldsmith bubble burst. This year it has been trading quietly about Dollars 15 either side of the current Dollars 380. Some strange things may nevertheless have been going on in the gold market, where a tumble in the gold lease rate signifies structural changes - perhaps heavy central bank selling absorbed by speculative buyers. However, the real targets for commodity speculators have been the metals and soft commodities which have been selling at below average production costs and are best placed to benefit from cyclical recovery. Some of the rises in 1994 so far have been quite sharp - including 23 per cent on North Sea crude oil, 26 per cent on copper and 70 per cent on coffee. But the markets have been dangerously flooded with speculative money, much of it diverted from bonds after the spectacular end of last year's bull market. Commodity markets can therefore be seen as reflecting the flipside of bond market sentiment: if it becomes generally accepted by the markets that the US economy is slowing down and inflation will stay reasonably low the money could flow straight back. So although the cyclical case for commodities remains valid, certainly if economic recovery kicks in later this year in continental Europe and Japan, the ride is not likely to be at all smooth. There is no easy alternative to the securities markets.</p>

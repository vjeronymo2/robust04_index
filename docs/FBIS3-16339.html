The project equally meets Turkey's and Ukraine's interests,  as allowing both nations to maximally diversify their petroleum  supply sources, and boost their prestige and economic influence  on the European continent.    Considering the project's political and economic  significance  Presidents Kravchuk of Ukraine and Demirel of Turkey gave it the  green light at its early drafting stage and pledged their  personal support for it.    The merger project and its Turkish construction part were  drafted by the Kiev-based Yugnipronefteprovod research  institute. According to its experts, the project's pipe-line  tracing, number of ramifications may be increased or altered,  depending on the number of parties, which might be interested in  its implementation. As tentative estimates suggest, the  original version may cost 2,750 million U.S. dollars.    The existent and under construction facilities of the  transshipment terminal nearby Odessa (the Yuzhny port), which  are supposed to be able to handle 40 million tons of petroleum a  year, will allow Ukraine to not only fully meet its domestic  petroleum requirements, including those of its oil refineries,  but also pipe large amounts of crude petroleum to nations in  East, Central and West Europe, which are, same as Ukraine,  dependent on Russian fuel exports.    Thus, this major alternative petroleum supply source is  expected to lessen Ukraine's dependence on Russia both  economically and politically.    On March 11 President Kravchuk met in Kiev with Vetad  Birlik,  Turkish President Demirel's personal envoy and C.E.O. of the  Birkan firm.    The Turkish official stressed the Turkish pipe-line  project's  significance, while discussing bilateral business relations  between the two Pontic nations, as well the importance of the  two national pipe-line systems' merger.    As Mr. Berlik disclosed, negotiations are underway aimed at  establishment of a Ukrainian-Turkish joint venture, which will  undertake the major pipe-line construction project. According  to Mr. Berlik, the Turkish party intends to maximally rely on  the Ukrainian experts' experience in laying pipe-lines  (Ukrainian research and construction institutions used to take  part in pipe- line construction across the former USSR and in  many foreign countries).    In January, 1994 a Ukrainian delegation met with Turkish  President Demirel, and a tentative agreement was reached on  cooperation and the President's personal support for the project.    As Mr. Berlik further disclosed, Turkey has concluded an  agreement with Iraq on future petroleum supplies for piping  petroleum, extracted in the Middle East, to Ukraine and other  nations in Europe. Eventually, other oil extracting nations may  join the project, primarily Iran, as petroleum exporters.    As the project's architects believe, their brainchild may  attract many OPEC nations by its much simpler route for oil  piping, in particular, those of them, who cannot reach an  agreement among themselves, with European oil producers and with  Russia on export quotas, all of which, taken together, may  greatly contribute to the trend to lower petroleum prices on the  petroleum and petroleum products.</p>

In a statement to AL-WASAT, he  said: "No one party should ask the other to be more  understanding because we are in the same boat and are facing the  same circumstances and difficulties."    Al-'Anani added: "We believe there must be coordination with  our Palestinian brothers prior to any agreement with the  Israelis, but the brothers in the PLO seem to have another  concept. Each side has its own identity and aspirations that do  not conflict with one another. We should not allow pressures to  have a negative effect on our relations. Coordination is  necessary at this stage and is required for sound negotiations.  Commonality of interests and the requirements of successful  negotiations make us demand coordination which, we believe, has  no alternative." He added: "All this does not mean  estrangement. Jordan believes that postponement of coordination  will not serve any side."    Al-'Anani revealed that Jordan and the PLO have reached many  agreements on trade, investment, citizens' travel, free zones,  transit, movement in the Arab region, security, borders, and  water. These agreements have not been signed.    Asked about opening branches for Jordanian banks in the  occupied West Bank, the Jordanian information minister said that  this step would not have been discussed with the Israeli side if  it had not already been discussed with the Palestinian side. It  was one of the agreements we reached with the PLO. He denounced  reports that Jordan decided to exploit the current opportunity  to reopen the banks.    Replying to another question, the information minister said  that the issue of establishing a Palestinian monetary authority  still seems to be a possibility. Our negotiations with the  Palestinians do not conflict with that possibility, and, if  realized, we will hold further negotiations.    It is noteworthy that Dr. Jawad al-'Anani was one of the  prominent members of the Jordanian negotiating delegation. He  is also a well-known economist and held the position of trade  and industry minister in 1984 and 1985.    It is also worth mentioning that Jordanian officials feel  that the PLO wants to put off the signing of the economic  agreement with Jordan until the PLO's leadership returns to  Jericho.</p>

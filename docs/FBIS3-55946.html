			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dmitriy Vasilyev, deputy chairman of the </F> State Committee for the Management of State Property, by A.  Yevgenev under the "Privatization Program" rubric; date, place  not given: "Voucher To Last Another Six Months"]    [Text] The state program for the privatization of state  and municipal enterprises in the Russian Federation (see  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA No. 1, 1994) can without any exaggeration be  called a document long in the making. For various reasons,  including political factors, work on it went on for 13 months.  We asked Dmitriy Vasilyev, deputy chairman of the State  Committee for the Management of State Property  [Goskomimushchestvo], to comment on its most important  provisions:    [Vasilyev] The program's main task is to create the  conditions for the completion of check privatization. At the  same time we have tried to take account of the lessons of the  previous stage -- for instance, we have introduced a section  entitled "Regional Peculiarities of Privatization." That is why  the Far North, for instance, is seen as an autonomous region.  The leaders of certain regions where a great deal has been  accomplished have taken offense: Don't protect us like  children, they say, give us more autonomy; and we have met them  halfway. Quite another scheme is adopted in oblasts such as  Magadan and Chita, which are close to becoming a socioeconomic  disaster zone. Of course, here it is not a matter of generating  revenue from privatization: The main thing is to ensure  employment among the population. A whole section extends the  regions' rights in the following direction also: They will  themselves resolve whether facilities of one scale or another --  for instance, a city's engineering infrastructure -- should be  privatized or not and, if so, how.    The list of facilities whose privatization is forbidden has  been increased. In point of fact we did not touch on these  facilities earlier either, but now we have confirmed this  documentarily. Well, indeed, what reason is there to privatize,  say, the maritime transport rescue service? Its work cannot be  based on commercial principles.    But at the same time the register of organizations subject  to  compulsory privatization has also grown. It includes not only  hotel complexes and motels, camp sites, boarding houses, and  housing and utilities, but also debtor enterprises in all  sectors. In other words, if you work badly and make losses, seek  new managers through transforming the forms of ownership; change  the system of management itself, and your hierarchical system.    I hope that the position of those who up to the present time  have been leasing premises not intended for habitation will  become more definite. To this day they have been, as it were,  living out of suitcases: And suddenly, on the expiry of their  lease term they are asked to leave their cosy nest and sell the  square meters to someone else, to say nothing of such  inconveniences as the impossibility of obtaining credit on  security. Now there is complete clarity in this area: If you  have bought an enterprise at a competition or auction, you have  the right to acquire also the premises that you were renting  before. In the upshot, small-scale privatization will probably  become more attractive.    At long last order has been introduced with respect to the  bloc of shares guaranteed to the state. All this used to be  done arbitrarily, by eye. The program's drafters proceeded on  the basis that the block, strictly defined in size, should  correspond to this or that state interest. If the state sets  itself the goal of keeping absolute control over an enterprise,  it should own 51 percent of the shares (more than that is not  necessary; the rest can be sold); if it aims at keeping partial  control (which enables it to prevent a change in the joint-stock  company's charter), it should be granted 25.5 percent of the  shares.    Like the previous program, the present program contains  three varieties of perquisites for the employees of privatized  enterprises. The first two have not undergone noticeable  changes, but the third has been geared toward the forthcoming  wave of bankruptcies. People assuming obligations not to allow  the ruin of an enterprise receive the right to 20-30 percent of  its incorporation capital. They put down a deposit of 200  minimum salaries, which is forfeit in the event of failure.  Already today the new-fledged property class is selling cars and  apartments in order to be come major owners of industrial  property and, with the rights of private owners, to dispose of  enterprises in such a way as to rescue them from collapse. The  scale here is not limited -- it can be a chocolate factory, or  the Likhachev Automobile Plant.    Investment competitions will be held in a new way. Formerly,  participants in these competitions swamped those attending with  the most diverse and tempting programs, including foreign  programs -- take your pick of which is the idee fixe, and which  is the goose that lays the golden eggs. Henceforth there will  be the following criterion: massive investments in the minimum  time. And the need to contribute real money to the coffers of  the enterprise directly after the auctions.    It is well known that at present incompleted construction  projects are sold with great reluctance. The owner dies, but  does not give way -- it's mine! Here the following rule is  introduced: In the process of privatization an uncompleted  facility is removed from the enterprise's assets and goes under  the hammer. Moreover, this is profitable to everyone: The  owner receives half the proceeds, and the committee for the  administration of property and the corresponding fund share the  rest between them. In our view, this incentive should be  effective.    Protection for shareholders has been devised. Should one of  them conceive a desire to sell his shares, he will pay no tax.  In addition, no one has the right, without the knowledge of  Goskomimuchestvo, to dispose of an enterprise's property until  it has become private. Even before there were a lot of people  wishing to sell goods on the quiet, while reorganization was  underway.    Restrictions have been imposed on the creation of holding  companies. Knowing our old love of changing the landmarks and  raking in the cash, we have written into the program that no  holding can have more than 10 percent of the shares in any  joint-stock company.    At the same time the purchase of shares by commercial banks  is restricted. The ruination of enterprises inevitably rebounds  on banks, and therefore, on their investors. A chain reaction.  We could become witness to what happened during the Great  Depression in the United States.    I want to bring cheer to the check investment funds: They  are exempt from dual taxation. Undoubtedly, their influence on  the affairs of an enterprise will also increase: Whereas before  the fund could acquire no more than 10 percent of the shares of  one entity, now it can acquire up to 25 percent.    And one more detail that is of no little importance: There  are strong and weak check funds. We have permitted the strong  funds to buy up the shares of the weak funds. This has been  done once again to prevent the bankruptcy of weaklings and, in  the final analysis, to protect the interests of shareholders.    Shareholders are also to have a greater say. It is  established that only with the agreement of three-fourths of the  members of a joint-stock company can the charter of a  joint-stock company be changed, a large part of its capital  handed over, or a decision on participation in holding companies  be made. Cumulative voting is introduced, enabling a minority  to be represented on the council of directors. A mechanism has  been elaborated for holding assemblies of the joint-stock  society.    Let me say directly that it is not so easy to implement  everything that is projected. Hence a system of "sticks and  carrots" has been devised. Financial resources will be  allocated to regions taking account of fulfillment of the State  Privatization program. The stakes are high. But the problem  for the country is also not inconsiderable.    Increasing interest is being shown abroad in our  privatization program. In principle this is no bad thing. But  will Russian property not end up in the hands of "their" mafia?  Especially the juiciest morsels: the defense complex, precious  metals, oil, and gas. We therefore think the following system  crucial: At the end of a competition or auction the  organizations are to send the Federal Counterintelligence  Service information on the winners in these auctions, and the  Federal Counterintelligence Service is to gather all the  necessary information within one month and present its  conclusion to the government. And the government will issue the  final verdict.</p>

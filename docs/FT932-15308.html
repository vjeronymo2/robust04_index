			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Berlusconi plans publishing float FININVEST, the privately-owned media and financial services group of Italy's Mr Silvio Berlusconi, is poised to raise cash by merging and floating its main publishing activities. The scheme, which has to be given a formal go-ahead by Mr Berlusconi, involves merging Silvio Berlusconi Editore, Fininvest's magazine publishing and industrial printing business, with Mondadori, Italy's biggest publisher, which Fininvest controls. Shares in the amalgamated unit, which would have annual sales of about L2,000bn (Pounds 839m), would be offered to domestic and international investors, with Fininvest retaining 51 per cent. The proceeds would be used to bring down the group's debts, officially about L3,000bn, although some bankers put the total higher. 'We are looking seriously at these hypotheses, but no final decision has been made,' said a Fininvest spokesman. Last week SBE bought 20 per cent of Mondadori's ordinary shares from the Fininvest parent company. No price for the intra-group transaction was disclosed. However, the transfer has been seen as a first step to the merger between the two publishing operations later this year. Goldman Sachs and Banca Commerciale Italiana have been appointed to advise on the deal. However, bankers note that Mr Berlusconi, on whom the ultimate decision rests, has not yet fully committed himself to go ahead. Two years ago, the widely-expected flotation of Fininvest's Silvio Berlusconi Communications film subsidiary was shelved because of opposition from Mr Berlusconi. However, bankers believe a cash-raising exercise is much more likely now in view of the greater financial pressures on his group. The merger of SBE with Mondadori is likely to come through a reverse takeover, which would precede placing a large proportion of the shares in the combined unit. SBE is best known for publishing Italy's biggest-selling magazine, 'TV Sorrisi e Canzoni'. The company made net profits of L29.7bn on sales of L320bn in 1992. Mondadori is Italy's biggest book publisher, and also has sizeable magazine interests. Sales amounted to L1,600bn last year. Bankers believe up to 40 per cent of the shares could be placed with foreign investors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours Newscast"] </F>   [Text] There are more statements by Prosecutor General de  Greiff, who was unruffled by the U.S. announcement of a possible  suspension of judicial cooperation with Colombia.    Although the Governments of the United States and Colombia  have not made official the suspension of aid or the exchange of  judicial evidence, the prosecutor general noted that if the  warning is carried out his office will continue to try the  narcotraffickers with the evidence that it gathers.    [Begin recording] [De Greiff] Nobody benefits. Nobody  benefits from a lack of evidence exchange or a lack of  cooperation.    [Unidentified reporter] Who stands to lose the most or what  happens?    [De Greiff] I believe that the United States stands to lose  the most.    [Reporter] Mr. Prosecutor, who do you think is--let us speak  honestly--trying to trip you up?    [De Greiff] Ask the government.    [Reporter] Do you think it is necessary to reform the law on  criminal proceedings again?    [De Greiff] I think that no foreign country has the right to  indicate to another one how to dictate its laws. That is the  mission of the legislators. [end recording]    [Earlier in this same "24 Hours Newscast" Santa Fe de Bogota  Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish at 0000 GMT on 23  March also carries a three-minute report on press agency reports  that the United States may suspend judicial cooperation with  Colombia and U.S. State Department sources claiming there is  very little behind these rumors. Colombian Embassy sources said  that future cooperation is being assessed and "whether material  would be given to the office of Prosecutor General de Greiff in  the future." In a recording, when asked about this issue  Colombian Foreign Minister Neomi Sanin said: "Colombia has a  sovereign and independent policy. It has its own foreign policy  that is respected by all countries of the hemisphere."]</p>

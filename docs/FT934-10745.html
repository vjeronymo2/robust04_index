			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Fujimori scrapes home in Peru poll POPULAR approval on Sunday for Peru's new constitution in an apparently clean poll puts the country back on the democratic track President Alberto Fujimori abandoned on April 5 last year. It gives him the backing he needs to continue with his sweeping programme of economic reform, and will permit him to stand for a second presidential term in 1995. However the government squeezed home by an uncomfortably narrow margin. Counting has yet to be completed, but it is clear earlier predictions of a 70-30 per cent government win were wishful thinking and the margin of victory is likely to end up at around 5 points. The 200-article constitution proved a challenging topic: Mr Fujimori claims Peruvians have given an example to Latin America of popular democracy but the vast majority of voters had little idea of the issues. A yes vote, at least in a view encouraged by Mr Fujimori, demonstrated approval of the government's three-year track record, while a no hinted at an 'unhealthy absence of patriotism.' Yet Mr Fujimori proved incapable of transferring his own popular approval rating - currently around 70 per cent, at least in the metropolitan area - to the constitutional cause. The result underlines the historical divide between Lima and the provinces. Voters in the capital, where a third of the population is now concentrated, were almost 2-1 in favour of the new constitution. But more than half of Peru's 25 departments rejected it. Opposition groups, which include the still unpopular traditional political parties and the debilitated trade unions, immediately claimed the constitution lacked legitimacy. They point to 30 per cent abstentions, similar to the level in last November's constituent congress elections which the major parties boycotted in protest at Mr Fujimori's seizure of increased powers. The business community, however, breathed a sigh of relief. Peru's 12th constitution enshrines the free market policies Mr Fujimori has followed since his election in 1990. It sharply reduces the role of the state, encourages competition and introduces modern work practices. But even if Sunday's vote demonstrates broad support for Mr Fujimori the government would do well to take the substantial protest vote seriously. Many Peruvians want decentralisation and an efficient public administration to promote development and jobs rather than a strong head of state who brings them occasional gifts.</p>

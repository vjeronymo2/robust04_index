			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 10, BNS -- The Estonian Cabinet at its  meeting today ruled to post the newly appointed director general  of the Police Department, Uuno Ellen, also as the acting head of  the Home Guard.    The ruling is aimed at following the recent practice when  the  national police chief simultaneously was the head of the  volunteer law enforcement force.    But Justice Minister Kaido Kama also told reporters today  the  Cabinet had ordered the Interior Ministry to draw up within one  month's time a draft of new Home Guard Statutes or submit to the  government a scheme of changes in the Home Guard organization.    It cannot be considered normal that the head of such kind of  a volunteer-based organization is appointed by the government  Kama said.    The parliament last month adopted a law on noncommissioned  police force.    Home Guard leaders claim the legislation has placed their  organization outside the legal framework.    The currently effective statutes of the Estonian Home Guard  were established under a April 28, 1992 ruling of the  government. The head of the parliamentary legal affairs  commission, Juri Adams, has admitted that the ruling from two  years ago fails to effectively correspond to present-day needs.  Adams has suggested the Home Guard could continue existing as a  non-profit organization or a public service entity.</p>

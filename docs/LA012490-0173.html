			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FELONS, FREEDOM AND FEAR;  </P> <P> PAROLE: RELEASE OF A NOTORIOUS CRIMINAL LIKE CHARLES ROTHENBERG RAISES  COMMUNITY CONCERN -- AND TOUGH QUESTIONS FOR SOCIETY.  </P> <P> On a spring night in 1983, Charles Rothenberg poured kerosene around the bed  where his 6-year-old son David slept in a Buena Park motel. He then lit a match  and fled. Moments later the room exploded into flames; the little boy survived,  but his body was seared with third-degree burns.  </P> <P> After repeated skin grafts, David, now 13, still bears scars on his arms, legs  and face, and his fingers have been amputated to the first joint.  </P> <P> Today, he and his mother, Marie Hafdahl, who has since remarried, will enter  another traumatic phase of their ordeal. After serving 6 1/2 years in prison  for attempted murder, arson and other crimes, Charles Rothenberg, 49, begins a  three-year parole at an undisclosed location.  </P> <P> With his release, Rothenberg joins a small group of criminals whose deeds have  been considered so heinous that they have sent shock waves of revulsion through  the country. When the penal system has attempted to place these ex-offenders in  communities to serve their parole, residents have responded with virulent  protests.  </P> <P> But to what extent is that protest justified? Do the people who live in  communities where these offenders are released need to live in fear? While  crime victims and the townspeople who must receive especially offensive  criminals point to high recidivism rates, experts caution that a person's prior  criminal record and life style are better indicators of the potential for  future crime than an individual act, no matter how heinous.  </P> <P> Criminal psychologists list crimes involving torture, rape and child abuse as  those to which people are likely to respond the most emotionally. In  California, such community reactions have been consistent in a number of  notorious crimes.  </P> <P> * After he raped 15-year-old Mary Vincent, chopped off her forearms and dumped  her in a canyon near Sacramento in 1978, Lawrence Singleton became one of the  state's most reviled criminals. At the end of an eight-year prison term,  Singleton began a celebrated parole odyssey during which prison officials  attempted to place him in 16 Northern California communities. In an exceptional  measure, Gov. George Deukmejian ordered him to serve the 10 remaining months of  his one-year parole on the grounds of San Quentin prison.  </P> <P> * Arthur Jackson, the deranged movie fan who stabbed Theresa Saldana 10 times  outside her West Hollywood apartment in 1982, aroused fear and widespread  protest when he was scheduled for parole last June.  </P> <P> After Jackson's cellblock threats to complete his "divine mission" of murder  upon his release, Saldana, the Los Angeles City Council, 60 members of the  state Assembly and thousands of residents urged the state Board of Prison Terms  to reverse its decision. On the basis of a window-breaking spree at the  Vacaville prison, his parole was postponed until March, at which point Jackson  will be deported to Britain.  </P> <P> * When Dan White, a former police officer, firefighter and member of the San  Francisco Board of Supervisors, shot and killed Mayor George Moscone and  Supervisor Harvey Milk in 1978, he became the object of nationwide attention.  When he was released from prison after serving five years on a manslaughter  conviction, thousands of San Franciscans took to the streets in protest. (After  a secretive year's parole in the San Fernando Valley, White quietly return to  San Francisco where he committed suicide 10 months later.)  </P> <P> Fueling community fears are statistics on violent crime and recidivism.  According to a U. S. Justice Department report published last March, 62.5% of  all inmates released from state prisons in 1983 committed a felony or serious  misdemeanor within three years of their release.  </P> <P> Almost a third of those who served time for violent crimes were re-arrested for  violent crimes.  </P> <P> "You find a degree of specialization among offenders. They've done it in the  past, so they're more likely to do it in the future," says Justice Department  statistician Allen Beck. (The report stated that 6.6% of convicted murderers  murder again; 7.7% of rapists repeat the crime.)  </P> <P> Despite the statistics, however, psychologists and psychiatrists involved in  the study of criminal behavior qualify the potential danger presented by the  release of violent criminals.  </P> <P> "You read about a Night Stalker or a Singleton and you think the institutions  are filled with these people," says Saul Faerstein, a Beverly Hills forensic  psychiatrist who examined Hillside Strangler Angelo Buono. "But institutions  are filled with common thieves and forgers." Adds Daniel Glaser, professor  emeritus of psychology at USC, who specializes in criminology: "The fear of  crime is not closely related to the rate of crime. It's related to the  publicity about the crime." The chances of any one person being assaulted by a  criminal with the notoriety of a Charles Rothenberg is roughly comparable, he  says, to the luck of winning the state lottery.  </P> <P> There are, however, certain types of people who are more likely to repeat  crimes than others. Says Glaser: "The best predictor is their prior criminal  record. If they have a history of prior crimes or alcoholism or drug addiction,  they're more likely to repeat than if the crime was an outburst of anger in the  family."  </P> <P> Adds Faerstein: "When you find a combination of psychosexual disorder and  sadistic disorders, these people have a high likelihood of committing heinous  crimes. But this is a very small percentage of cases, though they are the cases  that make the newspapers."  </P> <P> People who wear their crimes like a badge with no remorse are also more likely  to repeat them than those who fear society's ostracism, Faerstein says. "They  have a need to attract attention."  </P> <P> But without detailed study of the person, both experts say, it is difficult to  predict individual behavior.  </P> <P> This is what worries Marie Hafdahl, her husband, Buena Park Police Lt. Richard  Hafdahl, and their son, David.  </P> <P> In her Buena Park home, Marie and David are trying to stave off the fear that  could envelop them.  </P> <P> David says, softly, but firmly, "I'm afraid. I don't want to see him again."  </P> <P> Hafdahl is more emotional. The words fly out like sparks from a fire, as she  tells of her four-year marriage to Rothenberg and the incident that almost  killed David. Rothenberg had taken his son on a trip to California after their  divorce, and, when he did not return him to his home in Brooklyn, N.Y., at the  arranged time, Hafdahl told Rothenberg by phone that he would never see his son  again. The same day Rothenberg bought a bottle of kerosene.  </P> <P> Now Hafdahl sighs. "I'll never get over the loss David's had. It's broken my  heart."  </P> <P> Nor can she get over Rothenberg's act. "I live with it every day. You don't  hurt a child. You don't hurt your own baby. And when he's sleeping. It's  horrendous."  </P> <P> Does she consider her former husband to be dangerous? "Yes," she replies. "If  you can do that to your own son, what would you do to a stranger?"  </P> <P> Fear, whether felt by an individual or a community, is fed by noted examples in  which criminals terrorized communities after serving time for prior offenses.  </P> <P> Convicted murderer and rapist, Willie Horton, became a focal point in President  George Bush's campaign against Michael Dukakis after Horton violated his  furlough from a Massachusetts prison, raped a Maryland woman and repeatedly  slashed her boyfriend.  </P> <P> The conundrum facing communities and law enforcement officers was illustrated  by the release of Jerry (Animal) McFadden, a three-time convicted rapist, to  the tiny East Texas hamlet of Hawkins in the fall of 1985.  </P> <P> The following May, McFadden murdered three of the town's teen-agers, raping one  of them.  </P> <P> The town's sheriff, Frank White, says he protested McFadden's coming to Hawkins  to the Texas Board of Parole and the Department of Corrections; but when  McFadden arrived, White did not notify the residents.  </P> <P> "After I hit the ceiling and bounced off the wall, I didn't do much," he says,  adding that he feared stirring up unnecessary panic ("You can't hit the streets  and say, 'Lock up your daughters. We've got a sex fiend on the loose,' " he  maintains). He adds, "I didn't know where I stood legally as to further  enhancing his (McFadden's) bad reputation."  </P> <P> As a result of the murders, however, Hawkins resident Janie Wilson led her  community and the state in the formation of a victims' rights group, "We the  People," which was responsible for the adoption last fall of a state  constitutional amendment guaranteeing crime victims a more active role in the  criminal justice process. Texas is one of five states, along with Washington,  Rhode Island, Florida and Michigan, that have adopted constitutional amendments  giving victims the right to be heard at parole hearings and sentencing.  </P> <P> But, says Wilson, the loss to a community struck by heinous violence cannot be  legally mended. "He stripped us of our innocence," she says of McFadden, now an  inmate on death row.  </P> <P> Townspeople lock their doors at night and when they have to drive over rural  roads to the local shopping mall at night, they go in twos and threes, she  adds.  </P> <P> While communities feel threatened and helpless, it is often the victims who  suffer the most anguish and outrage at the release of their assailants.  </P> <P> Says Linda Barker-Lowrance, program director of the National Victim Center, an  information and referral organization in Ft. Worth: "They feel vulnerable and  helpless. First the perpetrator takes their control away. Then the police take  it through their investigations. Finally the prosecutor has control."  </P> <P> Some victims resort to drugs and alcohol to alleviate the pain, she says. They  develop such eating disorders as bulimia and anorexia, and are subject to  migraine headaches, depression, ulcers and heart attacks. A vast number of  victims also have thoughts of suicide.  </P> <P> For Marie Hafdahl, the symptoms have appeared as stomach disorders and chest  pains. She attends stress control sessions with a psychologist, and, she says,  she and David have taken self-defense classes.  </P> <P> She is sure Rothenberg will try to contact her son. "He's obsessed with David.  He views him as his possession. I don't think he'll let things be. They'll  start eating away at him. It's just a matter of time."  </P> <P> But she says, as if coaching herself, "I cannot let my fear overtake me," and  she adds with a rush, "I can't run away from this, even though I would like  to."  </P> <P> Prison officials and criminal experts point out that thousands of violent  criminals are regularly released into public life without the public's  knowledge.  </P> <P> Placement of parolees is typically known only to local law enforcement  officials. Says California Department of Corrections spokesman, Tipton C.  Kindel: "It's not something the public needs to know. We want to give  ex-offenders a fair chance to reintegrate into society." Law enforcement  officials are free to inform the public of a former criminal's whereabouts,  and, concedes Kindel, "It may happen in this (Rothenberg) case, but we hope  not."  </P> <P> In extreme cases, when notorious criminals have been identified in communities,  reaction has at times reached lynch mob hysteria.  </P> <P> When Singleton was suspected of being in a motel in the Bay Area community of  Concord, a crowd of several hundred gathered outside to protest. The town's  police chief, George Straka, recalls that even people who had known him for  years didn't believe him when he said Singleton was not inside. "They shut down  rational thought," he says.  </P> <P> Assistant Sheriff of Contra Costa County, Warren Rupf, similarly remembers how  "everybody -- the public, the county officials, the politicians -- got  hysterical" when Singleton was discovered living in an apartment house in the  little township of Rodeo.  </P> <P> Even the police officers, who were called in to remove Singleton from the  apartment house where an angry mob had gathered, felt a dual pull of emotions.  "It was extremely frustrating," says Rupf, who brought Singleton to the safety  of the sheriff's office. "Our officers were in a position of having to defend a  person they felt deserved more severe punishment." When they brought him out of  the apartment, Rupf says incredulously, "he was smiling."  </P> <P> On the other hand, criminals say society cannot lock them out forever. It must  give them a chance to change their behavior.  </P> <P> "It would be crazy for a town to say, 'Oh, boy, are we glad to have you back.'  They don't know if the person has changed or not,"' says Donald Weindorf, 55,  who runs the Nebraska branch of the International Seventh Step Foundation, a  Canada-based criminal counseling network, employing ex-offenders.  </P> <P> However, says Weindorf, who served nine years for armed robbery in Illinois,  "People look at offenders as animals. If you're going to hassle them all their  lives, you might as well just kill 'em."  </P> <P> The best way to reduce recidivism, say Weindorf and others who work with former  prisoners, is through rehabilitation programs that work to change the attitudes  of ex-offenders. According to Weindorf, in the last four years only two out of  214 ex-cons who came through his program have been re-arrested.  </P> <P> Normally, says Weindorf, criminals experience street shock, stress, fear and  ostracism after their release and, without help, are "a big screw-up. When they  can't handle a situation they tend to fall back into old patterns."  </P> <P> A former rapist and Seventh Step veteran, who spoke on condition of anonymity,  points out the extent of alienation a criminal can typically experience.  </P> <P> "I was a pretty sick guy," he says. "Crime was my cry for attention." During  nine years in San Quentin, he says, "there were damn few times when I felt  human." When he was freed, he states, "I had no more idea why I raped that  woman." Each time the parole board would ask him, he says, "I'd go out and find  the answers. I told them what they wanted to hear so they'd let me out."  </P> <P> It is this type of image of criminal behavior that haunts Marie Hafdahl when  she thinks of her former husband. Rothenberg has sent her a letter saying he  would not harm her nor David and has spoken of helping other parents who commit  child abuse.  </P> <P> But, Hafdahl says, "He's just trying to build up his image so people will  loosen up. I know him. He's so mixed up, it's impossible for him to be  rehabilitated."  </P> <P> She says that, although he has refused interviews before his release,  Rothenberg has agreed to appear on the "Oprah Winfrey" and "Larry King Live"  shows; both programs have invited her to appear with him. She is appalled at  their audacity ("Do they expect to have a family reunion?" she exclaims) and  snickers dryly, "Charles loves publicity. He actually thinks he's going to be a  TV celebrity."  </P> <P> But, pondering the question no one can answer, she adds darkly, "I wonder what  will happen when the publicity dies down."  </P></p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Revenue plan on personal files sparks alarm The Inland Revenue plans to merge its five computer systems and allow more of its staff to gain access to taxpayers' personal records. The moves have sparked concern among civil liberties campaigners. The Revenue is also going to give additional details to the Department of Social Security about employers who are potentially liable for National Insurance contributions. The changes to computer systems come as part of the Revenue's 'change management' programme, which includes ambitious modernisation of its computer systems and greater responsiveness to taxpayer demands. Staff at Revenue tax inquiry offices throughout the country - and others who answer taxpayer telephone inquiries - will for the first time be able to gain access to all personal tax information. The move, which the Revenue says comes in response to a desire from the public for easier access and quicker resolution of queries, will add to the number of tax officials able to gain access to personal financial information. The Revenue stresses that the officials able to view the information will be those who already hold sufficiently senior positions to be permitted to inspect taxpayer returns. It points out that most of the additional staff able to see taxpayer records will not be able to amend them, and that details of those inspecting the information will be logged. Separately, the Revenue has announced that it will provide the Department of Social Security with the names and addresses of employers likely to be liable for payment of Class 1A National Insurance contributions on company cars and fuel. Sir George Young, the financial secretary to the Treasury, has approved changes in the Revenue's powers which will allow it to supply the information without breaching its confidentiality obligations. Mr John Wadham, legal director of Liberty, formerly the National Council for Civil Liberties, said yesterday that he was concerned about the plans. 'There is a problem with more people getting access to records,' he said. He said that taxpayers should be able to have complete access to any information in their records held by the Revenue, and stressed the importance of a system that would log the names of officials who inspected these records. He questioned whether it was right for information collected by the Revenue for one purpose to be allowed to be passed on to another department for a different purpose.</p>

Latest figures show that there are now 25 property rights  exchanges in China, with Henan, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shandong,  Chengdu, Shenzhen and Zhejiang as the regional centers.    Recently, 30 big financial organizations and enterprise  groups decided jointly to sponsor the China International  Property Rights Exchange Center in Beijing, which will be a  national property exchange market.    The sponsors include the China Economic Development Trust  and  Investment Corporation, the Shenzhen Baoan (Group) Corporation,  the China Everbright International Trust and Investment  Corporation, and the Hangzhou Waitan Construction Co. Ltd.    Under the old planned economy system, state-owned fixed  assets could not be circulated. Statistics show that about one  third of the state-owned property is idle at present, seriously  affecting the efficiency of enterprises.    The country's first property rights exchange was formed in  the early 1980s. Thanks to property rights exchanges, over  6,900 enterprises were merged in the 1980s. Their property  rights, worth over eight billion yuan, were transferred. As a  result, the number of enterprises in the red dropped by 4,095  and the annual level of losses by state-owned enterprises was  reduced by 522 million yuan.    Since the beginning of the 1990s, over 10,000 enterprises  have been merged. More than 2,900 enterprises were sold and  merged through the 16 property rights exchanges in Tianjin,  Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shenzhen and other places of the  country. Many of the enterprises have been revitalized after  being merged or sold.    With the development of the property rights business, China  has promulgated a series of relevant laws and regulations on  bankruptcy, company and state enterprises.    Economists believe that the development of the property  rights business will play a more and more important role in  re-organization of the country's productive factors and in  development of the country's productivity.</p>

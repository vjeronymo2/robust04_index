			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: British Vita Two years on from its last rights issue British Vita still has a large portion of the proceeds in its back pocket. Even through the depths of recession, cash flow has been strong enough to finance capital spending well ahead of depreciation and a string of small deals. Given the dwindling returns on cash - and the fact that the shares have underperformed the equity market by 20 per cent since the rights issue - shareholders might feel disappointed on both counts. With 60 per cent of turnover in continental Europe, the outlook for sales growth should be brighter from here on. The snag is that Vita finds itself sandwiched between chemicals suppliers looking to increase prices and customers in the automotive industry and elsewhere trying cut costs. Margins may suffer further if the giants of the chemicals industry make annual price rises stick in April. With its shares on a price earnings multiple well above the market average, a well-judged acquisition would not go amiss.</p>

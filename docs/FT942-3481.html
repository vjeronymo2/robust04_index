			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Survey of Nottinghamshire Coalfields Regeneration (3): Private prospects are good - The county's coalfield has fared better than most Nottinghamshire, understandably, is grieving. To many miners it must seem that their industry has been virtually wiped out. But as their former colleagues in other areas can tell them, it could have been a lot worse. Nottinghamshire may have just six working pits left compared with several hundred in the mining heyday of the early twentieth century and 25 just 10 year ago. But that is six more than the north-east of England and Kent, for example, both of which were once proud deep mine regions but now have none in operation. Leaving aside the tiny mines of the Welsh valleys, Nottinghamshire has a quarter of the total 16 mines that are being sold by the government in five 'core' regions. It also has two pits, Calverton and Clipstone, which have been re-opened under licence this year by RJB Mining, the private coal company, after being rejected as unprofitable by British Coal. In addition Nottinghamshire is the headquarters of several companies and organisations that either will or want to play a role in the privatised industry. The Union of Democratic Mineworkers and Caledonian Mining are among those considering bids for at least one of the five regions. The government has decided that the Coal Authority, which will be responsible for licensing all coal mining activities in the UK and for maintaining mining records, will be based in Nottinghamshire. That the county's deep mining industry has survived at all, albeit in a truncated form, is partly because of the relatively thick and accessible seams of coal available in the centre of the country. Being close to the UK's biggest concentration of remaining coal-fired power stations in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire has helped. Also influential has been the political debt owed by the government to miners who continued to work during the 1984-5 national pits strike. Most of working miners were based in Nottinghamshire and most of them subsequently joined the Union of Democratic Mineworkers when it was set up as a breakaway from the National Union of Mineworkers in 1985. The UDM's leaders have had considerable access to ministers and they have used it to good effect. The decline of the UDM and its Nottinghamshire heartland has been marked since its formation in 1985, but not nearly so severe as that of the NUM and the national industry. While UDM-controlled pits have shrunk to about a quarter of their 1985 total of 25, the number of pits in the industry as a whole has fallen from 170 to about 24, a sevenfold decline. 'The UDM and Nottinghamshire has been protected by the government, to some extent at least,' according to one former British Coal executive. 'But it is only partly because of the political debt from the strike. The fact is that Nottinghamshire miners have shown time and again that they were willing to adapt to changed circumstances. 'They have always been more flexible about working hours than colleagues in other areas, for example.' That willingness was demonstrated again recently when more than 90 per cent of Notts miners accepted a package giving them a Pounds 6,000 lump sum payment provided they accepted the 12-hour shifts and compulsory weekend work. In the central north region, which has nine mines less and is based in Yorkshire, less than 50 per cent agreed to the package which also provides a maximum redundancy package of Pounds 27,000. In one sense the disparity between the acceptance rates should make central south - which comprises the four Nottinghamshire mines of Bilsthorpe, Harworth, Thorseby, and Welbeck, with Asfordby in Leicestershire, and Daw Mill, in Warwickshire - more attractive to potential bidders than central north. In another sense it will make it less attractive. Owners of central north would face redundancy bills of less than Pounds 7,000 per worker if they decide to make reductions among those who have not accepted British Coal's package. What is not in doubt, however, is central south's saleability. The government may not get much money for any of the five British Coal regions it is divesting but there are enough potential buyers around to ensure that each will be find a buyer. In all, 33 companies have told NM Rothschild, advising the government, that they want to pre-qualify to bid for at least one of the packages. Rothschild will not say how many have sought to pre-qualify for central south. However, it is understood that the list includes RJB Mining, a conglomerate comprising the UDM and Coal Investments, a company headed by Malcolm Edwards, a management buy-out consortium headed by Bob Siddall, British Coal opencast director, and RTZ, the international mining conglomerate. The package's attractions include stockpiles of 5.2m tonnes and contracts to sell the two main electricity generators 11m to 12m tonnes of coal a year until 1998. It also has five opencast sites, all outside Nottinghamshire. Reserves amount to about 220m tonnes compared with annual output in 1993-4 of 11.5m tonnes. But that does not mean that all the mines in the package will survive into the next century. Harworth is thought to have 60 to 70 years of reserves but Bilsthorpe is unlikely to last more than three to four years unless large sums are spent on finding access to new seams. Nor can there be any guarantees about the future of the two former British Coal mines which are already being operated by RJB. Richard Budge, chief executive, says the mines are exceeding their production and productivity targets and that there is no problem in finding them a market. Others remain to be convinced. British Coal executives accept that there may be a market for about six pits that it has closed. But up to nine are being opened around the country. Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, has warned that there could be casualties. That is far too pessimistic, according to the private sector miners, including RJB. Nonetheless there are few who doubt that further contraction is to come in the mining industry. Nottinghamshire's six mines may be good for a few years yet. But it is doubtful that the county will retain jobs for all 3,500 miners still in employment. Demands for increases in productivity in the mines now owned by British Coal will see to that.</p>

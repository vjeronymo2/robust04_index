			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Sport: The emperor climbs towards Olympus - Sport Politics / The growing power of Primo Nebiolo The Olympic movement is poised for profound changes. Last week the International Olympic Committee held its centenary congress in Paris. The constitutional changes and elections that took place give some clues to the future of the IOC. President Juan Antonio Samaranch stands down in 1997. The succession may well have been settled by the voting last week in the hotels of la Defense. Primo Nebiolo had, on the face of it, a good week. The widely-feared emperor of track and field, officially described as President of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, saw the rules change to his benefit and the IOC admit a new cadre of potential supporters. Making all members, elected or appointed, eligible for every office gives an opportunity to the Monte Carlo-based capo to stand for the top job three years from now. Bringing 10 presidents from international sports federations on to the IOC gives Nebiolo an additional voting bloc. Samaranch is 74, three years older than the Italian. He will almost certainly leave it to ASOIF, the association of 27 summer Olympic sports, to choose the nominees. Nebiolo, also President of ASOIF, has controlled this organisation ruthlessly for a decade. His power is both patronage and the allocation to individual sports of millions of dollars in revenues trickling down from Olympic headquarters in Lausanne. 'Primo will do anything to ensure that these men owe their place on the IOC to him and no other factor,' said one administrator who has known Nebiolo for 20 years. 'When he gets them the job he'll give them the speech. 'I want one thing in return, my dear friend, your total loyalty. When I come to you in need, then you must help me.'' Those two phrases, 'my dear friend' and 'help me', uttered in an accent horribly reminiscent of Marlon Brando in The Godfather, chill anyone who has had dealings with Nebiolo. In the 1987 Rome scandal over the cheating Italian long-jumper Giovanni Evangalista, Nebiolo was able to draw on the support of three IAAF council members who owed their President everything. 'He has an executive council of trembling puppets. He is a powerful man who gets his own way, superficially similar to Samaranch, so it is natural for Nebiolo to see himself as a logical successor,' said the source. Within the world of Grand Prix athletics, Nebiolo is acknowledged as having been an effective bulldozer, changing a landscape ripe for redevelopment. 'As president of the IAAF he has been a fresh wind. Primo has consistently removed or surmounted many barriers. A considerate manager, a gentleman, would not have managed it,' said Res Brugger, organiser of the Zurich Grand Prix meeting, in a recent interview with Sportinformationsdienst. Yet comparisons with Samaranch, unparalleled moderniser of the Olympic movement, are misleading. 'Measured against Samaranch, he is completely unsuited to be President,' the source said. 'Primo's motives are totally selfish and self-seeking. Samaranch may occasionally sup with the devil but always for the good of the cause.' The British have always been Nebiolo's particular phobia. Whether it is their peculiar insistence on rules and transparent administration or individual frictions (IOC member Princess Anne treated him with Arctic disdain), his instinct for deals has repeatedly clashed with London's world view. Nebiolo was in a carpet-biting rage over the British Athletic Federation's decision not to withdraw its women's team from this weekend's World Cup after the positive (IAAF-administered) drug test on 800m runner Diane Modahl. When the IOC in Paris elected Craig Reedie, chairman of the British Olympic Association, to one of 12 new seats on the committee they may have been bestowing more than an individual honour. If anyone has the instincts to fight the tendencies Nebiolo represents, then it would be Reedie. 'He is one of the very few men who has always been firm with Nebiolo and stood his ground whatever the pressure,' said John Holt, a former secretary of the IAAF who worked with Reedie on Manchester's bid for the 2000 Olympics. Reedie, a former president of the badminton federation, works as a director of a Glasgow pensions company. He is the kind of Scotsman who would have held out his fare as he stepped on to the Glasgow tram. Also with Reedie in the new IOC intake are Gerhard Heiberg of Norway, Arne Ljungquist of Sweden and Alex Gilady, an Israeli who, when he lived in the US, was a vice-president of NBC television. Since the mid-1980s it has been received wisdom among the savants of the Olympic movement that this was an era dominated by Latin and Hispanic interests. Barcelona received the 1992 Games from Samaranch (a Spaniard). Mario Vasquez Rana (the Mexican IOC member) rose rapidly to huge influence with southern hemisphere members. Primo Nebiolo built his long march on the careful cultivation of personal contacts with Latin American and African sports administrators. The arrogant, corinthian, Anglo-Saxon, attitudes of Averey Brundage and Lord Exeter seemed to have been consigned to a quasi-colonial past. Yet no political situation or movement is ever static. Richard Pound, the Toronto lawyer who is the most powerful member of the IOC after Samaranch, and Dick Gosper, the Australian vice-president who has just retired after a glittering career with Shell, now have powerful newly-elected allies who are likely to see the world more from their perspective than Nebiolo's. The next two Olympics, Atlanta in 1996 and Sydney in 2000, are both in venues which, although famously multi-cultural, possess predominantly Anglo-Saxon business cultures. Although the media largely greeted the Paris changes as an open door for Nebiolo, it may prove to be one which slams in his face.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Overseas growth masks sharp decline to Pounds 13.6m at Cape STRONG GROWTH overseas partly offset a sharp decline in the UK at Cape, the fire protection, insulation, and building products group. Nevertheless, pre-tax profits declined by 21 per cent to Pounds 13.6m for the 12 months to March 31. Mr Michael Farebrother, chief executive, said sales outside the UK had risen by 49 per cent, to about 40 per cent of total group turnover. The strength of the overseas businesses helped overall turnover rise by 10 per cent to Pounds 202.9m. Acquisitions in the Netherlands and Germany contributed Pounds 17m in sales and about Pounds 1m in profits, Mr Farebrother said. After spending Pounds 7m on new companies and a further Pounds 8m in capital expenditure, the group still had Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 21.7m) net cash which would be used for further acquisitions and investment. Mr Farebrother said the strong cash position, and the secure position of Charter Consolidated, its 67 per cent shareholder, gave good reason to maintain the final dividend at 7.5p, for an unchanged total of 10.5p. Of Cape's two main divisions, building and architectural products was the worst hit. Operating profits were sliced by 46 per cent to Pounds 6.88m amid the depressed conditions of the UK construction industry. Industrial services, which supplies insulation and scaffolding to the power and petrochemical industries, increased its contribution through acquisitions from Pounds 4.66m to Pounds 6.02m. Cape, which was on the brink of collapse in 1985 amid the turmoil surrounding its withdrawal from asbestos mining, had cut about 400 of its 4,000 jobs in the past year. As a result, administration costs were 13 per cent down year on year, Mr Farebrother said. Earnings per share, depressed by a higher tax charge, fell from 23.9p to 17p.</p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANAHEIM HILLS SHOPPING HUB OKD  </P> <P> Plans for the east Anaheim Hills' largest shopping center have been approved  and will include four shopping complexes, a business center and hotel.  </P> <P> The City Council approved the project, 4 to 0, Tuesday night after a public  hearing.  </P> <P> Construction of the Anaheim Hills Festival, planned for 85 undeveloped acres at  the southwest corner of Santa Ana Canyon and Roosevelt roads, will begin this  summer. Developers hope to complete it by the fall of 1991.  </P> <P> The $100-million project will offer Anaheim Hills residents convenient shopping  and the city an estimated $2 million in annual sales tax revenues, said Bradley  A. Geier of the Trammel Crow Co., which is developing the area.  </P> <P> One resident spoke at Tuesday's public hearing about concerns with some parts  of the plan, such as rooftop equipment and 24-hour security.  </P> <P> But Patrick Pepper, chairman of the Anaheim Hills Citizens Coalition, told the  council that his group approved of the project.  </P> <P> "It is a welcome addition to the East Hills area and will definitely be an  asset to our community," Pepper said.  </P></p>

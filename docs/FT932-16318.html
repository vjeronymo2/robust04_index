			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Digital to leave historic home DIGITAL Equipment is leaving its historic headquarters at The Mill, in Maynard, Massachusetts. Built in 1847 as a woollen mill, the building dominates the small New England town. It is a warren of stairs and wooden-floored offices, full of character and tradition, but lacking the efficiency of a modern office block. Digital will continue to keep its headquarters in Maynard.</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCK AS IT NEARS 40: RUNNING ON EMPTY?  </P> <P> Hilburn, as usual, is right on the money. Searching the radio dial for anything  remotely meaningful is a frustrating experience for anyone tired of oldies and  the prefabricated snot that the under-20 crowd prefers now-adays.  </P> <P> The death of rock as a vital form of popular music doesn't bother me, though.  All things must pass, and rock has had its day. The depressing thing is that  nothing is taking its place.  </P> <P> We've had the Jazz Age, the Big Band Era, the Rock 'n' Roll Years. Since the  turn of the century forms of popular music have left their marks on  generations.  </P> <P> The 1990s will be very empty indeed if the only original means of musical  expression is rap, which will never appeal to more than a small, angry  minority.  </P> <P> ROBERT W.D. DeVILLE  </P> <P> Claremont  </P></p>

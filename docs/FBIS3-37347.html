			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Lashch report: "The Latvian Administration </F> Harasses a Russian General"]    [Text] Another conflict has occurred in Latvia between a  Russian general and the local authorities. The Latvian  Citizenship and Immigration Department has confiscated from  General Anatoliy Gaponov his USSR passport. Yesterday  KOMMERSANT-DAILY learned some details of the incident. So far  there has been no reaction from the Russian Defense Ministry.    It is noteworthy that the decision to confiscate the  passport  from the general was made by Andrejs Rucs, chief of the Vidzemsk  district in Riga. Rucs is known for the fact that at the end of  January he ordered two Russian generals, Vodopyanov and  Taylakov, to be handcuffed and arrested. Their arrest led to  the disruption of a regular round of the Russian-Latvian  negotiations on the status of the Russian radar station in  Skrunda while Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev put troops  stationed in Latvia on high alert. After that incident the  Latvian government ruled to dismiss Rucs from his post while the  prosecutor's office opened a criminal case against him. Later  on, however, deputies of the local council reinstated Rucs in  his post. Apparently, after receiving a vote of confidence,  Rucs has launched a harassment campaign against the Russian  generals.    Rucs' first step in this direction has been an order to  confiscate the passport from Russian General Anatoliy Gaponov.  First, the local Latvian authorities invited General Gaponov to  vacate his apartment. After the general's representative  arrived at the Citizenship and Immigration Department with  General Gapanov's passport to obtain documents confirming the  legitimacy of the general's presence on Latvian territory,  Latvian officials confiscated Gaponov's ID. According to the  department leadership, he is simultaneously a private individual  (by his passport) and a military serviceman (by his ID), which  contradicts Latvian law.    A department employee, who asked not to be identified, said  in a conversation with KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent that he  has no information on this case: "The question of legality or  illegality of confiscating the passport will be decided at the  working level." Furthermore, as KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent  has learned, the Latvian prosecutor's office is undertaking its  own investigation into the incident with the Russian general.    Dmitriy Rogozin, chairman of the Congress of Russian  Communities, told KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent that he was  not surprised by what has happened: "This is not a precedent but  a relapse which will recur again and again. The arrest of  Generals Vodopyanov and Taylakov and the seizure of Gaponov's  passport is aimed at humiliating Russia and its officials."</p>

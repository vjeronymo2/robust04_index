			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 25 (CNA) -- Official diplomatic ties  between the Republic of China [ROC] and South Africa remain  solid, South African Ambassador J.L. Viljoen said Saturday [25  June]. Viljoen made the remarks while answering questions from  the media at a banquet honoring foreign envoys in Taipei. The  banquet was hosted by the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Viljoen said South Africa, after it regains membership to  the  United Nations, hopes to play a more active and positive role in  African affairs. He said he had no information on whether  Pretoria will establish ties with Beijing. Viljoen said his  government fully understands the efforts the ROC is making to  enter the United Nations, and said the most urgent task for the  ROC is to strive for more international support.    South Africa has not yet decided on how best to support the  ROC in its bid to join the United Nations, he added.</p>

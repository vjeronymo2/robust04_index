			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: BNP doubles its options business with US purchase Banque Nationale de Paris, the French bank which was privatised last autumn, plans to become a leading player in the international options business through the purchase of most of the operations of Cooper Neff, the options trading and research firm based in Radnor, Pennsylvania. BNP's decision to buy a ready-made derivatives business follows a similar, successful move by Swiss Bank Corporation which bought O'Connor Securities, a specialist options firm based in Chicago, in 1992. Market observers said BNP's acquisition made financial sense since developing a similar standard of technology in-house would probably have involved a much greater investment. 'BNP is also buying expertise and a modern financial culture,' said one derivatives expert. Mr Philippe Bordenave, head of BNP Global Markets, said the purchase of Cooper Neff would double the bank's presence in the options business - both firms have more than 100 traders and market-makers - and would raise BNP's profile in the US to the same level which it has achieved in Europe and Asia. 'We have complementary teams,' said Mr Bordenave, 'Cooper Neff has advanced technology and 13 years of experience of trading in options. We bring name, credit rating, customer base and global coverage.' Mr Bordenave declined to give any financial details of the deal, which will be completed at the end of this year. However, Cooper Neff's partners, including the firm's founders Richard Cooper and Roy Neff, have been 'heavily incentivised' to help BNP build a successful operation and to stay with the bank well into the next century. 'I hope to be very wealthy at the end of this period,' said Mr Cooper. BNP will buy some 80 per cent of Cooper Neff's operations at this stage and its equity index market-making operation in Chicago later when US regulations are met. BNP is also acquiring the US exchange-based currency options business of Mitsui T&amp;B Options, which Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking bought from Cooper Neff four years ago.</p>

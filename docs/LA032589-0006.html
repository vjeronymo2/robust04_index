			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ACCEPTABLE RISKS' WITH PESTICIDES USED ON FRUITS AND VEGETABLES  </P> <P> In response to Dr. Whelan's column, I've always had trouble understanding the  disproportionate increase in childhood cancers. When I was growing up in the  '30s, cancer was considered in illness of old age; cancer in children was so  rare it was considered on aberration.  </P> <P> And, even allowing for the fact that our population has more than doubled in  the last 50 years, there still doesn't seem to be an explanation for today's  hospital wards full of children with cancer, unless the combination of man-made  toxins in our water supply, in our food supply and in our air is simply more  than some young immune systems are able to tolerate.  </P> <P> ELEANOR TAYLOR  </P> <P> El Cajon  </P></p>

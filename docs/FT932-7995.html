			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / The hole at Hungary's banking heart: Nicholas Denton reports on the need for a recapitalisation Behind the World Bank and International Monetary Fund's belief that Hungary's big banks need rescuing are some compelling facts. The capital of the two biggest banks - Magyar Hitel Bank and Kereskedelmi Bank - is wiped out when international accounting standards are applied to their bad loans. Economic output has fallen 18 per cent in the last three years. The disappearance of demand from former Comecon countries has worsened the recession, hitting hardest the socialist industrial giants like Ikarus, Taurus, Videoton and Borsodchem which make up the rotten core of Hitel Bank's clientele. In 1991 parliament passed strict new laws: on bankruptcy, causing about a tenth of companies to go into liquidation or file for protection from creditors; and on financial institutions, giving banks the incentive to recognise bad debts. The banking sector's loans classified as bad, doubtful or substandard rose to Ft262bn (Dollars 2.9bn) - 17 per cent of all loans and 10 per cent of GDP  -in September 1992. Hitel Bank says its non-performing loans tripled from Ft25bn in December 1991 to Ft78bn at the peak last year. The result has been a sharp credit crunch. Banks, faced with the need to make huge provisions, have charged high real interest rates to maintain margins and produce paper operating profits estimated at Ft39.7bn for the whole sector in 1992. The average interest rate on short-term corporate loans was 28.2 per cent at the end of 1992, compared with inflation of 21.6 per cent over the year. The cost of borrowing has pushed bad risks to the wall and good risks abroad  -or, like Nestle, McDonalds and other western investors in Hungary, directly to the capital markets. Made cautious by defaults, banks slightly reduced their outstanding credit to enterprises in 1992, a sharp fall in real terms. 'A prudent policy today means extreme conservatism,' says Mr Gyorgy Ivanyi, president of Inter-Europa Bank. The World Bank study concludes that: 'The financial system is unable to finance the transformation to a market economy.' A one-off recapitalisation is widely seen as essential. Economic recovery is still feeble and loan portfolios are deteriorating. Weaker banks are losing their better clients to stronger ones. Mr Szalkai admits that Hitel Bank is at a 'threshold,' from which it could spiral downwards. Recapitalisation must also put the banking sector into condition for privatisation before more of the potential acquirers lose patience and set up local subsidiaries from scratch. An injection of funds, however, would allow bank managers to escape the consequence of past errors. Magyar Hitel Bank, Kereskedelmi Bank and Budapest Bank inherited a portfolio of loans made under communist logic when hived off from the National Bank of Hungary in 1987. Since then, managers have been responsible for their own decisions - and some of them have proved painful. Hitel Bank, for instance, has paid the price of a focus on lending to start-up businesses. The policy has won popularity, but the losses have been heavy. Mr Szalkai says that the default rate for new business is as high as on the old, communist-inspired loans. Kontrax, one of Hungary's largest domestic private groups, only this month declared bankruptcy owing Ft4.2bn to Hitel Bank and other creditors. Hitel Bank has also been reluctant to reduce exposure to inherited shaky borrowers for fear of pushing them into bankruptcy. 'In creditors' meetings Hitel Bank is always there,' says a banker. In contrast, Budapest Bank has pulled away from the other two commercial banks. Under Mr Lajos Bokros, managing director, Budapest Bank's capital has improved as a proportion of assets from -5.5 per cent in 1992 to +2.2 per cent this year. In 1991, Mr Bokros anticipated the wave of client bankruptcies to come. He defied the finance ministry's hunger for taxable profits and provisioned furiously. Mr Bokros has taken a pay cut, drives a second-hand Renault and flies economy class. He has refused to follow other banks in financing newspapers and political foundations. This approach has won him the admiration of the Budapest financial community. But it has done him little good politically. The World Bank study calls for managment changes at the worse performing banks. Yet it is over Mr Bokros's future that the biggest political uncertainties hang.</p>

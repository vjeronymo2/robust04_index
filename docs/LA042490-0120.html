			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PHONE FINALLY RINGS FOR VOORHEES; CSUN LINEMAN DRAFTED BY GIANTS  </P> <P> The phone call Barry Voorhees had waited the better part of a lifetime to  answer came Monday at 9:30 a.m.  </P> <P> The New York Giants had made the 6-foot-5, 302-pound Cal State Northridge  offensive guard an eighth-round selection in Monday's National Football League  draft. A staffer from the team's player personnel department was on the line  waiting to tell him about it.  </P> <P> So where was Voorhees?  </P> <P> Asleep in his room.  </P> <P> "I hadn't slept much all night and when I finally did, that's when the call  came," Voorhees said. "My mom had to wake me up."  </P> <P> There were 217 players picked ahead of Voorhees, 33 of whom were offensive  linemen. But that mattered little when the call finally came. He was the only  offensive lineman chosen by the Giants.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, it's the start of something," said Voorhees, who was scheduled to  fly out of Santa Barbara this morning headed for a two-day mini-camp in New  Jersey. "I went a little later than I expected. I thought maybe the fourth  through sixth round, but I'm just happy that it happened."  </P> <P> In all, five players with ties to the region were selected in the 12-round  draft.  </P> <P> Indianapolis, the team which had shown the most pre-draft interest in Voorhees,  picked two former local standouts in the fourth round. Bill Schultz, a guard  from Kennedy High and USC, was taken 94th overall and defensive back Alan  Grant, from St. Francis High and Stanford, went eight players later with a  choice the Colts obtained in a trade with Washington.  </P> <P> Running back Michael Pringle, of Kennedy High and Cal State Fullerton, was  taken by Atlanta in the sixth round. Former Montclair Prep standout Tim  Stallworth, a wide receiver from Washington State, went to the Rams later in  the same round.  </P> <P> Ken Whitney, a 6-3, 300-pound offensive lineman from Cal Lutheran, was not  selected but he has drawn interest as a free agent.  </P> <P> Whitney will work out with Raiders today, and the Rams and Saints have  expressed interest, Whitney's agent said.  </P> <P> Among the players Voorhees was chosen ahead of were quarterback Major Harris of  West Virginia, a Heisman Trophy finalist; Brad Leggett, a starting guard for  USC; and Texas A&amp;I running back Johnny Bailey, a three-time winner of the  Harlon Hill Award as the nation's top Division II player.  </P> <P> However, Voorhees does not hold the distinction of being the only Northridge  player ever drafted, as was previously reported.  </P> <P> After six months of saying Voorhees could become the first, the school  discovered Monday that there was predecessor. In 1973, defensive back Doug  Jones was a sixth-round choice of the Kansas City Chiefs.  </P></p>

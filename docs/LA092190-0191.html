			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MILLIONAIRE TO RELINQUISH CONTROL OF RACEWAY  </P> <P> Multimillionaire developer Mark Raymond Vogel, who was arrested last week on a  cocaine charge, plans to relinquish day-to-day fiscal control of Rosecroft  Raceway, according to the track's general manager.  </P> <P> James Murphy, who also is Rosecroft's president, said he will assume daily  control of the track's finances.  </P> <P> He spoke after a Thursday meeting between Maryland Racing Commission officials  and Daniel Sandler, vice president and treasurer of Rosecroft.  </P> <P> Vogel owns Rosecroft, in Oxon Hill, and Delmarva Downs in Ocean City, Md.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, court records show Vogel owes the federal government more than  $600,000 in income taxes, and that he is enmeshed in a tangle of financial  difficulties that may threaten the future of his real estate and racing empire.  </P> <P> Thursday's meeting came as legislators and racing officials expressed renewed  concern Vogel might use funds from the race tracks to shore up faltering real  estate projects.  </P> <P> "I think they would like to isolate the race track from Mark's other ventures,"  Murphy said.  </P> <P> Because Vogel has not been actively involved in Rosecroft's operations since he  bought the track in December, 1987, Murphy said, the move will not disrupt the  track's day-to-day operations.  </P> <P> State records show that the two tracks lost $1.2 million for the year ending  Sept. 30, 1989.  </P> <P> Vogel, 42, a real estate speculator, was arrested in Fairfax County after an  investigation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.  </P> <P> Charged with possession of four grams of cocaine, which is worth about $400,  Vogel was released on $10,000 bond and will plead not guilty to the felony  charge, according to his attorney, Plato Cacheris.  </P></p>

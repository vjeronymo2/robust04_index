			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Foreigners join the queue for Shenzhen flotations - Why investors are braving the risks on China's fastest growing stock exchange Last November the streets of Shenzhen City, the capital of the special economic zone to the north of Hong Kong, were busier than usual. The Shenzhen stock exchange was about to distribute application forms for subscription to 11 company flotations, then planned for 1992. More than 100,000 Chinese investors from all over the country had come to Shenzhen and camped outside the offices of financial institutions in an attempt to get in early. Since Beijing allowed foreigners to own shares in Chinese companies, investors in Europe, North America and elsewhere have been following the lead of local investors. They may not be camping on the kerbside but they are doing the next best thing, contacting their brokers in Hong Kong and trying to get on the list. Foreign investors are even calling journalists in Hong Kong to find out the details of the latest offerings. Mutual funds and unit trusts targeted at the Chinese have allocated at least Dollars 150m to buy shares in quoted companies on the Shenzhen exchange and Shanghai stock market - a figure equal to the total equity in Chinese stocks so far issued. Chinese companies, aware of the foreign interest and keen to exploit the tax breaks which they get from having foreign investors, have been queueing up to get their stock listed. A Chinese company located outside one of the country's special economic zones only has to pay 15 per cent tax on profits to the central government if it has foreign shareholders, compared with around 50 per cent if it remains wholly owned by the state. In Shenzhen, Mr Wang Jian, executive director of the exchange, said he had received applications from 119 companies (both in Shenzhen and throughout China) to have their shares listed. Few realised the amount of paper work entailed in the 35 separate steps they had to take before they could have their company's shares listed, he said. There are currently seven companies listed on the Shenzhen exchange, with a further five due for listing in the next two months and another 14 due for listing in the second half of this year - quite an acceleration compared with the 11 expected in November. So far, four have issued 'B' shares, which only foreigners can buy. The 'B' shares rank equally with 'A' shares, which are for domestic investors, but they have to be paid for in US dollars and receive dividends in dollars. Shanghai, although technically the first stock exchange to reopen in China, has been slow to develop. Eight companies have shares listed on the Shanghai exchange but only one - Shanghai Vacuum - has issued 'B' shares to foreigners. Four more are in the queue to issue 'B' shares. The city was recently admonished by Mr Zhu Rongji, China's industry minister and the former mayor of Shanghai, for its slowness in developing the exchange. He criticised local bureaucrats for being short-sighted and urged them to allow more companies to issue stock. Shenzhen has comprehensively stolen the march on Shanghai; its speed of development and the activity on its exchange has made it the market of choice for foreign investors. The four stocks which foreigners can own are trading at premiums to their issue price of between 61 per cent and 96 per cent. In contrast, Shanghai Vacuum, after an initial burst of enthusiasm, is trading at a premium of about 4 per cent. The attraction of the Shenzhen market is obvious, but the risks of investing in 'B' shares are many. Even though China appears to be on the verge of embracing another round of economic reforms, the country's flirtation with capitalism is anything if not pragmatic. And like share prices - which can fall as well as rise - pragmatism also has a downside. The country's most senior leader, the 87-year-old Mr Deng Xiaoping, is an ardent supporter of the types of reforms being undertaken in Shenzhen and southern China more generally, but he is also a communist. As he told the Politburo recently, if stock markets in China did not work, then they could be closed down. The more serious political risk is the possibility of political instability after the death of Mr Deng and the other seven octogenarians who comprise the 'revolutionary' cohort of the leadership. The effect on prices could be significant if the leadership transition were to go badly. The more immediate risks are much more mundane but no less important for the investor. There is no securities law in China; neither is there any corporate law and accounting standards are rudimentary. Indeed, the whole concept of law, as westerners may understand it, is unknown in China, where what law there is applies to those who are governed, not those who govern. This makes it potentially tricky for the foreign investor because the companies being offered to foreigners are those which are well connected politically. However, Beijing does have a companies law on the drawing board, and its experts are looking at the whole issue of accounting and adopting international accounting standards. And Chinese companies do realise that to get western capital they have to present information in a way westerners can understand. Equally positive is that exchange officials in Shenzhen are genuinely concerned that their market operates fairly and transparently. But with all things in China the proof the pudding lies in the eating.</p>

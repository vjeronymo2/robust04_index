			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Property: House-hunting season in Hardy country - The green rolling valleys and attractive coastline of Dorset offer stimulating pastimes and a variety of properties IN FOUL WEATHER think of Dorset, that contented, homely county where only spring and summer seem to reign. If you look for a house there now, the winter gales sweeping in from the Channel promise a few thousand pounds more off already competitive prices. A drive of two to three hours from London by the A303 (worth the trouble for the sudden magic of coming on Stonehenge shortly after Amesbury) or the M3, Dorset is a different, self-sufficient world of rolling hills and wonderful walks, villages nestled in tree-packed hidden valleys, and old market towns of great charm, and good shopping, such as Sherborne, Blandford, Wareham, Shaftesbury, Bridport and the county town, Dorchester. The Blackmore Vale, known for its hunt, runs through the middle of the county. The coast is superb for swimming and sailing, offering a choice between lonely beaches or developments, especially around Poole harbour, that are the nearest England comes to a riviera. The Weymouth ferry is an escape route to France but Dorset itself has any number of places for expeditions, from the Swannery at Abbotsbury or Thomas Hardy's study in the delightful Dorchester museum, to Maiden Castle, a whale of a prehistoric hill fort just outside Dorchester. Houses on the market are of unusual interest for the slack season. Top billing goes to Thornhill Park, a splendid Palladian house near Sherborne which belongs to John Rew, co-editor of the Lloyd's Chatset reports, and his wife. Sir James Thornhill, responsible for the dome of St Paul's and the Painted Hall at Greenwich, rebuilt the house in the 1720s and that is, on the whole, how it remains today, restored lovingly by the Rews. With its own obelisk, fabulous views over Blackmore Vale, 185 acres, a dower house and a lodge, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171), Michael de Pelet in Sherborne (0935-812-236) and Symonds &amp; Sampson in Dorchester (0305-264-172) offers this Grade II* house at around Pounds 1m. Huish Manor, near Blandford, is a late Georgian house from the 1790s, offered at around Pounds 875,000 from Strutt &amp; Parker in Salisbury (0722-328-741). The gardens are so fine that only devotees should think of this property, although the heated indoor swimming pool sounds perfect for winter. Still more horticultural commitment is needed from those considering Clapton Court on the Somerset-Dorset border, offered by Lane Fox (071-499-4785) at around Pounds 1.2m, including cottages. These could be sold separately but probably are essential for housing plantsmen to look after the superb gardens, which are open most of the year and known to all serious gardeners. Those considering the part-Tudor, part-Victorian Compton House near Sherborne need not be committed to butterflies and silk worms. It is at present home base for Worldwide Butterflies and the Lullingstone silk farm - renowned for making the silk for the Queen's coronation dress - which are not part of the sale. But, with 50 rooms, it might be wise to think of a business use for the house, on sale from Savills in Wimborne (0202-887-331) at Pounds 1m. In nearby Nether Compton, Savills (acting with Humberts in Sherborne: 0935-816-909) has the mellow Old Rectory, complete with the vicar's billiard room and orangery, at around Pounds 525,000. Maiden Newton House, offered by Symonds &amp; Sampson at around Pounds 550,000, is another 19th century rectory, this one with fishing on the Frome which flows through the grounds. Weston House, perched on a clifftop at West Lulworth and built by Edwin Lutyens for George V's surgeon, Sir Alfred Fripp, is also with Savills. The guide price of Pounds 375,000 is attractive for what stands out at once as Lutyens' work: a brick manor with projecting eaves and prominently leaded windows. Another impressive property by a well known architect - this time the Victorian, GE Street - is Kingston House, originally a rectory, in the middle of the Isle of Purbeck and two miles from Corfe Castle. Jackson-Stops in Yeovil (0935-74066) offers it at around Pounds 675,000. The firm has another old rectory at Frome Vauchurch, in the Frome valley, for about Pounds 485,000. Between Street and Lutyens in date are two Tudoresque houses. One is the half-timbered Chaffcombe House just across the county boundary near Chard in Somerset, offered by Michael de Pelet and Knight, Frank &amp; Rutley at around Pounds 425,000. The other is the stone Dower House at Parnham (John Makepeace's furniture studio is in the big house), with Savills at around Pounds 385,000. The pick of the village houses is the grand Dawnay House in Puddletown outside Dorchester, a listed Grade II* Queen Anne-Georgian building with original oak staircase. Savills is offering it at over Pounds 200,000. The attractive Old Manor Farmhouse at Marnhull, Dorset's largest village which prospered on the wool trade, dates even earlier to the time of Charles I and is offered at around Pounds 235,000 by Jackson-Stops. Thornton Cottage at Moorside, near Shaftesbury, is offered at Pounds 190,000 by Knight Frank &amp; Rutley and Michael de Pelet. Ware Farmhouse near Lyme Regis, with spectacular views of the Dorset coast, is with Jackson-Stops at around Pounds 350,000 while an inland farmhouse, Benville House near Dorchester - which has a paddock available for anyone who fancies hunting with the Cattistock - is offered at over Pounds 250,000 by Symonds &amp; Sampson. The Old Forge in the lovely village of Milton Abbas is also on offer from Savills at around Pounds 170,000. Sailors will think hard about Moriconium Quay at Poole harbour. It is a new 'Mediterranean-style' development of apartments and houses on 125-year leases, each of which has a 43ft berth for a boat right on the doorstep. Prices at the Quay - Moriconium is the Roman name for Poole - start at Pounds 285,000 from Savills.</p>

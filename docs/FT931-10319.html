			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Escaping from the Euro-VAT maze A CHANGE in the VAT rules brought about by the creation of the single European market has led to an anxious time for at least one British company. Northern Tooling Reclamation, a Wetherby-based company which reconditions industrial power tools, went through a difficult few weeks when it feared it might lose a large chunk of its continental European business. New EC rules which required it to start charging VAT on European deliveries led to threats from several of its agents that they would no longer be able to act for the British company. To make matters worse, confirmation of the rule change did not come through until early December, just three weeks before they took effect. Northern Tooling, with sales of just over Pounds 1m - half of them exports - and a workforce of 60, has found a way of absorbing the impact of the new tax rules. But only by paying Pounds 20,000 into a special bank account from which it will make VAT transfers to UK Customs. This avoids charging VAT to its European customers but means it ties up a large sum of its own money and takes on an extra administrative burden. 'If we had not had the cash to provide the VAT cash pool and remove the need for our agents to carry the VAT cost we would have lost their orders,' says Kenneth Sutcliffe, chairman of the 17-year-old company. The problem arose when Northern Tooling's activities were classified as 'repair', and subject to VAT, rather than 'process', which is not. Previously no VAT was payable on EC exports so the distinction did not matter. The company told its continental agents that it would add 17.5 per cent VAT to all its invoices from January 1. But when Northern Tooling's agents made their own inquiries, some said they were told by their local VAT authorities that they had no knowledge of the change. Sutcliffe checked again with UK Customs, who confirmed the new regulation, but was told there should be no problem because the agents would be able to reclaim the VAT. But since the agents had other suppliers who did not require them to get involved in VAT red tape, they felt they could live without Northern Tooling. Setting up the special bank account provides a short-term solution but it ties up Pounds 20,000 worth of badly needed capital. Northern Tooling will be able to reclaim the VAT from UK customs but there is a time delay between the initial payment and the repayment. It will also result in Northern Tooling paying over VAT to Customs only to claim it back almost immediately. Administering the bank account has meant that Northern Tooling has had to obtain power of attorney from its agents to claim the VAT refund. It has also had to come to an agreement with UK Customs for it to accept photocopies of its invoices rather than the originals. Customs has said it will look at ways to speed up the clearing of Northern Tooling's VAT refunds so that the impact on the company's cash flow is minimised. It will also lobby in Brussels for a change in the rules so that 'repair of goods' can be zero-rated. Like many other UK businessmen faced with single market changes Sutcliffe feels he is the victim of overzealous interpretation of the rules by UK Customs. But claims that the VAT authorities in other countries are more lax are hard to verify and Customs says it has to assume its counterparts on the continent are applying the rules. Nevertheless, this episode has been a nasty shock for Sutcliffe and exposed the vulnerability of his business to decisions taken by bureaucrats in Brussels and London. 'Had any of our major agents pulled out this would have placed a serious strain on our business,' he says. 'In normal circumstances we might have taken this in our stride but we are at the bottom of a recession. Who benefits?'</p>

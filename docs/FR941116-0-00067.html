			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Order No. 561, the Commission adopted section 342.4(b) of the regulations, which provides that: ``Until the carrier establishes that it lacks market power, these rates will be subject to the applicable ceiling level under &sect;342.3.'' This rule builds on that requirement by requiring an oil pipeline to file an application for a market power determination rather than a rate filing under the ICA. Only after the Commission concludes that the oil pipeline lacks significant market power in the markets in which it proposes to charge market-based rates may it file market-based rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AOPL, Kaneb, and Marathon argue that the Commission has overstepped its authority under the ICA by precluding an oil pipeline from charging market-based rates until the Commission has determined that the oil pipeline lacks significant market power in the relevant markets. The AOPL and Kaneb maintain that the Commission will be improperly suspending market-based rates indefinitely when Section 15(7) of the ICA permits suspensions for a period no longer than seven months. They both contend that the Commission's procedure is unnecessary in light of the ICA's refund mechanism, which protects the public interest. The AOPL further maintains that the Commission is acting inconsistently with its approach to market-based determinations for gas storage rates while Kaneb contends that the Commission has not justified disparate treatment between market-based rate filings and cost-of-service based rate filings, which will be allowed to become effective, subject to refund. Marathon maintains that the Commission will violate Section 6(3) of the ICA by opening an investigation before either a rate can be filed or go into effect. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6(3) of the ICA provides: No change shall be made in the rates, fares, and charges or joint rates, fares, and charges which have been filed and published by any common carrier in compliance with the requirements of this section, except after thirty days' notice to the Commission and to the public published as aforesaid, which shall be plainly indicated upon the schedules in force at the time and kept open to public inspection: Provided, That the Commission may, in its discretion and for good cause shown, allow changes upon less than the notice herein specified, or modify the requirements of this section in respect to publishing, posting, and filing of tariffs, either in particular instances or by a general order applicable to special or peculiar circumstances or conditions: Provided further, That the Commission is authorized to make suitable rules and regulations for the simplification of schedules of rates, fares, charges, and classifications and to permit in such rules and regulations the filing of an amendment of change in any rate, fare, charge, or classification without filing complete schedules covering rates, fares, charges or classification not changed if, in its judgement, not inconsistent with the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

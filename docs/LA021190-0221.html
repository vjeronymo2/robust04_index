			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIEW FROM THE BENCH ISN'T ANY BETTER FOR TITANS  </P> <P> Exasperated, John Sneed turned on his heel and walked down the bench, picking  out one player after another.  </P> <P> You, you, you and you -- into the game.  </P> <P> He didn't like what he saw on the court of the Spanos Center, where his Cal  State Fullerton team was trailing University of the Pacific by two points in  the second half of Saturday's Big West Conference game. So he sent in the  substitutes with 15:32 left in the game.  </P> <P> By the time he sent the starters back, 2 1/2 minutes later, Fullerton had  fallen behind by six. The Titans never recovered and finished with a 78-73  loss, their 10th defeat in 13 road games this season.  </P> <P> It was the sort of coaching move that cuts both ways. Win, and he's a master  motivator. Lose, and it's open season for second-guessing.  </P> <P> Sneed said he had no regrets.  </P> <P> "We were as flat as we've been in a long time," he said. "For whatever reason,  we were flat. I was upset with our play at both ends of the floor. I thought it  would be good if I got them out for a second so they could see the view from my  seat."  </P> <P> With the starters sitting, Fullerton (12-10 overall, 6-7 in the Big West) had a  lineup on the floor that was averaging a combined 12.7 points.  </P> <P> "The bottom line was they weren't much better, either," Sneed said.  </P> <P> When the starters returned, the score was 55-49 with 13:03 to play. But they  didn't come back and turn it around, instead falling further behind.  </P> <P> Even after the sit-down, Fullerton wasn't at full strength for much of the  second half. Mark Hill was on the bench after picking up his fourth foul with  10 minutes to play. He played only nine minutes in the second half, finishing  with 18 points. Wayne Williams sat out much of the second half, too, playing  only 12 minutes after halftime.  </P> <P> By the time Hill and Williams returned for the stretch run, Fullerton trailed  by 11, at 70-59, with 2:31 left.  </P> <P> "I tried to do what I could the last few minutes," said Williams, who hit  back-to-back three pointers around the one-minute mark and finished with 17  points. "I can't speak for the rest of the team, but I came ready to play."  </P> <P> Pacific (13-9, 6-7) has won more games this season than in the past two  combined, when they went 5-24 and 7-21.  </P> <P> The Tigers held on down the stretch, led by Anthony Woods' 16 points, including  eight consecutive free throws in the final 1:26, and Dell Demps' 16.  </P> <P> The loss was the Titans' second on the road in three days, both against teams  below them in the conference standings.  </P> <P> But losing on the road is nothing unusual for this team. For all their good  intentions, the Titans are 3-10 away from home this season, 1-7 against  conference opponents, with the only victory over Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> Fullerton's struggle Saturday was more pronounced than usual. Cedric Ceballos,  averaging 23 points, scored only 15 on five-of-17 shooting.  </P> <P> "Like always, we get out a little but can't put it away," Ceballos said. "I  don't know why, but it's hard for us on the road for some reason. We go through  the same pregame plan as at home. I don't know. . . . "  </P> <P> Ceballos played 35 minutes.  </P> <P> "I don't think (the starters' sit-down) made a difference," he said.  </P> <P> Hill agreed.  </P> <P> "We didn't come out too well," he said. "I've got faith in the other players on  my team. I don't know if everyone has that point of view. But I don't think  that was the critical point of the game."  </P> <P> The road has been critical to the Titans' season.  </P> <P> In Titan Gym, Fullerton is averaging 85 points a game. On the road, the average  is 69. At home, Fullerton is shooting 50% from the field. On the road, 41%.  </P> <P> "I don't know why," Ceballos said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Titan Notes  </P> <P> Cedric Ceballos has been chosen to compete in a dunk contest at the Final Four  in Denver in April. Ceballos is one of eight players selected for the contest,  which will be televised by ESPN. The list of other participants is not yet  final. . . . Look-alikes: Fullerton reserve guard Dareck Crane and Michael  Jordan, in the opinion of Mel Franks, Fullerton sports information director.  </P></p>

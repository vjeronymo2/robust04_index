			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 10, 1992, the Department published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and invited comments from interested parties regarding proposed or recommended regulatory actions to be taken by the Department. 57 FR 41447.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 29, 1992, the Department published an interim final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , providing the opportunity for comment. 57 FR 62004. Amendments to the rule were published on June 3, 1993. 58 FR 31471.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over 400 sets of comments were received in response to the interim final rule. Sources of comments by the close of the comment period were as follows: Private industry councils (99); service delivery areas (72); service providers (41); States (39); community-based organizations (33); public interest groups (31); State JTPA offices (28); private contractors (14); State education agencies (10); Federal agencies (8); unions (7); private citizens (7); State job training coordinating councils (6); members of Congress (2); and other sources (4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, on March 24, 1992, the Department published proposed rules in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for the Clean Air Employment Transition Assistance program under JTPA title III, providing the opportunity to comment. 57 FR 10232. Thirteen sets of comments were received from State, substate entities and other organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department fully considered these comments and other comments received in time to consider in the development of this final regulation and addresses the issues they raised in the following discussion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, during the period of May through July, 1994, when this final rule was in development, the Department initiated a Dialogue with the employment and training community and others interested in the JTPA title II program for the disadvantaged. This Dialogue was initiated by a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice published on May 18, 1994, and consisted principally of a series of fifteen small group and town hall meetings and a review of research on employment and training programs with a view to developing an action plan to improve title II programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Approach to Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These regulations continue to provide substantial responsibility and discretion to States and local areas in developing policy and in implementing procedures for JTPA programs. Thus, in many instances in these final regulations, responsibility for certain decisions is vested in the State and in the service delivery areas (SDA's) and substate grantees (SSG's).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has attempted in these final regulations to foster improved customer services by eliminating or reducing unnecessary programmatic requirements wherever possible so that decisions on how to best serve JTPA customers will be made, to the maximum extent possible, at the level of customer service and based upon customer need. For example, some of the restrictions on the duration of certain activities, such as work experience and entry employment experience where not specifically provided for in the Act, have been eliminated. Rather than Federal regulation, the needs of the customer as determined in the assessment process and the intervention's likelihood of success in enhancing skills and achieving long term employment will dictate how the program intervention will be designed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This was also a theme from the title II Dialogue. Some of the principal themes suggested by the title II Dialogue were the following: (1) Greater program flexibility with accountability, (2) Greater support for longer-term training interventions, including approaches more customized to customer needs and better connections between training and jobs, (3) Improved coordination at all levels but with special attention to coordination among federal agencies, (4) Increased supportive services, (5) More streamlining of eligibility, and (6) Better access for community-based organizations to JTPA planning and service delivery. To the extent permitted by the rulemaking process, the Department considered the major themes from the Dialogue in this final rule. In several instances, there are changes in this final rule that are consistent with the themes of the Dialogue. For example, as noted above, certain prior restrictions have been eliminated; initial efforts to achieve greater coordination with the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services and Housing and Urban Development are reflected in this final rule; the Department has attempted to streamline the requirements for providing participants with financial assistance; and these final regulations clarify that, as appropriate, the new eligibility provisions for youth are applied in the program under section 123 and title II-B. In addition, the Department will reexamine the Eligibility Documentation Technical Assistance Guide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), these regulations are limited to those areas which are specifically required by statute, identified by the Department or the public as necessary to provide guidance and clarification, or essential to further the purposes of the Act. Additionally, the Department fully intends to provide strong oversight and monitoring of JTPA programs in conjunction with strengthened State and local oversight and monitoring. It is through the monitoring of the implementation of the Amendments and these regulations, rather than through promulgation of prescriptive regulations, that the Department, working with the States and service delivery and substate areas, will ensure effective program operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

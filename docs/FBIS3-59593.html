			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Takis Kambilis: "Telecommunications Blockade"] </F>   [Text] For almost two years now, the Turks have been  planning a telecommunications blockade of Greece from the  Balkans and also from the geopolitically important region of  East Europe and the Middle East.    Already, three ultramodern fiber optic nets are being built  by Italy and Turkey for the purpose of linking the European  Economic Community to the Balkan countries and to the former  Soviet republics on the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.    The central point of these nets, that have major economic  significance, will be Istanbul. According to the plans, not one  of these nets will pass through Greece. As experts explain, the  result will be Greece's being cut off economically from these  regions--and, in fact, from the Balkans--since it is evident  that ultramodern telecommunications constitute a prerequisite  for every form of economic and social development in modern  societies.    More specifically, one of the three nets, that is expected  to  be put into service in about a year, will link Bari, Italy, with  Tirana, Skopje, Sofia and Istanbul, leaving Greece completely  out of the planning.    Prof. Kostas Makropoulos, former OTE [Greek  Telecommunications Organization] and community specialist on  telecommunications issues, was the one who revealed the details  of the plan and the dangers posed for Greece from a  telecommunications blockade. He attributed responsibility to the  previous government since the agreements involved were signed in  December 1992 and the technical projects inaugurated in May 1993.    Mr. Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist  Movement] secretary general, has already been informed on the  matter, while a relevant file will probably be given to Minister  of National Defense Yerasimos Arsenis today.  <H5>  The Plans </H5>   Specifically, from the relevant documents and maps, it  appears that on 2 December 1992 contracts were signed for the  implementation of the three plans to set up a telecommunications  infrastructure lasting 25 years. The ITUR links Italy with  Turkey and Ukraine with Russia. This net starts out in Palermo,  goes to Istanbul and from there, via Ankara, heads for Odessa  (and Novorossiisk, Russia). Its length is 3,500 kilometers,  while it is expected to go into service at the end of 1995. The  technical meeting took place on 25-28 May 1993 and the second  that took place a month ago concerned the building of five pairs  of fiber optics at 565 MB/sec with 38,400 circuits.    The second plan that is called DOKAR concerns the linking of  Istanbul and Ankara with the eastern shores of the Black Sea.  Its two other big stations are Tbilisi and Baku.It also has the  same huge capacity of 565 MB that, however, abruptly drops to 34  MB when the net reaches Georgia. It has been planned to go into  operation sometime in 1994.    The third (and best) net is the Trans-Balkan Link. It begins  in Bari and goes to Durres, Tirana, Skopje, Sofia, Sliven and  Istanbul that is the central city station for all three nets.  The relevant agreement was signed five months later, on 6 May  1993. We have here 1,920 140 MB circuits and 7,650 622 MB  circuits. Beginning of service is also planned for sometime in  1994.    Finally, there are also plans for linking the Black Sea  shores that include Romania.  <H5>  Northern Cyprus </H5>   Besides the Balkan telecommunications arc that is being  promoted, the Turks have also included another fiber optic net  that will link up with Turkish-held northern Cyprus.    As Mr. Makropoulos explained, the Turkish plan constitutes  one of the most developed forms of an exercise of political and  economic pressure that is founded on the development of new  technologies. The country that will constitute the central  telecommunications junction of a major geographic region not  only will earn billions of dollars from the use of this net by  third parties but it will automatically acquire a privileged  entry into the countries that will be linked with Europe.    Mr. Makropoulos further explained, "Fiber optics today  constitute the linchpin of the community's telecommunications  policy for the coming decades. This is so because they are much  cheaper than satellites and have much greater capacities. In  other words, they are able to send to another given region  images, sound and information in the shortest possible time. I  will cite as an example that a 140 MB net can send information  on 7,500 typed pages in the space of one second!"    As Mr. Makropoulos said, all the added value services are  based on these nets as are the rapid development of activities  such as tourism, trade, technical projects, cultural relations  and, finally, privileged entry of a given country into third  countries since the latter depend on--in this case--Turkey.    The cost of the investment is big but for this too,  according  to Mr. Makropoulos, there is expectation for community subsidies!    Mr. Makropoulos added, "Unfortunately, these facts reveal  how  the New Democracy party exercised such an unrealistic and  nationally dangerous policy in a field like telecommunications."</p>

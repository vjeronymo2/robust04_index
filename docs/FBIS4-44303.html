			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by George Jones and Philip Johnston: "Portillo </F> Puts on Pressure for Changes in Europe"]    [Text] Tory Right-wingers, led by Mr Michael Portillo,  served notice last night that the decision to veto Mr Jean-Luc  Dehaene as European Commission president should mark the start  of a campaign to change the direction of the Community.    As Mr Major basked in the praise of Conservative MPs on his  return from the Corfu summit, the party's Eurosceptic wing began  to reassert its influence.    Mr Portillo, the Treasury Chief Secretary, used a speech in  Barcelona to increase the pressure on Mr Major to adopt a robust  stance in Europe in defence of free market policies and less  state interference in economic and social issues.    He scorned suggestions that Britain's more sceptial approach  meant that it would "miss the bus" in Europe. "This imagery can  be misleading," he said. "It suggests that speed is more  important than direction."    Mr Portillo's speech will increase concern among EC leaders  that Mr Major is under growing domestic pressure to return to  the more confrontational attitude towards Europe adopted by Lady  Thatcher.    The Euro-sceptics kept a low profile during the European  elections, but are now emboldened by indications of a shift of  emphasis in the Government towards a more critical posture.    After successfully putting pressure on Mr Major to veto the  appointment of Mr Dehaene, the Right is seeking to ensure that  he will take further steps to halt the integration of Europe in  the run-up to the next Maastricht-style conference in 1996. The  Prime Minister won an enthusiastic welcome at Westminster from  Tory Euro-sceptics for his decision to block Mr Dehaene, the  Belgian prime minister and a federalist in the mould of M  Jacques Delors, the outgoing president.    Although his action has plunged Europe into crisis, his  backbenchers were delighted that a strong stand had been taken  in defence of the country's interests.    They packed the Commons, waving order papers in a show of  solidarity. The biggest cheer came when Mr Major said that  "being a good European does not mean signing up to everything  which our partners propose."    It was the most confident performance he has given since his  leadership was questioned last autumn.    The one discordant note on the Tory side was sounded by Sir  Edward Heath. He said that use of the veto was "a matter for  regret, not for rejoicing."    Mr Kenneth Baker, the former party chairman, said that Mr  Major had taken "a courageous and popular decision."    Mrs Margaret Beckett, the Labour leader, said Mr Major was  the "prisoner of the Euro-sceptics." Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal  Democrat leader, said he had attempted to "portray the Punch and  Judy farce at Corfu as Henry V at Agincourt, with himself in the  title role."    Mr Major emphasised that he was sticking to his guns. He  said: "I believe that there are a number of well-qualified  people who could take on this post on the basis of a genuinely  common accord."    Downing Street reaffirmed later that Mr Major remained ready  to use the veto again if need be.    Mr Dehaene hinted yesterday that he might pull out of the  race while Germany, which assumes the rotating EC presidency on  Friday [1 July], embarked on a search for a compromise candidate.    The acrimony surrounding the blackballing of Mr Dehaene was  reinforced when Downing Street sought to blame the crisis on the  way France and Germany had tried to push him forward without  proper consultation.    Officials said that Chancellor Kohl had not told Mr Major  that he backed Mr Dehaene when the two leaders met in London in  April, and claimed that he had not made up his mind, although Mr  Major disclosed then that Sir Leon Brittan was his choice.    German insistence that they did not have a candidate  continued even after reports that Herr Kohl and President  Mitterrand had struck a deal at a meeting in Mulhouse last month  to support Mr Dehaene.</p>

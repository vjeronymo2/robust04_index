			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Amoco wins Polish oil exploration concession POLAND yesterday granted its first post-war exploration concession to Amoco, the US petroleum company, which is to spend Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.2m) on looking for oil and gas south of Warsaw and east of Lublin, near the former Soviet frontier. The deal, covering rights to 10,000 sq km, arises from a contract signed in 1989 for Amoco to do a survey based on what was known of Poland's domestic energy resources. It comes in the midst of tendering by other foreign companies for oil exploration rights to a further 35,000 sq km of the country. A tender has also just closed for coal bed methane gas exploration; six foreign companies, including Amoco, applied. Poland is dependent on supplies of Russian gas for two-thirds of its 13bn cubic metres annual consumption, while almost all its oil is imported from Russia and the Middle East. Natural gas reserves are now put at 170bn cu m, while as yet undocumented resources are estimated at 630bn cu m The World Bank has granted the state a Dollars 250m loan for the development of the gas industry while the European Investment Bank has provided Dollars 60m. Russia's top corruption fighter yesterday accused crooked western businessmen of siphoning off three-quarters of the profits due to his country from its dwindling sales of oil abroad, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Mikhail Gurtovoy, who heads a government anti-corruption team, said Russia, pushed by its need for foreign investment in the energy sector, had let in a 'swarm of petty crooks' from abroad when it allowed foreign and Russian companies to set up oil-producing joint ventures.</p>

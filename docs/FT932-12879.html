			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Sanctions set to isolate the Serb economy THE WORLD began tightening the economic noose around the rump Yugoslavia yesterday after Bosnia's Serbs defied international pressure and rejected a United Nations-sponsored plan to end the civil war in Bosnia. The self-styled Bosnian Serb assembly, which has no international recognition, announced yesterday that it would reject the plan to divide Bosnia into 10 ethnic provinces although sanctions on Yugoslavia were certain to be stepped up. The assembly rejected the plan in spite of a last-minute appeal from Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic and his Montenegrin and Yugoslav counterparts. The message warned the deputies gathered in the Bosnian frontier town of Bijelina that they had 'no right to endanger 10m citizens of Yugoslavia because of . . . some minor points'. The US and France said they would take immediate action to freeze Yugoslav assets, and last night President Bill Clinton said that the US and its allies must come up with a 'stronger policy' on Bosnia. He said he hoped to announce new US proposals shortly after discussions with Congress. The tougher sanctions won support from Russia. The measures include a land, sea and air trade embargo that will virtually isolate Serbia and Montenegro, the remaining Yugoslav republics, from the rest of the world. Within hours of the vote, other countries began to tighten the sanctions, which have brought the Yugoslav economy to its knees since they were imposed last May in retaliation for Belgrade's support for the Bosnian Serb war machine. As western countries scrambled to find a new diplomatic direction on Bosnia, , Yugoslav and Serb leaders said they still sought to end the year-old civil war through diplomacy. In Bonn, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, called for the reconvening of the EC-chaired Yugoslav peace conference - excluding the warring parties - so that the west and its allies could agree on new moves to bring peace to the region. 'We are not saying the peace plan has failed,' the German Foreign Ministry said last night. 'If we said that, we would have to have an alternative, and nobody sees alternatives. We are saying the plan is temporarily rejected.' The participants in the EC peace conference, convened in London by the British government last year when it occupied the chair of the EC Council of Ministers, included the US, Russia, Japan and Canada, as well as Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the 12 EC member states, and all the countries bordering Yugoslavia. Mr Kinkel and Lord Owen, the EC peace envoy, both avoided any suggestion of military action. Lord Owen said the price of cutting Serbian supply lines might be too high if it meant an end to humanitarian relief for the civilian population. In Sarajevo, a UN official said Serb forces ringing Srebrenica were asking 150 Canadian UN peacekeeping troops to leave, saying it had not been properly demilitarised as laid down in a ceasefire accord. The official said the Serbs had not set a deadline for the withdrawal, and emphasised that the UN had no intention of pulling out its peacekeepers. The Serb demand came as Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, promised to allow free access to Srebrenica for UN relief convoys and French aid doctors. Foreign ministers of 52 Islamic countries meeting in Karachi, last night adopted a resolution calling upon the UN Security Council to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia-Hercegovina immediately and impose a blockade on Serbia and Montenegro, writes Farhan Bokhari in Karachi. They also stressed Bosnia's 'inherent right of individual and collective self-defence' and urged the Council to take further appropriate measures including authorisation of the use of force. A session of the conference today will be devoted to securing monetary help for Bosnia. Saudi Arabia yesterday announced a Dollars 20m donation. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

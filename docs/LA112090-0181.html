			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> KEEP QUIET, RABIN URGES SHAMIR  </P> <P> Former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak  Shamir today to keep his mouth shut about the occupied territories so the world  could focus on the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> The 75-year-old Shamir, risking a dispute with Israel's chief ally -- the  United States -- told supporters of his rightist Likud Party on Sunday that  Israel should hold "Greater Israel," from the sea to the River Jordan, for  Jewish immigration.  </P> <P> "It was a completely pathetic and unnecessary remark at a time when the  American effort is directed at focusing everything on the aggression of Saddam  Hussein," said Rabin, 68, of the leading opposition Labor Party.  </P></p>

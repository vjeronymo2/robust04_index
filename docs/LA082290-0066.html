			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GERMAN UNITY ACCORD UNRAVELS WITHIN HOURS;  </P> <P> POLITICS: MAJOR PARTIES IN THE EAST BRIEFLY AGREED THAT OCT. 14 SHOULD BE THE  DATE FOR UNIFICATION. BUT THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING FOR SEPT. 15.  </P> <P> East Germans worked out an agreement Tuesday on political unity between the two  Germanys for Oct. 14, but it unraveled within hours, adding to the mounting  confusion about the unification process.  </P> <P> The brief accord between the major East German political parties appeared to  have ended weeks of chaos and bitter infighting over the date for unification.  </P> <P> But, soon thereafter, East Germany's second-biggest party, the Social  Democratic Party, backed away from the approval given by its leader in  Parliament, Richard Schroeder, and declared that it would not agree to the  October date.  </P> <P> It quickly became apparent that Schroeder had agreed to Oct. 14 without  consulting with other members of his party in Parliament.  </P> <P> Schroeder promptly resigned and was replaced by the party chairman, Wolfgang  Thierse. Then, after a marathon meeting of the party's 88 members of  Parliament, Thierse announced late Tuesday that the Social Democrats would  stick with their demand that unification take place earlier, preferably on  Sept. 15.  </P> <P> The episode underscored the unpredictable nature of the fledgling East German  democracy, which, with little experience and no tradition, has lurched from  crisis to crisis in the four months since it was created.  </P> <P> The agreement reached early Tuesday appeared to have been an important  concession by the Social Democrats, who had pushed for early unification in an  effort to stem the disintegration of the East German economy.  </P> <P> East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, who announced the earlier accord  to reporters in East Berlin, said that 10 of the 12 parties represented in the  Volkskammer, or Parliament, had agreed to meet in special session on Oct. 9 to  prepare a declaration of unity.  </P> <P> Only the Communists, now known as the Party of Democratic Socialism, and  Bundnis 90, a small group that played a key part in last autumn's revolution,  initially opposed the move. They wanted unity on the day of the first  all-German elections, scheduled for Dec. 2.  </P> <P> Uncertainty over the terms of unity has slowed West German investment in East  Germany to below expected levels, and West German government officials have  complained that key financial assistance has been seriously slowed by East  German bureaucracy.  </P> <P> Political figures on both sides agreed that accelerating the pace of unity  would likely help with these problems.  </P> <P> Hans-Jochen Vogel, chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, and  Oskar Lafontaine, the Social Democratic candidate for chancellor in the  December elections, issued a joint statement emphasizing the need for clarity  in the unity process, but even that indicated a desire to stick with the  earlier date.  </P> <P> "We'd have liked it (unity) even earlier," Lafontaine told a radio interviewer.  </P> <P> Some Social Democrats, in both German parliaments, had called for immediate  unity. But West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and De Maiziere have resisted the  earlier date, claiming that it would interfere with international commitments.  </P> <P> Unity before mid-September would put it ahead of the final round of talks on  international aspects of unification, talks involving both Germanys and the  World War II allies, the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> These talks are scheduled for Sept. 12 in Moscow, and a final accord could be  initialed there by the six foreign ministers.  </P> <P> Also, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher is expected to obtain  a go-ahead on unification from the foreign ministers of many East and West  European countries at a meeting in New York, on Oct. 2, of the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe. All the countries of Europe except Albania  are represented in the organization.  </P></p>

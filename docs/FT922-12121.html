			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / From catastrophe to mere crisis: Russia is embarking on a new phase of economic reform which could reignite inflation For Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform in Russia, the past week has been the end of his beginning. He and his team of reformers have survived the popular disaffection over price liberalisation. They have also survived a Congress of Peoples' Deputies in which their policies were excoriated. Now begins a new period: over the past few days, senior government ministers have stressed that it will usher in significant modifications to the reform process. The turn in policy is not being executed because of intolerable popular pressure: the anti-government demonstrations have been poorly attended, while the Congress, though showing an anti-reform majority, has been manipulated into surly acquiescence. Both the street protests and the Congress have been deeply inhibited by the fact that they do not represent real voters. Their most active leaders are former Communists who, although they can profit rhetorically from the harshness of the government's measures, cannot reap real political rewards because of the reluctance of the population to give them their trust. The ruin the government inherited is the Communists' principal legacy. Their rhetoric cannot hide this truth. The policy change has been made more because of fears of the future, than because of the pressures of the present. Mr Gaidar, the reform's architect, made this clear when he said in an interview that 'we have had three years of strong negative growth from 1988 to 1991. We paid for the absence of reforms: now we must pay for reforms. We cannot stand three more years of that: one year only (1992) is possible. The long-term structural agony of this economy will create a very unpleasant situation - we must get growth.' As the government has repeated many times over the past week or two, the 'successes' of the first quarter of the year permit some relaxation. Mr Gaidar insists, for example, that in the first three months of the year the budget was balanced: the Ministry of Finance says there was a deficit of about 1 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product on an actual expenditure basis and 5 per cent on the basis of commitments, although international financial institutions suspect it may be about 10 per cent. Even so, fiscal policy has been a success, particularly when output in the first quarter is estimated to have fallen by more than 13 per cent from the level of the same quarter of 1991. The budget deficit of the Russian Federation was, after all, about 20 per cent of GDP in 1991, allowing for Russia's share of the revenue and expenditures of the former Soviet Union. What is more, after serious teething difficulties, the Ministry of Finance has achieved something that has eluded most post-Communist governments: the establishment of a reliable source of revenue independent of profits in the state enterprise sector. Revenue from value-added tax has risen from Rbs10.5bn (Dollars 68m at market exchange rate) in January, to Rbs32bn in February and then to Rbs54bn in March. To this will soon be added taxation of both domestic consumption and exports of oil and gas as their prices are raised towards world levels. The new system of trade regulation, too, suffered from initial difficulties in January, following the introduction of a new system of export taxation. But postponement of the export taxes, introduction of a market exchange rate for hard currency and curtailment of administrative regulations reversed the declining trend in exports. In February they rose to Dollars 3.8bn, from Dollars 2.2bn in the previous month, while in March they rose to Dollars 4.8bn. Meanwhile, rescheduling of payments of principal on medium- and long-term loans due in 1992 has saved Russia Dollars 11bn of the Dollars 21bn that comes due this year. The foreign exchange position is moving from the catastrophic to the merely critical. Equally successful, if more brutal, was the price liberalisation at the beginning of the year. As has happened elsewhere, notably in Poland, prices climbed much more rapidly than the government forecast. Official estimates are that prices rose three and a half times in January and by another two-thirds from January to March. Unofficial estimates suggest that they rose still more. This surge in prices has lowered officially estimated real incomes by 40 per cent, thus eliminating queues, the growing disequilibrium between nominal wages and the nominal value of output, and the 'monetary overhang', or unspendable store of roubles, which had been among the main issues in the previous two years. At the end of last year the stock of broad money (M2 on the Russian definition) was about 60 per cent of GDP. By the end of March 1992 that ratio had fallen to well below a quarter. Inevitably, money became very short, particularly cash, the demand for which (at the present face value of the notes) surpassed the capacity of the four printing plants (all located in Russia): many workers have been told that there is no cash for their wages. Nor should one ignore the most visible, if least quantifiable, success: the liberalisation of commerce. The pavements of Moscow have become the site of one of the world's most densely thronged street bazaars. This may add little to Russia's output; it may, indeed, be extremely inefficient; but it says much about the entrepreneurship of a population for which such activity was long a criminal, if not a capital, offence. These 'successes' have had a high price. Output has fallen further from an already deeply depressed level. It has become clear, above all, that industry will not respond unaided and unprompted to the hidden hand of a still wildly imperfect market. Unsurprisingly, post-Soviet enterprise managers have pushed up their prices, stockpiled the goods they cannot sell and sent good to other enterprises without any likelihood of payment. Inter-enterprise indebtedness has risen from Rbs39bn at the beginning of the year to Rbs900bn by mid-April. Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, who receives a steady stream of such managers in his office in the former Gosplan state planning commission building in the centre of Moscow, has noticed an encouraging shift in their petitions: they no longer assume he can help them with supplies, but want him to dole out cheap money. Instead, he claims, he tells them to cut their prices, wages and staff. However, he also now offers some help. He will soon authorise Rbs200bn in extra investment credits from the Central Bank of Russia over the next six months, of which Rbs120bn will go to industrial companies that, in his view, can use it for sensible investment. This in turn, would produce marketable goods. He has put aside Rbs42bn to assist defence conversion (not much, given the scale of the problem) and another Rbs40bn for social protection of displaced workers in the military sector. Mr Nechayev hopes to pick a few winners, but also wants to force a few losers to the wall. He expects that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, will soon sign a decree on bankruptcy. This will allow the government to force 10 or 15 companies into liquidation: a small beginning, but an important demonstration to others of the consequence of failure. The right way for the government to proceed, as it has recognised in its memorandum to the International Monetary Fund of last month, is via rapid structural change. The list of requirements is long, the obstacles high and the technical difficulties immense. What is needed embraces: price liberalisation, including the raising of energy prices to world levels, expected to be achieved by the end of 1993, starting with a sixfold increase in prices of crude petroleum from Rbs350 to Rbs2,000-2,500 a ton; auction of small-scale shops and enterprises (recently started in just a few cities); private ownership of land; privatisation of food production and distribution; demonopolisation of industry; commercialisation of larger enterprises, leading to mass privatisation in early 1993; liberalisation of international trade; and effective convertibility of the rouble, including for interest, dividends and capital inflows. Yet Mr Gaidar also argues, probably rightly, that the Russian economy needs to be 'remonetised'. Unfortunately, the monetary grease is to be provided by the central bank, a point on which, it should be noted, the government and the central bank do not now disagree. Pointing to the shortage of money in the economy, which is one characteristic of an economy teetering on the brink of hyperinflation, the Central Bank of Russia is expecting an increase in the money supply of between 50 and 120 per cent this year. Some of that will come from monetisation of the budget deficit, expected to remain at about 5 per cent of GDP. A credit line to the Ministry of Finance of Rbs67bn has just been established. More will come from the Rbs200bn promised to enterprises, while another Rbs70-80bn will come from schemes of Mr Gyorgy Matiukhin, the chairman of the central bank. Applying the multiplier of 2-2.5 on central bank credit deemed normal in Russia, the resulting credit expansion is already Rbs700-850bn, or about 50 per cent of recent levels. No wonder that Mr Gaidar still talks of inflation running at an annual rate of 40 per cent at the end of the year, while Mr Matiukhin, probably more realistically, talks of 100 per cent. No wonder, too, that a 'crawling peg', or moving, exchange rate is seen as more realistic than a fixed one. The question is whether 'remonetisation' will prove a euphemism for resurgent inflation, especially when, even at its recently increased level of 50 per cent, the interest rate on credit from the central bank is far below the rate of inflation. These plans are bound to be of serious concern to western donors, including the International Monetary Fund, the staff of which is in discussion with the government this week. The planned stabilisation fund of Dollars 6bn would make little sense if the exchange rate were not to be fixed. The rouble market exchange rate, currently 150 to the dollar, is hugely undervalued. The exchange market is extremely thin. Nonetheless throwing dollars at it, in order to raise its level to Rbs40-50, as the government hopes, might prove ineffective if monetary expansion were not under secure control. The government of Russia deserves credit for what it has achieved. It deserves credit too for the ambitions it has for the future. Much - if not most - remains to be done, but the foundations are at last being laid. Unfortunately, the government already seems to be tempted by the easiest of all paths, the one to the printing press. If it is not careful, Russia will become not a market-oriented great power, but another Brazil, caught in a never-ending series of short-term inflationary cycles, each one reducing still further the credibility of its government and its capacity to govern. Mr Gaidar describes the need to print more money as 'terribly unpleasant'. It is worse than that. Inflationary finance is fraud. However tempting and however respectable, fraud is no basis on which to build the new democratic Russia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the Notes and Information Page: ``A Senate </F> Responsibility'']    [Text] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee must urgently  explain to the nation why it is keeping the Quadripartite  Agreement on the back burner. This agreement establishes a  series of safeguards for Argentine and Brazilian nuclear  activities. The least that can be expected is that there are  grave enough reasons -- which must be publicly explained -- to  justify an omission that will make Brazil subject to the  affronts normally piled on irresponsible governments. The  committee is not empowered to hold Brazilian foreign policy  hostage without clearly explaining the reasons behind such a  drastic measure. The highest national interest is at stake. The  silent inspiration of the representatives of false nationalism,  which also seek to become mentors of the nation's  representatives, cannot prevail over those interests.    The Quadripartite Agreement achieved in a single stroke an  inspired way of guaranteeing, in the eyes of the international  community, the peaceful purposes of Brazilian and Argentine  nuclear programs. It is a powerful instrument to build trust  between the two signatory countries. It is also worth noting  that Brazil has for some years suffered a variety of pressures  to join the Non- Proliferation Treaty [NPT]. It does not do so  because it believes the NPT is unacceptably discriminatory and  differentiates between those who have and those who do not have  nuclear weapons. In view of the progress in the nuclear  program, the simultaneous increase in international efforts to  achieve nonproliferation, and faced with the inescapable need to  raise the level of relations with Argentina, Brazil chose to  strengthen regional nuclear control instruments as a way to  guarantee the international community of our peaceful use of the  atom, and as a way to obtain the required approval to legitimize  this sensitive area.    The country acted on two fronts: First, the  Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear  Materials (ABACC) was created and the Quadripartite Agreement  was negotiated with Argentina, authorizing the ABACC and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to supervise and  control nuclear activities in the two countries. Second,  efforts were made to eliminate the obstacles that prevented  Brazil from accepting the Tlatelolco Treaty.    The purpose of this double action was, we repeat, to obtain  the international community's respect and credibility without  accepting the costs of the NPT. As a result, Brazil is possibly  the only country that does not have a nuclear weapon and which  did not sign the NPT. But in order to earn political profit  from this -- that is, credibility and respectability -- it is  necessary for Congress to approve the Quadripartite Agreement.  If that does not happen we will only encourage the  international community's general mistrust without a way to  counteract it.    Contrary to what is feared by narrow-minded and perhaps  well-  intentioned people, the Quadripartite Agreement does not  restrict our national sovereignty. Skillfully drafted, it does  not present obstacles for building a nuclear submarine and it  protects our autonomously obtained industrial and technological  achievements. The supplementary arrangements introduced into the  Agreement -- which originally raised doubts because of the scope  of regulations that could have gone beyond what was established  in the main body of the agreement -- were finally accepted in  the record time of two negotiating sessions, as a demonstration  that the IAEA has great political interest to see this  Quadripartite Agreement entering into effect quickly.    The Brazilian Government thinks likewise. The Senate must  approve the agreement before Brazil can join the Organization to  Ban Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Opanal), the agency  responsible for the implementation of the Tlatelolco Treaty.  The Opanal meeting scheduled for 7 December was postponed until  19 January at the request of the Brazilian Government. Opanal  directors expect that Brazil, Argentina, and Chile -- countries  that reviewed their positions on the Tlatelolco Treaty -- will  formally join the organization by that date. For Brazil,  joining Opanal now will mean influencing -- as the country with  the region's most complete nuclear program -- the organization's  working agenda that will be elaborated in January. From a  broader point of view, approval of the agreement will be  evidence of the respect Brazil has for joint efforts with the  Argentine and Chilean Foreign Ministries on this extremely  sensitive issue. By not joining, however, we will be ridiculed  for unnecessarily delaying the meeting. Brazil will also pay  the political price of showing, before the international  community, that the government is incapable of approving the  Quadripartite Agreement on time.    Congress has been convened for a special session and could  discuss international agreements and treaties as well as the  specific item on the agenda. There are, therefore, ways for the  Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate plenum to approve the  text of the agreement before 19 January. To fail to do so will  hurt the Brazilian image in the world.</p>

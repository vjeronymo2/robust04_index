			<p>BFN     [Text] The Electoral Commission has released the national  results of the parliamentary and presidential elections.  Announcing these in a press release, the Electoral Commission  said in the presidential race, the final results are as follows:  Mr. Bakili Muluzi, 1,404,754 votes; Dr. Kamuzu Banda, 996,363;  Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, 552,862 votes; Mr. Kampelo Kaluwa,  15,624.    In the parliamentary election the distribution of seats is  84  seats for UDF [United Democratic Front]; 65 seats for MCP  [Malawi Congress Party] and 36 seats for Aford [Alliance for  Democracy]; the rest of the contesting parties did not win a  single seat. The Electoral Commission has also nullified the  results in two constituencies in Nsanje, namely, Nsanje north  and Nsanje southwest. This follows the commission's  investigation of complaints of irregularities in these  constituencies. The commission discovered that at one station  figures kept by all monitors did not agree with the official  figure and that some important documents like ballot paper  counterfoils, original forms for results, were missing.    In another station, the ballot papers used during the  elections were missing. The elections in the two constituencies  will be rerun. The Electoral Commission will announce details  of the by-elections later.</p>

Zhu is expected to meet Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in Tokyo to discuss bilateral  issues, including ways Japan can support reform and open-door  policies in China, the sources said.    Zhu, who is regarded as a possible successor to Premier Li  Peng, will also seek increased investment from the Japanese  private sector in China at meetings with top business leaders.    During the 10-day visit, the vice premier also plans to  visit  Osaka and Fukuoka, western Japan, to inspect local business  activities and seek cooperation from private concerns.    Both nations agreed on Zhu's visit to Japan when Hata went  to  Beijing in January. Zhu's visit to Japan is the first since he  assumed his post in April 1991.</p>

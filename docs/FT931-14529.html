			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Mr Miyazawa edges forward THOSE WHO hoped that the Miyazawa doctrine, outlined in a speech by the Japanese prime minister in Bangkok at the weekend, would enunciate a set of clear principles and launch bold proposals for Asian economic and security co-operation will have been disappointed. He qualified Japan's commitment to democracy by stressing it would take a pragmatic approach to the development of human rights and made only one firm proposal - a forum to discuss the comprehensive development of Indo-China. Yet the speech should be welcomed as the clearest sign yet that Japan is gradually developing a more strategic approach to foreign relations, independent of its US mentor. Japan has long had a vital economic role within Asia as a source of capital and as a market for goods. By proposing this forum, Mr Miyazawa has taken Japan a further step into the political domain. With the US and the European Community preoccupied in the Balkans and the Middle East, Mr Miyazawa provided a timely reminder that Asia has its own tinder box of territorial disputes and that over the next decade the region's fast-growing economies may use their wealth to fund an Asian arms race. His speech was also important for what it ruled out - Japan's re-emergence as a military power and any ambition to create a trading bloc in response to the development of the EC or the North America Free Trade Association. It stressed the continued centrality of the US role in the region. Asian security is underpinned by a complicated web of agreements: US alliances; growing collaboration between Asean states; the five-power defence agreement involving the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore; Russia's military co-operation with China and its relations with Vietnam and North Korea. This complexity cannot be distilled into a single forum modelled on the Conference of Security and Co-operation in Europe. So Mr Miyazawa quite sensibly stressed the importance of promoting overlapping discussions leading to a mutually recognised sense of interdependence. However, the Miyazawa doctrine also implies the recognition of some difficult issues at home. His call for more open economies requires a more open Japanese rice market. His desire to defuse territorial conflicts points to a badly needed initiative from Tokyo on its dispute with Russia over islands known in Japan as the Northern Territories. These items are the short-term price of an emerging statesmanship from which Japan and the world have much to gain.</p>

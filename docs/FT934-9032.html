			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): CFCs make a hasty exit With manufacturers gearing up to phase out ozone-depleting cleaning fluids in 1994, a number of products and processes are appearing to replace materials which contain chlorofluorocarbons. In Faulbach, Germany, Grasmann WLS has developed a dry process for cleaning printed circuit boards in electronics manufacture. The process involves putting the boards in a plasma chamber where a high-frequency generator breaks down the normal bond between the electrons and the atomic nuclei in the offending particles, burning them off the surface. The Grasmann machines are distributed in the UK by Parkheath of Cardiff. Grasmann: Germany, 9392 8020. Parkheath: UK, 0222 462230.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- As a consequence of the election  defeat in Lower Saxony, Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]  Bundestag Deputy Wolfgang Lueder has called on his party to vote  for Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] candidate Johannes  Rau as president in the last ballot in the Federal Assembly on  23 May. "We should spell with the liberal alphabet in the  Bundestag election, in order to demonstrate independence,"  Lueder said in an interview with the BERLINER MORGENPOST  (Wednesday [16 March] edition). Accordingly, the FDP is to vote  for its candidate Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher -- who is said to have  no chances -- in the first two ballots, but for Rau in the last  ballot.    In this way, the FDP would also accept that the SPD is today  the strongest party and that only one SPD presidency (Gustav  Heinemann) in the FRG's era is "unhealthy" for the SPD, Lueder  said. North Rhine-Westphalian FDP Chairman Juergen Moellemann  had also advocated support for Rau. So far, the FDP leadership  in Bonn has refused to commit itself.</p>

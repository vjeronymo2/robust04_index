			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Wrong Reasoning"] </F>   [Text] Following the reciprocal visits paid by Iranian  journalists to several countries, namely Germany, Kuwait, and  Lebanon, some foreign policy and cultural officials came to  believe that they can seize this opportunity to establish a  dialogue between Iranian and American journalists as well, and  thus find a way to open the door of dialogue between the two  countries! Arranging the visit of 13 chief editors from  American publications to the Islamic Republic of Iran, which is  said to have taken place with the coordination of our country's  representation at the United Nations and the director general  for foreign mass media affairs at the Ministry of Culture and  Islamic Guidance, was apparently based on this same assumption.    Fortunately none of the chief editors of the Iranian  newspapers accepted the invitation to meet with the American  chief editors, and the plan failed. The conclusions that can be  drawn from this failure are noteworthy. First of all, the  Iranian chief editors' refusal to meet with the American chief  editors shows that a strong anti-American atmosphere still  exists in Iranian press circles, and the Americans should  realize that they are hated by all the social strata in Iran.    Secondly, in the past two days since the press raised this  issue, many people from various walks of life have called to  strongly criticize those who made the preparations for the  American chief editors' visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran  and to thank the Iranian chief editors for refusing to  participate in this dialogue. This means that the Iranian  nation's strong hatred for America continues.    Thirdly, if there are those in various parts of the system  of  the Islamic Republic with a "wrong reasoning" who think that  through such attempts, they can open a door to dialogue with  America, they are very mistaken and will be confronted with the  people's rage and negative responses. At any rate, public  opinion now expects the related sources to follow up the issue  and to clarify the situation.</p>

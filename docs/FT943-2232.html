			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Shaken and stirred Those inclined to look back will find plenty to grumble at in yesterday's restructuring announcement from Grand Metropolitan. The company seems unable to shake off an inclination to pile up provisions. The Pounds 280m charge announced yesterday, primarily for reorganisation of the drinks and European food business, follows a Pounds 175m charge a year ago for the US food and eye care businesses. If GrandMet really is trying clean up its accounts, why is it still resorting so heavily to exceptional charges? If the drinks business really is in need of surgery, why were its problems not addressed earlier? Cynics would say the new top team is simply setting itself up for a run of good operating profits. Yet those prepared to look forward must admit that the new approach is both reasonable and a reflection of GrandMet's growing internal strength. Disposals and cash generation have strengthened its balance sheet, so it can more easily cope with the outlay involved in restructuring. The latest programme will enable GrandMet to spend more on marketing its spirits brands, some of which have suffered slightly from neglect. Two big questions remain. GrandMet clearly needs to do something about its European food business, which lacks critical mass. The choice, left open in yesterday's announcement, is between expansion and winding down which might prove less risky. The other concern is whether the weakness of the spirits business reflects fundamental pricing troubles. GrandMet's recovery will be slower if today's austere climate has left consumers reluctant to pay up for premium brands. That environment would hit other producers too, though. In such a world the prizes accrue to those with the most efficient production and distribution networks.</p>

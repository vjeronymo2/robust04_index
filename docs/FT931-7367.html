			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Brussels to tighten up safety at sea THE European Commission yesterday called for stricter implementation of international rules on safety at sea to prevent a repeat of recent oil tanker accidents. The Commission said it would introduce legislation before the end of the year which will oblige member states to observe minimum rules on safety, ship maintenance and training which have already been set by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). But Brussels stopped short of proposing measures which would give the Community new maritime safety standards stricter than those already in place under IMO regulations. Mr Abel Matutes, EC transport commissioner, said yesterday that the main aim was to enforce existing rules. 'There's a great deal of leeway between adopting an international convention and actually applying it: that can lead to a lax approach, which can lead to accidents,' he said. The Commission also said it would be up to member states to propose and enforce measures protecting environmentally sensitive areas from shipping. Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EC environment commissioner, said: 'There is no map (of such areas). It isn't up to the Community to do that. This is under national juris-diction.' The paper published yesterday lays out 'a common policy on safe seas' and will be submitted to EC transport ministers next month for political backing. The Commission has been working on the paper for some time, but speeded up publication following the oil tanker accidents earlier this year at La Coruna, in northern Spain, and in the Shetland islands. Mr Matutes said the introduction of any subsequent legislation would be co-ordinated with the IMO, but he also made clear that the Commission would press for all shipping to be subject to stricter checks. The Braer, the tanker which broke up in the Shetlands in January, was in transit through an international navigation lane. The Commission document calls on IMO member states to establish 'beyond doubt' that vessels in transit through such shipping lanes should report to coastal states about their cargo. Lord Sterling, chairman of P&amp;O, the British shipping company, and president of the European Community Shipowners Association (ECSA), welcomed the report yesterday, but warned the EC against developing 'a regional approach' to maritime safety. 'Regional EC regimes would be both counter-productive in terms of safety and competitively unfair for European shipowners,' he said. The Commission said its legislative proposals would include minimum training requirements for seafarers, minimum reporting requirements for vessels carrying dangerous and polluting goods, common rules on technical safety standards, and the establishment of a 'committee on safe seas'.</p>

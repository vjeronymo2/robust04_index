			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Books: A robust defence of reason REASON AND CULTURE by Ernest Gellner Blackwell Pounds 10.95, 193 pages AMONG the conflicts which scar the world's human face, those that involve people bombing each other, and the struggle to survive nature's onslaughts, rightly absorb our immediate attention. Behind these, though - and detached from them, because it is a struggle with the proportions of history itself - is another struggle, profound and consequential because it shapes the long-term destinies of whole nations: even of the world. This is the struggle of ideas, expressing itself in terms of ideologies, politics, and the conceptual frameworks which determine beliefs and moralities. Our understanding of the human condition, and the choices we make in managing the unruly and difficult complexities of social existence, are founded on ideas systematised into theories. Ultimately, it is ideas which drive people to peace or war, which shape the systems under which they live, and which determine how the world's scarce resources are shared among them. Ideas matter: and so, therefore, does the question of reason, by which ideas live or die. In this elegant and perceptive book, Reason and Culture, Ernest Gellner addresses the enormously important issue of reason's role. On one view, reason is the armament of ideas; it is the weapon employed in the conflict between viewpoints. This suggests that, in some sense, reason is an absolute which, used rightly, can settle disputes and guide us to truth. But reason so understood has always had enemies. One is religion, which claims that revelation from outside the world conveys truths undiscoverable by human inquiry within it. Another is relativism, the view that different truths, different views, different ways of thinking, are all equally valid and that there is no authoritative standpoint from which they can be adjudicated. In recent debates between science and religion, we see an expression of this underlying conflict between competing conceptions of the nature of reason. Gellner is on the side of the argument which says that reason, despite its imperfections and fallibilities, provides a standard to which competing standpoints must submit themselves. Accordingly, he is is hostile to the fashionable 'post-modernist' views which say there are authorities more powerful than reason such as race, tradition, nature, or supernatural entities. To mark the boundaries of this fundamental dispute, Gellner takes us through the history of views about reason, from Descartes to the present. The result is a clear, sharply-delineated history of thought. It lays bare the essence of rationalist optimism in early modern philosophy and proceeds to a robust anatomisation of anti-rationalisms, not least those versions which have come to hold increasing sway in the contemporary world. Gellner's diagnosis of contemporary anti-rationalism is stimulating. Human traits and values once were thought to be constants, he argues, but social and other forms of engineering have turned them into manipulable variables, with the result that we have lost premises from which to reason about aims and means. He is tough on anti-rationalists. Their oracles 'speak in nebulous and murky language and their pronouncements are allergic to clarity.' He attacks 20th century 'depth psychology' as one form of anti-rationalism, describing its doctrines as 'nebulous, flabby and evasive' and its therapeutic claims as 'baseless.' His defence of reason is not unqualified, though. Human identity is more ironic and conditional than it once was, and less entitled to confidence. But still, reason remains our best help in seeking knowledge and it 'enjoins us to treat each other equitably' so, despite its failings and limitations, we must cling to it. More than 30 years ago, Gellner, now professor of social anthropology at Cambridge, offended academic philosopers in Britain mightily with his book Words and Things, an attack on then-fashionable 'ordinary language philosophy.' Ever since, British philosophy has been ungenerous to him, failing to acknowledge his qualities as a frank, robust thinker distinguished by an unswerving belief in the importance of philosophical debate. It is true that, in the long-ago offending book, some of Gellner's arguments were unfairly polemical. But, on the evidence of this valuable and provocative defence of reason, it is clear that this quarrel within the tents of the Greeks must end; in the context of the wider battle in defence of reason, it has no further place.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Following the recent session of foreign ministers of  the six member states of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council  [GCC], as well as Syria and Egypt, known as a six plus two  sessions, Dr. Mahmud Mohammadi, a spokesman of Iran's Foreign  Ministry, in a conversation with the IRNA yesterday, explained  Iran's views on certain stands of members of the session on the  dispute between Iran and the United Arab Emirates [UAE].    The spokesman of Iran's Foreign Ministry, in referring to  the  final statement of the Damascus session, described as a  repetition of UAE's baseless claims, what has been set forth in  the statement.    At the same time he reiterated Iran's readiness to continue  dialogue with the UAE for resolving the dispute. Indisputably  in the opinion of political observers, the dispute between Iran  and the UAE over the Iranian islands, due to the assertion of  baseless claims by the UAE, has drawn attention of some Arab  states of the Persian Gulf region and participants in the  Damascus session. Hence before being based on realities, it is  an issue that has been asserted in line with the regional  developments and for the sake of holding of sessions by the Arab  states. Obviously such a trend cannot be construed as  indicative of the real stand of the UAE. This very point has  again been refuted by the spokesman of Iran's Foreign Ministry.  The spokesman expressed regret over the fact that the UAE's  Government, while stressing bilateral talks to remove  misunderstanding between the two states, has not taken any  practical steps in this regard.    At any rate, as explained in the comments of Iran's Foreign  Ministry spokesman, the officials of Iran's Islamic Republic  system have constantly stressed the principle of good  neighborliness and removal of differences through negotiations.    At present too, they, similar to the past, have announced  their readiness for holding talks with the UAE authorities. But  these efforts can attain the desired result only when the UAE  officials reciprocate this good intention with a positive  response. Hence UAE authorities, to bolster friendship, good  neighborliness, and regional stability must show a positive  response in practice based on realism and devoid of any impacts  arising from passive stance adopted by such sessions as the  Damascus meeting.</p>

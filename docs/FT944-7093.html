			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Gingrich warned on role in Congress The outgoing leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives yesterday warned his successors against letting power go to their heads after their sweeping triumph in this month's congressional elections. Mr Bob Michel, who is retiring after 38 years in the House and 14 as leader of the Republican minority, said he did not care for the plans of Mr Newt Gingrich, who will succeed him as Republican leader and take over as speaker of the House in January, to concentrate more power in the speaker's office. 'I didn't crave power when I was leader - I don't know if it would have changed if I were speaker. I just hope it doesn't go to our newly elected leaders' heads,' Mr Michel told the Chicago Tribune newspaper. 'Newt knows what he's doing,' Mr Michel said, but warned that the pugnacious Georgian was 'more of a theoretician than he is a parliamentarian'. 'Overplaying your hand in the majority can lend itself to the minority in justifying itself in really sticking it to you,' he said. This is not the first time Mr Michel has bemoaned the more partisan style of politics that has taken over Congress, but his warnings to Mr Gingrich were unusually pointed. They could foreshadow clashes in style between Mr Gingrich and Senator Robert Dole, who will lead the Republicans in the Senate and who is more of a parliamentarian than the new speaker. Mr Michel also criticised the 'Contract with America', a list of campaign pledges espoused by most Republican candidates in the November 8 election, saying its promise of tax cuts without offsetting spending cuts did not add up to a balanced budget. Mr Ray LaHood, a Michel aide who won his seat representing Peoria, Illinois, was one of the few Republicans who did not sign the contract.</p>

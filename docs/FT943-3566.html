			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (3): Costs are cut as jobs are lost - Angus Foster looks at how industry has coped with economic crisis According to the doomsters, Sao Paulo's industry is on a knife edge. After years of suffering from Brazil's economic crisis, companies have underinvested in technology and skills. They must catch up now, while the country's economy looks to be strengthening, or face rapid extinction from foreign competition. The situation is probably slightly more rosy, and certainly less simple, than the pessimists' predictions. Industry unquestionably has been damaged by the years of recession and economic 'shock' plans. Manufacturing industry averaged a 1.3 per cent annual decline in output in the seven years to 1992 and investment rates have fallen 10 percentage points to 15 per cent since the start of the last decade. But some sectors, including food processing, auto parts and wood products, have responded well. Industry as a whole has been forced to reduce its traditional reliance on government and look abroad for new export markets. Levels of productivity have risen sharply, although they will have to improve much further to match developed countries with which Brazil will increasingly have to compete. Mr Antonio Correa do Prado, economist at Sao Paulo's Dieese Institute, says the state's industry bears the scars of the last few years. Employment in industry is below 1986 levels. Companies laid off 500,000 workers during the 1990-1992 recession alone. 'Sao Paulo's industry has performed in a typically defensive way in order to survive rather than expand,' he says. Investment and new technology have been limited, and have mainly been used to improve management and planning processes. The use of computer technology in production, for example in design, has so far been limited probably because of cost, according to Mr Prado. Rather than invest, companies have spent the last few years trying to cut costs. The partial opening of Brazil's economy to imports in 1990, and the realisation of increased future competition, has forced many companies to restructure radically. The most visible result has been the drop in industrial employment. But most companies have improved efficiency in other areas too. It is a common refrain among businessmen that they are this year likely to produce more than in 1990 with only half the workforce. Duratex, a maker of hardboard and bathroom fixtures with eight factories in Sao Paulo, has reduced its headcount from 14,500 to 7,300 since 1990. It has also moved its head office into two buildings instead of seven and cut the delay on delivering orders to the US from 65 to 10 days. 'We realised we had to be competitive otherwise we would not survive,' says Mr Plinio Pinheiro, executive director. The rapid decline in industrial employment in Sao Paulo was seen as inevitable by companies' managements. But it has been fiercely criticised by union leaders. They say laid-off workers are being forced into service sector jobs which are often part-time and lower paid. Mr Vincente Paulo da Silva, president of Brazil's main trade union grouping CUT, says that unions agree Brazil has to integrate with the world economy and develop high technology industries. 'But this can only happen if workers participate. It cannot happen by throwing workers out onto the street,' he says. There have been some important agreements to retain labour in return for lower wage claims, such as the 1992 pact in the car industry. But industrial employment is likely to continue to fall in coming years, although at a reduced rate. New investment will be directed at technology, suggesting the state's economy will face a growing unemployment problem. There is greater consensus between management and labour on the speed of further opening to the world economy. Average tariffs have fallen from 30 to 14 per cent since 1990. Both sides believe further cuts should be cautious and that industry needs more time to prepare for foreign competition. Recent hints from the federal Ministry of Finance that import tariffs would be lowered in a bid to stimulate competition and lower domestic prices, have been broadly criticised. Mr Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of the Federation of Sao Paulo Industries, believes the threats are bluff. 'You cannot just junk our industries, we cannot accept a total opening yet. No minister of finance can unilaterally open our markets by abolishing tariffs. For a start, our industrialists are very strong politically,' he says. The financial problems of the federal and state governments have accelerated the state's withdrawal from economic decisions, a process which is set to continue. Government remains an important client for many industrial sectors, but the time of cosy relationships is over. 'We are no longer waiting for the government, we have learned to survive without them,' says Mr Moreira Ferreira. One area where businessmen do want government action is the port of Santos in the south of Sao Paulo state. This is Brazil's most important, but has become expensive because of inefficient union practices. Mr Pinheiro says Duratex finds it cheaper to send its export products 1,000km by road to the state of Parana rather than use Santos. Unfortunately for the businessmen, Mr Mario Covas, Sao Paulo's probable next governor, has strong backing among the Santos port workers, and may not be ready to listen to the complaints.</p>

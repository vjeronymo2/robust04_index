			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / 'Obsessive' hacker cleared of computer misuse A SCHOOLBOY whose obsession with computer hacking led him to break into computers operated by the Financial Times and other institutions was acquitted yesterday of three charges brought under the Computer Misuse Act. Mr Paul Bedworth, aged 19, had become so addicted to hacking that he became ill and no longer knew why he did it, according to expert psychiatric evidence given at his trial. In the first prosecution brought under the Computer Misuse Act 1990, Mr Bedworth denied charges of conspiracy to obtain telecommunications services dishonestly, conspiracy to cause unauthorised modification in computer material and conspiracy to secure unauthorised access to computer material. The prosecution was regarded as a test of the new law, which was brought in specifically to outlaw hacking. Before the act, prosecutions in hacking cases meant bringing charges of criminal damage or the theft of electricity. But the nature of Mr Bedworth's defence means that questions about the effectiveness of the law remain unanswered. Mr Bedworth, from Ilkley, Yorkshire, began hacking when he was 14, using a Pounds 200 BBC microcomputer given to him as a Christmas present, the court had been told. From his bedroom, he gained entry into computers run by large organisations and then used their telephone accounts to fund other hacking. His activities cost The Financial Times more than Pounds 20,000 and the Brussels-based European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Pounds 10,000 in telephone bills. However, at his trial at Southwark Crown Court, Professor James Griffith Edwards, an expert on addictive behaviour, had said Mr Bedworth's obsession had become so strong that it was impossible to judge what his intentions had been. His solicitor, Ms Deborah Tripley, said afterwards that Mr Bedworth had started hacking before the Computer Misuse Act came into force. 'As an unusually bright boy, his computer presented the ideal intellectual challenge. It began to absorb all his free time. His behaviour was obsessive and compulsive. He thought he was harmless but he found he couldn't draw himself away from his computer activities. He was addicted.' Mr Karl Strickland, 22, from Liverpool, and Mr Neil Woods, 26, from Oldham, admitted similar conspiracy charges under the Computer Misuse Act before the trial. Full report, Page 7</p>

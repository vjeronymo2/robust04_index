			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow weighed down by technology sector Wall Street In spite of a firm bond market, an early rally by US blue chip stocks fizzled out yesterday as losses in the technology sector mounted, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average blue chip indicator closed 4.75 off at 3,729.78 and the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 2.11 to 464.18. The American SE composite was 1.56 down at 467.31, while technology issues again hurt the Nasdaq, which surrendered a further 6.40 to 761.49. New York SE volume totalled 287.6m shares. In early trading, the tone in equities was guided by the US Treasury market, which reacted with initial disappointment when the Labor Department announced that the core producer price index - excluding the more volatile energy and food components - had increased by 0.4 per cent last month. While the figure suggested that inflationary pressures were still modest, bonds declined on the unful-filled expectation of a 0.2 per cent rise. However, once traders realised that a 2.1 per cent advance in car prices was mostly responsible for the headline figure, the market retraced ground and equities followed suit. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at 101 9/32 , yielding 6.15 per cent. With bond prices on the rise, investor optimism resurfaced, lifting those issues most sensitive to broad economic trends. At one stage, the Dow Industrial Average was 14 points ahead, but the gain was eroded in late trading as firming cyclical issues failed to offset mounting losses in the technology sector. During the afternoon, Alcoa watched a Dollars 1 gain turn into a Dollars 1 loss and closed down at Dollars 71 1/2 . Among other cyclical stocks, Caterpillar, the heavy equipment manufacturer, advanced Dollars 1 to Dollars 86, Rockwell added Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 35 5/8 and Union Carbide finished Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 21 3/8 . The car makers were positioned near the top of the NYSE's most active list. General Motors was Dollars  7/8 stronger at Dollars 56 1/8 , Ford ahead Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 63 1/2 and Chrysler Dollars  1/4 firmer at Dollars 53. As a Delaware appeals court panel heard testimony over the proposed takeover of Paramount Communications, the company's stock moved up Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 81 3/8 . Shares in the competing bidders lost ground, with Viacom's 'B' stock softening Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 44 1/2 and QVC down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 43 5/8 . After the market closed, the court announced a ruling which favoured QVC. Xerox tumbled Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 88 1/4 amid profit-taking. The stock had risen sharply on Wednesday's announcement of a big restructuring programme. The embattled semiconductor sector suffered a further blow after a trade group issued a disappointing report on orders. Motorola weakened Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 91 1/8 and Texas Instruments dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 60 3/8 . The damage spilled over into Nasdaq technology shares, with Microsoft falling Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 81 1/8 and Apple Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 30. Novell plunged Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 19 7/8 . Dataware Technologies plummeted Dollars 7 1/4 to Dollars 8 3/4 after a profits warning. Canada Toronto relinquished some ground in moderate trading after Wednesday's surge to an all-time peak. The TSE 300 index ended 17.0 down at 4,290.6, with declines leading advances by 446 to 360 after volume of 58.7m shares valued at CDollars 730m. All but one of the 14 stock groups declined. Mining recorded the largest decrease, falling 0.92 per cent.</p>

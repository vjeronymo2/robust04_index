			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Treasury 'wise man' calls for skills cash INCREASED public spending on training, scientific research and infrastructure such as roads and railways may be needed to boost long-term industrial competitiveness, Professor David Currie, one of the Treasury's team of outside economic advisers, warns today. In linking higher public spending in specified areas with the requirements of business, Prof Currie is joining forces with others on the seven-strong advisory team which is meeting today at the Treasury to complete its first report to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. In a study written jointly with Mr Geoffrey Dicks, a colleague at the London Business School, Prof Currie suggests that to reduce the Pounds 50bn government deficit Mr Clarke should consider cuts in tax relief on mortgages and cuts in income-tax allowances. Tax increases should on the whole be favoured to reductions in public spending, which can be 'indiscriminate, cutting into areas of spending that are important for promoting longer-term growth'. In his comments on public spending, Prof Currie is joining forces with two other of the 'seven wise men' - Mr Andrew Britton and Mr Gavyn Davies - who also reckon a more-skilled labour force and improved public investment are essential to stable growth. Others among the advisers are keener on across-the-board public spending cuts as a way to control state borrowing. Their report will be presented to Mr Clarke later this week before its public release next Monday. Writing in the latest edition of the LBS's Economic Outlook, Prof Currie and Mr Dicks also swipe at Prof Tim Congdon, another of the Treasury's wise men. They say broad money in the past has 'not been a reliable indicator', commenting: 'Advocacy of this indicator is accompanied by exaggerated claims for Tim Congdon's forecasting prowess that does not bear close examination.' Because of skill shortages and lack of mobility, efforts to reduce unemployment below 2.5m by an expansion of demand are likely to trigger higher wages and unacceptable inflation, the LBS economists say.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS REACT: TAKING ISSUE WITH TIMES' STANDS;  </P> <P> NOTE: MANY LETTERS WRITERS SUPPORT OUR VIEWS; MANY DO NOT. IN THE SPIRIT OF  VIGOROUS DISCUSSION OF THE ISSUES, HERE IS A SELECTION OF LETTERS THAT  DISAGREES WITH US.;  </P> <P> ALCOHOL TAXES: PROPS. 126, 134  </P> <P> While the liquor industry continues to spend millions on an ad campaign to  defeat Prop. 134, I grow more and more apprehensive. I refer to your article  concerning the current preparations by Los Angeles County officials to close  four more clinics serving more than 4,000 mentally ill patients.  </P> <P> I am continually frustrated and angry at the blatant disregard for our county's  seriously mentally ill.  </P> <P> My oldest daughter has been mentally ill since she was 16. I cannot adequately  describe in this space what serious mental illness does to the victim of this  brain disease. Any disease that attacks one in the prime of youth is sad; one  that arrests capacity for productivity and basic functioning and relegates one  to a stigmatized life of misunderstanding and confusion is tragic. One of the  very few programs available to my daughter is one offered at a community mental  health center. Now, once again, after closing 10 in the last two years, more  are threatened to close.  </P> <P> Community programs can make a difference. They help people gain confidence and  learn independent living skills. With well-developed programs, some people  recover substantially, hold a job and achieve a satisfactory life.  </P> <P> The governor has cut $61 million from the mental-health budget this fiscal  year. The system is in dire need of funding to hold off a complete collapse.  And don't forget the other trick, Prop. 136, the so-called taxpayers "right to  vote." If it passes, it nullifies Prop. 134 because it calls for an almost  impossible two-thirds vote to increase any state or local taxes. We need a no  in 136 and a yes on 134.  </P> <P> PAM KENNEDY  </P> <P> La Habra  </P></p>

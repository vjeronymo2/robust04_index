			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Activity on USM dries up in first quarter FOR the first time in more than 10 years, no companies chose to raise funds by joining the Unlisted Securities Market during the first quarter. The drying up of activity is revealed in new-issue statistics published yesterday by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock. KPMG monitors new issues on both the USM and the stock exchange's official list. New-issue activity on both markets was severely depressed during the quarter, largely due to the UK recession and uncertainties after the Gulf war. The statistics also revealed a new low in the steady, steep decline of companies seeking a USM quotation. The junior market, founded in November 1980, was once a bustling arena for the small and growing company. Last year, the number of new issues was 47, raising a total of Pounds 40m worth of new money, down from 87 raising Pounds 303m in 1988. Some followers of the USM are concerned that its relative decline will continue, even when investor appetite for new issues improves. Changes in stock exchange regulations have made it easier for companies to go straight to the official list. The first-quarter statistics continue last year's trend. KPMG said the USM last year suffered a net shrinkage as 29 of its constituent companies moved up to the main market. The figures show that the main market saw 12 new entrants. Three of these were investment trusts which raised funds when they floated. But all nine companies joining the market came by way of introduction, where a listing is obtained without shares being simultaneously sold. The investment trusts raised a total of Pounds 90m in the first quarter. New entrants to the main market in 1990 raised Pounds 899m. The comparative figures exclude privatisations, including this spring's flotation of National Power and PowerGen, the two electricity generators. Meanwhile, five companies obtained a USM quotation during the first three months  - the lowest-ever quarterly total. All of these were introductions and three were transfers from the Third Market  - the arena for the very smallest and youngest companies which was abolished at the beginning of the year. Six of the companies introduced to the official list came from the USM.</p>

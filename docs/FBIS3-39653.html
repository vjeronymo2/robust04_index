			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [First of three installments on interview with Abdullah </F> Ocalan, leader of the Workers Party of Kurdistan, PKK, by  Huseyin Gul; place and date not given]    [Text] KURD-A/Botan-- [Gul] The clashes never stopped this  winter. The state forces are launching daily air and ground  operations. What is your assessment of this situation?    [Ocalan] The state is not remaining idle. It is launching  attacks with all its might and is exerting every effort to gain  victory for its policy, government, and parties. We are working  to draw some conclusions after carefully assessing the air and  ground operations it launched under such difficult winter  conditions. This assessment of the situation is opening the way  to numerous political developments. It is helping us to  understand our real strength, see our advantages as well as  shortcomings, and clarify and evaluate the path of our progress.    Tansu Ciller is describing all such operations as "political  decisiveness." What she means is that she is trying to achieve  results by manipulating the laws where our nation is concerned  and by using the counterguerrilla organization in a lawless  manner. She is showing that she is decisive on this issue.    [Gul] I want to ask a question that interests everybody.  What is your assessment of the murder of Mehmet Nabi Inciler  and Behcet Canturk, who were Kurds known as godfathers in Turkey?    [Ocalan] We could easily state that starting with the murder  of DEP [Democracy Party] parliamentarian Mehmet Sincar, these  murders of those we could describe as patriotic Kurdish  businessmen were done under the direct orders from the highest  authority. Nabi Inciler, nicknamed "Inci Baba," and Behcet  Canturk were disposed off because of the role they could have  played in the Kurdish problem, as they had done in the past.    These are intimidation murders aimed at silencing this  [patriotic] segment and at encouraging the emergence of a  collaborationist segment, such as volunteer village guards, some  clan leaders drawn to Ankara, and many such agents.    [Gul] The 27 March local elections are approaching. It is  expected that the state will conduct large-scale detentions on  the eve of the elections. What will be your stance on the  elections?    [Ocalan] The state is engaged in an "all or nothing" game.  It is trying to hold the elections on the principle of the  complete destruction of our movement. It is trying to  completely disregard the legal foundations. It is trying to  reverse a possible referendum situation in Kurdistan. It  appears that the state will intensify its activities in this  direction.    [Gul] What is your assessment of the attack on Zhalah camp  and the position of the southern forces [Iraqi Kurdish parties]  on this attack?    [Ocalan] The Zhalah operation was designed to use the  federal  government in the south against us or, failing this, to warn  that government that Turkey could bomb it out. With the Zhalah  operation, the Turkish state is also indicating its "political  decisiveness" to resort to bombings if its policy toward the PKK  fails. They are resorting to military, political, and  diplomatic initiatives. They already did all that was possible  in the diplomatic arena. All these initiatives are various  aspects of their policy, and indications are that they will  further escalate their violence by the spring.    The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that we must  look at the situation from a wider perspective, assign duties,  and prepare our guerrilla force, war effort, introduction of new  ideas, enhancement of efforts, and cognizance of defects and  assessment of advantages accordingly.    It is imperative that we make preparations quickly and move  toward implementation. Time is vital for us, too. It is  possible to pack the efforts of the past years into these few  months. It is possible to achieve as much within the coming  months as was achieved during the previous years. At such  fast-moving historic times, it is easy to make maximum gains in  a lifetime if a proper response is made.</p>

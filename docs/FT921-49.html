			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / A check on the boss's cheque: US shareholders have won new powers to limit executive pay A priest in Evansville, Indiana, a hardware store owner in Boonville, California, and an 'irate and discouraged stockholder' from Dallas are set to write a small but significant chapter in US corporate history. Over the next two months these small, individual investors, along with seven others, will become the first shareholders in the US allowed to raise directly the controversial issue of executive pay at companies' annual meetings. They will do so thanks to a recent policy switch by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the government agency which oversees the securities industry, which will have important repercussions. The change will give investors more power to stand up to boards to ensure executive pay is more closely aligned with corporate performance than is often the case. Second, it could restrain the overall levels of US executive pay, which are far higher than those in Europe and Japan. And it could stimulate debate on these issues in Europe - especially the UK. Third, it will give shareholders more information on just what their board members are being paid, and why. Finally, it will intensify a mounting US controversy over companies' increasing reliance on share options to reward executives. Two factors, coalescing into a single political imperative, lie behind the SEC's policy change. One is the ever-increasing stake in corporate America held by large, institutional investors and the related rise over the past decade of an influential 'corporate governance movement'. This seeks to make boards more responsive to shareholders' wishes. The other is sheer public outrage at the eye-popping sums of money paid to top executives of some leading companies over the past year or two. In 1990, for example, Mr Steve Ross, chairman of Time Warner, netted Dollars 78m (Pounds 45m) and Mr Stephen Wolf, his counterpart at United Airlines, received Dollars 18m. Headline sums like these can be misleading for, as in the two cases above, they often include the exercise of share options awarded for a manager's work over many years. But the fact remains that executives are rewarded handsomely. This month, Coca-Cola announced plans to give its chairman, Mr Roberto Goizueta, shares currently worth around Dollars 80m provided he stays with the company until 1996. According to Mr Graef Crystal, an academic and a leading authority on executive pay, chief executives at top American companies earned 109 times the pay of the average US worker in the late 1980s. This compares with just 17 times in Japan and about 35 times in the UK. At a time when recession is prompting tens of thousands of lay-offs, fat cats cause resentment. The Democratic hopefuls in the US presidential race have been quick to spot votes in attacks on 'boardroom greed', while Congress has also worked up a head of steam. Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, introduced a bill last summer to increase shareholder power over executive pay which attracted strong backing. The prospect of this becoming law has helped push the SEC, which was already considering policy changes, into adopting its own package. This bears a close resemblance to the Levin legislation, most of which looks like being shelved. Until now, US shareholders have been prevented from directly questioning pay at company annual meetings. This is because the SEC, which decides what proposals can be included on ballot papers for a vote at shareholder meetings, always deemed this to be 'ordinary business' - in other words, day-to-day matters best left to the discretion of directors. But Mr Richard Breeden, the SEC's politically ambitious chairman, says that from now on pay proposals covering top management can be included in the 'proxy' ballot material sent to investors, although these must be advisory, rather than binding on a board. The SEC, Mr Breeden explains, is obliged to allow significant 'policy' issues facing a company to appear on the ballot, and he thinks the executive pay controversy has now assumed such proportions. The most immediate impact of his switch is on 10 companies where individual shareholders had already filed pay proposals in the hope of getting them on the proxy papers for the current annual meetings season, which extends until May. The SEC has now told the 10 they must include the proposals in their proxy material. The companies include the Baltimore Gas and Electric company, which is being asked to cap executives' pay at 20 times that of the average employee; IBM, where a shareholder is demanding better disclosure of officers' pay and justification for these sums; and telecommunications group Bell Atlantic, where the Indiana priest wants to get a short-term incentive plan abolished. With the floodgates now opened, many more companies will find themselves facing similar demands in future years. A large proportion of these proposals is likely to come from small investors, but heavyweight corporate governance groups and institutional investors may also put in pay resolutions, or use the threat of them in behind-the-scenes negotiations. The United Shareholders Association, a Washington-based shareholder rights group, has done so already. It announced last autumn that it would introduce pay resolutions at 10 big corporations - including ITT and Woolworth, the stores group - in the current proxy season. However, it dropped its threat after what it termed 'successful dialogue' with each company. The California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), the largest public pension fund in the country, has also been a pioneer on executive pay. During the 1991 proxy season it submitted, but then withdrew, proposals calling for independent board committees to handle compensation at both ITT and conglomerate W R Grace. It also took the unusual step of voting against re-election of the directors of ITT in protest at chairman Mr Rand Araskog's Dollars 11m pay package. The changes at ITT since last year's annual meeting show how effective institutional protest can be: the company is introducing a pay scheme for 500 senior managers which ties their rewards more closely to the company's share price performance and return on equity. However, recent surveys of institutional investors by both the Investor Responsibility Research Center, an independent information agency, and Georgeson &amp; Company, which advises on proxy issues, found that most do not want to take part in routine compensation decisions. 'Shareholder democracy is a bad idea for compensation,' Georgeson quoted one money manager as saying. 'No pay raises and terrible compensation attract mediocre people.' What the institutions do want, however, is greater and clearer information on what a company's directors are paid. The elements that make up an executive's compensation are scattered through proxy statements and Mr Breeden acknowledges that it sometimes 'requires a PhD in finance' to figure out how much executives get. The SEC wants to change this, too. Mr Breeden, while stressing that market forces rather than government regulation should determine pay levels, says shareholders need to be given pay information which is easier to understand. The agency is proposing that companies be required to set out clearly in a table the cash payments given to top executives, as well as the estimated value of stock or stock options granted during the year. Boards would also have to compare changes in the pay of chief executives over recent years with the company's performance, describe the criteria they use in incentive pay and explain the reasons for specific awards. This would help to remove the muddle, although there would still be controversy over stock options - an element of pay that has become increasingly important in recent years, thanks to a 1980s fashion for granting options to managers and to booming stock markets, which greatly increased their value. Stock option plans give an executive the right to buy shares in the company at a certain price at some future date. The idea is to encourage him or her to work hard and boost the company's share price. However, there is mounting concern, both within the accountancy profession and among shareholder activists, that companies do not usually have to treat grants of options as a compensation expense, even though these will reduce the amount of earnings available for distribution to other shareholders. Mr Crystal estimates that 274 US companies made 1990 stock option grants worth Dollars 3.8bn and claims that by ignoring them companies are overstating their earnings by 2 to 3 per cent a year. Mr Breeden has asked the SEC's chief accountant and the national Financial Accounting Standards Board to look into the issue. No early resolution seems likely, since the FASB has been grappling with the issue for years. In any case, investors already have it in their power to block grants of options, since these have always been subject to a shareholder vote. But it is only now that most investors are waking up to the huge profits being generated by options, and questioning whether too many managers are getting too much for mediocre performance. Irrespective of options accounting, the SEC's other changes mean that shareholders should now have enough power to challenge excessive pay, and this may encourage boards to take a fresh look at compensation policies. The changes will also give a fillip to the corporate governance movement, which has long campaigned for reforms. That said, the movement's leaders are realising that proxy proposals are a fairly crude weapon. Far better, they say, to ensure that corporate boardrooms are filled with independent-minded directors who will put the interests of shareholders before those of managers. That battle is only just beginning.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The 10 pay resolutions  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aetna Life and Casualty          Deduct pay from outside directors who                                  miss company meetings.

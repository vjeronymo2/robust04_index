During the meeting with the president, the Czech defense  minister reported that the Czech Government adopted a decision a  week ago to sell all types of weapons to Lithuania without any  restrictions.    At the moment Lithuania is buying only pistols from the  Czech  Republic. However, Linas Linkevicius, minister of national  defense, said that a commission of specialists had already been  set up to investigate other types of arms Lithuania could buy in  the Czech Republic.    The Czech Government also gave Lithuania 2 million kronas,  which is about $60,000, to pay the fees for five Lithuanian  military groups that will come to study the peace-keeping  operation at a specially designed training center in [words  indistinct].    The Czech Republic pays much attention to this kind of  operation and the NATO initiative [words indistinct] and this,  according to the Czech politicians, is the most direct and  concrete way to NATO.    Antonin Baudys also told Algirdas Brazauskas that  Lithuania's  wish to join NATO had influenced the position of the Czech  Government on this issue.    Speaking to Ceslovas Jursenas, the Czech minister of defence  said that his country expected to become a member of NATO in  five years.    Talking to the journalists Antonin Baudys was more careful  and did not mention any specific date. He only said that this  would depend on when NATO will see that the Czech Republic was a  reliable partner, which he said would not take too long.  Besides, according to Antonin Baudys, not only countries of the  Visegrad triangle should be simultaneously accepted into NATO,  but also the Baltic countries and Bulgaria, Slovenia, and  Romania.    The Czech minister of defense also said that the Visegrad  triangle was not a closed structure, but should embrace all of  Central and Eastern Europe. At the moment, the Czech Republic,  without declaring publicly its intentions to proceed toward  NATO, is making concrete steps in this direction.    This year joint military exercises are to be held with (?the  Netherlands) and France within the framework of Partnership for  Peace. The military structures are being reorganized according  to the NATO model.  (Andrius Vasiliauskas), representative from the Ministry of  National Defense, who was accompanying the delegation, told the  journalists that the Lithuanian military structures were  established according to the NATO model from the start.</p>

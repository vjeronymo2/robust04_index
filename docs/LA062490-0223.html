			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SO, WHAT DOES (14-MONTH-OLD) HOMER WATCH?  </P> <P> Until he created "The Simpsons," Matt Groening used to pretend that he never  watched much television, that he despised the tube and everything it stood for.  </P> <P> But now that he's an executive producer of one of the year's most-talked-about  television shows, Groening, 36, is free to admit that he was indeed a product  of a cathode ray environment, just like the rest of America born since the baby  boom.  </P> <P> "My biography could be written by consulting any TV Guide from the 1960s,"  Groening said. "Wednesday night, 7:30? I was watching 'The Flintstones.' "  </P> <P> So now that he's a grown-up with a 14-month-old son of his own, what does  Groening want his kid to watch?  </P> <P> "It's okay for my son to watch whatever he wants, although I prefer that he  watches the show I'm already watching," Groening said.  </P> <P> "I imagine kids learn from the example of their parents, and I really don't  watch that much television now. And when I do I'm one of those constant  remote-control switching people. So I guess what I don't want him to emulate is  my exasperated behavior while I'm scrambling around trying to find the channel  changer."  </P> <P> And if Homer Groening (named after Matt's father, not Homer Simpson) adopts his  dad's tv tastes, what will he be watching?  </P> <P> "He'll like 'Pee-Wee's Playhouse,' 'Donald Duck Presents' and any PBS  documentary featuring mischievous monkeys," Groening said. "I'd only be  alarmed, I guess, if he wanted to watch "thirtysomething."  </P> <P> Groening doesn't think TV is detrimental to kids as long as they have other  sources of information and entertainment. "I grew up in a household full of  books and was surrounded by people to whom reading was very important. So  television was not my full source of cultural nourishment."  </P> <P> "And I would hope that when I subject my child to Louis Armstrong and read  aloud to him from Charles Dickens that he'll pick up on those things as well as  'America's Funniest Home Videos.' "  </P></p>

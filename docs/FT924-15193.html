			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Observer: Kohler leaves Kohl Embattled Chancellor Helmut Kohl is set to lose another of his closest advisers to the private sector. Horst Kohler, state secretary in the Finance Ministry and Kohl's chief negotiator for everything from European monetary union to the international aid programme for Russia, is planning to quit next year to become president of Germany's association of savings banks. It seems an extraordinary transformation for a man who has been so close to the inner wheels of power and who is still only 49. Yet his closest friends and associates insist that his decision is being taken for entirely personal reasons. Kohler is notorious for driving himself beyond the limits of reasonable hard work, turning in regular 16-hour days at the Finance Ministry in Bonn when he is not on the road to international meetings. He is one of that inner school of German bureaucrats who has acute political antennae, and occupies the grey area between pure civil service and pure politics. He also combines a clear intellect with a rapid grasp of issues, and a readiness to react emotionally as well - a combination which has endeared him to the chancellor. Since the departure of Horst Teltschik as Kohl's foreign policy adviser, also to the private sector, Kohler has been an ever-more important confidant of the chancellor. He was the key German negotiator on the economic and monetary aspects of the Maastricht treaty - and its advocate to an increasingly sceptical German public - alongside Hans Tietmeyer, his predecessor, who is now at the Bundesbank. One of the ironies of the appointment is that the present savings banks' boss, Helmut Geiger, has always been notably sceptical about the advantages of the Maastricht treaty for Germany. To that extent, Kohl will now have a crucial ally in the private sector. But he will have lost someone from the Bonn inner circle he can ill afford to see go.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Housing market Faith among builders in the housing market recovery seems to be gathering momentum. Tarmac is the latest to ask shareholders for money to invest in land. The worry is that the indicators show scant evidence of recovery so far. Halifax's house price index shows no net gain since prices stopped falling last October. The building society also accompanied its interim figures with a comment that the market remains delicately poised. Even allowing that its statement was tailored for political consumption ahead of the budget, the implication is that investing in land now is risky. Land prices are already rising faster than house prices. If that continues, and building materials prices start to rise as well, house builders' margins will be squeezed. True, the premium commanded by new houses over old has dwindled in recession. In normal times the premium is around 15 per cent, against an average of 7 per cent at present - not least because cash-starved builders have been offering discounts to secure sales. New house prices thus have some catching up to do. They might show something of a recovery even if the market as a whole remains subdued. But that cannot be taken for granted. If the enthusiasm of builders outstrips that of buyers, excess supply could quickly emerge. With cash committed to new land and construction but little flowing in from completed sales, the builders would again have to fight the urge to discount.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): Still vulnerable to political upheaval - Investing in the Far East / The best route is through a collective fund. But be wary, and seek growth rather than income THE ARGUMENTS for investing in the Far East appear to be very clear to UK investors, judging by the reception given to regional funds launched this year. The economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and the Phillipines are among the most dynamic in the world. The marketing brochures spell it out with charts that show growth rates in the region to be at least two or three times higher than in Europe or the US, and forecast that they will continue that way. They speak of the entrepreneurial spirit of the people, and how they are at the vanguard of new technology, while keeping wages low. Healthy economic growth is usually accompanied by equally health stock market growth, and this has been the case in most of South East Asia. Stock markets in the region have been buoyant this year  - several, including Singapore, the Phillipines and Hong Kong, have been hitting all-time highs. Funds investing in the Far East have been among the best performing in recent years. If five years ago, on a hunch, you had put Pounds 1,000 into the Gartmore Hong Kong unit trust, it would have grown to Pounds 3,332 by now. However, if, after hearing those arguments, you start to wonder why anyone would want to invest in boring old developed countries, it may be time to point out some of the downside. It is well known that high rewards do not come without some level of risk  - and there are plenty of risks associated with investing in the Far East. For a start, there are the repercussions of political upheaval. When Chinese troops went in to put down the student protest in Tiananmen square in 1989, the Hong Kong stock market plummeted, as did several others in the region. They rebounded in time, but Chinese political events and rumours can still make the Hong Hong market jittery, and that is unlikely to change before 1997, when it reverts to Chinese rule. China is not the only problem; the Phillipines still suffers political instability, there are occasional coups in Thailand, and so on. Because many of these economies are export-led, there is a knock-on effect when the west goes into recession. The home markets are also developing very fast, but they cannot always take up the slack when overseas sales fall off. The currency exposure involved in investing in the area is also a risk - the strong yen has contributed to the good performance of many Japanese funds, but it can work the other way. For example, inflation in China, currently running well into double digits, could force a devaluation of the renminbi, which means that assets held in the Chinese currency would lose value for foreign investors. Foreign investors can also face complications due to currency exchange controls. Another feature of even some relatively developed markets in the region is that accountancy standards, information disclosure and insider trading legislation are not quite what UK fund managers are used to. There are also structural constraints on foreign investment in some countries. For example, Korea allows a maximum of 10 per cent of any one company's stock to be held by foreign investors, and Taiwan has similar rules. Sometimes there are ways around this, for example locally registered funds can buy the stock, and their shares are then bought by foreigners, but this can add to costs. If you are looking for income, you would not be well advised to look East  - dividends from south-east Asian markets are low or non-existent. Rather, this is the place to put some of your money if you are not likely to need it for a good few years. Managers of funds concentrating on the smaller markets in the region tend to take a long-term view, and it is sensible for investors to do the same. Short-term gains are possible, but not guaranteed, as the markets can be volatile; however, the prospects for fundamental economic growth are indisputable. If you ride the dragons and tigers for long enough (and are not put off by the occasional tumble), you should come out with substantial capital gains. For the average UK investor attracted by the idea of devoting a corner of the portfolio to the Far East, the easiest way is through a UK authorised unit trust or investment trust. It is possible to buy shares in some companies directly, but this is not a commonly-used option for private UK investors. UK authorised unit trusts are limited by law as to what proportion of their funds they can invest in unrecognised stockmarkets  - this can be a disadvantage for China funds, for example, as neither of the mainland Chinese exchanges are recognised. There is also the risk of becoming trapped in illiquid markets when investors start cashing in units. Investment trusts are closed-end funds, ie investors buy and sell shares on the open market rather than selling them back to the manager. This means that the manager has more freedom to invest for the long term, without worrying about whether enough of the portfolio is in very liquid stocks which can easily be cashed in if investors panic and withdraw their money. Charges are lower on investment trusts than unit trusts, but investors also have to cope with fluctuating discounts to net asset value. Also, if a trust falls very heavily out of favour, you may have difficulty finding a buyer. As at September 1, there were 89 Japanese unit trusts, 46 in the Far East including Japan, 62 in the Far East excluding Japan, and five in Australasia. The funds had a combined total of Pounds 10bn under management. The investment trust industry is slightly less prolific: there were 30 funds covering the region, with a combined market capitalisation of Pounds 3.2bn. Six funds invest in the whole of the Far East including Japan, eight exclude Japan; seven invest in Japan alone; and nine invest in other single countries in the region. The current popularity of the area can be seen from the number of specialist unit and investment trusts launched recently. This year's crop includes the Fleming Chinese Investment Trust, the S&amp;P Asian Smaller Companies fund, Rothschild's Five Arrows Asia Fund, HTR Japanese Smaller Companies, Dunedin Japan Investment Trust, the Perpetual Japanese Investment Trust, the Govett Greater China Fund and Jupiter Tyndall's China fund. As the Japanese economy has matured, it has lost its dragon-like characteristics, and is now settling down to more western-style growth rates of 2 or 3 per cent, or even negative growth at times. Japan has regained favour this year, as the strong yen has combined with a stock market recovery from last year's low point of just over 14,000 to more than 20,000, although the economy is still stagnating. However, anybody who put money into Japan at the height of the stockmarket boom, when the index hit 38,000, may feel less positive about the current state of the market. China has been this year's favourite with many UK fund managers, despite worries over whether its economy has been overheating out of control. Money has been pouring into all the East Asian stockmarkets on the back of the Chinese investment boom. Fund managers see the folly of trying to invest large quantities of money in the miniscule mainland Chinese exchanges at Shanghai and Shenzhen, so they have been scouring the lists of companies on nearby exchanges  - particularly Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan  - looking for 'China plays'. The idea of precisely which stocks can be defined as a China play varies from manager to manager. Some have strict criteria: the company must derive a minimum of its profit or turnover from China. Others take a more relaxed view, regarding almost any stock on those exchanges as a China play, on the grounds that market sentiment responds to events in China, and the economies of those countries are becoming increasingly dependent on doing business with China. The choice between single-country and more general funds investing in the whole region is essentially one of risk levels. The former are far more speculative  - they can do very well one year, but the next they could also be found floating around the bottom of the performance tables, as there is little fund managers can do if the market in their chosen country crashes. Regional funds have the freedom to pull out of markets when they scent trouble, and so can avoid the depths, but it is also difficult for them to take full advantage of spectacular growth in individual markets, because their funds can only put a minority of their money into any single country.  -----------------------------------------------           BEST PERFORMING UNIT TRUSTS  ----------------------------------------------- FAR EAST INCLUDING JAPAN               % GROWTH*  ----------------------------------------------- Govett Pacific Strategy                   110.8 Perpetual Far East Growth                 102.5 Fidelity Far East Income                   90.8  ----------------------------------------------- FAR EAST EXCLUDING JAPAN  ----------------------------------------------- Gartmore Hong Kong                        231.2 Providence Capitol HK                     192.9 Invesco Hong Kong &amp; China                 175.6  ----------------------------------------------- * Over three years to September 1, 1993,   income reinvested  ----------------------------------------------- Source:  Hardwick Stafford Wright  -----------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------         BEST PERFORMING INVESTMENT TRUSTS  ----------------------------------------------- FAR EAST INCLUDING JAPAN           % GROWTH*  ----------------------------------------------- TR Far East Income                   136.0 Martin Currie Pacific                108.0 Foreign &amp; Colonial Pacific            98.7  ----------------------------------------------- FAR EAST EXCLUDING JAPAN  ----------------------------------------------- Scottish Asian                       177.1 Pacific Assets                       168.1 Gartmore Emerging Pacific            136.8  ----------------------------------------------- * Over three years to September 1, 1993, midmarket to midmarket, net income reinvested on payment date  ----------------------------------------------- Source:  Hardwick Stafford Wright  -----------------------------------------------</p>

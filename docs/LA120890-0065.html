			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOTTERY SALES SLUMP WILL REDUCE SHARE TO EDUCATION  </P> <P> The failure of a new Lotto game to produce a record-breaking jackpot combined  with a softening economy has caused a sales slump at the California Lottery  that officials predicted Friday could reduce the game's contribution to  education next year by as much as $280 million.  </P> <P> Officials said the lower than expected sales already have forced them to cut  $59 million from their administrative budget by severely reducing advertising,  declaring a hiring freeze and postponing equipment purchases.  </P> <P> "We are cutting as close to the bone as we can," said Joanne McNabb, the  lottery's public affairs director. "It's what many businesses are going through  now. Any business whose sales are down below expectations is looking to cut."  </P> <P> McNabb said sales, totaling $880 million since the beginning of this fiscal  year, are 5% below the goal for the period. Given this trend, coupled with  expectations that the economy will continue to decline, McNabb said officials  are estimating that total sales by the end of the fiscal year will range from  $2 billion to $2.3 billion.  </P> <P> That would provide only $700 million to $800 million for education next year as  compared to the $980 million the lottery provided this year, McNabb said. Under  state law, the lottery must allocate at least 34% of its revenues to education.  </P> <P> Susan Lange, public relations director for the California Department of  Education, said the drop in lottery money would come at a time when schools are  experiencing tremendous enrollment growth.  </P> <P> "It could be really damaging to districts especially now when many of them have  become dependent on their lottery money because of the lack of revenue from the  state," she said.  </P> <P> She said the lottery was intended to provide "extras" for school districts, but  many districts in recent years have used proceeds to provide "necessities" as a  way of balancing their budgets.  </P> <P> McNabb said officials are attributing the slow lottery sales to the same  nemesis that dogs many of their players -- bad luck. The Lotto game was changed  in midsummer to produce more of the big jackpots that drive up sales. While the  change provided some very large jackpots -- four were more than $30 million  since July 1 -- it did not produce the super jackpots of $70 million or more  that drive sales up significantly, she said.  </P> <P> "We did have a turnaround in the downward trend of Lotto sales and that was a  good sign," McNabb said. "It just went more slowly then we would like."  </P> <P> In other states that have changed their Lotto games, she said the big explosion  in sales did not come until there was a jackpot that broke the record for that  state. In California, the biggest jackpot has been $68 million.  </P> <P> "Unlike many other businesses in this economy," McNabb said, "we have a luck  factor. What's happened in other states is that the sooner they've hit a record  jackpot after the change (in Lotto), the sooner their sales have taken off.  It's our bad luck that we haven't had that."  </P> <P> The change in the game required players to choose six numbers from a field of  53 instead of 49, making it nearly twice as hard for players to win but also  adding to the potential size of the prizes.  </P> <P> McNabb said officials also believe economic conditions have been a sales  factor, but they have no way of determining how much of a factor.  </P> <P> "This is the first time that our lottery has been in an economic downturn," she  said. "This is new territory for us."  </P> <P> Within the agency, McNabb said advertising will take a particular hit as a  result of the sales slump. She said television advertising of Decco and Topper,  two games of chance introduced this year, has been stopped and the advertising  of Lotto, which produces two-thirds of the lottery's revenue, has been reduced.  </P> <P> She said 50 vacant positions in the department have not been filled and will be  recommended for elimination.  </P> <P> McNabb said officials believe the volume of lottery ticket sales could rise  dramatically if there is a record-breaking jackpot or if a game to be  introduced next spring does exceptionally well. The game, to be called Little  Lotto, would allow players to chose six numbers from a field of 39. The top  prize would be $500,000 paid immediately in cash. The Lotto jackpots are paid  over a 20-year period.  </P> <P> McNabb said revenue projections for Little Lotto have been conservative because  similar games have had mixed results in other states.  </P></p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: SEP shares rise 5p as first half profits double WITH THE progress in the first half and good prospects for the year as a whole, SEP Industrial Holdings, the general engineering group, is forecasting an increase in dividend. Pre-tax profit for the six months ended March 31 1993 jumped from Pounds 378,000 to Pounds 883,000, and exceeded the figure for the whole of the previous year. The shares closed 5p higher at 28 1/2 p. The interim dividend is raised to 0.35p on the higher capital (0.3p) and the total will be not less than 0.75p (0.65p). The manufacturing division lifted profit from Pounds 87,000 to Pounds 234,000, which had added to the board's confidence in recovery prospects. Distribution activity increased 'quite noticeably' in recent weeks. Jaton Holdings, acquired in January, made a substantial contribution, with turnover of Pounds 4.13m and operating profit of Pounds 397,000. Earnings per share for the half year came to 1.2p (0.7p). Shareholders' funds at March 31 were estimated to have increased to Pounds 12.5m after the sale of Cediwal by the Belgian subsidiary, proceeds of the placing and open offer in January, and the surplus of Jaton's net assets over the purchase consideration.</p>

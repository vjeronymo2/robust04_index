			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG MIX;  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS;  </P> <P> THE EMERGING FILIPINO CUISINE;  </P> <P> WITH ITS SPANISH AND AMERICAN HERITAGE, THE FOOD OF THE PHILIPPINES IS A TASTY  MIX INDEED  </P> <P> A first-rate Filipino meal in the United States? Until recently it was almost  impossible to get. Family-oriented Filipinos are so accustomed to entertaining  at home that, even in Manila, dining out is a relatively recent phenomenon. And  unlike many other immigrants, most Filipinos arriving in the U.S. speak English  and can easily find work. This means few of them end up working in restaurants  or opening eating places of their own.  </P> <P> But immigration has been so brisk that Filipinos are now the second-largest  Asian ethnic group in the United States (Chinese rank first), and the largest  in California. Many are hungry for a taste of home, and as the surge of  immigrants continues, enterprising Filipino restaurateurs are starting to reach  a ready market.  </P> <P> Right now the clientele is primarily Filipino. Americans have taken to Thai,  Vietnamese and spicy Chinese dishes with enthusiasm, but most know very little  about Filipino food. Political unrest in the islands has inhibited tourism, and  few Americans have encountered the food first hand.  </P> <P> Paradoxically, this is the one Asian cuisine that should be the most acceptable  to Westerners. More than 300 years of Spanish occupation and almost 50 years  under the American flag have strongly marked Filipino culture and cuisine.  Paella is as popular as pancit (the Tagalog word for noodles). And steak,  barbecued chicken and macaroni salad share the table with such indigenous  dishes as lechon (roast suckling pig served with liver sauce), daing na bangus  (fried milkfish) and pinakbet, a vegetable combination that includes eggplant,  bitter melon and a heady shrimp paste called bagoong.  </P> <P> There is, of course, a more adventuresome side to Filipino food. Filipino  cooks, for instance, are famous for wasting nothing, hence dishes such as  tripe, pig ears and others from assorted internal organs.  </P> <P> Some dishes remain totally Western. Flan, the most common dessert, is like flan  anywhere. Others incorporate a Filipino touch. Steak might be seasoned with  garlic and soy sauce. Fruit salad might include translucent palm seeds or  shreds of buko (young coconut). And a chiffon cake might be tinted a startling  lavender because of the use of a purple yam called ube. Exotic contributions  also come from the Chinese, Malays and Indonesians. But chiles are used so  sparingly that Filipinos have the mildest food in Southeast Asia.  </P> <P> How good is Filipino food here? Manila-born Cecilia De Castro, who conducts  training classes for chefs, misses the fresh taste of just-caught fish and  shrimp. "It's very hard to translate the flavor without the freshness," she  said. All restaurateurs miss the luscious, buttery-smooth mangoes of the  Philippines. Without them it is impossible to make such entrancing desserts as  mango jubilee, a flaming fruit concoction that is spooned over ice cream.  </P> <P> We also can't get tangy-sweet green mango juice, a common aperitif in the  Philippines. Manuel and Corazon Ongpauco Tamayo of Barrio Fiesta in Los Angeles  apologize for using tomato instead of green mango in a relish that accompanies  a platter of barbecued meats and seafood. On the other hand, Manuel Tamayo  thinks some dishes taste better in the United States because Philippine-made  ingredients here are of export quality (superior to what is sold in the  islands).  </P> <P> That doesn't stop the Tamayos from bringing in bagoong made by a Manila  restaurant chain, because it tastes better than the brands sold here. Their  cooks insist on peanut butter from the Philippines. And Manila is the only  place they can get the Chinese brand of banana flavoring that they use in sago  and gulaman, a sweet drink made with gelatin cubes and sago pearls.  </P> <P> One of the first Filipinos to enter the market was veteran Manila restaurateur  Rey Bautista, who opened Tito Rey of the Islands in 1984 in Daly City, near San  Francisco. His clientele there is 90% Filipino, and he serves them the more  exotic sorts of Filipino foods, including the aforementioned tripe and pig's  ear, as well as pork fat, liver, shrimp heads and dinuguan, which is composed  of pork meat and internal organs simmered in blood. But when Bautista opened a  West Los Angeles branch of his restaurant (11829 Wilshire Blvd.; (213)  479-7008) in 1987, he changed the menu to suit the non-Filipino area.  Westernized creations that he introduced here include a "Filipinized" Caesar  salad -- crisp-fried pork skin and dried shrimp replace croutons, and a touch  of bagoong flavors the dressing. A tiny bit of bagoong also goes into the dip  that accompanies an appetizer of batter-coated, deep-fried kangkong (water  convolvulus) leaves.  </P> <P> Lorna and Ben Halili, founders of the Mommy's Best eating places in Manila,  arrived in L.A. in 1984 and the next year started a chain called Manila Sunset  (2815 W. Sunset Blvd.; (213) 484-5161). Now there are Manila Sunsets in West  Covina and Sepulveda, as well as Chicago, New Jersey and Virginia.  </P> <P> Manila Sunset's menu is limited to a handful of dishes that would not commonly  be prepared at home. The chief attraction is bibingka, a rice-flour cake that  is traditionally baked in an earthen container with charcoal at top and bottom.  Lorna Halili searched until she found a commercial oven that duplicated this  effect. She soaks rice overnight and grinds it -- the old-style way of making a  more traditional flour. Then she lines the baking dishes with banana leaves and  tops the batter with a salted duck egg and cheese. The cake comes to the table  brushed with butter and sprinkled with sugar and grated fresh coconut.  </P> <P> Another specialty is puto bumbong, small purple rice cakes steamed in bamboo  tubes and topped lavishly with sugar, coconut and melted butter. A dark rice  called pirurutong produces the color naturally. Still another special is pancit  malabon, rice noodles in an annatto-colored sauce topped with hard-cooked egg,  shrimp, pork and pork cracklings.  </P> <P> Many Filipino restaurants offer Continental, American and other types of Asian  food in hopes of broadening their appeal. Mario's, named for owner Mario  Benitez, opened in Santa Ana under the name Calesa (2106 N. Tustin Ave.; (714)  541-6585) so that Californians wouldn't expect an Italian menu. (Calesas are  horse-drawn carriages that still operate in the Philippines, and one sits  perched on the restaurant roof.) Calesa played it safe by adopting "Around the  World Dining" as his theme and offering Continental food in addition to  Filipino dishes. Thus one can have French onion soup, crisp duck legs with  orange sauce or Maryland crab cakes along with adobo (chicken and pork cooked  with vinegar, garlic and soy sauce), fried lumpia (egg rolls), shrimps in  coconut sauce and lengua (tongue) in red wine sauce.  </P> <P> The Aristocrat, Manila's oldest major restaurant, opened in 1936 and grew to  eight branches. Its American offshoot, The Aristocrat of the Orient in Los  Angeles (400 S. San Vicente Blvd.; (213) 657-0581), got off to a rather  faltering start in August. The menu here is as heavy in Japanese and Chinese  dishes as in Filipino food, which is downplayed. Kalbi chim, a Korean beef-rib  soup, has been written into the menu, but the highly popular Filipino sinigang,  which incorporates vegetables and meat or seafood in a sour broth, has been  relegated to the specials announced by waiters. It is, however, available  daily. In January, the restaurant opened a sushi bar, which is manned by a  Japanese-trained Filipino chef.  </P> <P> Mami King (4321 W. Sunset Blvd., L.A.; (213) 669-1078. 21209 Hawthorne Blvd.,  Torrance; (213) 540-3326) leans toward the Chinese side of the Filipino  heritage. It features noodle soups and fluffy siopao, the Filipino version of  Chinese barbecued pork buns. Max's restaurant (3575 Wilshire Blvd.; (213)  384-3043) is the first American branch of a famous Filipino chain that based  its success on fried chicken (its motto: "The House That Fried Chicken Built").  </P> <P> Manila's leading caterer, Glenda Barretto, is involved in Via Mare (3377  Wilshire Blvd.; (213) 480-1223), a restaurant and adjacent coffee shop in the  mid-Wilshire district. The coffee shop, which features traditional Filipino  dishes, opened recently. The dining room, which is not yet open, will offer  Continental seafood. Barretto is president of Via Mare Catering Services, which  operates the original Via Mare restaurant and several coffee shops in Manila.  </P> <P> In the past, restaurants here paid little attention to ambiance. Then, in 1987,  the ambitious Barrio Fiesta (3821 W. 6th St.; (213) 383-9762), which has 16  branches in the Philippines, unveiled a tropical setting imported entirely from  the Philippines, right down to the pale narra-wood flooring. The response was  resounding applause from the Filipino community and prolonged waits for a  table. The menu is exclusively Filipino. One top-rated dish is crispy pata,  pig's knuckles deep fried to produce crisp outer skin and succulent meat. A  Barrio Fiesta opened in October in South San Francisco, and another is planned  for San Diego.  </P> <P> Los Angeles also has a scattering of turo turo restaurants, where the food is  set out in steam tables for quick service (turo turo means "point point"). A  good example is Greenhills Restaurant (2745 W. Beverly Blvd.; (213) 487-4224),  near downtown Los Angeles. Here the large selection of dishes, which changes  daily, might include catfish cooked with coconut milk and spinach, pinakbet,  barbecued chicken, adobo, longaniza (Filipino-style sausage), pancit canton  (fried noodles), kare kare (oxtails in peanut sauce) and sinigang. In addition,  there are desserts such as sapin sapin, a coconut-flavored rice flour cake  composed of orange, purple and white layers. Like most Filipino restaurants,  Greenhills serves halo halo, a soda glass filled with sweetened beans,  jackfruit, coconut shreds, palm seeds, sweetened ube paste, ice, milk and a  spoonful of flan.  </P> <P> Filipino food clearly appeals to this nation's large Filipino population -- but  the new breed of restaurateur hopes for a wider audience. "I think there's a  big future," says Fil Benitez, manager of Calesa. "The Philippines is really a  cross of East and West."  </P> <P> This special issue was edited by David Fox, Sunday Calendar assistant editor.  </P></p>

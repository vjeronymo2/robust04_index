			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Zhdankin under the rubric "Weapons": "The </F> Formula for Binary Death: The Disclosure Has Been Rescheduled"]    [Text] In the last issue we reported that chemical  scientist Vladimir Uglev, one of the developers of the  state-of-the art types of domestic chemical weapons, had  appealed through the press (in essence, issued an ultimatum) to  the president of Russia. The scientist promised to divulge on 4  February "the chemical formulae and names, precursors for their  production, and mode of combat application" of our binary  weapons unless he was received by the president personally so  that he could familiarize him with an "independent point of  view" on the destruction of chemical weapons.    The dissident from the military-chemical complex has not  been  received by the president, 4 February has come and gone, but the  world did not shudder. All the secrets except those divulged  earlier remained in the scientist's head.    V. Uglev gave several reasons for his "restraint." In the  first place, "up above," he believes, there has been a shift in  ideas about the real problems related to the destruction of  chemical weapons. The president's assistant for national  security, Yuriy Baturin, met with the scientist. He agreed with  Uglev that there are problems, and the primary one is clarifying  the real quantities of our stockpiles.    Additionally, understanding the full measure of his  responsibility, the scientist did not intend to reveal the  secret. One of the distinctions of binary weapons from previous  toxic substances is that the components in and of themselves  present no great danger and are produced in immense quantities  for peacetime purposes, and therefore it is practically  impossible to stop up leaks. If they know the formula, in  Uglev's words, fifth-grade chemistry students can manufacture a  binary weapon that surpasses everything created heretofore in  terms of its killing force. That is, the danger of uncontrolled  spread of binary death is immense. As a person with common  sense, the scientist did not intend to contribute to this, and  his threat was a bluff, a means of making his way into the  highest corridors of power.    The third factor is specific. Having loudly declared his  intentions, V. Uglev expected authorized organs to pay attention  to him. But the special services ignored him. Uglev also knows  the formulae for the latest developments in American chemical  weaponry, which, incidentally, do not come under the Convention  on Bans. It is logical to assume that our former potential  enemies have a concrete idea of our "achievements." So the state  secret has already leaked out, and all Uglev has to do is  divulge the formula in order for all the former imperfections of  the special services to be blamed on him.    Another reason disappeared of its own accord. Uglev demanded  the release of V. Mirzayanov from "Sailor's Rest" prison. In the  words of lawyer A. Asnis, Mirzayanov does not intend to change  his decisions and therefore he will not submit petitions to  change the punishment.    But V. Uglev is certainly not in a good mood. He does not  rule out the possibility of divulging information about our  achievements. "That moment may come if we are driven into a  corner and the leaders continue to completely ignore these  problems."    The problems are indeed of an apocalyptic nature. The  official, fairly rosy position will not stand up under  criticism. Generals of the military-chemical complex assert that  destroying chemical weapons is dangerous, but in Volskiy Rayon,  where the military chemical testing ground is located, the  incidence of oncological diseases has almost doubled in two  years. The average indicator for Russia is less than this by a  factor of 2.5. These figures are from the Saratov Oncological  Center. Surpluses concealed from the world community and the  people themselves are being destroyed hastily and barbarically.  Last summer an outbreak of skin diseases was reported in that  same Volskiy Rayon. The clinical picture is the same as with  mustard gas or lewisite contamination. The military blame the  grass cow parsnip which, according to biologists, is found  extremely rarely in those regions. An examination of the soil in  certain places on the test ground showed the arsenic content to  be 330 grams per kilogram of soil. Mustard gas and lewisite  contain arsenic. The poison is simply poured onto the soil! One  could give a long list of examples.    The program for the destruction of chemical weapons  developed  by generals from the military-chemical complex will apparently  have to be revised. The contradictions between the majority of  aspects of the official viewpoint and the positions of  independent specialists, including V. Uglev, V. Mirzayanov, L.  Fedorov, and others, may be what Lenin would have called  blatant. This pertains both to the quantity and the  classification and the technologies and the cost and the safety.  Leaders of the military-chemical complex are remaining silent,  but this cannot last long--these problems have received too  great a response. It will be necessary to admit many unpleasant  things. Having begun with some kind of "trivia," the official  picture of military-chemical socialist realism is coming apart  at the seams. So many sad sensations lie ahead.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VIEW FINDER: ODDS &amp; / ENDS AROUND THE VALLEY;  </P> <P> THE FISH LADY  </P> <P> Patients at a hospital in the West Valley are sometimes surprised when a woman  carrying a bucket of dead fish comes to see the doctor.  </P> <P> "I'm responsible for about 5,000 koi. Sometimes, when I can't figure out why  certain fish died, I'll bring them to this doctor friend who does a full  autopsy free of charge," says Barbara Johnson, whose company, "The Fish Lady,"  specializes in pond and koi care.  </P> <P> Three years ago, Johnson, who lives in Sherman Oaks, was working in the film  industry. "It's a business of loonies," she states unequivocally. "I didn't  want to pay a shrink $125 an hour to tell me to relax, so I got into fish  instead." (The minimum payment for one call is $45.)  </P> <P> Now she works 12-hour days and is on call 24 hours a day. "If a fish gets sick,  you want to get there right away because they go fast," she says.  </P> <P> Johnson, who runs her business out of her home, administers shots and once  spent several hours moving a comatose fish back and forth in a pond, in a  successful attempt to revive it. "My arm was killing me by the time I was  done," she recalls.  </P> <P> One of the more fun parts of her job is stocking a client's pond. "I create a  water painting with fish. They all have different colors and patterns, so when  they swim around, it's mesmerizing," Johnson says.  </P> <P> Tranquility does have its price. Johnson says, "I don't eat much fish anymore  because it's too personal."  </P> <P> A New Spin on Art  </P> <P> There's a whole lot of painting going on in the Valley these days, thanks to  two new businesses that make instant artists out of their customers.  </P> <P> The first, Paintemonium, is a shopping mall store that sells T-shirts, socks,  sweat shirts, and leggings, which customers decorate with paint at worktables  inside the store. Anyone with a less-than- steady hand may opt to have their  piece put into a spinner, where the paints swirl together and race off the edge  of the garment. It costs $16 to buy and paint an adult-size T-shirt.  </P> <P> "It's wearable art," says Lori Ross, manager of Paintemonium in the Glendale  Galleria. (There are also outlets in Topanga Plaza and the Northridge Fashion  Center.) "You can even bring in your own clothes and just pay for the paints.  We've had people bring in gym shoes, boxer shorts and even bikinis."  </P> <P> Some customers paint the bottoms of their dog's feet or their child's hands and  imprint them on the clothing.  </P> <P> In Northridge, another business called Kids 'N Paint ("Ages 5 to 95") sometimes  resembles a child-care center. It sells a huge assortment of plaster objects --  such as masks, coin banks, animal figurines, letters and numbers -- which  children (and yes, some adults) paint in the store.  </P> <P> "We provide smocks, a bathroom, a pay phone, glitter, lace, soft drinks,  popcorn -- you name it," says co-owner Elissa Fishman. Prices start at $1 and  average about $6.  </P> <P> The New Smell of Facials  </P> <P> "Aromatherapy has been around for centuries, but it's relatively new to this  country," says Renate Barbev, co-owner of The Face Maker Skin Care Salon in  Westlake Village.  </P> <P> As part of a facial treatment, aromatherapy involves the application of  fragrant essential oils to the skin during the massage stage. (According to  skin-care experts, essential oils, made from plant extracts, are used for such  problems as red and dry skin.) "Most facial treatments rely on various creams  instead of these oils," says Arlene Worchell, owner of Arlene's Beauty Retreat,  a skin-care salon in Northridge.  </P> <P> Among the essential oils that may be used are lavender, lemon, pine,  eucalyptus, rosemary, chamomile, rose or geranium, each with its own  revitalizing or healing properties. The condition of a client's skin at the  time of the facial determines which oil or combination of oils will be used.  </P> <P> "Don't forget that our sense of smell is very closely linked to our emotional  system -- a whiff of something can sometimes bring back a powerful memory that  is very pleasing to you," Worchell says. "These oils smell very lovely, and  people relax when they smell the fragrance."  </P> <P> The cost of an aromatherapy facial is comparable to a regular facial: $35 to  $40.  </P> <P> Ivy to Go  </P> <P> "The main reason we got rid of it was because of the rats, and the second  reason was because we hated it. Ivy hampers you in your landscaping because it  overtakes everything," says homeowner Sylvia Mandel of Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> That ubiquitous ground cover is frequently being ripped out of yards where it's  been growing for decades. "People don't like the look of it anymore. They're  tired of it," says Steve Weber, bedding plant manager at Green Arrow Nursery in  Sepulveda. "We probably have over 50 varieties of ground cover that we carry  here, and one of the most popular ones right now is called Red Apple. It looks  like ice plant, has a lot of red flowers in the spring through summer and is  very drought resistant."  </P> <P> Among the other ground covers frequently replacing ivy are African daisies and  ice plant. They are similarly priced (about $8.99 a flat) but are more labor  intensive. Unlike ivy, they need to be fertilized and watered regularly and are  more prone to disease. Rosemary and lantana (at $10.99 a flat) are other  popular choices.  </P> <P> But this is not the time of year to replace any ivy growing on hillsides, warns  David Ngo, owner of Suburban Landscape and Maintenance in Van Nuys. "It's  better to wait until after the rains," he says.  </P> <P> Overheard at . . .  </P> <P> "My husband calls it the most expensive coffee warmer in the world."  </P> <P>  -- Woman in Encino Gelson's, referring to her microwave.  </P></p>

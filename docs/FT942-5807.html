			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recovers initial fall on inflation fears Wall Street Blue chip stocks finished with modest gains yesterday after recovering from early declines touched off by inflationary jitters in the bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.46 higher at 3,760.83, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.13 at 457.63. Volume on the New York SE was moderate, with 278.5m shares changing hands. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite shed 0.57 to 439.88 but the Nasdaq composite added 0.33 at 735.52. For most of the session, stocks moved in step with the US Treasury market. Its first move was down sharply. At mid-morning, bonds went into a tailspin when the National Association of Purchasing Management released the results of its monthly survey. The closely watched report actually offered a mixed view of the economy. Its overall May index was unchanged from the previous month, but the prices index showed a big rise from April. The data suggested that a gradual escalation of demand for raw materials had begun to feed through to prices paid by manufacturers. The trend, reasoned inflation-sensitive bond traders, would soon lead to higher prices paid by consumers. But government securities managed to stabilise and gradually retrace all the ground lost immediately after the NAPM's announcement. Sliding prices for gold and other commodities helped to soothe nerves, as did talk of outright bond purchases by the Federal Reserve, a move which carried no policy implications. During the afternoon, bonds continued to move ahead, ending the day with solid gains. The gradual improvement in the Treasury market helped the Dow industrials to a point. After falling by as many as 25 points during the morning, the bellwether index could only manage to nudge slightly into the plus column. A few cyclical stocks were stubbornly anchored in negative territory. Caterpillar lost Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 105 1/2 and Cummins slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 42 1/4 . But Chevron, up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 88 1/4 , Sears Roebuck, Dollars 1 1/4 higher at Dollars 51 7/8 , and International Paper, Dollars 1 3/4 ahead at Dollars 71, rallied during the afternoon. Banking issues also pushed higher in late trading. Bankers Trust gained Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 72 1/4 , Chase Manhattan added Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 39 3/8 and Chemical Bank ended Dollars 1 3/8 better at Dollars 39 3/4 . Analysts said the gains may reflect a shift away from cyclical issues in response to the recent evidence of a cooling economy. Takeover speculation in the pharmaceuticals field emerged once again. This time the potential target was US Surgical, the medical equipment supplier. The stock jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 21 1/2 on expectations that Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss drug group, would launch a takeover bid. International Game Technology improved Dollars 1 to Dollars 23 1/8 . Its management issued a positive assessment of the company's prospects in an effort to arrest the recent slide in its share price. Canada Toronto tumbled in moderate trade, dragged down by a dropping gold price and weak Canadian bonds. The TSE 300 index fell 37.1 to close at 4,289.7 and declines led rises by 466 to 288 in volume of 56.2m shares. Canadian bond markets felt the impact of heavy foreign selling of Quebec bonds due to nervousness over forthcoming elections in the province. Bond prices recovered somewhat but the TSE 300 index managed only a slight rally from its intraday low. Brazil After opening easier following disappointment over the failure by a congressional committee to agree a revision of the constitution late on Tuesday, the Bovespa index picked up again. By the close the index stood a net 593, or 2.4 per cent, higher at 25,265. Brokers said liquidity had risen by late morning as foreign investors returned to the market. The day's turnover reached Cr348.6bn (Dollars 182.7m). An announcement shortly after the market closed by Mr Rubens Ricupero, the economy minister, of new rules for Brazil's new currency, the real, to be introduced on July 1, was seen as providing support for Friday's opening. Brazilian markets are closed today due to the Corpus Christi holiday.</p>

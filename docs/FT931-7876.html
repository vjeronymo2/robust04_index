			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (6): Starting point for success - Gary Mead tries to find the secrets of a good conference THERE IS no ready-reckoner to indicate how best to fix any of the many variables concerning a conference. How much to spend; how long it should last; what the venue should be; how best to publicise it - all are crucial factors in determining whether or not it will be successful, but any conference organiser requires from a client one basic starting point. Setting carefully defined objectives and aims to be achieved by the conference or exhibition is an absolute prerequisite for a successful event. According to Mr Paul Swan, managing director of event organiser Spectrum Communications, 'there is now almost no capital city that does not have what it terms a convention centre and many secondary capitals such as Birmingham, Edinburgh or Glasgow, all either have or plan to have good conference centres.' The wide choice of international venues, with at least 10 conference centres with excellent infrastructural support in the former west Germany alone, means that event organisers can be spoilt for choice - and have the opportunity for fine-tuned negotiation over not just price but other services too. Moreover, the line between conferences and exhibitions is blurring; it is increasingly rare to find a conference without some sort of exhibition, and many exhibitions are now offering associated seminars. That development has resulted partly from the fact that the sector has suffered from the recession. 'Absolutely loads' of companies in the industry have gone under, according to Mr Swan. 'What has happened is that an awful lot of the smaller organisations have gone and there is a move towards the more secure suppliers, and they are all quite busy,' he adds. The more casual spending, especially at the euphemistically titled 'incentive' end of the market, has stopped, as testified by empty hotels everywhere. 'It is also tougher to win clients,' says Mr Swan, 'because there are people who go purely on price, since their own company is in survival mode.' The event organisers that are surviving have had to learn some essential business lessons These include: building solid relationships with their clients; how to understand their clients' strategic needs; taking a long-term view to maintain quality of service; and being able to compete not just on price but also on giving value in many different ways. Spectrum and similar companies are investing in efforts to measure the success of what they do, by pre and post-event measurements of retention of the message of events. Ms Diana Ambrose, managing director of Conference Associates and Services, and vice-president of the International Association of Professional Congress Organisers (Iapco), says that when it comes to selecting a conference or exhibition organiser it is vital to 'see how long they have been in business. Study their track record. Look at the type of events they have organised, speak to some of their previous clients, even look at their office structure, how it operates. There are a lot of companies that appear and disappear. Many conferences are now being planned for two years' time and it is vital to make sure that the organiser has the financial means to survive.' Choosing a venue requires careful planning. If international, then it must be a location well-served by airlines and with adequate accommodation. If people are paying to attend rather than being required to do so by their company, then a line-up of attractive speakers is important. Making sure that no-one speaks for 20 minutes is a basic rule of thumb, since, as Ms Ambrose puts it, 'no-one says anything more in 60 minutes than they can adequately do in half that time.' Mr Swan says that it is important to get from the client what the purpose of the event is: 'Is this meant to be fun? Is it meant to have very cerebral overtones, in which case we could go to Oxford or Cambridge? 'Some time ago one of our clients had booked one of our favourite venues, the NEC in Birmingham. Then they told us what the show was meant to achieve and we took them instead to Paris. We are big fans of the NEC but what our clients were trying to do in overall terms of ambience and feel was best served by Paris, even before we found the individual hotel. 'First impressions at an event are crucial; by stepping into a luxury hotel in Paris you create a certain feeling. For other types of events, the NEC might be much better. It's a bit like three-dimensional noughts and crosses; you've have got a lot of variables which need to be considered.' Ms Vanessa Cotton of the Event Organisation Company, confirms that those event-organising companies which are marketing-led have not only survived the recession but actually done rather well through it. 'Corporate clients are now looking for very visible value for money. A meeting which generates a few hundred leads in the form of real people as part of an overall communications campaign has got value stamped all over it, compared to meetings which are just held because they always have been or those where no-one has really thought about why they are doing it. People now have to examine - and are examining - why they hold an event.' It is therefore impossible to define a good conference in any single way. For delegates, it must mean a satisfying experience without hassles over poor accommodation, food, transport and service. For those who have spent their money on holding the conference, it must lead to new custom (if the host is a company) or a certainty that any future conferences will maintain or increase attendance (if the host is a trade or other association). As with any other marketing tool, the only reason for using it is if the response is positive. Two organisations which are able to give advice on organising conferences are: The Association of British Professional Conference Organisers (ABPCO); Tony Waters (secretary), c/o 54 Church Street, Tisbury, Salisbury, Wiltshire SP3 6MH. International Association of Professional Conference Organisers (IAPCO); Ghislaine de Coninck (executive secretary), Rue Washington 40, B-1050, Brussels.</p>

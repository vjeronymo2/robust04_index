			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> NOT MUCH PUNCH TO 'MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK'  </P> <P> Tonight at 9 on NBC (channels 4, 36, 39), it's the movie named after a '60s  song of the week: "My Boyfriend's Back." And, yes, if you watch it, you're  gonna be sorry. Hey-la, hey-la.  </P> <P> No, this is not a docudrama about the girl group, the Angels, that briefly hit  it big with the title song back in 1963, but rather a comedy-drama about the  fictional Bouffants, played for maximum cuteness by TV stars Jill Eikenberry,  Sandy Duncan and Judith Light.  </P> <P> Fiction is truly duller than truth as a TV executive (guess which network)  tracks down the three middle-aged Bouffants, whose collective hair, if not  their egos, has deflated over the years, reuniting them for a live TV nostalgia  special to be titled "The Warholians Who Wouldn't Go Away" -- er, "My  Boyfriend's Back."  </P> <P> Playing the network exec as a self-serving, dimwitted hunk (which makes you  wonder about NBC's self-image), John Sanderford mutters such things as: "My  entire television career is riding on my promise to deliver the Bouffants!"  This makes him sound more like a desperate French caterer than a brilliant  media VP.  </P> <P> His efforts are welcomed by Duncan, who's become a housewife, and Light, who's  carried the singing torch to new lows at a bowling alley lounge -- but thwarted  by Eikenberry, who is an executive herself now reluctant to look back at her  high-haired past.  </P> <P> Eikenberry is a high-powered professional not unlike the one she plays on "L.A.  Law," only here she sports a much worse makeup job (which may be intentionally  ironic, since she's supposed to be a cosmetics firm VP but probably isn't) and  is cold, unavailable and secretly insecure. Do we sense some tearful  reconciliation and girlish rediscovery coming on here? Do we sense a pillow  fight approaching?  </P> <P> A few actual oldies stars, including Mary Wells and Gary Puckett, make cameos,  but writer Lindsay Harrison and director Paul Schneider show no sense of  authenticity or affection for the period(s) -- the early 1960s or the late  1980s.  </P></p>

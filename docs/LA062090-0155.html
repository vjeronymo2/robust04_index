			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAPSULE REVIEW;  </P> <P> MIDNIGHT OIL FIRMLY FILLS WHO'S SHOES  </P> <P> Meet the new boss, not quite the same as the old boss.  </P> <P> The rock pinata is stuffed nowadays with bands struggling to evoke the Beatles  or trying to be the new Stones, but hardly anyone seems interested in being the  new Who, with all the passion, bravado, bluster and sheer intellect that would  entail.  </P> <P> Filling those estimable shoes quite nicely -- and without really trying -- is  Midnight Oil, the world-class rock 'n' roll band from Australia that headlined  the first of two nights Tuesday at the Universal Amphitheatre with a  near-faultless show exceeded in its tugging sense of commitment only by its  viscerally overwhelming, finely detailed musical drive.  </P> <P> At last, the answer to who's next.  </P> <P> "It's good to be among friends," announced singer Peter Garrett -- not your  average giant bald left-wing Christian environmentalist hard-rock former  political candidate -- between edgy encore renditions of John Lennon's "Instant  Karma" and Nick Lowe's "Peace, Love and Understanding."  </P> <P> He explained, in the same earnest tones used to pitch the whale-saving and  anti-apartheid tables in the lobby, "We have a common understanding . . .  mistrust of Milli Vanilli."  </P> <P> Among the quite rousing songs played Tuesday: "Stars of Warburton,"  "Warakurna," "Kosciusko." Among the themes addressed: aboriginal rights and  outback strip mining. Clearly, this is not a band obsessed with Stateside  stardom.  </P> <P> The relentless punch with which Oil put across its songs in the late '70s and  early '80s -- when the band was playing the Hollywood Palladium and  slam-dancing audiences were the norm -- made the Clash the closest point of  reference. These days, though, they relent now and again, and few of the songs  from the group's two latest albums -- which accounted for 14 of the 17 original  selections Tuesday -- mandate a slam response.  </P> <P> The Who comparison is much more apt now, and not just because Garrett did a  fleeting windmill motion while miming during a guitar solo. The pace is more  moderate on most of their newer songs, and nuances of melody and timekeeping  have become far more important. The three-piece horn section used on a few  choice numbers -- borrowed from the opening act, fellow Aussies Hunters &amp;  Collectors -- recalled the heights of the Who's "Quadrophenia" era.  </P> <P> Garrett, of course, is no Roger Daltrey: He calmly and wittily plugs  environmental causes during the breaks (not to mention some SDI- and  Bush-bashing), then erupts in a fury of rigid motion during the songs, like a  cross between Joe Cocker and Robocop.  </P> <P> He's both smoothly articulate and unpredictably galvanized; his band is precise  and musically refined but positively rips. It's rock in an advanced  evolutionary state that indeed made the Milli Vanillis of the world seem like  crustaceans.  </P> <P> A complete review runs in Thursday's Calendar section.  </P></p>

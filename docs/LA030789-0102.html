			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 18 LAWYERS TO DEFECT FROM SHEA &amp; GOULD'S L.A. OFFICE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles office of Shea &amp; Gould, one of the nation's biggest and  most prestigious law firms, was rocked Monday by the disclosure that 18 of its  lawyers will leave to join a fast-growing competitor.  </P> <P> Sources close to Shea &amp; Gould said the firm is considering shutting its 3  1/2-year-old Los Angeles office as a result of the defections. The New  York-based firm currently has 70 lawyers here.  </P> <P> The departing lawyers, including eight partners and 10 associates, are leaving  Shea &amp; Gould by the end of March to open a Los Angeles office for Myerson  &amp; Kuhn. Founded only 14 months ago, Myerson &amp; Kuhn has grown to a firm  of more than 150 lawyers with headquarters in New York and additional offices  in Philadelphia, Washington and Dallas.  </P> <P> Both firms have ties to baseball history. One of Myerson &amp; Kuhn's  co-founders, Bowie Kuhn, is a former commissioner of major league baseball. The  name of one of Shea &amp; Gould's founders, William A. Shea, is on the New York  Mets stadium in Queens.  </P> <P> Heading the group leaving the Shea &amp; Gould office are senior partners Alan  U. Schwartz, Leon M. Cooper and Robert H. London, a former Los Angeles Superior  Court judge. Schwartz said the defections stemmed from disagreements over  compensation and "on how the office should be run."  </P> <P> Spokesmen for Shea &amp; Gould could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Shea &amp; Gould entered the Los Angeles market in mid-1985 by acquiring the  Century City firm of Pacht, Ross, Warne, Bernhard &amp; Sears.  </P> <P> The firm's arrival here dovetailed with a growing influx of New York law firms  to the area.  </P></p>

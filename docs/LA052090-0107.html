			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> SCREEN GEMS: Warren Beatty may be directing "Dick Tracy," but our favorite new  actor-turned-director is Kiefer Sutherland, who'll be at the helm of the next  Jude Cole video, "House Full of Reasons." One reason to watch for the clip:  It'll feature a guest appearance by Sutherland's current paramour, actress  Julia Roberts. . . . Serious Rock Fans should keep their eyes peeled for a sly  visual joke in the upcoming "Back to the Future III."  </P> <P> In a sequence that takes Michael J. Fox back to the Wild West of the 1880s, we  see a scraggly, bearded clump of musicians playing at a raucous hoedown. The  beards aren't fake -- the band is none other than ZZ Top, who pluck some old  Western-style tunes (and even offer a trademark spin of their guitars). The  guys can also be heard performing a new rock tune, "Double Back," on the film's  sound track. . . . And we're betting that Columbus, Ohio's WMGG-FM must have  heard that Led Zeppelin recently reunited for Jason Bonham's wedding (the  surviving members of the group, with Jason on drums, played "Rock &amp; Roll,"  "Custard Pie" and "Bring It on Home"). Maybe that's why -- as a programming  stunt -- the station debuted its new classic-rock format earlier this month by  playing "Stairway to Heaven" nonstop for . . . 16 consecutive hours!  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A PALL OF ANGER HANGS OVER BLOODIED PLACE OF WORSHIP;  </P> <P> JERUSALEM: BOTH ARAB AND JEW REMAIN BITTER TWO DAYS AFTER A DEADLY  CONFRONTATION AT THE WESTERN WALL.  </P> <P> The common act of worship in the Old City is one of the inspiring sights of  Jerusalem, but on Wednesday a common pall of anger hung over Muslim and Jewish  shrines in the ancient walled district.  </P> <P> On the Temple Mount, holy to both religions, worshipers at the Al Aqsa mosque  prayed amid bloodstains on the richly woven Oriental carpets. Bloody clothing  also was on display, reminders of police gunfire Monday that killed 19  Palestinians.  </P> <P> Below, at the Western Wall, Jews prepared for the conclusion of Succot, the  feast of the tabernacles. Rocks hurled down from the mount had been cleared  away from the plaza in front of the wall, but the resentment of the attack by  rioters remained in the minds of the worshipers.  </P> <P> Talk was apocalyptic: The week's tragedy left only bitterness on both sides and  a gap of understanding that has long seemed unbridgeable.  </P> <P> "Next week, or next month, more of us will die. We expect nothing less from the  Jews," said Jihad Hamide Yassini, the father of a 15-year-old boy killed  Monday, as he looked at the display of bloody clothing in a side room at the  mosque. The pale-blue shirt of his son, Ezzedin, was among the collection.  </P> <P> "We don't want to kill anyone," said Rabbi Sholom Gold, a Long Island, N.Y.,  native, as he made his way to the Western Wall. "But we have to be able to live  here, come here and pray at the wall. Anyone who limits our access must  understand that he is endangering his own life."  </P> <P> The riot and killings Monday only accentuated a steady degeneration of the  atmosphere in the Old City during nearly three years of the Arab uprising --  stabbings of Jews by Arabs; shootings of Arabs by Jews; clashes between Arabs  and Jews who have moved into the traditional Muslim quarter of the city;  clashes between Jews and Christians over the occupation by Jewish seminarians  of a Christian Quarter building; stonings; marches; tear gas; police chases;  beatings; searches.  </P> <P> Now, even worship seems like a competition. Some would argue that here it  always was.  </P> <P> After the deaths Monday, the Temple Mount has become a shrine to martyrdom for  Palestinians. The fading bloodstains on the marble approaches to the Dome of  the Rock are marked by prayer rugs. Onlookers stop to count the six bullet  holes on the western face of the gilt-top dome. Boys finger full metal shells  collected at Al Aqsa.  </P> <P> "This was a massacre," murmurs a woman in a white veil, the traditional female  garb at the dome. "The Jews want to kill us."  </P> <P> When she learned an American was present, she shouted, "Why does America help  Israel? Do you hate us?"  </P> <P> Outside, within winding alleyways, four simultaneous wakes were under way for  Old City victims. One was at Yassini's house, held for his son. Neighbors sat  outside sipping coffee and praising the dead boy for defending the mosque  against Jews. Periodically, a rambunctious group of local youths would march by  chanting Palestinian slogans and consoling Yassini with a pledge that "we are  all your sons."  </P> <P> Around the corner, at the home of Musa Suweiti, a 26-year-old goldsmith killed  at the Temple Mount, the political tone of the wake was more pronounced. Red,  white, green and black Palestinian flags and pictures of Yasser Arafat, the  Palestine Liberation Organization leader, hung on the alleyway walls.  Nationalist music blared from a stereo.  </P> <P> A patrol of armed soldiers passed by and scanned the rooftop for stone  throwers, ignoring the illegal display of nationalist symbols.  </P> <P> "More explosions, more explosions," predicted Musa's brother, Majid.  </P> <P> At the Western Wall, the outward signs of tension were less apparent. Soldiers  kept watch from the heights of the Jewish Quarter. In an indirect reference to  the trouble, the government urged worshipers to attend celebrations there as  usual, and police pledged they would be safe.  </P> <P> "We're angry," said Tsvi Klein, a New York native and 18-year resident of  Israel. "The police should keep the Temple Mount closed so the Arabs learn they  pay for what they do. We came here yesterday. We could have been killed."  </P> <P> His wife, Drora, said that to remain, the Arabs must accept Jewish rule. "There  are certain conditions for strangers to stay in this land," she said.  </P> <P> Abe Grunfeld, a visitor from Brooklyn, criticized the Bush Administration for  its statements that Israeli police need to be better prepared and use more  restraint in similar situations.  </P> <P> "The world would condemn us for sneezing," he said. "Whatever we do, it will  bring a condemnation. We don't throw stones up at them."  </P> <P> "We can't reach them," his wife, Yona, remarked dryly.  </P> <P> But Aaron Tomlin, a newly arrived yeshiva student from Canada, expressed shock  at the incident and at the atmosphere here.  </P> <P> "Everybody hates somebody in this country," Tomlin said. "It's sad to walk  around."  </P> <P> As the sun set Wednesday, turning the blue sky a faded pink, crowds arrived for  the Simha Torah, or "Joy of Torah," celebration marking the end of Succot. From  afar, their prayers and song would appear to mingle with the call of the  muezzin at Al Aqsa proclaiming God is great and calling his own flock to  worship.  </P></p>

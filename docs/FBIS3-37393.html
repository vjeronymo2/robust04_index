He added that no extremist slogans targeting Russian  military  could be heard during the protest action. The organizers of the  picket had warned the Tallinn base command of it in advance.    Gavrilov said the pickets, which will be repeated every  Monday, are "designed to put pressure" on Russian politics. He  linked them with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's  recent statements.    "Judging by the speeches and the behaviour of the  participants, it was clear they gathered in order to reassure  themselves, not to express hostility toward us," Gavrilov told  BNS.</p>

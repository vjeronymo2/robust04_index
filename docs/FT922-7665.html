			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Books: London through a compassionate eye - Review of Doris Lessing LONDON OBSERVED by Doris Lessing Harper Collins Pounds 14.99, 214 pages AROUND 1985 Doris Lessing - to the relief of the vast majority of her admirers - returned to earth from outer space and gave us a major novel, The Good Terrorist, short-listed for the Booker Prize. That, like her latest book of stories and sketches, was an aspect of London observed; a London still too much with us, the London of the homeless. Lessing took the lid off a communal squat in which the clash of emotional, sexual and political aspirations among the temporary family formed by its inhabitants was put under fascinating scrutiny. Lessing has indeed been observing the seamy, and the affluent, sides of London for much of her career. Way back in 1960 Lessing set out in a work of non-fiction, In Pursuit of the English, where she gave a deeply honest account of her induction into the London of the working-class when she arrived here from Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. Lessing was then a young woman of 25 for whom England had throughout her childhood been 'a grail'. There have been frequent interruptions for such things as the study of Sufism, and travelling in order to sample life in troubled parts of the world, Pakistan and Afghanistan - see The Wind Blows Our Words Away (a Picador Original, 1987) - and of course into the stratosphere in her multi-volume Canopus in Argos: Archives Series. But ever since that arrival more than 30 years ago, Lessing has been living in - and that means bringing her wise compassionate gaze to bear on - London. It is, as she makes explicit in London Observed, that part of London whose centre is West Hampstead and whose extent may be measured by the sections of the Bakerloo and Jubilee Lines that run from there to Trafalgar Square. The story printed here 'In Defence of the Underground' is 16 pages long, and about medium-length for the collection as a whole. It describes a typical journey made along this route. 'I like travelling by Underground. This is a defiant admission', says Lessing. One assumes she was fortunate enough to have had a seat for the whole journey. The other passengers are codified collectively and then each is described individually: 'In my half of the carriage are three white people and the rest are black and brown and yellowish. Or, by another division, five females and six males. Or, four young people and seven middle-aged or elderly. Two Japanese girls, as glossy and self-sufficient as young cats, sit smiling. Surely the mourners for old London must applaud the Japanese who are never, ever, scruffy or careless?' This persona of the sharp-eyed observer, who appears merely to describe the external scene as well as she can, is one that suits Lessing's temperament as a fiction-writer and which she uses with great assurance. Unobtrusively, in this ruminating fashion, serious points are made, structures shaped out of the steady march of mundane events. She does it again stuck in her car in a traffic jam on Hampstead Heath near Kenwood - she doesn't always go by public transport, it would seem - where neither of the two offending vehicles was prepared on principle to reverse, thereby causing a long tailback and tedious delay for other motorists frustratedly sounding their horns. And she does it often again in a whole range of local London settings where a miscellaneous collection of people is brought together - the waiting-area of the Casualty Department of a hospital; or various cafes in Hampstead or Regent's Park where Lessing likes to spend time, sipping tea while eaves-dropping on the other customers. A particularly good story of this sort deals with the tension apparent between a couple enjoying some refreshment in the park; they are observed in terms of their reactions to the sparrows who land on their table pecking at crumbs. Again, nearby in Queen Mary's Rose Garden, Lessing observes a young woman furtively taking cuttings, and it leads the writer to speculate on the woman's relations with her mother. Every writer about London produces a completely different version of it. In modern times the Londons of Orwell and Virginia Woolf are perhaps the two extremities. Lessing's London spans both; she is at home with the former's underclass as she follows a social worker into a tower block where he attempts unsuccessfully to persuade a Pakistani woman to send her daughter to a special school for autistic children; or when Lessing catches sight of a young mother begging outside a supermarket, penniless because of a strike by the staff of the DHSS. Yet Lessing's range is such that she is no stranger to the world of Mrs Dalloway. From time to time she takes us into drawing-rooms within earshot of the sound of Big Ben and the division bells. 'Her' gives a brilliant impression of a political salon in Westminster during the Thatcher era; while 'Two Old Women and a Young One' chronicles a publishing lunch in a chic London restaurant. One longer story with which this book ends take us out of London altogether to a pleasant weekend country house where the former and present wife of a successful man are assembled under the same roof. Taken as a whole the stories exemplify the point Lessing made in the talk she gave on 'Women's Quests' at the 92nd Street Y in New York last year (re-printed in the current Partisan Review, 2, 1992): 'So, all that great explosion of energy (behind women's liberation) has ended up with a very narrow section of the female population doing better than it did.' These excellent stories deal with some of the women whom the women's movement has passed by.</p>

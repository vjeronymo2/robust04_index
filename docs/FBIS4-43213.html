			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Guy Duplat: "The Danger"] </F>   [Text] Brussels and Wallonia are now going to have to live  with an extreme right, just like Flanders and France already  have had to do for several years. We had thought we might be  spared this peril, but now it is upon us. Nearly one  French-speaking voter in 10 decided on Sunday [13 June] not just  to show their dissatisfaction with the traditional parties, but  also to reject the democracy which is a credit to our European  countries.    That is the sad but important lesson of this European vote,  in addition to the collapse of the PS [Walloon Socialist Party]  and the victory of the PRL [Walloon Liberal Party]-FDF [Brussels  French-speaking Democratic Front]. Experience abroad has shown  us that these extremist votes cannot be eradicated in just a few  years. They reflect a lasting malaise which requires long-term  action by the democratic parties.    But let us first forcefully remind all those who wanted to  "vent their frustration" by voting for the FN [National Front]  or Agir [Act] that these votes will remain a surface irruption,  without real effect. These parties will never share in the  exercise of power and are no more than a movement of negation, a  turning inward that offers no solution to the serious problems  to which they are seeking to draw attention.    A vote for the extreme right is in fact a "cry for help."  Very often the cry of people directly hurt by the crisis, whose  lives are affected by insecurity, poverty, and unemployment.  Sometimes people who believed in the solutions of the PS but  feel let down by the scandals that have brought disgrace to the  political class. This electorate, often inhabiting areas with a  high immigrant population, seeks and finds a scapegoat in "them."    The democratic parties, those who have won today and those  who have lost, must be careful not to console or absolve  themselves by simply pointing to the -- real -- danger of this  extreme right. They must attack the very roots of the evil.  They must restore ethical values to the political debate,  combat the pockets of poverty and exclusion that are the  breeding ground for extremism, and take real account of the  problems of society that were so discussed in November 1991 but  that so often, in the interests of government budgets and state  reform, failed to result in action. Insecurity remains a  sensitive point. The democratic parties were wise to keep  silent on the problem of immigration during the campaign. But  what have they really done to support the former Royal  Commission on Immigration, and now the Center for Equal  Opportunity, in the struggle for the harmonious integration of  communities which are in any event here to stay, whatever the  dangerous harbingers of the far right may like to think?    The far right has now come crashing into our political  system. The essential task for the future is to provide a  democratic solution to the sickness which has found such  scandalous expression.</p>

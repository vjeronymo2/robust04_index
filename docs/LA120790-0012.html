			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGISTRATION OF ASSAULT GUNS  </P> <P> In response to "Gun Owners Ignoring Law on Registration," Part A, Nov. 28:  </P> <P> The Department of Justice claims that owners of these guns are not registering  them as required.  </P> <P> I sent in the form and my check two months ago, and have heard nothing. I can't  believe they are that inefficient (not even cashing the check). I rather expect  to see a lot of "sorry, we never received it" advice after Jan. 1, while lists  of would-be registrants are sent to local police departments for weapons  seizure at the first excuse. Those who are registering should do so by  registered mail.  </P> <P> CARL G. HOKANSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

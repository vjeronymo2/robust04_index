			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Taiji takes the whaling ban as a personal affront: Norwegian and Japanese whaling communities are united in their defiance of IWC moratorium TAIJI is a whaling town and proud of it - two humpback whales are mounted above the entrance to the town, whale motifs are emblazoned on manhole covers and it boasts a harpoon boat museum. Last week, 160 residents from the port in southern Japan protested in front of a Kyoto conference hall where the International Whaling Commission extended the moratorium on commercial whaling and angered the Japanese government. A frustrated Mr Setsuo Hamanaka, Taiji's mayor, stood with the protesters, who carried placards demanding that the delegates 'respect differences in food culture' and suggesting that 'France, get out of the IWC', a reference to the French proposal for a whale sanctuary in the southern oceans. 'The problem is that the IWC has become an environment protection group and not a whaling management association,' said Mr Hamanaka, who was yesterday guiding a Danish delegation around the town. 'The IWC was never intended to be a love-the-animals commission.' Taiji is determined to convince visitors that the whaling history in the region, traced back more than 1,000 years, has taught the town to understand and 'love' the whales. Most of the residents still have links with the fishing industry, but the town is not much interested in presenting itself as another fishing port, and wants to be known as 'the town living with the whales.' The result is a marine park, where killer whales charm tourists with their intelligence and tricks, a whale museum, whale meat restaurants, and whale-shaped boats which cruise the nearby islands. But the fluffy whale toys, the key rings, and blow-up mammals are not enough to satisfy the Taiji Fishermen's Co-operative which wants to get back into the business of whale hunting. The co-operative takes the whaling ban personally and nationalistically, seeing Japan as suffering unfairly at the hands of the international community. The co-operative's members complained that the people of Taiji are victims because the IWC does not understand the tradition of whaling culture in Japan. That tradition is displayed in the local museum, where an old whaling boat has been reconstructed, and benign-faced whalers spear their prey. But the question of whether whales will survive modern whaling techniques is raised by Kyomaru No. 11, a harpoon boat beached at the opposite end of Whale Park. The Kyomaru No. 11 takes credit for a haul of 12,638 whales and was part of a fleet which scoured the Antarctic in the 1960s and 1970s, bringing home the carcasses not for the local community, but for large Tokyo and Osaka companies. Mr Hamanaka says Taiji's immediate ambition is to return to a community-based whaling programme, not large hauls for Tokyo companies. But a Japanese proposal for a community-based quota of 50 whales was rejected last week by a majority of IWC member nations. 'We didn't win that vote, but I think we are starting to improve international understanding,' the mayor said. 'But western nations must remember to respect our culture.'</p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Fears over redundancy still rising THE PERCENTAGE of workers who fear they could lose their jobs within the next 12 months continues to rise, in spite of the fourth consecutive drop in official unemployment figures, a MORI survey published exclusively in the Financial Times reveals today. The increasing fear of redundancy is particularly pronounced among women, people aged 18 to 34 and those living in the Midlands. A quarter of those in work say they are 'very concerned' about being made redundant, rising to 36 per cent among the youngest category, 18- to 24-year-olds. The survey appears to indicate that some confidence has returned during the past month to professional and managerial employees. But overall, 44 per cent of workers are now 'very' or 'fairly' worried they could be made redundant over the coming year - up from 41 per cent in April, the first month of the research series, commissioned from MORI by Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay and conditions research group. Official seasonally-adjusted unemployment figures fell between April and May by 26,100 to 2.914m. This fourth consecutive monthly fall cut the seasonally-adjusted jobless rate to 10.4 per cent from 10.5 per cent in April and a winter peak of 10.6 per cent. Mr Andrew Brode, IRS publisher, said the continued rise in the IRS/MORI index 'shows that in the real world - uninhabited by politicians - all is not well'. Anxiety among women has risen 5 percentage points since April to 40 per cent, but is still lower than the fear shown by men that they could lose their jobs: 46 per cent of men were worried in April, a figure which rose slightly to 47 per cent by June. Concern among 18- to 34-year-olds has risen from 40 per cent to 48 per cent since April and, among all groups of employees in the Midlands, from 40 per cent to 49 per cent. May saw a sharp increase in fear of redundancy among social groups A and B - 28 per cent in April to 41 per cent - but this has now dropped back down to 32 per cent. MORI interviewed 978 adults aged 18 and over in full-time or part-time work, face-to-face in their homes, across 147 constituency sampling points throughout Britain on June 24-28. Data was weighted to match the profile of the population. The Finance and Leasing Association says in a report today that consumer credit in May was 29 per cent higher than a year earlier, Daniel Green writes. Motor finance was up 16 per cent and finance for the business community rose a 'patchy' 15 per cent. New car loans are leading the way in a recovery in consumer demand according to a report today from Infolink, the credit information organisation.</p>

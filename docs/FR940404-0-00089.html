			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Response to Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on the proposed rule were received from inmates, members of the general public, and other interested parties. The majority of inmate comments consisted of form letters from one institution. A summary of the comments and response to these follow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Use of Commissary Trust Fund <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter disagreed with the proposed rule, suggesting that the Bureau of Prisons is not expending the Commissary Trust Fund profits in accordance with the terms of the trust, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1321(b) (1993). This commenter expressed a belief that all federal inmates are the beneficiaries of the trust and any expenditure must benefit the inmate population ``as a whole.'' In this commenter's view, the ITS does not benefit all inmates and, thus, is not a proper expenditure from the trust.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bureau disagrees with this comment. The Commissary Trust Fund, and the commissary system that it finances, were established to further the Bureau's security and correctional management goals by permitting inmates to purchase goods and services not regularly provided by the Bureau. To encourage inmate financial responsibility and to further the Bureau's other correctional management and security concerns discussed above, it is appropriate to charge inmates for the costs of their telephone calls. In addition, inmates have no entitlement to a telephone system provided at government expense. It is, therefore, appropriate to charge inmates for the costs of their telephone calls, to deposit the revenue from the inmate telephone calls into the Commissary Trust Fund, and to use Commissary Trust Fund revenues to pay for the expenses of the ITS telephone system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The operation of the ITS through the Commissary Trust Fund will also benefit the inmate body as a whole because the ITS telephone rates, like the prices for other goods and services sold in Bureau commissaries, are designed to cover the cost of providing the service and to leave a profit in the Commissary Trust Fund. Thus, after the ITS is fully operational and start-up expenses have been recouped, the ITS is expected to increase the amount of Commissary Trust Fund money available for the procurement of books, recreational equipment, or other items that benefit the inmate population as a whole.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the trust documents establishing the Commissary Trust Fund, Department of Justice Circular 2126 (1930) and Department of Justice Circular 2244 (1932), give the Director of the Bureau of Prisons the sole discretionary authority to determine which items will be sold through institution commissaries and how, if at all, any Commissary Trust Fund profits will be disbursed. Both trust documents also authorize the Bureau to restrict inmates' commissary privileges to further penological goals and state that inmates are not entitled to any profits derived from the operation of institution commissaries. Thus, while the Commissary Trust Fund benefits the inmate population ``as a whole,'' inmates are not legal ``beneficiaries'' of the trust and have no right to control Commissary Trust Fund expenditures. For the reasons stated in the section entitled ``PURPOSE OF THE AMENDED REGULATIONS,'' the Bureau has determined that the ITS benefits both the inmate population and the public, such as protecting the public from inmate telephone abuse, and furthers the Bureau's correctional goals. It is appropriate, therefore, to pay the ITS expenses from the Commissary Trust Fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same commenter also contended that because the ITS program has enhanced security features, it should be paid for by using other appropriations. The commenter referenced 18 U.S.C. 4007, which calls for expenses attendant to the confinement of prisoners to be paid out of the Treasury of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response, the Bureau first notes that security equipment and supplies used to record telephone calls are not funded by Commissary Trust Fund revenues. Rather, funds for this equipment and these supplies will continue to be allocated from other appropriated Bureau funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for the other security features, the Bureau believes that one of its primary objectives is to ensure the security and good order of Bureau institutions, thereby benefitting both the inmate population as a whole and the public. It is not inappropriate to expend Commissary Trust Fund profits on the ITS merely because the system assists in achieving this goal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

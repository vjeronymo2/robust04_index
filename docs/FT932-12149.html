			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Kuehler sets date to leave IBM MR Jack Kuehler, vice-chairman and former president of International Business Machines, is to retire at the end of August after 35 years with the company. Mr Kuehler's retirement follows the appointment of Mr Louis Gerstner as IBM chairman and chief executive on April 1, and is another step in IBM 'changing of the guard'. But unlike former IBM chairman and chief executive Mr John Akers, who resigned in the face of mounting pressure from shareholders and board members, Mr Kuehler is leaving IBM after having postponed his long-planned retirement at the request of Mr Akers. 'Jack agreed last year to stay beyond his planned retirement date, and I'm pleased that he will stay through August to continue his work on key alliances and to advise me on technology issues,' said Mr Gerstner. One of the most widely respected executives in the computer industry, Mr Kuehler was the first technologist to reach the top ranks of IBM's executives. He is said to have long urged changes that are now under way within the company. In particular, Mr Kuehler was instrumental in the formation of IBM's technology alliance with Apple Computer and Motorola to develop microprocessors and software for a new generation of high performance, low-cost computers. He was also the architect of IBM's partnerships with Siemens and Japan's Toshiba in semiconductor memory chips, and with Toshiba in flat panel displays for laptop computers. 'Jack Kuehler is one of the princes of the computer industry,' said Mr Andrew Grove, chief executive of Intel. 'He understood the critical role of semiconductor manufacturers long before it was generally recognised in the computer industry.' In what may turn out to be his most lasting contribution to IBM's technology direction, Mr Kuehler was responsible for bringing to market the technology that is used in its workstation products and ultimately is expected to be the foundation for a broad new generation of computers.</p>

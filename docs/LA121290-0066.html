			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE GRANTS INCREASED POWER TO WATER  AGENCY  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has granted increased authority to a  nine-member board seeking to oversee cleanup of extensive ground water  pollution in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> Over the objections of environmentalists, the Main San Gabriel Basin  Watermaster had sought expanded powers to fill the leadership void in one of  the West's worst water pollution problems.  </P> <P> Judge Florence T. Pickard ruled this week that the water agency can have more  control over pumping by water suppliers, but must also hold public hearings as  part of any cleanup.  </P> <P> Water officials said the judge's decision solves a key jurisdictional problem.  Environmentalists, who advocate creation of a regional super-agency to deal  with the pollution, also claimed victory. They cited the judge's mandate that  in the case of any conflicts, the Watermaster must defer to public agencies  such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  </P></p>

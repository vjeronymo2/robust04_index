			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN CONTROL AND TRAGEDY IN A STOCKTON SCHOOLYARD  </P> <P> In your editorial, The Times predictably seized upon the tragedy of Stockton to  fuel new attempts to ban firearms. This time your target is so-called "assault  weapons."  </P> <P> The sad fact is that the murderer could have caused as much or more carnage at  the school by ramming his car across the playground, or burning a couple of  crowded classrooms with his "crude incendiary devices." Other disturbed people  in the past have used cars or arson to kill and you didn't issue outraged calls  to ban cars or gasoline.  </P> <P> A great many people own and use firearms such as the AK-47 in sport shooting or  as part of collections. The vast majority will never be used in crime. To  prohibit the legal ownership of something because criminals sometimes use it  and it has great potential for deadly misuse would logically lead to the  prohibition of many things. Private airplanes and boats, fast cars, chemistry  sets, home workshops, and personal computers are a few easy to name ones. I  don't think most Americans want to live in a society where government regulates  everything.  </P> <P> I am a member of the NRA. I am a "decent sportsman." I do work to make  lawmakers understand my views. I vote. I also can't think of a more "coercive  pressure group" than the anti-gun people you spearhead.  </P> <P> ERIC H. ELLERSIECK  </P> <P> Camp Pendleton  </P></p>

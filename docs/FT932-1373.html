			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Political reform for Mexico MEXICO'S ruling party has proposed a controversial political reform that would establish democratically elected self-government in Mexico City over the next seven years, but postpone the direct election of the mayor until 1997, writes Lucy Conger from Mexico City. Direct elections in Mexico City are a sensitive issue for the government following the party's defeat in the capital in the 1988 federal elections, when it lost the presidential race and both Senate seats.</p>

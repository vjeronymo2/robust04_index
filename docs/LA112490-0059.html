Someone who can perform, entertain or, more likely, sell  records. Did the recording academy ever ask whether Vanilli used their own  voices? If not, it has no right to complain.  </P> <P> I'll bet even Madonna and Michael Jackson can't recognize their own voices in  the mix of their records!  </P> <P> JON C.

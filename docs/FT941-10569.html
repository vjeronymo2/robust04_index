			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Superstore plan dropped J. Sainsbury, the food retailer, yesterday dropped its plan to build a superstore on the outskirts of Yeovil, Somerset. The scheme ran into strong local opposition, with protestors occupying vacant buildings in the town centre. The decision comes less than a fortnight after Sainsbury said it would continue with its programme of opening 20 superstores a year for the next four years. The company denied that the withdrawal had any bearing on its overall development programme, and said it was because Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, had given consent for a Safeway store about a mile away. Sainsbury said that since it first sought a Yeovil site in 1986 'the provision of food shopping in the town has increased dramatically'. It had negotiated a clause with South Somerset District Council that allowed it to withdraw if consent was given for another supermarket within five miles. The council supported Sainsbury but opposed Safeway's scheme. After a public inquiry Mr Gummer approved the Safeway plan in December. Recently the Department of the Environment has taken a tougher stance on out-of-town developments. On Monday Mr Gummer urged local authorities to discourage them.</p>

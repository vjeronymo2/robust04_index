			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / ANC plays down national protest prospects THE African National Congress yesterday played down expectations of big national protest actions following the funeral of slain black leader Mr Chris Hani, but said regional rallies and sit-ins would take place to try to force the pace of constitutional negotiations. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC's chief negotiator in the multi-party constitutional forum, held out hopes for early progress in the talks. He said he believed the forum could agree on a date for multi-racial elections, an interim constitution, and the installation of a Transitional Executive Council (an advisory body to oversee the ruling National party government) before the middle of June. 'Most of what we have to deal with has already been on the table for quite some time,' he said, and fellow negotiator Mr Joe Slovo noted that the election dates proposed by the government and the ANC were separated by only six months. 'After 350 years, these six months are not going to be a stumbling block between any of the parties,' he said. However the ANC's optimism looked unrealistic in light of comments yesterday from Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, who called the ANC's campaign of mass protest action 'ridiculous' and said it was a setback for negotiations. The ANC 'cannot ram their demands down the throats of the other parties.' Mr Slovo made clear that Inkatha would not be allowed to impede progress at the talks. 'If there are any parties that want to stand in the way they should not be allowed to hold the process to ransom,' he said, an obvious reference to Inkatha. A senior British policeman, Commander George Churchill-Coleman of the London Metropolitan Police, is to assist in the investigation of the Hani murder. Cmdr Churchill-Coleman is a former head of Britain's anti-terrorist squad. Path to peace, Page 25</p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Milken Lawyers Summarize Case: Lawyer for former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk  bond king Michael Milken claimed in a written summation that prosecutors failed  in recent pre-sentencing hearings to prove that Milken committed more crimes  than the six to which he pleaded guilty. Milken's lawyers also claimed that  prosecutors unfairly used their power to grant immunity to get pro-government  witnesses to testify while keeping out those sympathetic to Milken. The  prosecutors' written summation is expected to be made public today.  </P></p>

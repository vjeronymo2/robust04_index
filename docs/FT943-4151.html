			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Judges attacked for relying too much on eyewitnesses A new generation of judges is placing too much faith in unsupported eyewitness testimony, the British Association meeting heard yesterday. The judges have lost sight of the fact that 'fleeting glimpses lead to fragmentary and easily influenced memories' said Professor Graham Davies, a forensic psychologist from Leicester University, after reviewing miscarriages of justice. Identity parades can mislead, he said. The fact that an eye-witness is able to pick the suspect when eight others are present may be irrelevant if none of the other people in the parade looks like the defendant. The effective size of the parade - the number of people in it with the same physical description as the subject - is much more important than its actual size. Often the effective size can be reduced to one, which means that the identity parade is meaningless. In one case examined by Prof Davies the description of the suspect was sufficient for most people to select his photograph from those of the others in the parade. Witnesses tend to make their identifications using only two or three key features, often the eyes and the hair, said Prof Davies. They tend to ignore differences in other features such as the mouth and the chin, and will confuse two faces that are obviously very different. These problems of eye-witness testimony are well known to the legal profession. In 1976 Lord Devlin reported the results of a judicial inquiry that recommended that identification evidence alone should not usually be considered sufficient evidence for prosecution. These recommendations were not fully implemented, in part because of the importance of identification in cases of rape. But there continue to be cases where a conviction on the basis of identification evidence is overturned by evidence that comes to light after the trial.</p>

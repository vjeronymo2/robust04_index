			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Porsche family to step aside TWO senior members of the Porsche family are to stand down from leading roles on the supervisory board of the troubled sports car maker to make way for 'an outstanding entrepreneurial personality' from the chemicals industry, writes Christopher Parkes. Mr Helmut Sihler, former chairman of the management board at Henkel, was yesterday nominated as head of the Porsche supervisory board in succession to Mr Ferdinand 'FA' Porsche, who remains a full member of the board. Mr Sihler will also take over the board seat occupied by Mr Ferdinand 'Ferry' Porsche, the 83-year-old son of the company's founder, who will retain a role as honorary chairman. The changes mark a further development in the management culture at the group, which last year posted its first loss.</p>

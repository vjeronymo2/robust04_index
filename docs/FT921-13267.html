			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Spending reported stable at year-end EXPECTATIONS of low inflation and reduced fears of unemployment have helped to stabilise consumer confidence, according to a Gallup/BSL regional consumer survey published yesterday. The nationwide survey suggested that consumer spending in the fourth quarter of last year was little changed from the third quarter. It was 1.5 per cent lower than in the last quarter of 1990. The improvement in consumer confidence has been most marked in East Anglia, the north-west of England and the south-west. The north, east Midlands and south-east, excluding London, showed improvements above the national average. The fear of unemployment, while slowly diminishing over the year, continued to restrain consumers across the country. Expectations on inflation and the cost of living improved significantly, however. For the first time since the middle of last year, households expected their financial situation to improve over the next 12 months. Only Greater London and Wales expected them to deteriorate. In Scotland consumer confidence improved over the year to reach the UK average by the end of last year. The north-south divide has narrowed in the recession as unemployment has grown more quickly in the south and house prices have fallen further, Cambridge Econometrics said yesterday. It said in a report on regional prospects that on measures such as income per head and unemployment, the south remained more prosperous. The report forecast virtually no growth for this year for Greater London - the region suffering worst in the recession. Scotland, which escaped the worst of the recession, was predicted to grow faster in the short term than any of the English regions and Wales. Gallup/BSL Regional Consumer Survey.

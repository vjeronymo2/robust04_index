			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Technology: Ten light bulbs for the price of one - Worth Watching The chandeliers at Chatsworth House and the light bulbs in the Goat Inn public house near Peterborough both exploit a British design for increasing the life of the ordinary light bulb. The Bulbsaver, developed by Microcel, of Peterborough, is a tiny device installed behind the wall switch. The chip-on-a-circuit reduces the electrical surge which occurs when the light is switched on and which weakens the filaments in the bulb. The designers say the life of bulbs should be increased 10 times. At Pounds 4 per unit the Bulbsaver will be most widely used where it is difficult to replace bulbs - in belisha beacons or railway signals - or where one switch controls a large number of bulbs.

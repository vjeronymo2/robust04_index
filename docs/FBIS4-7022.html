			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the  Central Committee of the Union of Agricultural Working People of  Korea in a statement today demanded the South Korean authorities  discard the wrong position of negating dialogue and pursuing war  and show a positive response to the North-proposed convocation  of a national conference, before it is too late.    The statement says:    The South Korean authorities block a wide-range dialogue  involving various strata of society. This shows they do not want  national reconciliation and unity, peace and reunification. It  reveals their sinister political intention to isolate and stifle  the Korean-style socialist system centred on the masses in  conspiracy with outside forces.    The South Korean authorities must act with discretion,  mindful that if they persistently refuse the proposed national  conference and take the line of confrontation and war, they will  face a grim judgement by the nation.    The Central Committee of the Union of Agricultural Working  People of Korea will continue to make all sincere efforts for  the convocation of the national conference and remain faithful  to its mission for the nation.</p>

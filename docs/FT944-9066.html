			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Demolition plan for Wembley English Heritage, the guardian of historic sites, yesterday gave tentative permission for the demolition of Wembley Stadium, a Grade II listed building, but found fault with plans to modernise it. It said: 'The international standing of Wembley demands a much more imaginative approach than shown in this scheme.' Wembley's distinctive twin towers and grand entrance block must be retained, it added. The application to renovate the London stadium came from the Genesis Corporation, which last month approached Wembley plc, the site's owner, with an investment offer which was rejected. Genesis then approached the London Borough of Brent, which consulted English Heritage about the redevelopment plans. Wembley plc, which has debts of Pounds 150m, yesterday 'noted with great interest' the decision of English Heritage. English Heritage is keen to see the stadium modernised. It said: 'The redevelopment would bring Wembley up to Olympic standard, with increased seating capacity and modern facilities. 'Whilst we therefore would not be minded to authorise the grant of listed building consent for the proposals as they stand, we hope that the applicants will reconsider their scheme in the light of our comments and put forward what might be considered a more radical scheme which we could unequivocally support.'</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1  Network in Hebrew at 1800 GMT on 28 December reports that  "Islamic Jihad activist Muhammad Abu-al-Rish today turned  himself in to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] in Khan Yunus.  The IDF later released him as a gesture to Fatah in view of the  fact that Muhammad's brother, who was a Fatah activist, was shot  dead last week. To date the IDF had only released Fatah members  who turned themselves in."    The report goes on to quote official IDF sources as saying  that "Muhammad Abu-al-Rish is a Fatah activist and not a member  of Islamic Jihad."    Army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David reports that "a  large rally was staged at noon today in Khan Yunus by Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] to celebrate the return of the  deportees from Lebanon to their homes in the Gaza Strip."</p>

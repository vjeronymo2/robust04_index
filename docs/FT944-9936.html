			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / A diplomatic incident over sunshine: Should you go to Peru or Bolivia to see the solar eclipse? Neither, says Peter Aspden Nations rejoice, nations mourn; and nations can also look very foolish indeed. Just look at some of the tiffs they get into. Until last week, the silliest diplomatic incident I had ever come across was the one which accompanied the England cricket team's 'bodyline' tour of Australia in 1932-3. For those unfamiliar with this seminal moment in both countries' sporting histories, it consisted of an upper-class Englishman telling a lower-class Englishman to hurl a projectile very fast at the heads of a number of Australians. The countries' dignitaries exchanged angry letters, questions were asked in the House, and the entire episode coincidentally said everything you needed to know about pre-war English attitudes to social mobility and colonialism. But last week, thrown away at the bottom of a story in The Times, came an infinitely (and I use the term deliberately) more absurd example of state squabbling. It concerned the sighting of a total solar eclipse in South America, the rarity of which understandably caused quite a commotion. Tourists arrived from all over the world for a view of this outstanding phenomenon; and what could be more wholesome than that? Well, here is that last paragraph in full: 'The event has caused a diplomatic rift between Bolivia and Peru, which accused each other of printing false astronomy charts and maps to attract more visitors to their observation points.' Yes, indeed; this was no mere solar eclipse, but a quintessential entrepreneurial opportunity to earn some hard cash for a couple of strapped economies. So while the Nobel Peace prize winner Rigoberta Menchu, a Guatemalan, was waxing spatial on the eclipse symbolising the sun and moon making love, and producing an offspring of love and peace, the boys in the back rooms were hatching a fiendish cartographic scam to improve the balance of payments. The idea that both the astronomer, that most millimetrically precise of scientists, and the innocent romantic, contemplating our ultimate insignificance for a moment or two, can thus be ambushed by political expedience is rich in cosmic irony. Do not ask for the moon, as Bette Davis so nearly said, when we have the technology to redraw the sky. But maybe the Bolivians and / or Peruvians (I am refusing to adjudicate on this one) have a point. The notion that anyone should spend time looking at the night sky for any reason other than whimsy is ludicrous. In South American mythology, what we call an eclipse is in fact a puma devouring the sun; to prevent the sun's death, the puma has to be frightened away by the screams of animals and children beaten with sticks. This strikes me as considerably more plausible than the latest findings by cosmologists and that tiresome Hubble space telescope, which conclude that the universe is only half as old as the stars it contains. The scientists poring over this remarkable result at least have the grace to confess that it is a logical impossibility, but I am sure that will not stop them devising another muddle-headed piece of nonsense about the beginning of the universe, as if anyone cares any more. These people make their reputations by blinding us with staggering facts and ridiculous figures, and hope, like the Inca kings, that we will be impressed by the glare. It is no accident that whenever they urge us to watch something worth watching, it has to be through a pinhole in a shoe box. Well it is time to whip off the sunglasses. I am branching out on my own. While doing some further reading on this subject, I have discovered that there is something called the Andromeda Nebula which is zipping towards our doomed planet at 300km a second. With the aid of Bolivian and Peruvian researchers, and last week's episode of Star Trek, I have calculated to the last decimal point that it will be arriving, sooner rather than later, in the vegetable patch of my back garden. You can all come and watch for a fee which must, of course, reflect realistically the costs of my research. And if you are in any mood to argue, I will set the puma on you, I promise.</p>

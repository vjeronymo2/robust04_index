			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARIAN PARLIAMENT ROOMS WILL BE RENTED OUT IN 'ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT'  </P> <P> The Hungarian Parliament has decided to rent out its rooms to help make ends  meet.  </P> <P> Administrators of the huge neo-Gothic building on the banks of the Danube River  will rent out rooms for receptions and other functions "in the country's new  entrepreneurial spirit," the state news agency MTI said.  </P> <P> A large, richly decorated hall below the building's central dome will cost  18,000 forints ($275) an hour, more than twice the average Hungarian's monthly  take-home pay.  </P> <P> Several state institutions have devised money-making schemes following budget  cuts prompted by austerity measures. Earlier this year, the Interior Ministry  said it had begun offering sniffer dogs and security guards for hire to help  pay for the police force.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by C. Ibishi: "A Nightmare Life From Tortures"] </F>   [Text] Anybody who sets off on the road to a village in  Shala wonders in terror how he will pass the police checkpoints  at Tunel i Pare and Stanterg. That is where the maltreatment  begins, concluding with savage tortures in the Serbian police  stations. Many buses are stopped at these sensitive points, and  their passengers checked. Cars are also inspected, and the most  eagerly expected are those with license plates from other towns.    All this is done on the pretext of searching for weapons and  to create tension. During these checks, according to the mood  of the police, travelers are beaten and then sent to the police  station, where the police continue their "urgent" mission with  beatings and manhandling of the harshest and most inhuman kind.  Teachers also pass these checkpoints, and are taken in for  questioning and asked where they are going and why.  <H5>  Houses Raided, Men Tortured in Police Stations </H5>   Raids on houses in the Shala region have recently  intensified. Not a day has passed since the new year without a  house being searched, supposedly for weapons or young people who  have not been sent on military service. Heads of families are  beaten in front of members of their family, and grown-up sons  are tortured. The police go wild if they do not find weapons.  They are not content with rubber truncheons, fists, kicks, and  punches; there have been cases of men tied behind tractors and  beaten on the back with spades. In some cases, teeth and ribs  have been broken, and some people are still bedridden as a  result of injuries caused by the police. Such beatings have  occurred in Stanterg, Bare, Bajgore, Vidishiq, Rashan, Zabergje,  Magjere, and recently in Vllahi and other villages.    Many men have been issued with summons to appear at the  police station. Stanterg has for many months been a scene of  torture, where the inhabitants of Shala wait in line to be taken  in for questioning. If they do not hand in weapons, they are  beaten and tortured by policemen now notorious for their  barbaric lack of restraint. If the police wear themselves out  beating Albanians, those waiting outside have to come back the  next day to be subjected to police tortures. It has been common  for dozens of village houses to be raided on the same day, with  dozens of men and boys being taken to police stations to be  beaten and tortured without scruple. The Serbian regime wants to  sow fear in this region so that the population will move, with  the younger generation setting off for the big wide world.  <H5>  Heads of Households Beaten and Manhandled </H5>   Police violence and torture take place not only in the  villages of Mitrovice, but in those of Leposaviq and Vushtrri  [Vucitrn]. The Albanians are mainly beaten over weapons. Old  men say that these tortures are worse than those of 1956,  because then only the heads of households were beaten, whereas  now any male the police come across may be beaten at home in the  presence of the rest of the family. Even women can be beaten,  as in cases in Bistrice, Stanterg, Sllatine near Vushtrri, etc.  This filthy campaign is being led by a certain Velovic, Kandic,  and one Vucina from Vushtrri, who at one time pretended to be  the Albanians' friends. Velovic has forgotten how he used to  talk 10 years ago in front of delegations that came to Trepca,  saying, "It is a pleasure to see Serbs, Albanians, Dalmatian  Croats, Montenegrins, Romany Gypsies, and Latins living together  at Tunel and Stanterg, helping each other....</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> JUST THE TOUGHEST;  </P> <P> IT TOOK A BROKEN ANKLE TO KEEP BRUIN GYMNAST SHAWN MCGINNIS OUT OF THE OLYMPICS  -- BY ONLY .05 OF A POINT  </P> <P> Shawn McGinnis may not be the best gymnast on the UCLA women's team, but she is  probably the toughest.  </P> <P> The best Bruin is probably senior Tanya Service, the Pacific 10 Conference  gymnast of the year in 1987 and 1989. And Service gets stiff competition from  junior Kim Hamilton, two-time defending NCAA floor exercise champion, and  junior Jill Andrews, last year's NCAA vault champion.  </P> <P> But this season McGinnis has been pushing her three teammates. After a UCLA  career that has been hampered by injuries, the 5-foot, 4-inch junior from  Anaheim Hills has surpassed personal records in five of UCLA's nine dual meets.  </P> <P> Last week Hamilton won the all-around competition and Service finished second  as UCLA won the team competition at the West Regionals at Cal State Fullerton  and earned the top seed at the NCAA championships. The nationals will be held  April 14-15 at the University of Georgia in Athens.  </P> <P> Oregon State's Joy Selig finished third among individuals at Fullerton, but  close behind her in fourth place was McGinnis, who could be the mainstay of  next year's team for Coach Jerry Tomlinson.  </P> <P> She could be, that is, if her daring does not lead to more injuries.  </P> <P> "Break a leg" may be words of encouragement for actors, but that should never  even be whispered around a gymnast, especially McGinnis.  </P> <P> McGinnis would have liked to score a few points for the U.S. national team in  last year's Olympics. But in trials a couple of years ago she missed making the  team by finishing five-hundredths of a point (0.05) in her score behind the  last gymnast to earn a spot.  </P> <P> She might have made the team if she hadn't been trying out on a broken ankle.  </P> <P> "I didn't know it was broken," she said. "I thought it was just sprained and  sore. But even though it was swollen, I did not want to give it up."  </P> <P> She was injured, she said, during a meet just before the national trials. On  her first tumbling pass in floor exercise, "I landed really bad."  </P> <P> There have been other unhappy landings for McGinnis.  </P> <P> In 1986 she tore ligaments in a knee, again while tumbling in floor exercise.  She had surgery to repair the injury and as a UCLA freshman in 1987 didn't see  much action.  </P> <P> Before her sophomore season, she came down with a kidney ailment that kept her  out of action until mid-season. "It was a congenital problem," she said. "A  kidney wasn't functioning and it almost burst."  </P> <P> By mid-season of last year, however, she had recovered and came back to finish  as one of UCLA's better all-around gymnasts. She also placed third on the bars  at last year's Pac-10 championships and was named all-conference.  </P> <P> Her strong performances this season might have been stronger were it not for  painful shinsplints.  </P> <P> She thought at first that the inflammations in her lower legs, brought on by  the constant pounding from landings, might have been stress fractures. But she  had a few weeks to recover after UCLA won its third consecutive Pac-10  championship on March 4.  </P> <P> Last season Service dislocated an elbow in the West Regionals and could not  compete in the NCAA meet. Senior Gigi Zosa missed all of last year after knee  surgery, and she is competing on a limited basis this year with a fractured  wrist.  </P> <P> The UCLA gymnastics press guide is a litany of painful injuries: a ruptured  Achilles' tendon here, chronic elbow pain there, ankle and wrist ailments  everywhere. All gymnasts are familiar with pain.  </P> <P> But trying out for the U.S. team with a broken ankle, even if it was heavily  taped? C'mon, McGinnis.  </P> <P> Coach Tomlinson said that he could not personally testify about the broken  ankle, but he added, "I wouldn't doubt that at all."  </P> <P> McGinnis, he said, turned out for this season's first practice with no doubt  that she would have a good year.  </P> <P> "This is probably the strongest year of her life," he said. "She came (to UCLA)  "a very talented gymnast and was extremely strong all the time in practice.  </P> <P> "She just really hadn't mastered the art of competing as well as she works out,  which is common. And then she's had injuries almost every year of her career  which have kept her from doing everything she wanted to do.  </P> <P> "But Shawn McGinnis walked into the gym last September a different Shawn. You  could see it in her and feel it from her. She had an extremely confident and  aggressive attitude.  </P> <P> "You could tell she had made a change over the summer. She had set goals and  made a commitment that nothing was going to stand in her way."  </P> <P> Not a painful kidney ailment, not torn knee ligaments, not shinsplints, not  even a broken ankle could have stayed her from her determined rounds with the  UCLA team this year.  </P> <P> Tomlinson said McGinnis was the first woman gymnast with the courage to do a  trick in floor exercise called a full twisting doubleback. The stunt is two  backward somersaults with a full twist on the first somersault.  </P> <P> He said she has performed the twisting doubleback -- and done well -- five  times in meets and that he thinks only one other college woman gymnast has  tried the trick in a meet. His best gymnast, Service, has done it in practice,  he added.  </P> <P> McGinnis thinks her main asset as a gymnast is strength. "I've always been  big-boned and strong, and that has always benefited me because strength is  needed in gymnastics."  </P> <P> And anyone who doubts that she was once strong enough to do tumbling,  somersaults and jarring landings on a busted ankle had better be prepared to  take more than a little guff from McGinnis. She is of Irish descent, you know.  </P> <P> Still, didn't she ever consider quitting gymnastics after the sport had done  such a good job of roughing her up? She replied with an emphatic no.  </P> <P> "I didn't want to give it up; I wanted to do it partly for the college and  partly for me. I like it, or else I wouldn't still be doing it.  </P> <P> "I like the sport, and I guess the injuries made me want to do better," she  said, adding that when she returned from an injury she always worked harder.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Jia Quanxin (6328 0356 2946): "China's Customs </F> To Adopt Five Reform Measures"]    [Text] Beijing, 30 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Qian  Guanlin, director of China's General Administration of Customs,  said today that the reform and development of China's customs  must keep pace with economic restructuring as a whole, that  customs systems must conform with internationally practiced  regulations as soon as possible, and that as reform -- which is  oriented to a market economic structure -- is proceeding  multilaterally under the new situation, China's customs will  adopt five reforms:    -- Reform the supervisory and management pattern and put the  customs checking system into practice in an all-round way. This  will change the traditional pattern whereby the customs  over-concentrate manpower, material resources, and supervisory  means in ports that are crowded and so have little time for  inspection; establish the customs supervision of imports and  exports on the basis of enterprise management and accounts  checking; expand the time and space for supervision and  management so as to speed up passage through customs and make  supervision more scientific and effective, which suits an  increased degree of openness to the outside world and the  development of an open economy.    -- Deepen reform for passage through customs and establish a  new order for passage through customs. This will, first, reform  the customs declaration structure and foster a service market  for customs declaration. Second, it will study and gradually  establish a categorized management system for the passage  through customs of the consignor and consignee or its agent of  import and export goods, and will study and formulate  categorized management standards -- based on risk analyses --  for passage through customs.    -- Reform the bonded system and promote the development of  an  open economy. As a nationwide unified and open large market  gradually is being formed, the customs bonded system will become  an important means whereby the customs supports the development  of an open economy and promotes the mutual supplementation of  the international and home markets and the two types of  resources. Therefore, it is necessary to reform and improve the  bonded management method and increase the legal responsibility  of bonded managers and come closer to international standards.    -- Establish and perfect a customs inspection and estimation  system, and improve professional expertise in the collection and  management of customs and excise. It is necessary to reform the  procedures and methods for goods inspection, price estimation,  goods categorization, and tax calculation and collection;  establish a keen and accurate price information system; increase  the number of laboratories and establish their legal status;  train a vast number of high-caliber and high-level experts on  customs inspection and estimation.    -- Accelerate the integration of customs with science and  technology. This year, the customs should use the opportunity  afforded by the linking of the computer networks of customhouses  all over the country to consolidate, improve, accelerate,  promote, and apply the automatic customs declaration system;  step up the establishment of comprehensive data banks for  customs operations management and a variety of special data  banks; and link the computer networks of relevant departments  such as banks, foreign enterprises, and taxation departments.</p>

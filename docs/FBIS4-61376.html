			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("Lragir" daily), 04/29/94 -- Presidential  spokesman Levon Zurabyan held a briefing and particularly  touched the answer of the RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh]  authorities on the Azeri cease fire proposal.    The message by the RMK authorities confirmed a cease fire  agreement, starting 0:01am on April 29, on conditions stipulated  by the Moscow agreement of February 18.    Mr. Zurabyan noted that the Azeri proposal was for a short  term (10 days) cease fire, which would be used to "take a  breath" in order to restart the military operations with new  force. At the same time, the Azeri side takes no obligations by  this cease fire, which is naturally not acceptable for  Mountainous Karabakh.    It was stressed that Mountainous Karabakh will establish a  cease fire only in case, all topics of the above mentioned  agreement are met.    "Armenia completely agrees with the position of Mountainous  Karabakh", Zurabyan said.</p>

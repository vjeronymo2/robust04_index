			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / BP sheds 330 jobs in Scotland BRITISH Petroleum is to shed 330 jobs in its chemicals operation at Grangemouth, on the Firth of Forth in Scotland. The losses are the result of a company-wide review of operations. The company said reorganisation and revised work practices at Grangemouth were essential if the plant was to remain competitive. About 225 of the redundancies are among BP staff, the rest among contract and agency staff. They will be phased over 18 months, and the company said it hoped most could be achieved voluntarily. Grangemouth's oil and chemicals complex employs 2,050 people at present. The cost-cutting programme has already brought redundancies at two of the company's four other UK sites. Four hundred job losses were announced at the company's plant in Hull, Humberside, and 120 at Baglan Bay in south Wales. The BP group last week announced an 80 per cent decline in first-quarter profit, which was insufficient to cover its dividend payment. The chemicals division, suffering in the recession, lost Pounds 25m, compared with a Pounds 54m profit in the same period last year. Three hundred jobs will be lost following a decision by Asda, the supermarket group, to close 17 stores belonging to its Allied Maples carpet and furniture subsidiary. The closures follow a strategic review of the business. Allied Maples blamed the recession for difficult trading conditions.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRISON INMATE LABOR INITIATIVE  </P> <P> If Proposition 139, the Prison Inmate Labor Initiative, is approved by the  voters, the results will not be as good as the proponents hope or as bad as the  opponents fear. We likely would see mixed results on a modest scale that do not  threaten free labor.  </P> <P> Many prisoners have psychological problems and poor social skills and work  habits. They pose no serious threat to the AFL-CIO or to Japan Inc.  </P> <P> The prison system as an expensive failure. The prison population has swelled to  95,000, costing us several billions each year in lost productivity as well as  interest on a batch of long-term jail and prison construction bonds that we are  expected to approve at almost every election.  </P> <P> We should encourage the better prisoners to improve self-esteem with jobs to  earn wages, most of which would go for family support, taxes, room and board,  victims' restitution and a small bank account for the prisoner to have when  leaving the prison.  </P> <P> Our prisons are increasingly expensive failures. We need to try a new approach.  Inadequate as it may appear, let's approve Proposition 139 as a step in the  direction of making our prisons into factories behind walls.  </P> <P> GARY COLBOTH  </P> <P> Professor of Public Administration  </P> <P> Cal State Dominguez Hills  </P></p>

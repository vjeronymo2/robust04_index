			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Recall attempt -- A story in the Aug. 2 edition of The Times incorrectly stated  that organizers of a recall attempt against two trustees in the Inglewood  Unified School District had withdrawn their effort. The story should have said  that the organizers of the recall did not submit the required signatures to the  county registrar-recorder's office by the July 17 deadline.  </P></p>

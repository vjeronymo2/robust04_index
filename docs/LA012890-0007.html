			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES  </P> <P> Is General Motors chairman Roger Smith also image conscious?  </P> <P> Several sources in town tell us that calls have recently been placed by a GM  rep to find a PR firm willing to consider a campaign to offset the unflattering  image of Smith and GM in the Warner Bros. documentary "Roger &amp; Me."  </P> <P> Film maker Michael Moore, who made the movie about the impact of GM's plant  closings on Flint, Mich., has also alleged that GM is in search of a Hollywood  publicist.  </P> <P> But when we called GM, they denied it, insisting, "No such queries have been  made." Added Bill Ott, director of media relations for GM, Los Angeles: "GM is  not going to do anything that in any way promotes that guy's movie, for  heaven's sake."  </P> <P> "Roger &amp; Me," which has already grossed more than $2.2 million, will expand  from 103 screens to 250 on Feb. 9. From Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

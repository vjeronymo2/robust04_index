			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND HIGHLIGHTS FOR L.A. INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> The American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival continues  at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas this weekend. Highlights from  today's and Sunday's program follow.  </P> <P> TODAY  </P> <P> 'Ginger Ale Afternoon'  </P> <P> United States, 1988, 94 minutes  </P> <P> 4:30 p.m.  </P> <P>  Sassy and sensual, this adaptation of Gina Wendkos' play about a California  trailer court couple -- a very pregnant wife, an unemployed philandering  husband -- becomes a deeply touching affair. It's partly because of Dana  Anderson as the nagging, loving wife and John M. Jackson as the exasperated  husband, as well as bubble-gum-voiced Yeardly Smith as his baby-doll mistress.  The film's other pluses come from director Rafal Zielinski, cinematographer  Yuri Neyman ("Liquid Sky"), and the great blues score by Willie Dixon.  RECOMMENDED. SHEILA BENSON  </P></p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Iceland advances to Pounds 55.4m ICELAND FROZEN Foods, which plans finally to cast off its traditional freezer centre image by changing its name to Iceland Group, yesterday announced a 20 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 55.4m. The increase from Pounds 46.3m for the 53 weeks to January 2 was achieved on sales ahead 17 per cent to Pounds 1.04bn. The results were largely in line with forecasts made last month when the group announced a Pounds 27m placing to fund the development of 48 Iceland stores in Littlewoods, the private retailing chain. Mr Malcolm Walker, chairman, was ebullient when speaking of the group's achievements in the past year. 'It was an absolutely brilliant year,' he said. Growth was achieved by drawing in more customers, with the average number per week rising by 700,000 to 3m. Mr Walker said this level equalled the Christmas peak trading period of the previous year. However, the average spend per customer had remained steady at about Pounds 7 due to the increasing proportion of chilled and fresh foods being provided. Like-for-like food sales rose by 10 per cent in existing stores, while new space contributed 7 per cent of the increase. Iceland opened 45 new stores during the year, and planned a further 110 openings in 1993 - including the Littlewoods outlets. The expansion programme will create over 2,500 new jobs in 1993. The Littlewoods deal had accelerated Iceland's development as a mass market high street retailer of convenience food, Mr Walker said. No longer a frozen food centre as in the 1970s and 80s, the group would continue to evolve to meet market demand, he said. Frozen foods now accounted for some 56 per cent (60 per cent) of food sales. Chilled foods increased from 11 per cent to 13.5 per cent. A final dividend of 6.9p makes a 10p (8.5p) total. Earnings advanced by 19 per cent to 41.31p. A 2-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed. COMMENT There is no shame in being the poorer man's Marks and Spencer. Indeed, Malcolm Walker virtually crows about the potential of his market niche. He has increased his forecast of 1,000 stores in the UK to a bold 1,500 and has no fears of reaching saturation point while he remains in the packaged food market. The Littlewoods deal has added weight to his argument, although it is unlikely to have a full impact until 1994. There is big scope for improving the old Littlewoods food margins, while customer numbers in those outlets are far higher than in normal Iceland stores. Iceland's experiences there will be valuable as the group seeks to change its product mix in other stores. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of Pounds 68m this year, with a prospective p/e of 16 times. Marketability of the shares will improve following the planned scrip issue. Although there is good reason to stick with Iceland in the long-term, the high premium rating compared with others in the food retailing sector leaves little room for slippage.</p>

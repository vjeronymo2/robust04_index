			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, April 22--In a significant development,  the NHRC [National Human Rights Commission] has held the Border  Security Force [BSF] personnel responsible for firing live  ammunition at an unarmed crowd at Bijbehara in Kashmir on  October 22. The firing had killed 37 and injured 73.    In its report, the NHRC recommended immediate proceedings  for  the prosecution of the 14 "guilty" officials identified by the  Magisterial Inquiry.    The NHRC asked the Centre to undertake a thorough review of  the circumstances and conditions in which BSF units were  deployed to operate in situations involving solely civilian  populations.    Also, it sought payment of Rs 50,000 [rupees], as  compensation, to the next of kin of those killed; Rs 25,000 to  those injured by bullets and Rs 10,000 to those who sustained  other injuries.    The report was accepted by the Centre and an "action-taken  report" tabled simultaneously.    The commission's report said that the evidence collected in  the inquiry under the BSF Act, shows, prima facie,  that a sizeable group of local residents had gathered after  prayers at the Jama Masjid and had later moved to the national  highway. There they were accosted by a BSF unit.    "The evidence provided to the Staff Court of Inquiry by  those  in the procession," the report pointed out, "states that there  were no armed militants in the crowd, the members of which were  shouting political slogans and slogans against the siege of the  Hazratbal shrine by the Defence forces."    The NHRC report added that with the exception of one  witness--from the six whose evidence was recorded--none of the  others referred to any altercations between the people in the  crowd and the BSF personnel. In fact, the witnesses stated that  the people in the crowd were unarmed and that the firing by the  BSF on the crowd was "without warning."    The NHRC noted that although the situation in the Valley  called for firm measures, the firing of live ammunition into a  crowd of unarmed civilians could not be condoned.    The commission told the Centre to keep it informed of the  action--taken on its recommendations--and also of any measures  being contemplated against those identified in the Magisterial  Inquiry and Staff Court of Inquiry.    The Ministry of Home Affairs, which released the  "action-taken" report, stated that Record of Evidence  proceedings had already been initiated against 14 BSF personnel.    It said that the BSF authorities had been instructed to  complete the proceedings expeditiously. Investigations into a  case, registered in the local police station, had reportedly  been completed and steps had been initiated to file a  chargesheet against the indicted personnel.    The Ministry claimed that the following steps had been  undertaken by the BSF to ensure proper safety of civilians:     -  The training syllabus emphasized respect for human rights  and ways to deal with the public, particularly with the elderly,  women and children.    -  Wherever searches were conducted, the  services of the Magistrate, Civil Police and women police were  requisitioned.</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JUDGE BACKS CASE AGAINST DREXEL  </P> <P> The government is free to seek the indictment of Drexel Burnham Lambert for  racketeering and securities fraud because the firm has failed to reach a  required settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a federal  prosecutor said today.  </P> <P> Drexel agreed in December to plead guilty to six felonies and pay $650 million  to avoid an indictment under the racketeering statute. Such an indictment,  which would have to be made by a grand jury, would have dire consequences for  Drexel because it would allow the government to seize assets even before a  trial begins.  </P> <P> The agreement with the U.S. attorney's office cannot become final unless Drexel  reaches a settlement with the SEC in a separate civil case brought against the  investment banker. Talks on settling these charges have been going on for  months without success.  </P></p>

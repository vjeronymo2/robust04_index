			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Sport: Manifesto for a sporting right-hander - Cricket John Major's lament that 'summers will never be the same', after the death late last November of cricket's great commentator, Brian Johnston, has quickly passed into popular sporting language. A book about Johnston has been produced, with that title and last weekend, BBC television broadcast a programme in tribute to Johnston, with that name. One of the programme's speakers was Major and it was striking how much better he is at talking about cricket than talking about politics. But why separate the two? There is a hit-and-miss tradition in England of using cricket as an aid to public affairs and preaching. The prime minister knew enough of it to present President Bush with a cricket bat on an official visit to the US, admiring as he did so America's victory over England in the only cricket match the two countries have played, in the 1850s. Missionary diplomacy at its best, with England humble throughout. As far as I know, history does not record the president's reaction to the bat. Given the prime minister's love of cricket, perhaps history would have a happier future to record for him if he would let his favourite game decorate his political life once in a while, perhaps as an agent of eloquence. It does not seem possible, alas, to keep politics out of cricket. The d'Oliveira affair is one among many examples of that. But might not cricket be allowed to cheer up politics a bit? Every time English politics goes into a grim patch, I remember C Northcote Parkinson's comment in his famous 'Law of Delay' on cricket as a model for democracy. I can see that it might have less appeal for a government in power. 'Most would agree that Parliament must continue to exist. While it does so, the two parties must play a game modelled, apparently, on that of cricket: a game in which no innings can be prolonged for ever.' Some politicians have a good go at it, though. Stanley Baldwin, renowned for his 'safety first' politics, sometimes used clever tactics in playing safe. He was fond of cricket and when A P F Chapman led England to victory over Australia in the winter of 1928/29, Baldwin sent him a telegram designed to keep both countries in good humour. Chapman kept it all his life. 'Hearty congratulations on victory after a most gallant fight of which both sides may feel proud.' A good bit of medium pace politeness on a sensitive Commonwealth wicket. By the time that was sent, no one publicly attributed to cricket the grandiose serenity attributed to it a generation earlier. Bishop Welldon, for instance, once Bishop of Calcutta, was a man devoted to travel who had accompanied the 1903/04 English Test team to Australia, on the Orontes. When he returned, he wrote a 'breezy and genial introduction' to P Warner's book How We Recovered The Ashes, and used it to sing the praises of international cricket matches. 'They tend as well to excite and promote a kindly feeling between the nations that take part in them. They have brought Englishmen to Australia and Australians to England. They associated them as members of the same great national family.' Inspiring himself as he wrote, the bishop ended up declaring that the reason Australia and New Zealand had supported the mother country in her recent war with South Africa was 'the fostering of mutual respect through international athletic competitions at home and in the colonies.' Bishop Welldon was one of a number of sporting idealists who saw cricket as a tool of imperial peace-making in the early years of the century. The 1932/33 Bodyline tour had an opposite effect, with diplomatic relations between England and Australia in danger of being severed and Downing Street calling special meetings to try and cope with the furore arising from Douglas Jardine's 'leg theory' bowling tactics in Australia. Jardine remained silent until the weight of pressure and the outspoken reporting of the tour prompted him to speak, back in England in February 1933, praising his men and quoting Kipling. His men stood by him. Bodyline was a cricket issue which only attracted pronouncements by public figures attempting to keep the peace. It was the sort of cricket issue that the government was glad to leave behind, although England had won the series. Not long ago the Pakistani government and, to a lesser extent, the English government were faced with a cricketer who mixed cricket and politics in a way few have done. His country's government denounced him in high style and his country's cricketers were glad that when events reached a peak, he was past his best with the bat and they had no reason to speak. Aftab Gul was a student leader in the frenzied years of the late 1960s. He played cricket for Lahore University, where he was a law student. When England toured Pakistan in 1968/69, Aftab was selected for the Lahore Test because, it was said, students threatened to disrupt the match unless he played. His scores of 12 and 29 did not do much to glorify the cause of student reform, there were some 'minor riots and skirmishes' and the Tour was a troubled one. Aftab was a talented, but erratic, opener and in three years played in six Tests. His politics led him to a spell abroad and when Pakistan's government claimed to have found ground-to-air missiles in his garage, it refused to re-admit him. He applied for political asylum in Britain. It was not granted and, quite rightly, cricket was not mentioned as his government vehemently deplored his politics. Clearly the tone to adopt when bringing cricket into politics is a peaceful one. Public speaking with little touches of cricket is a rare and neglected art, to be carefully used. I think Bishop Welldon tended to excess. But then Archbishop Temple tended to the philistine with his sole remark about cricket: 'I have always looked on cricket as organised loafing.' It is probably time for a senior politician, rather than a churchman, to take his chance and talk cricket. As Johnston used to say, with a twinkle in his eye, to anyone who was nervous, 'Go on. It's always worth a go. You never know what might happen.'</p>

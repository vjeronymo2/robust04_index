			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (10): Group B - Cameroon Everyone remembers the Indomitable Lions in 1990. Cameroon have trodden a rocky road since then, and on paper they are not the force they were four years ago. But nobody will underestimate again their capacity to do damage when everything is at stake. Cameroon scraped through to the finals, and then looked distinctly lacklustre under their new coach, Frenchman Henri Michel. Political wrangling between sports minister Bernard Massoua II and President Biya's entourage paralysed the national football federation, which at one stage had two rival chairmen - each with his own ideas. - By May plans to field an almost entirely new squad gave way to a strategy built around veterans of 1990 - including the 42-year-old Roger Milla. The 1994 squad have been playing together for nearly two decades. Captain Stephen Tataw leads a defence that would put fear into the strongest attack. In front, Fran - ois Omam Biyik scored the Lions' opening goal against Argentina four years ago, and is relatively unknown only because he has lived so long under Milla's shadow. These old Lions could pull one more surprise before retiring for the last time to their dens.</p>

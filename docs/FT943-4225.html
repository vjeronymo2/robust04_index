			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Nine Network reports earnings ahead 25% Nine Network, the operator of Australia's largest commercial TV network and 44.5 per cent-owned by Mr Kerry Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings, has reported a 25.5 per cent increase in profits after tax and abnormal items to ADollars 88.3m (USDollars 64.9m) for the year to end-June, writes Nikki Tait. Revenues were up by 5.1 per cent, and operating profit before abnormal items and tax was 11.5 per cent higher at ADollars 136.1m. Nine said that its share of TV advertising revenue in the period amounted to 41.2 per cent, and that underlying costs - once allowance was made for the Winter Olympics - had been static. The company said that it expected pre-interest operating profits to increase by about 10 per cent in the current year. However, it warned that profits after interest and tax would probably not show any growth because of higher interest costs incurred to fund increased investments outside its main TV business. Nine holds much of the Packer stake in John Fairfax, the newspaper publisher; 18.08 per cent of Village Roadshow; and a 29.5 per cent interest in New Regency, the US film production company.</p>

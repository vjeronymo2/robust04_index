			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STALEMATE IN THE SCHOOLS  </P> <P> We should be clear on one point before getting into a discussion of  negotiations involving the teachers' union: Teachers are entitled to more  money. They perform a vital mission for society at wages that simply do not  reflect the value of their time, energy and intellect. The Los Angeles Unified  School District offers to pay them 8% more this year and a total of 20% more  over the next three years -- generous by any standard except perhaps as a  measure of a teacher's ultimate worth. Yet no agreement on a new contract is in  sight. The reasons are diverse and complex.  </P> <P> Under the school district's offer, beginning teachers, who now earn $23,440 a  year, would see their pay go to $25,316 now, $26,326 next year and $28,427 the  following year. The school administration points out that these salaries would  make Los Angeles teachers among the best paid not only in this area but also  among large districts in the state and in the nation. The United Teachers of  Los Angeles union wants beginning teachers to receive an 11% raise now, taking  them to $26,000 immediately, and adding 10% more next year.  </P> <P> The union says that the school district is inflating the cost of its contract  offer. The school district says that it will have to cut $100 million from  existing programs and services if its latest offer is accepted. It may take an  independent fact-finder to get to the bottom of that. The district has  identified as areas for possible cuts items ranging from junior-high humanities  programs to the cars that the district supplies for top staff and board  members. It would be an important symbolic gesture if the district switched to  paying mileage and had its officials use their own cars as teachers must do,  but it would not go far in paying the bills.  </P> <P> Negotiations have produced some progress.The school district is offering a  larger increase than its original proposal of 5.6% in the first year; the union  has come down from its opening request of 12% the first year, and is now  talking about a two-year contract instead of a one-year pact. The union does  not want to lock teachers into lower salaries for longer than that because the  state's financial condition may change and allow larger raises. The district's  request for a three-year contract would mean that schools could avoid for a  while longer upheavals like the one that they now are going through, and that  makes sense. It shouldbe easy to write a triggering mechanism into the contract  so that the agreement could be reopened if state revenues were to go up sharply  or the Gann limits on spending were changed.  </P> <P> School Supt. Leonard Britton says that he will withhold paychecks from teachers  who do notturn in student grades to the district by Friday. The union is going  to court to try to stop him. This clearly isn't the main issue in the dispute,  although it has gotten everyone's attention. It may well reflect teacher  frustration at not being paid for performing duties that go beyond basic  teaching, but neither side should have made it such a big issue.  </P> <P> The situation is aggravated by the fact that three school board seats will be  at stake in the city's April 11 election. While the current board will remain  in office until summer no matter who wins, the election could produce a board  more favorably inclined toward the union and toward more lucrative contracts in  the future.  </P> <P> Parents are starting to voice some anger over continuing disruptions of  schooling. Some of the hostility is directed at the school district for not  paying teachers more money; some is directed at teachers because of their  tactics. The schools need all the support from parents that they can get.  Nobody benefits from such anger, no matter what its target.  </P> <P> Many working parents will agree with the school district that a pay increase of  8% is generous. They will consider equally generous the district's offer to go  on paying all medical, dental and life-insurance benefits, regardless of  increases in the price of those benefits, although the teachers point out that  they won this full payment by the district in lieu of salary increases in the  past. A good number of people, then, want teachers to be paid more but think  that this offer sounds decent, given the circumstances. We agree.  </P> <P> The next negotiating session is set for today. If there is no progress, the  state mediator who is now guiding the process should call in that independent  fact-finder. That report should lay out for the public just what money is  available and what cuts can be made. This stalemate must end, and soon. Erosion  of support among parents and legislators in Sacramento who pay most of the  bills is one more problem that the public schools do not need.  </P></p>

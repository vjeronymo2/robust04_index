			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- Foreign public denounced  the suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents  in Japan (Chongnyon) by the Japanese reactionaries.    Japanese Dietmen on May 19 investigated the suppression of  Chongnyon by the Japanese police in Osaka.    They met with officials of Chongnyon and Japanese lawyers  and  acquainted themselves with the background and truth of the  police crackdown. They concluded that the wholesale police  search was motivated by a political intention to pry into the  inside of the Chongnyon organisation and incite anti-Chongnyon  sentiments.    They visited the Osaka prefectural police headquarters and  called the police chief to account for the suppression of  Chongnyon.    The Indian committee for supporting Korea's reunification,  the all India Indo-Korean Friendship Association, the Indian  Federation for World Cooperation and Cultural Relations, the  Friendship Association of India and the Indian Diplomatic Club  issued a joint statement May 14 denouncing the Japanese  reactionaries' anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign.    The statement denounced the Japanese authorities'  suppression  of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan as an intolerable challenge to  the DPRK and the Korean people and urged them to immediately  stop the unjustifiable and rude acts and apologize to the DPRK.</p>

Named Ballot Papers To Be Used To Vote on  Constitution"]    [Text] With a number of personnel matters smoothly  resolved, the next item on the agenda of the Belarusian Supreme  Soviet session was the long-awaited report by the prime minister  "On the Structure of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of  Belarus." Vyacheslav Kebich has been promising the  reorganization since last November. The parliament had tasked  the prime minister with presenting the reorganization plan by 15  December 1993. The prime minister's report, however, has been  postponed over and over again for various reasons. This time,  too, it was announced at the session that Kebich was sick. It  is evident to independent observers that Vyacheslav Kebich will  not make his report public until the situation in Moscow  regarding the unification of the monetary systems of Belarus and  Russia is clarified. The parliament, for its part, turned to  what may be the focal point of the current session -- the  adoption of the Republic of Belarus' new constitution.    Attempts to do so have been inconclusive at every succeeding  session for as long as 18 months. Now, Vasiliy Sholodonov,  chairman of the conciliatory commission tasked with drawing up a  draft constitution, proposed that the fundamental law be adopted  by voting with named ballot papers. The vote should be held for  three days to adopt the three main sections of the constitution:  on the Supreme Soviet, the president, and local authorities.    When Oleg Trusov, an opposition deputy, wondered if there  has  been a historical precedent of adopting a constitution in this  fashion, Sholodonov responded: "History is created by people,  and only then is it analyzed. If there has not been anything  like that in history, then there will be." Another opposition  parliamentarian, Vladimir Kakovko, retorted: "You have just  fashionably explained to us how we can go down in history, but  we may just enter the Guinness Book of World Records instead."    Be that as it may, the deputies approved the procedure for  voting with named ballot papers and appointed a commission to  count votes, which presented a ballot paper design. Upon  receiving a ballot paper, a deputy is obliged to sign his or her  name and subsequently confirm his vote by affixing his or her  signature. According to the vote-counting commission chairman,  the ballot papers offer splendid protection from forgery. Under  this system, not only will the 250-270 parliamentarians present  take part in this session, but also the deputies who are  currently absent for valid or not very valid reasons (the  Belarusian parliament comprises a total of 346 deputies). By  introducing named ballot papers the parliamentary majority  expects to win the requisite number of votes -- 231 -- to pass  the section on the president first. Meanwhile, a draft Supreme  Soviet decree on calling parliamentary elections on 20 November  1994 has already been handed to the deputies. Thus, the "party  of power" has embarked on the practical implementation of its  strategic plan to adopt the constitution, to elect the  president, and only then to hold elections for the Supreme  Soviet.</p>

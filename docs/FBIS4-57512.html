			<p>BFN     [Text] Asuncion ROMPRES 18/5/1994 -- Paraguay's capital  Asuncion is the last stage of the South-American journey of  Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and his delegation, a  stage that started on 18 May afternoon. The Romanian premier  was welcomed at the airport by President Juan Carlos Wasmosy.  The visit started with an interview between the Romanian  premier and the Paraguayan president. Virtually, there is no  tradition of Romanian-Paraguayan relations. Diplomatic  relations were established only in 1992. The Romanian party  considers that actions should be started soon, to secure a  development of these relations. Priorities are the realization  of adequate diplomatic representation in the two capitals, the  conclusion of the first inter-government agreements, the  development of trade.    The Paraguayan party has already shown interest in the  domain  of economic cooperation, in the building of a Romanian car  assembly line, the building of cotton spinning mills, of  electricity transport lines, oil and mining units. Trade and  economic cooperation agreements and an agreement on mutual  promotion and protection of investments are expected to be  signed during Premier Vacaroiu's visit.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> NO. 1 DRAFT PICK CLEVELAND GARY SIGNS BASEBALL CONTRACT  </P> <P> Ram rookie holdout Cleveland Gary signed a contract to play with the Miami  Miracle of the Class A Florida State League in 1990, the baseball team  announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> Gary, a first-round draft choice of the Rams, is a former University of Miami  fullback who led the team in rushing and receiving last season.  </P> <P> Gary played baseball briefly for the Hurricanes last season. He had two hits  and two strikeouts in seven at-bats, and no fielding chances. He is a third  baseman.  </P> <P> He tried to negotiate earlier with the Atlanta Braves, but that deal fell  through.  </P> <P> "We feel Cleveland has both the physical ability and mental approach to make a  good professional baseball player," Miracle owner Stuart Revo said.  </P> <P> The Miracle is an independent minor league team.  </P> <P> "I hope he can hit the curveball," Ram Coach John Robinson said. "That's all  I've got to say."  </P> <P> Said Willie Gary, Cleveland Gary's agent: "It's not a deal that's going to  prohibit him from signing with the Rams. Obviously, football has priority."  </P> <P> Willie Gary insisted this is not a negotiating ploy.  </P> <P> "It's no leverage situation," he said. "We're still saying that he's ready to  go to L.A. and play football."  </P> <P> Free-agent offensive lineman Mark Schmidt left the Rams' training camp at Cal  State Fullerton with a concussion Wednesday.  </P> <P> Schmidt was taken to Anaheim Memorial Hospital for observation and is scheduled  to be released today.  </P></p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Labour threat on Sunday trading THE LABOUR party has threatened to oppose any proposals the government makes for the reform of Sunday trading laws in England and Wales if the wages councils are abolished. The government is expected to make a statement on Sunday trading soon, and will need the support of Labour MPs to ensure that any reform passes through the Commons. Many Conservative MPs oppose the extension of Sunday trading. The Employment Department has said that it sees 'no permanent place' for wages councils, which set minimum rates for about 10 per cent of the working population. There has been speculation that Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, will include their abolition in the Employment Bill, likely to be published tomorrow. The link between Labour's support for reform and wages councils emerged during a meeting between Ms Joan Ruddock, Labour's voice on Sunday trading, and Mr Peter Lloyd, a junior Home Office minister. Ms Ruddock said the abolition of wages councils would undermine legal guarantees of protection for retail workers.</p>

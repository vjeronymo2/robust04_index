			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: National Power advances 18% NATIONAL POWER, the electricity generator, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up 18 per cent to Pounds 514m for the year to March 31 1992, the first full year since it was privatised. Earnings per share increased by 22 per cent to 28.63p (23.54p), and the dividend goes up 10 per cent to 9.1p. Mr John Baker, chief executive, said the results showed the company, was competing successfully in the new privatised electricity market. 'Profits are beginning to reflect the major restructuring we are undergoing,' he said. The company's performance was achieved against the background of a 0.2 per cent growth in the electricity market. Its unit sales fell by 3.9 per cent, and it lost market share to rival generator, Nuclear Electric. A sharp rise in electricity prices accounted for a 7.4 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 4.7bn. Prices in the pool or wholesale market rose by nearly 25 per cent, while income from direct sales to customers rose by 30 per cent. Although costs rose by just over 5 per cent overall, fuel costs fell as the company used up old cheaply-priced coal stocks. It also saved about Pounds 150m after shedding 21 per cent of its workforce, or 3,000 jobs, as part of a programme announced after privatisation. These manpower savings boosted productivity by 13 per cent. Improved turnover and cost savings together gave a 23 per cent increase in operating profits. Good cash flow financed nearly Pounds 500m of capital expenditure, 22 per cent more than in the previous year. This was mainly spent on reducing emissions, and building new gas stations. Borrowings at the year end fell by 5 per cent, although the average for the year was higher, giving an interest charge of Pounds 11m against net interest income of Pounds 7m the year before. The outlook for the coming year was still uncertain, National Power said, because it has not yet agreed a deal with British Coal, its main fuel supplier, or the regional companies, its main customers. The electricity market would improve only slightly, Mr Baker said. That meant National Power had to rely on cost-cutting and lower fuel prices to provide short-term growth. In the longer term, its strategy is to expand overseas, and Mr Baker said he hoped to invest Pounds 1bn in international generation ventures by the end of the decade. City analysts expect a pre-tax profit of between Pounds 550m and Pounds 590m next year, giving earnings of between 31.5p and 34.5p per share, and a dividend of 10p to 10.2p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Zheng Degang (6774 1795 0474) and </F> XINHUA reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511)]    [Text] Guangzhou, 10 Apr (XINHUA) -- Four enterprises in  Shenyang, Fujian, and Guangdong have been sternly punished by  the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC]  for engaging in illegal entrepot trade in textile products.    At the fourth national conference held today to crack down  on  illegal exports of textile products through transit trade, Zhou  Keren, director of the MOFTEC Control Department, announced the  circular on the decision to punish the four enterprises.    The circular said: In August 1993, the Shankou branch of the  Dongmao Industrial Company in Shenyang singed a contract with  the Zhuoxing Company in Hong Kong to export 6,200 dozen jeans  shorts and 1,980 dozen knitted women's pajamas to Singapore.  This batch of goods was processed and manufactured by the  Fulong Garment Plant in Guangdong's Zhongshan, the Xiangjing  Woolen Garment Plant in Shenyang, and the Warp Knitting Plant in  Yingkou City. The goods were labeled "made in Fiji." In  October and November last year, the goods were shipped in  batches to Singapore and then re-exported to the United States.  The goods were tracked down and seized by the U.S. Customs.  The MOFTEC has decided to confiscate the income of the Dongmao  Industrial Company derived from this business deal; to cancel  all its textile product export quotas as well as its right to  apply for a textile product export quota for 1994; and to order  Shenyang City's Commission of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation to suspend all business activities of the Shankou  branch of this company. The MOFTEC has suggested that the  competent department mete out administrative punishment to those  who are directly responsible for this matter.    In June 1993, the Guangyu Shareholding Xiamen Company in  Fujian signed a contract with Taiwan's Jianru [Chienju]  Enterprise Company, Limited to export 8,500 towel coverlets to  Taiwan. In accordance with the request of this Taiwan firm, the  Guangyu Shareholding Xiamen Company attached labeles saying  "made in Thailand," provided by the Taiwan firm, on the customs  declaration, invoice, and packing list. In July of the same  year Qingdao customs discovered the goods when the company  submitted its customs declaration. The MOFTEC has decided to  fine the company a sum of 20 percent of the value of the  contract, suspend its textile product export right for two  years, and correspondingly reduce Xiamen city's textile export  quota for 1995.    The two other companies receiving punishment are garment  plants in Guangdong Province's Shantou City. One is Shantou  city's Shifa Dress-Making Company, Limited. In the crevices of  the "washable" labels of 1,560 cotton shorts it manufactured for  export were stitched made in Hong Kong" labels. In September  1993, this batch of goods was discovered and seized by a product  inspection organ. The company had been punished. The other was  the Yongjia Garment Manufacturing Company, Limited in Shantou  city. All 4,080 pair of cotton shorts it processed and  manufactured for export were sewn with "made in Hong Kong"  labels covered by offset printing paper printed with the words  "made in China." In December 1993, this batch of goods was  seized by a goods inspection organ, and the company had been  punished.    The penalties meted out to these two enterprises by the  MOFTEC were: suspending the two companies' textile product  export rights for two years; correspondingly reducting  Guangdong's textile export quota for 1995; and suggesting that  the competent department mete out administrative punishment to  those directly responsible for the fraud.    The circular urged the relevant foreign trade and economic  cooperation commissions in the areas mentioned in the circular  to concentrate on checking the textile product and garment  processing enterprises in their respective areas to prevent  recurrences of similar incidents, and asked customs not to  handle export customs declarations for these few enterprises  whose textile product export rights have been temporarily  suspended.</p>

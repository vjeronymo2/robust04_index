			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis  said that there is a threat from Turkey and that the decision  for a unified defense area with Cyprus is a natural development  since Greece is a guarantor power on the island and is  responsible for its defense. Mr. Arsenis will arrive in Cyprus  on Wednesday [16 March] for talks with the Cyprus Government.  Our correspondent Andreas Stilianou has the following report:    [Begin recording] [Stilianou] In a statement to a current  affairs program on Athens ET-1 Television Network, Mr. Arsenis  pointed out that Greece's role as a guarantor power in Cyprus  gives it direct responsibility for the island's defense. Mr.  Arsenis reiterated that any intensification of the Turkish  threat in Cyprus would be a casus belli for Greece, and added:    [Arsenis] When you have two Hellenic countries--Greece and  Cyprus--which believe, and they are right, that there is a  common threat against them, Turkish expansionism, it follows  that these two countries should coordinate their national  defense plans. The unified defense area....[sentence unfinished  as received]    [Stilianou] Mr. Arsenis further noted that a unified defense  area means that Greece and Cyprus are discussing their defense  and coordinating their plans so that they can be more efficient.  Responding to a question, Mr. Arsenis said that he did not get  the impression that there were reservations about the joint  Greek-Cypriot decisions. He said: Many countries questioned  the move and it was necessary for us to clarify our goal. Mr.  Arsenis concluded:    [Arsenis] From the moment it becomes crystal clear that as  far as we are concerned the issue is coordination of defensive  plans to deter a common threat, then the matter has been  explained sufficiently.

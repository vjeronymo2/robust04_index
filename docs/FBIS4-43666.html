			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Nuclear Clean-Up May Cost 12 Billion </F> Pounds"]    [Text] The cost of cleaning up the legacy of Britain's  atomic research programme could be 12 billion pounds, four times  as much as was estimated four years ago. Tim Eggar, the energy  minister, published the revised costs in a parliamentary answer  yesterday, when most MPs had left for the weekend.    Detailed engineering studies suggested that nuclear  liabilities at UKAEA [UK Atomic Energy Authority], the former  atomic energy authority, amounted to 8 billion pounds, Mr Eggar  said. However, "the total cost could lie in the range 6 billion  pounds to 12 billion pounds."    The figures compare with decommissioning liabilities  estimated at 3 billion pounds to 4 billion pounds in 1990.    UKAEA has been divided in two, because ministers hope to  introduce legislation to pave the way for a sale of AEA  Technology, the engineering arm, in October. Decommissioning  liabilities will stay with the UKAEA government division and be  met by the taxpayer.    Derek Pooley, the division's chief executive, said the  unique  nature of each research reactor posed problems that were greater  than expected, and the rundown of the research programme  highlighted maintenance costs previously ignored.    UKAEA is responsible for decommissioning a host of  experimental facilities, including reactors at Dounreay,  Harwell, Windscale and Winfrith that have been used to produce  fuel for nuclear weapons or as prototypes for electricity  generation. Most of them were built between 30 and 50 years ago.    "These facilities were built with not nearly enough thought  about what you would do with them when you no longer need them,"  Mr Pooley said.</p>

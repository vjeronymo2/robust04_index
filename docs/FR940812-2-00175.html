			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Notice of Inquiry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to determine the copyright implications, if any, of the 1992 Cable Act's instruction to the FCC to update the major television market list, we published a NOI initiating this proceeding. 58 FR 34594 (June 28, 1993). We requested direct response to a series of questions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The section 111(f) definition of a ``local service area of a primary transmitter'' is ``the area in which such station is entitled to insist upon its signal being retransmitted by a cable system pursuant to the rules, regulations, and authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission in effect on April 15, 1976''_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the 1976 must-carry rules. Is the amendment to the &sect;76.51 major television market list required by the 1992 Cable Act an amendment of the 1976 rules, or is it a separate and independent action of Congress? If it is an independent act with no bearing on the 1976 rules, under what statutory justification should the Copyright Office follow the present and future changes to the &sect;76.51 list?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The FCC has stated its belief that ``Congress intended for our updated &sect;76.51 list to be applied to assess copyright liability.'' What evidence is there in the 1992 Cable Act to support this contention?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the Copyright Office accepts the redesignations of Ohio, Connecticut, and Georgia for copyright purposes, should the Office accept any future redesignations? Should such acceptance be as a matter of course, or should it be on a case-by-case basis?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) If the Commission at some future date reranks markets on the list, and/or adds or subtracts markets, should the Copyright Office recognize these changes as applicable to the cable compulsory license? If so, in the situation where a reranking results in a cable system reducing its number of permitted distant signals, should the cable system be allowed to continue to carry a former permitted distant signal on a grandfathered basis as a non-3.75% distant signal?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We received comments from the following parties: Federal Communications Commission (FCC); National Association of Broadcasters (NAB); Motion Picture Association of America, Inc. (MPAA); National Cable Television Association (NCTA); Association of Independent Television Station, Inc. (INTV); Commissioner of Baseball, National Basketball Association and National Hockey League (Professional Sports); Press Broadcasting, Company, Inc.; R&amp;R Media Corporation; United Video, Inc.; Force Amusement Enterprises, Inc.; Providence Journal Company and Multivision Cable TV Corporation; WLIG&hyph;TV, Inc.; TV 14, Inc.; and Cablevision Industries Corporation, Comcast Cable Communications, Inc., Cox Cable Communications, Jones Intercable, Inc. and Newhouse Broadcasting Corporation (Joint Cable Operators).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Summary of the Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comments reveal a general unanimity as to the effect of the 1992 Cable Act and the Commission's recent action regarding &sect;76.51; the parties generally agree Congress did intend to affect copyright through the 1992 Cable Act, and that the Copyright Office should observe the Ohio, Connecticut, and Georgia redesignations for cable compulsory license purposes. While there is a slight difference of opinion as to how the Office should treat future FCC redesignations, most parties stated that the issue of FCC rerankings of the top 100 television markets was not ripe for decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> a. Response to Question 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Question  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1 addresses an extremely important legal issue: whether the 1992 Cable Act's direction to the FCC to update &sect;76.51 constituted an amendment of the FCC must-carry rules which were in effect in 1976. The Copyright Code requires application only of the 1976 must-carry rules.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 17 U.S.C. 111(f) (definition of a ``local service area of a primary transmitter''). With the exception of the MPAA, all of the parties who addressed the issue agreed that the 1992 Cable Act's direction to the FCC to amend &sect;76.51 was not an amendment of the 1976 must-carry rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Professional Sports argues that amendment of &sect;76.51 by the FCC is not an amendment of the 1976 must-carry rules because &sect;76.51 was not part of the must-carry rules. Rather, the applicability of the 1976 must-carry rules was determined only by reference to the &sect;76.51 list. Sports, however, qualifies the separability of &sect;76.51 from the 1976 must-carry rules by noting that a fundamental change in &sect;76.51 could amount to a de facto amendment of the 1976 must-carry rules: [S]o long as the underlying structure of the [&sect;76.51] list remains unchanged, a case-by-case modification of individual components of the list is an external event_comparable to modification in the reach of a station's Grade B contour_which may affect a station's local service area under the 1976 must-carry rules, but which does not alter the underlying principles by which calculation of a station's local service area is made under those rules. *&blank;*&blank;* However, if at any time in the future the Commission reverses itself and chooses to redefine the underlying structure of the 76.51 list, such a change could_depending on the nature of the change_constitute an amendment of the 1976 must-carry rules requiring a different response from the Copyright Office. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Professional Sports, comments at 7&hyph;8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

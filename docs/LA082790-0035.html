			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> UNSER STRATEGY WORKS IN VICTORY AT DENVER  </P> <P> A full-course caution flag early in Sunday's Denver Grand Prix raised a  strategic dilemma for Al Unser Jr.: to pit or not to pit?  </P> <P> Unser stayed on the track, most of the other leaders pitted and Unser went on  to earn his third consecutive victory and solidify his hold on the CART-PPG  series point lead.  </P> <P> "At our team meeting (Sunday morning), we decided we'd get past lap 12 before  we'd come in," Unser said. "It (the caution flag) was too soon."  </P> <P> The yellow flag waved at the finish line on lap 10 after pole-starter Teo Fabi  crashed. Unser and teammate Bobby Rahal remained on the downtown street  circuit.  </P> <P> The rest of the race was pretty much a strategic duel between the two  teammates, with Unser winning the battle of late pit stops, as mechanical  problems dropped Rahal to third.  </P> <P> Unser ended up handling the 90-degree heat, the thin air of the mile-high city  and the demanding 1.9-mile, 16-turn downtown street circuit to beat Danny  Sullivan by 28 seconds.  </P> <P> But Rahal raced with Unser through most of the 80-lap, 152-mile race on the  much slower temporary circuit.  </P> <P> Unser, who earned his 14th career victory and fifth of the season, gave up the  lead to Rahal by making a final scheduled pit stop on lap 61.  </P> <P> He came back out of the pits trailing Rahal by 16.83 seconds and proceeded to  slice into that margin every lap, moving up right behind the nearly identical  Chevrolet-powered Lola of his Galles-Kraco before Rahal was forced to pit for  fuel on lap 73.  </P> <P> That pit stop was a slow one because Rahal's hydraulic jack and clutch both  failed.  </P> <P> Unser, who won $123,866, averaged 71.24 m.p.h. in the slowest race in CART  history.  </P> <P> Brazil's Ayrton Senna won the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps for the  third consecutive time, beating world champion Alain Prost of France and  extending his Formula One standings lead.  </P> <P> Senna, driving a McLaren-Honda, led all the way, driving cautiously over the 44  laps. He finished 3.550 seconds ahead of Prost's Ferrari.  </P> <P> Senna's teammate, Gerhard Berger of Austria, was third, 28.462 seconds back,  after a tough battle with Alessandro Nannini of Italy in a Benetton-Ford.  </P> <P> The victory increased Senna's point total to 63 in the world drivers'  standings. Prost is second with 50 and Berger third with 33.  </P> <P> Senna finished in one hour 26 minutes 31.997 seconds. He averaged 131.272  m.p.h.  </P> <P> Mark Rodrigues was the beneficiary of attrition, taking the Denver round of the  American Racing Series for his first ARS victory.  </P> <P> Rodrigues, from Van Nuys, took the lead five laps from the end of the 25-lap  event on the 1.9-mile, 16-turn downtown street circuit. He easily held off  Robbie Buhl, whose car was having an electrical problem, by 4.24 seconds.  </P> <P> Rodrigues earned $29,500 and averaged 61.050 m.p.h.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article including interview with Andras Toth, </F> spokesman of the Hungarian Socialist Party; place and date not  given: "They Are Counting on the Activists--MSZP Tickets of  Support"]    [Text] Not long ago the Hungarian Socialist Party  [MSZP] issued 25 million forints' worth of so-called tickets of  support, and it wants to use the sum that came in from this  source for its campaign goals. Who buys these tickets of  support? We asked spokesman Andras Toth.    [Toth] The idea comes from the British Labor Party, and  there  are decades of tradition behind it here. We "sell" these tickets  of support in our citizens' forums and in our local  organizations. So far, the typical supporter is a party member  or sympathizer with a small income, often a retired person, who  gives us one or two hundred forints. A few have given us 50,000  forints and their names will be made public, in keeping with the  party law, in our end-of-the-year accounting.    [MN] How large is the sum that has been received so far?    [Toth] About 1.2 million forints in Budapest. We think that  the MSZP will be able to collect a good part of 25 million  forints. The first nationwide reckoning is expected in March.  Incidentally, one-half of the received sum is earmarked for our  local organizations, and one-half for our central budget.    [MN] How much money are the socialists using for the  campaign? So far Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats] is the  only party that has announced that its national committee has  approved 18 million forints for the campaign.    [Toth] I cannot give an unequivocal answer to this, but this  much is certain, that we will not spend more than the above  amount either, and financial factors will not dominate our  campaign.    [MN] Do you mean that since it is well-organized, the party  will substitute the communal work of its activists for money?    [Toth] Yes, because after all the middle-class type of party  is, by virtue of the way it is structured, geared to elections,  while the social democratic, left-wing type of party, which the  MSZP is, functions continuously and so has at its disposal a  significant activist network. In the course of the campaign we  will emphasize low-level work, and it is certain that our  members and sympathizers will be happy to take our flyers to  people's houses so that we will not have to use the services of  the post office.    The socialists presented their education program in their  Thursday media club. [MSZP] vice president Gyorgy Janosi  stressed that it is one of the most important goals of the party  to modify, even if only in the long term, the inequality of  opportunity that is presently noticeable. To achieve this, it is  necessary to have a flexible, penetrable educational system as  well as autonomous schools. In its program the MSZP considers  the so-called sector-neutral education financing system to be  the good one, independently of who runs the school, since the  sum used for this purpose is a right of the student by virtue of  citizenship. The party considers it very important that the  state ensure teachers' wages from the central budget, without  burdening local governments.</p>

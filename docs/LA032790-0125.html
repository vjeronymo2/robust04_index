			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> HIRING HALL GETS OFF TO A SLOW START  </P> <P> Anselmo Hernandez won the lottery on Monday, but instead of a million dollars  he got a job.  </P> <P> Because he drew a low number, Hernandez, 33, was the first dayworker to be  hired through the city's new hiring hall. To the envy of others waiting for  jobs, he drove off in a white El Camino to help swimming pool contractor John  Kliese move dirt in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Kliese needs extra workers on an irregular basis, usually for only one or two  days a week. He used to drive slowly along Chapman Avenue where day laborers  have gathered for years on street corners. But then he read in a newspaper that  the city planned to open a hiring hall, and on Monday he showed up to hire some  help.  </P> <P> Hernandez was among an estimated 250 workers drawn to the hiring hall by  brochures that city employees distributed along Chapman Avenue in recent weeks.  And he was one of only six laborers hired: Only four contractors had come to  the hall by noon when it closed.  </P> <P> City officials say they will try to attract more employers by posting signs  along Chapman Avenue, advertising in newspapers and telephoning local  contractors to spread the word about the hall.  </P> <P> The hall, housed in a trailer on McPherson Avenue north of Chapman, was opened  after residents and merchants complained that the workers who congregated in  the area were lowering property values, discouraging business and causing  traffic jams as employers stopped to hire them.  </P> <P> For now, the city is giving dayworkers a chance to find and use the hall. But  in late April, police will begin enforcing a pair of day-laborer ordinances  passed last September that prohibit workers from soliciting jobs on city  streets. Violators could be fined up to $500 and sentenced to jail for up to  six months.  </P> <P> "I know this has got to be a step in the right direction," said Eric Bogart, a  sandwich shop owner on Chapman Avenue.  </P> <P> Outside the hiring hall on Monday, several workers said they came to the United  States in search of steady work and money.  </P> <P> "Everybody comes to work. When the people go back to Mexico, they tell them  there's a lot of work here," said Alfredo Jimenez, 19, who came here from  Veracruz last year. "The money over there is worthless and the money over here  is worth a lot."  </P> <P> Speaking through an interpreter, Jimenez said it takes him about 10 days of  work in Mexico to earn what he can earn in one day in the United States.  </P> <P> Pascual Alvarez said the $80 to $100 he averages for two days' work each week  is more than he made in a week as a full-time truck driver in Mexico City.  </P> <P> But some say that there is a price to working north of the border. Many miss  the families they left behind. Once they are here, laborers say, dreams of big  money remain elusive because work in Orange County is often hard to find. Some  go weeks without working. Others complain that they are not paid for their  work.  </P> <P> Many of the dayworkers interviewed Monday said they will try using the center  but are worried that immigration officials may show up.  </P> <P> Workers are required to fill out U.S Immigration and Naturalization Service  employment forms and provide officials at the hiring hall with some sort of  identification. But employers are responsible for verifying the workers' legal  status.  </P> <P> "We're not working with the INS," said Mayor Don Smith. "We want this to work."  </P> <P> The hiring hall is scheduled to operate from 6 a.m. to noon Monday through  Friday, and 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Saturdays. Employers can call ahead to line up  workers, requesting those with specialized skills, such as carpentry, plumbing  or silk-screening. SHANNON SANDS  </P></p>

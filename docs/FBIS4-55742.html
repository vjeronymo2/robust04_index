			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "lr": "Investment Funds Heard Out; Wage Growth </F> in Loss-Making Companies and Banks Will Be Limited to 15 Percent  This Year"]    [Excerpt] Bratislava--Following a six-month delay, wage  regulation will, after all, become the reality for the state and  semistate sector as of 1 July, in accordance with the  recommendation of the International Monetary Fund. This was  announced by Julius Brocka, minister of labor, social affairs,  and the family, in the course of yesterday's consultative  meeting of economic ministers.    The aim of wage regulation is not to freeze wages at their  current level. As Minister Brocka stressed, under the proposed  limit for wage growth [smerny rast], even companies that will be  subject to the decree will be able to retain the real value of  their employees' earnings. This means that, because an overall  17-percent growth of consumer prices is expected this year, even  in wage-regulated organizations wages will be permitted to rise  17 percent. Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova  specified, however, that the upper limit will be between 15 and  17 percent, so as to utilize the motivating nature of the  restriction for labor productivity improvements. In compliance  with the demands of social partners laid down in the General  Agreement, the government decree will not apply to organizations  that operate at a profit. Equally, it will have no impact on  already transformed entities--that is, entities in which the  stake of the state and of shareholders from coupon privatization  is lower than 50 percent as well as entities in which foreign  capital has an ownership stake in excess of 30 percent.    There is one exception, however. Even profitable  organizations in banking, the energy sector, and the water  economy will not be permitted to exceed the set limit for wage  growth because, as Julius Brocka said, the development of wages  in these branches has broken loose.

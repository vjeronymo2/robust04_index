			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- The government issued a  stern warning Monday against a move by locomotive engineers and  subway workers to stage a nationwide strike next Monday.    In a joint statement by the home, justice, labor and  transportation ministers, the government said any attempt to  stop the country's railways and subways "cannot be pardoned."    If Chonkihyop [The National Council of Locomotive  Engineers],  a private group of locomotive engineers having no collective  bargaining power, does not drop its strike plan, the government  will have no choice but to take strict legal action, the joint  statement warned.    The locomotive engineers' strike, if staged in spite of the  government's announcement over the weekend of a package of  measures to increase wages and improve working conditions for  railway workers, would be considered an anti-social act, it said.    The statement came in response to the move by Hyundai and  Daewoo workers and some "unregistered" labor unions, such as  Chonnodae (The National Council of Union Representatives) and  Chonnohyop (The National Council of Labor Unions) to strike in  sympathy with the strike by locomotive engineers and subway  workers.    In a related development, the Seoul subway workers union  said  Sunday it had dropped plans to launch a "work-to-rule struggle"  Monday in view of the resulting inconvenience for passengers.    But the union warned that if its demand for a 14.5-percent  wage rise was not accepted, it would go on strike starting at  4:00 a.m. next Monday as announced earlier.</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Hong Kong This week, the market will have to digest last Friday's interest rate rise, announced after the close of trading; and another batch of results look potentially disappointing, writes Louise Lucas in Hong Kong. While the immediate impact on stock prices may not be huge - the rate rise has been anticipated since the Fed move - there may be longer term implications for companies' borrowing costs. Results this week start with interims from Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong-listed arm of the Beijing foreign investment company, and are followed by property developers, including Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong on Thursday. Property watchers will also have an eye on Tuesday's land auction. Compiled by William Cochrane</p>

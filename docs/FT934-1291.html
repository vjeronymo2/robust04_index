			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: PEPs, private investors and a lack of concern Sir, Mr J D Wittle made a good point in his letter 'Crestfallen investors' (December 11) about the seeming lack of concern for the private investor in the drawing up of plans for the Crest share settlement system. I think there has been a similar lack of concern in the way that personal equity plans (PEPs) have been allowed to develop and I would like to feel that pressure will continue to be brought to bear on both matters. Surely the Treasury - and the Bank of England - should see that the respective systems take fully into account the needs of the private investor. In the case of Crest, it is essential that private investors should not be disadvantaged by a higher cost structure, but with both Crest and (self-select) PEPs it seems vital to me that the investors' names should be 'on the register' so that they receive balance sheets, proxy forms etc. The Bank of England Crest team is said to be wishing to improve what it call the 'visibility' of the relationship between companies and their shareholders when nominees are used - which I take to mean the same thing] My plea is, therefore, that pressure should be maintained on behalf of the private investor in relation to Crest and to PEPs. Certainly ProShare should be supporting the case and I feel that it would be a great help if you would continue to publicise the matter on behalf of your private investor readers.

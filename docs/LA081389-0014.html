			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTIQUES: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> NATIVE AMERICAN BEADWORK  </P> <P> FROM THE BEGINNING, long before the arrival of Europeans in the New World,  Native American tribes were producing magnificent beadwork. Tribal artisans  (mostly women) worked with shells, stones and porcupine quills. They used  almost any material that could be strung or attached to cloth or buckskin:  shells, seeds, berries, stone, bone, teeth, plant resins, glass, metal ivory,  ceramic and even dried otter's liver.  </P> <P> Plain or decorated, each bead was wound, woven, inlaid or stitched to a variety  of materials. Before 1850, beadwork generally consisted of large white, black  or blue "pony beads." Smaller glass beads, or "seed beads," were developed  after that date and led to further refinement of the craft. In general, the  best work was done between 1870 and 1890. Oddly enough, commercial glass beads  from Italy were introduced into the Southwest by the Spanish around the middle  of the 16th Century, and centuries later they were brought in from  Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> Sophisticated beadwork was consistently produced by the Indians of the Great  Plains (the Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho, among others) and the Great Lakes  areas. Beads were used by the Southwest Indians more sparingly, though often to  greater effect; thus an Apache blouse and skirt might have a single band of  blue and white beads outlining an ochre-colored cloth area.  </P> <P> Beadwork decorated a variety of objects: Arapaho moccasins; Sioux deerskin  dresses; Apache ceremonial costumes and headbands; Hopi kachina dolls; Crow  handbags for holding the mirror, hair-parting stick and face paints needed by a  young man for dances and other social occasions; Sioux embroidery vests;  Cheyenne boots with the "lazy stitch" to produce narrow lines; Comanche women's  boots with light-toned stitching; Cheyenne doctors' fans; Jicarilla Apache  shirts with beads in black and white; Ute bandoleers; Crow lance cases, and,  perhaps most glorious of all, Great Plains war bonnets and decorated cradle  boards from the Southwest.  </P> <P> Though beadwork is generally not expensive, there are some compelling  exceptions. At a November, 1988, sale at Sotheby's, for example, a pair of  beaded Seminole leggings sold for $60,500, something of a record. Of course,  beadwork from tribes of the Eastern and Southern United States is much rarer  than from the Great Plains and the Southwest, but Native American art of all  kinds is undervalued today. There are still many splendid examples for the  collector.  </P> <P>  Look for Native American beadwork at Taos Indian Trading Co., Wounded Knee  Gallery, Nonesuch Gallery and Federico in Santa Monica; Native American Art  Gallery in Venice; Don Bennett Antique American Indian Art in Agoura; Sun Stone  Gallery in Laguna Beach; Indian Store in Anaheim; Ojai Indian Shop in Ojai;  Mike Haskell (Peregrine Galleries) in Santa Barbara, and American Indian  Gallery in San Diego.  </P></p>

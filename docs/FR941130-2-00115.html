			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Based on the representations made by the Exchange in the 1994 MTS Report, the Commission concludes that the MTS Pilot Program has contributed to the protection of investors and to the Exchange's ability to provide fair and orderly markets in new options products. Additionally, the growth in the use of the MTS Pilot Program as represented by the CBOE, combined with the Exchange's findings that options classes assigned to DPMs, relative to other options classes, rate high in the quality of their markets (e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> depth of the markets and which of bid/ask spreads), leads the Commission to conclude that the MTS Pilot Program is beneficial for investors and will promote fair and orderly markets for options classes. Accordingly, for the reasons stated herein, for the reasons articulated in the Commission's order establishing the MTS Pilot Program, <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  and because of the success of the pilot program since its inception (as represented by the Exchange in the 1994 MTS Report), the Commission believes that granting permanent approval of the MTS Pilot Program at this time is appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Exchange Act Release No. 24934,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, as amended, prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in order to permit the uninterrupted continuation of the Modified Trading System. As set forth in the 1994 MTS Report, the CBOE has represented that no adverse comments have been received and no problems have arisen in connection with the operation of the MTS Pilot Program since its inception. Furthermore, the Commission has not received any comments opposing the MTS Pilot Program or otherwise indicating that the MTS Pilot Program is operating other than as originally intended. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5), 11A, and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

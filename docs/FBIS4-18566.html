			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern League ideologue Gianfranco Miglio </F> by correspondent "P.C." in Milan; date not given: "`In Three  Years We Will Revolutionize Everything'"]    [Text] Milan -- [Correspondent] Professor Miglio, you say  that with 50 plus one percent of parliamentarians, you can delve  into Article 138 of the Constitution and modify it. But how  many articles will you end up modifying after that?    [Miglio] Quite a few. Indeed I believe that by 1997 or 1998  we will have a totally new Constitution. Or at least it will be  set right on other issues as well, ones which are not currently  under discussion like basic rights. The basis for this change  lies in holding the majority, and that majority now exists.    [Correspondent] The program it all hinges on is federalism.  Your project provides for the majority of power in public  administration to be handed over to the so-called macroregions.  Can you explain how?    [Miglio] I would be inclined to go along with what the  Bicameral Reform Commission established, namely: Only a few  areas of jurisdiction will remain the province of a central  authority, which will be called federal. In our view that could  cover such areas as defense, foreign policy, the currency,  credit, the higher realms of justice. The balance, which is an  enormous amount, will be the province of the macroregions, or  the regions with special statutes. We can do this thanks to  Article 138, which opens up a breach in the Constitution. You  must recall that the only thing we cannot do is enshrined in  Article 139: "The nation's republican status cannot be subject  to constitutional reform." So even those who wrote the  Constitution intended everything else to be possible.    [Correspondent] Possible in what way?    [Miglio] The first package of reforms, which is what I think  people are talking about, will take about 90 days. It concerns  the major bodies, the major power centers: the government,  parliament, the president of the republic. These will all be  changed and we will be able to have a state that works. Then  further work will be needed, a few years, I believe, to change  other institutions like the Higher Council of the Magistracy, or  the role of the Constitutional Court.    [Correspondent] So you see continuous change?.    [Miglio] Yes, we are living through an ongoing constituent  phase. I have always maintained that change cannot be  implemented in one fell swoop. To change the setup in the major  centers of power will take this 90 day period followed, in  accordance with Article 138 in the Constitution, by two further  deliberations in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, with an  interval of no less than three months between. Let's say about  six months to prepare the groundwork for the big change. A  number of adjustments will follow. For example, the three  cantons which I have proposed are groupings based on existing  regions. We may need to hold referenda, because certain regions  or provinces may prefer to join one canton rather than another.  Take Umbria, for instance. It is already split; whom will it  want to go with? The citizens will be the ones to decide.    [Correspondent] You mentioned modifying some inviolable  rights...    [Miglio] Yes, by which I mean that those articles of the  Constitution which have caused nothing but trouble must be  changed. For example, I am not so sure punishment should aim to  re-educate the guilty. When it is objectively obvious that a  person cannot be re-educated, that he is a habitual delinquent,  then there is no point in thinking in terms of re-education. I  would like to stress that this is a personal opinion of mine.    [Correspondent] So, in your view, modifications of that  nature are easy to implement?    [Miglio] Absolutely, and I would like to point out that all  we need is 50 plus one percent of parliamentarians to change the  Constitution. But to make the great leap over to federalism we  will be calling a popular referendum. There will be a great  battle for the future. I believe public opinion will support  this majority; persuasion to cooperate will emerge [as  published].</p>

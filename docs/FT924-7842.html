			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (11): Few northern bubbles to burst - The North / There is a shortage of good modern or new space in some city centres THE north of England has been reaping some rewards from being on the wrong side of Britain's north-south divide in the 1980s. While the south bubbled, the north's property markets hardly inflated at all, so there were few northern bubbles to burst when the south's went pop. Mr Tom Marshall, chief executive of Lambert Smith Hampton in Manchester, sums up much of the situation in a vast swathe of England from Crewe and Grimsby northwards to the Scottish border. 'The property market finds itself in as hostile an environment as any, but has inflicted fewer wounds on itself over the past five years than is the case for much of the rest of the country,' he says. Much of northern England was ignored by national property developers until very late in the last upward swing of the economic cycle. This was not because the north was essentially unattractive, but the pickings were easier and richer in the south. The result is that there is no serious over-supply of good property anywhere in the north. Indeed, there is a shortage of good modern or new space in the city centres of Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield and Newcastle. Rental levels have softened on some older, refurbished properties, but are holding at the top end, although Manchester's will be tested in the next few months as 45,000 sq ft comes on stream at an asking price of Pounds 22 or Pounds 23 per sq ft. Leeds, however, has been steady at Pounds 19 a sq ft, with Pounds 20 projected for next year on new space. As Matthews and Goodman - a surveyor active in London, Liverpool and Manchester - points out, Manchester's top rents were about Pounds 15 five years ago, although growth there is not as impressive as in Leeds, where the 1987 level was Pounds 7. Not everything is wonderful: concessions and incentives are on offer in several areas to get people to move in, but it is hard to find signs of real desperation to let or sell. Developers who had stretched too far into debt to hold on have already gone. For the rest, an absence of glut has enabled a longer view to be taken. If there is a problem, it is at Salford Quays, Manchester's docklands at the terminus of the ship canal. An expiring enterprise zone brought 1m sq ft of new office space onto the market in a rush in 1990-91, just as demand began to falter. About 80 per cent is still unlet, but while this hit Charter Developments hard, others such as the Manchester Ship Canal Company appear able to afford to sit it out. Meanwhile, Amec - another big Salford Quays developer - is getting on with serious industrial property projects in the adjacent Trafford Park urban development area. Mr Nicholas Kos, a partner in Bailey Deakin Hamiltons, a Preston firm of chartered surveyors, says that although the market is sluggish and speculative development has dried up, specific requirements are being met by bespoke design and build projects. He also says there is continuing demand for well-located property. Indeed, location is proving a crucial factor, involving three elements - the motorway network, proximity to Manchester Airport and the growth of the financial and professional services sector in Leeds and Manchester. The last of these is what is keeping up prime office rentals. In both cities, the financial and professional firms involved operate within walking distance of each other and employ tens of thousands of people between them. Manchester Airport, meanwhile, is now the fastest-growing in Europe and is firmly established as Britain's northern hub and international gateway. This is spawning its own mini-market, with several sizeable speculative developments planned. Top rents in nearby Wilmslow, for example, have been a step ahead of central Manchester's for several years. The motorways, however, are probably the northern property market's biggest asset. Good sites near important junctions offer crucial benefits to foreign inward investors, national relocators, and anyone in the distribution business. Warrington and Wakefield - respectively at the crossover points of the M62 with the M6 and M1-A1 - prove the point, with warehouses by the mile or prestigious new arrivals such as Pioneer, the Japanese audio systems manufacturer, and Cover Girl, which Procter &amp; Gamble has relocated to Wakefield from Bournemouth. The M1 at Sheffield and Rotherham has proved ideal for the new Meadowhall shopping complex. After two years' operation, only five of 285 units were unlet and 43m visitors had produced a pedestrian flow higher than London's Oxford Street. Second-year traffic was 15 per cent up. Finally, Crewe Business Park offers one of the best examples of how the north is now outscoring the south. Sokkia, the Japanese manufacturer of surveying instruments, was faced with a rent review in Crawley, Sussex, from Pounds 9.50 a sq ft to Pounds 17. Crewe and Nantwich Urban Renewal built Sokkia a 12,000 sq ft UK headquarters for Pounds 900,000. It would have cost three times as much to buy a site in the south-east - and it would have been an unprepossessing infill between warehouses. And Crewe's green fields will allow 50 per cent expansion of present buildings, plus the option to almost double the present one-acre site when Sokkia wants to grow further.</p>

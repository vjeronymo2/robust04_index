			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Inchcape poised to appeal over actuaries classification Inchcape has failed in its attempt to persuade the FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee to move it from Vehicle Distributors to Diversified Industries. It now plans to appeal. The group's shares fell 6p to 515p on the news. Inchcape said it was 'very disappointed by the decision' which it said was 'not in the interests of our shareholders, our customers and the people we do business with. It cannot be in the best interests of the investment community'. Under the classification system companies are assigned to sub-sectors according to the industry from which they derive most of their profits. In 1992 Inchcape made 60 per cent of its operating profits from motors importing, distribution, and retailing. But Inchcape argued that there was a distinction between the importing and distribution activity and the retailing side. The latter made only 14 per cent of profits. Inchcape's compatriots in the sub-sector are largely UK motor retailers, and as a much larger company, Inchcape said its presence would distort the sector. The new system comes into effect on January 4, and the Financial Times will publish details at the year end. Final changes to the proposed reclassifications, originally published in October, were announced by the committee yesterday after a third meeting on Monday. As a result another 40 companies were reassigned. Significant movers included Albert Fisher Group, which shifted from Retailers &amp; Wholesalers, Food to Food Manufacturers, and Ladbroke, which moved from Leisure to Hotels &amp; Caterers. Burton Group, which owns Debenhams department stores as well as a number of retail chains, moved from Retailers, Chain Stores to Retailers, Multi-Department. Sears, which runs the Selfridges department store, and chains such as Miss Selfridge, Adams and Olympus, did the opposite switch. A full list of yesterday's company sector changes will appear in tomorrow's FT.</p>

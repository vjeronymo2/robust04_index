			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPACE FLIGHTS SEEN AS COSTING LIVES  </P> <P> A space shuttle will be lost and astronauts may well die within the next decade  if the United States carries out its vision of exploring the universe, Congress  was warned in a report released Wednesday.  </P> <P> "If the United States wishes to send people into space on a routine basis, the  nation will have to accept the risks these activities entail," said the study  by the congressional Office of Technology Assessment. "If such risks are  perceived to be too high, the nation may decide to reduce its emphasis on  placing humans in space."  </P> <P> The price of increased space activity includes "the likelihood that loss of  life will occur," the report said.  </P> <P> The OTA report, called "Round Trip to Orbit: Human Space Flight Alternatives,"  examines some of the policy choices Congress faces in decisions for this  century and the next. The OTA said NASA could reduce some of the risks by  building a fifth orbiter, at a cost of $2.5 billion, including spare parts.  </P></p>

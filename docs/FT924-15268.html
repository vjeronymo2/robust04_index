			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Ruling lets Japanese import cheaper foreign rice JAPAN'S Food Agency yesterday cleared the way for imports of sushi prepared overseas, letting Japanese restaurateurs take advantage of cheap foreign rice prices, even though imports of rice alone are banned, AP reports from Tokyo. The popular food (fish atop balls of vinegar-flavoured boiled rice) will be classified as a processed fish product if the fish makes up over 20 per cent of the total weight of one piece of sushi, the agency said. The decision came after the Finance Ministry classified sushi as a processed fish product and decided to impose 10-20 per cent tariffs, depending on the kind of topping. At issue was whether a piece of sushi is one unit, or separate fish and rice components. Japan's food law bans almost all rice imports, to keep its self-sufficiency in its staple food. Seeking a ruling, Sushi Boy, a 44-restaurant chain based in Osaka, had imported 1,000 frozen pieces of sushi as samples. Proposals at Gatt's Uruguay Round would require Japan to lift its rice ban. Japan has rejected the idea.</p>

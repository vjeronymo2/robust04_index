			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with President Carlos Menem by </F> journalists Roberto Guareschi, Ricardo Kirschbaum, Alcadio Ona,  and Julio Blanck at his office in Government House on 14 April]    [Excerpts] [CLARIN] How do you assess the results of the  [10 April Constituent Assembly members] elections?    [Menem] What was the goal? We must start by asking ourselves  what was our goal concerning the 10 April elections: The  constitutional reform. This goal is underway. An overwhelming  victory, virtually in the entire Republic, has been achieved,  even though an attempt was made to downgrade this victory by  emphasizing a defeat in the federal capital. Look at Buenos  Aires Province: Even though the percentage who voted for  Justicialism dropped a bit, it is the first time in history that  Justicialism has won 121 of the 127 districts. In Santa Fe  Province, for example, it is the first time Justicialism won all  19 districts. The same happened in La Rioja Province and other  provinces.... Granted, the number of votes dropped. This may  have been caused by this sort of dispersion in which two other  parties, the Grand Front [FG] and MODIN [Movement for Dignity  and Independence], appeared with a certain strength.  Nevertheless, Justicialism obviously achieved excellent results.  We achieved victory. Add up the UCR [Radical Civic Union], FG,  and MODIN Constituent Assembly members, and you will see they do  not reach the number of Justicialism Constituent Assembly  members, namely 138.    [CLARIN] Mr. President, this fourth consecutive electoral  victory for you and Justicialism represents an unprecedented  record. Nevertheless, you will agree that the federal capital  represents a sort of political showcase in our country and  events in the federal capital have strong repercussions.    [Menem] The capital is represented by 27 out of 305  Constituent Assembly members.    [CLARIN] What is your explanation for the defeat of Peronism  in the capital?    [Menem] Voters in the capital are wayward and demanding. I  don't know why, but this waywardness has occurred since the  federal capital was founded. Socialism, headed by Alfredo  Palacios, won here once. I could attribute the electoral result  in the federal capital to a very good performance by the FG  leaders, but also to the waywardness of the federal capital  voters. [passage omitted]    [CLARIN] Do you agree with the polls that say that the main  reason for voting for the FG was that the people believed there  had to be an opposition?    [Menem] There are many factors. This may be one. The  floods, caused by the heavy rain in the capital, was another  reason. This soured the people's mood. The people tend to  blame the incumbent president rather than what has been going on  for many years.... The scandals, prompted by reports on  corruption within the PAMI [Comprehensive Medical Assistance  Plan], may, also have had an impact; no doubt. There are many  factors.    [CLARIN] This may be an explanation for the growth of the  FG,  but why did the votes for Peronism drop?    [Menem] Maybe Justicialist Party [PJ] members or those who  sympathize with Justicialism decided to cast blank votes or  support the FG.    [CLARIN] Could this happen again next year during the  presidential elections?    [Menem] They are a different type of election. It is one  thing to vote for presidential, gubernatorial, or mayoral  candidates, and quite another thing to vote in this type of  election in which it was known beforehand that the candidates'  prestige was not involved. [passage omitted]    [CLARIN] At the national level the PJ does not have a  majority in the Constituent Assembly and there is speculation  that someone may attempt to open up the "package" that you and  [UCR President Raul] Alfonsin agreed upon.    [Menem] We have a strategy to confront this maneuver. This  is part of politics. And in this field I am no newcomer....    [CLARIN] At the national level, even after a clear victory,  the PJ has lost 900,000 votes since October....    [Menem] For the reasons I have just mentioned.    [CLARIN] There will be a presidential election within a  year.    [Menem] We will recover these votes and achieve a better  result than the one we achieved in October. A presidential  election is different. In a presidential election, we are all  mobilized. This time I went to just two places. I went to  Cordoba Province, where I knew that we were not going to fare  well, and I went to Santiago del Estero Province where there was  a chance of overcoming a given situation. Just 100 days after  the December disturbances, we carried out a number of rallies,  approached the community, and won by 12 percent. No one  expected this to happen -- except those who always have faith  and hope. [passage omitted]    [CLARIN] Do you believe the 10 April election results spell  the beginning of the end of a bipartisan system?    [Menem] Following these elections, the bipartisan system has  become a four-party system. There are four strongly emerging  parties. Of the two traditional parties, Justicialism is  holding on while the UCR is visibly shrinking. Nevertheless, I  believe the UCR will regain its strength and its votes. [passage  omitted]    [CLARIN] The latest foreign trade figures indicate that  exports are growing at a much slower pace than imports....    [Menem] Every country that is overcoming serious crises and  entering a process of significant transformations will have  unbalanced trade figures. Argentina cannot be an exception.  What are the goods that cause this imbalance? Imported capital  goods. How can we compete at an international level with totally  obsolete equipment in our factories? We must not forget that as  we progress in technology, incorporating science into  production, we will overcome a large number of stumbling blocks  in our efforts to compete internationally. We are implementing  an export-oriented policy, and a series of incentives are under  study. We will be somewhat careful concerning imports because  virtually all the components required by factories and producers  have already entered our country.    [CLARIN] Please define "be careful concerning imports."    [Menem] I do not want to pass absolute judgment, but a  number  of measures, to favor our country's production, may be taken.  These measures will foster our export-oriented policy.  Nevertheless, this issue must be handled very carefully because  we may also be subjected to trade reprisals, involving increased  tariffs, by the countries receiving our exports and the problem  will be more complicated for us. An agreement must be reached  on this issue.    [CLARIN] [Economy Minister Domingo] Cavallo has recently  said  it will be necessary to reduce the consumption growth rate....    [Menem] This depends on the people. When [former President  Juan Domingo] Peron was president, he said what Minister Cavallo  is saying now: Save because this situation will not last a  lifetime. Be careful. It is necessary to be far-sighted....    [CLARIN] Is Cavallo announcing that the party is over?    [Menem] No, no... Cavallo is not saying this. He is simply  telling the people that they have to control their spending.  Even if we have a very small amount, we Argentines like to  spend this very small amount. This is why we have ruined over  the past four or five decades one of the most progressive  countries on Earth.    [CLARIN] How do you view the pharmaceutical patents law  issue?    [Menem] We are making an effort to at least have a Senate  commission approve it and leave it ready for discussion by the  Senate plenary. The commission's approval represents an  important step.    [CLARIN] If even this small legislative step is not  achieved,  will Argentina be placed by the United States on a list of  countries whose entry into NAFTA is not recommended?    [Menem] I don't know because our imports from this country  represent a huge benefit for it. More than 50,000 jobs in the  United States depend on Argentine imports.    [CLARIN] It has been said that if no progress is made on  this  law, the United States could implement some reprisals, like  placing us on this list....    [Menem] These are mere sanction announcements.  Nevertheless, we must not forget that the patents law issue  goes back to the Bush administration. We discussed this issue  with Carla Hills who was the U.S. trade secretary during the  Bush administration. We shall see....    [CLARIN] The GATT agreement establishes a more benign  patents  legislation system. Does the bill presented in Congress follow  the GATT or the U.S. standards?    [Menem] It conforms to the U.S. proposal. This is very  important because like this we have the possibility of joining  NAFTA and immediately gaining access to a market of more than  600 million consumers. [passage omitted]</p>

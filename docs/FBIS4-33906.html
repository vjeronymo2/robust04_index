			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Brigadier General Raul Valle Valdez, </F> chief of General Staff of the Western Army, by Roberto Cavada;  from the "First Thing" program -- live]    [Text] [Cavada] We have with us Brigadier General Raul  Valle Valdez, chief of General Staff of the Western Army, as  well as Brigadier Gen. Harry Villega, chief of the political  department of the Western Army.    Good morning. I am reminded of Che, for Villega had much to  do with Che's involvement in Bolivia. But we can discuss that  some other time.    Let us begin with the Western Army's combat readiness. The  effort and commitment -- not only political commitment but also  work commitment -- required to maintain an Armed Forces such as  ours during such difficult times has always concerned me. We  cannot afford to lose the commitment, spirit, and combat  readiness of our troops and militiamen and of the people, in  general, since this is the Armed Forces of the people in uniform.    How has the Western Army maintained combat readiness? What  initiatives has it taken to maintain such high combat readiness  levels?    [Valle] The commander in chief, the Revolutionary Armed  Forces [FAR] minister, and the leadership of the Cuban Communist  Party and Government have always known this. The guidelines our  commander in chief issued before the special period were aimed  at finding cheaper solutions to maintaining our combat training  and readiness level, in light of the fact that Cuba was heading  toward an energy crisis that would affect every aspect of  national life.    We began to work on this immediately. Keep in mind that the  special period began around the time the mission in Angola was  ending. That is when we arrived in Cuba. From that point on,  the Western Army engaged in those tasks with the other armies.  Today, the people's combat training is more solid than ever.  There is a certain amount of expertise involved in training  regular troops for combat today, thanks to trainers who look for  ways to improve combat training methods at integral training  ranges and at relatively smaller ranges. Command and control  exercises and training and general staff's and chief's exercises  upgrade cadre training. We have managed to make the soldiers'  overall training much more efficient and have increased the  recruits' basic training time from eight to 10 weeks, allowing  soldiers to arrive at their units with higher quality training.  This has allowed us to maintain the Armed Forces' combat  training and readiness levels despite the ongoing special period.    [Cavada] Yes. Above all, the austerity and commitment to  continuing the training and to not lowering the combat training  and readiness levels has prevailed.    I would like to discuss later the Western Army's 33 years  and, specifically, how lately, due to the economic situation  facing Cuba, the Army has engaged in productive tasks. Armies  worldwide are unproductive state institutions which feed off the  government and state budget. In Cuba's case, there has been a  willingness and commitment to turn the army into a productive  sector to benefit the army itself and the rest of the population.</p>

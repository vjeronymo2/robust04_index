The question was asked by Gestinform to 1,000  Maputo residents between 18 February and 4 March. Domingos  Arouca and Fumo [Mozambique United Front-Democratic Convergence  Party] emerged as viable alternatives to run the country.    Out of a total of 1,000 people, Arouca received the support  of 360 people or 36 percent. Maximo Dias came second with 225  votes (22.5 percent), Padimbe Kamati with 31 votes (3.1  percent), and Neves Serrano with eight votes (.8 percent). The  number of voters who did not vote for the candidates was 118  (11.5 percent), and those undecided represented 25 percent or  258 voters.    If parliamentary elections were held tomorrow without the  participation of Frelimo and Renamo, Fumo would also enjoyed the  support of the Maputo electorate with 271 votes or 27 percent.  Then comes Monamo [Mozambican Nationalist Movement-Mozambican  Social Democratic Party] with 258 votes (25.8 percent), the PCN  [National Convention Party] with 247 votes (24.7 percent),  Pademo [Mozambique Democratic Party] with 25 votes (2.5  percent), the PPPM [Mozambique People's Progress Party] with 18  votes (1.8 percent), Sol [Social Democratic and Liberal Party]  with 14 (1.4 percent), and Palmo [Mozambique Liberal and  Democratic Party] with 7 (.7 percent). There were 149 undecided  voters (14.9 percent) and 11 various others (1.1 percent).    This is the opinion expressed by people interviewed during  the opinion poll:    Dr. Domingos Arouca: "He is the best among the other  political leaders." "If the two main contenders do not run for  the presidency, it would be his turn." "He is the type of man  that this country needs -- old, cultured, and calm." "He is not  one of those who has the hands stained red; his are clean."    Dr. Maximo Dias: "He is a good political leader, cultured  and  mature." "He seems to be the most democratic of the Mozambican  politicians." "He is an experienced politician." "Many  politicians could learn from his speeches."    Dr. Padimbe Kamate: "He is the eldest of the candidates."  "He has a lot to teach us." "He seems to be very careful in his  statements; he does not make senseless accusations." "He is  very worried about our people, and deserves to be the president  of the Republic."    Dr. Neves Serrano: "Mozambique needs a religious president  so  that there is no more war; he is the right person." "He is a  very simple and respected man, who greets everybody." "He is  not one of those who drives luxury automobiles; he walks like  the people."    The opinion poll covered residents of the city of Maputo  older than 18 years, of whom 490 were males and 510 females.  The margin of error is 3.09 percent with a 95 percent degree of  certainty.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Walloon protest flags Belgium's cultural divide AT 8am today a socialist member of the European parliament will hang a black-bordered Walloon flag outside a town hall in eastern Belgium. Mr Jose Happart's symbolic gesture is not a belated expression of grief at the death a month ago of Belgium's much loved King Baudouin. He is mourning the day, 30 years ago, when the Belgian government laid down the linguistic frontier between French-speaking Walloons in the south, and Dutch-speaking Flemings in the north. Belgium's deep linguistic scars, which the late king often had to soothe, run across the small cluster of villages where Mr Happart will stage his protest - the Fourons, or, in Dutch, Voeren. Equidistant from Maastricht in the Netherlands, Aachen in Germany and Liege in Wallonia, most of the villages' 4,200 inhabitants speak a Germanic dialect. Two-thirds also consider themselves French-speakers. But, in 1963, it was decided that for administrative purposes the villages, instead of staying in Wallonia, would become part of Flanders. The francophone Happart family has been at the centre of resistance to that decision, fighting for the right to French culture through the Action Fouronnaise campaign. Recently, the tension has only come to the surface in tame rows about which regional flag to hoist over the town hall. During the 1970s and early 1980s, however, the villages were caught up in violent demonstrations between Walloon and Flemish militants. The Fourons/Voeren problem was blamed for the collapse of several national coalitions. Mr Happart and his allies claim that their constant pressure for special treatment of the villages helped shape the recent constitutional reforms in Belgium, which devolved more powers to the country's regional authorities. But he warns: 'Every time there's an inter-institutional solution for the rest of Belgium, people say the Fourons is no longer a problem. But there isn't yet an acceptable solution, so whether it's in the short or medium term, the problem is bound to erupt again.' The French-speakers' blunt demand that the villages be returned to Wallonia, however, seems to have been scaled back. In an interview with the francophone daily, Le Soir, published yesterday, Mr Nico Droeven, French-speaking mayor of the Fourons, said he could accept geographical membership of Flanders, provided inhabitants had the right to choose between Flemish or Walloon administrations. Recent months have seen a surge in the national movement against separatism. But with several Flemish politicians still openly backing independence for Flanders, Mr Happart's protest will act as a warning to Belgium's new king, Albert II, and the country's fragile centre-left coalition government that they will have to work hard to keep Belgians together.</p>

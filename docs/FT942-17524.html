			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Property: Planning permission that never lapses - Cadogan's Place The bulldozers ripping up the turf in the sprawling Cotswold village of Quenington, Gloucestershire, have exposed a loophole in planning rules. Quenington, in the beautiful valley of the river Coln, is made up of isolated farmsteads with fields between. In 1979, the Cotswold district council gave permission for two bungalows to be build in a field on the edge of the village, as well as conversion of a barn already there into studios. Soon afterwards, most of the village was declared a Conservation Area (CA) so the council could keep tighter control on development. The field has CA land on three sides but was not itself included. Work began on the barn - and stopped. Years passed. The villagers continued to enjoy the green field, assuming that the planning permission had lapsed. Not so. It lapses if nothing has been done within five years. But, if work has started, the permission remains valid indefinitely. Attitudes have changed, though. The council probably would not approve such a scheme in 1994 and must regret not having drawn a larger CA. Now, more than 200 of the village's 400 inhabitants have signed a petition against the project (with only nine in favour). But nothing can be done. What has happened in Quenington is a lesson for buyers, solicitors and local councillors. Meanwhile, opponents of the scheme believe the government should amend the law so that permission is revoked automatically for developments that are not finished in a specified time. ***** When the big house in the village is up for sale, worry stalks the pub. Where will the fete be held? Who will chair the parish council? Or give money to the church? Will the new owner employ as many staff? That is the buzz in Kingsey, on the border of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire near Thame, where the 17th century Tythrop Park - listed grade I, with 1,034 acres - is for sale from Savills (071-499 8644) for more than Pounds 4.5m. Tythrop Park was built by James Herbert, one of the Herbert/Pembroke family that owns Wilton in Wiltshire. Indeed, the carved elm staircase, which is the glory of the main house, could have come from Wilton. Among the motifs of the house, a Boscobel oak alludes to Charles II, a visitor there. Around the stairwell are classical busts, life-size reliefs of Juno and Minerva, portraits of James and Jane Herbert, and a statue of Venus. The present owners bought the house (almost derelict) with 10 acres 30 years ago - the asking price was Pounds 16,500 - and have restored it with love and flair. It remains to be seen if the new owner is as sympathetic - to village as well as house. ***** If you do not set too high a guide price in a sale, you could get a pleasant surprise. Joint auctioneers Allsop and Savills suggested Pounds 425,000 to Pounds 475,000 for Hinwick House, a lovely Queen Anne property in Bedfordshire (described in this column on March 19/20). The hammer came down at Pounds 590,000 to an overseas buyer. ***** In the same vein, the Pounds 875,000 price from Savills (071-730 0822) for the 1690 Zoffany House, which fronts on to the river Thames at Strand-on-the-Green in west London - a splendid house in one of the capital's handsomest areas - is Pounds 20,000 less than it was two years ago with the same agent. The house has a blue plaque recording that John Zoffany, a painter, lived there. His studio, now a bedroom, faces north over the garden. ***** Down-river in London's Docklands, the house of film director David Lean, who died in 1991, has just come to market (also Savills). He turned four Victorian warehouses at Sun Wharf, Narrow Street E14, into a dramatic home with a large garden so close to the river that you could fall in. He kept the brick inside so that you do not forget how the house began. It is rich in terraces, unusual views of the water and the barges, and has cunning lighting. Mod cons include a cinema - and a turntable in the garage so that you need not back into the street. At Pounds 3m, it is ideal for somebody in showbiz - or a big bonus-winner in the City or nearby Canary Wharf.</p>

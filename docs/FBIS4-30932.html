			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 30 (ATA) -- Commenting on the storm of  threats, slanders and offenses towards Albania and Albanian  authorities as well as the war mongering calls of the most  senior authorities of Greece over the last weekend, the  spokesman of the Foreign Ministry said that all these aim at  stirring up tensions and artificially preventing the dialogue.  Referring to numerous threats by the Greek officials, the  spokesman stressed that the Albanians and Albania, as the most  ancient nation of the Balkans, do not threaten anyone, but they  also consider hopeless those who try to impress the Albanians  through threats. The policy of threats towards the Albanians is  an abortive policy. Regarding the numerous offenses by senior  Greek officials for Albanian authorities and Albania, the  spokesman said that he did not want to answer because he said  they reminded him of the Hoxha period when the dictator used to  slander and offend all the leadership of Europe.    Certainly, he said, "I consider them as an expression of the  crisis of the political culture. I can see that object of their  attacks have also been other European countries during the past  few months."    Further on the spokesman said that what should be considered  true and dangerous are the warmongering calls of the Greek  senior political leadership and the evocation on their part of  another Bosnia in the south of the Balkans.    "I think that Greek statements should be analyzed through a  special preoccupation by the European Union, the USA, Russia and  the UN. They are a clear sign showing that those who are  dreaming of another Bosnia are seriously attacked by the Serbian  syndrome. This clearly helps to interpret and understand more  clearly and convincingly the greek regional policy for the past  two years. I remind these messrs", the spokesman said further  on, "that the game of Bosnia in the south of the Balkans means a  broader Balkan conflict for which they will be fully responsible.</p>

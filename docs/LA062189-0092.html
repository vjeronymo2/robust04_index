			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: IRVINE;  </P> <P> MOBILE AD CAMPAIGN PROMOTES RIDE SHARING  </P> <P> To promote ride sharing, large, portable signs with messages such as "Does it  seem like this billboard is moving faster than you?" have been greeting  motorists this week at key intersections in the Irvine Spectrum light  industrial and office complex.  </P> <P> Sponsored by Spectrumotion, the area's transportation management association,  the ad campaign is also intended to help The Irvine Co. achieve traffic  reduction goals for the area that were set by the city as a condition of  development.  </P> <P> Charity Gavaza, Spectrumotion's executive director, estimates that 20% of the  17,000 employees in the Spectrum area already use car or van pools, mass  transit or bicycles, or walk to work.  </P> <P> One of the portable billboards states: "If you van pooled, you would have read  this message 10 minutes ago."  </P> <P> County transportation officials believe the Spectrum area is ripe for  car-pooling and van-pooling efforts because so many workers there share the  same work destinations. The complex is located near the junction of the Santa  Ana and San Diego Freeways.  </P></p>

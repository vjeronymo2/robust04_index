The documents were provoked by the suprise success of  Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic  Party and communists in the Dec. 12 elections in Russia.    The Latvian political elite may start restricting democracy  in the republic to please Great Russian chauvinists, the  statement said.    The governments of the free world countries should prevent  "restrictions of human rights and freedoms, and repressions  against people loyal to the Latvian independence."    The statement is distributed to foreign diplomats in Latvia.    In the other statement the party urges the Latvian people to  actively protest opression and totalitarism.    Otherwise, Latvia may fall back into the yoke of the Russian  imperialism, the statement said, because Latvia "still has not  become part of the free world; it still lacks close links with  other former Communist bloc countries; and the Latvian economy  is managed by pro-Russian businessmen."    The statement advises Latvians to react on any attempts  against human rights and freedoms by means of civil resistance,  like rallies and demonstrations. In case of Russian military  aggression, the Latvian national defense forces should not obey  orders to surrender their arms, the statement added.    The National Democratic Party also protested its  classification as a far right wing grouping. It claimed that, if  so, the majority of European countries and the United States  should be also viewed as radical rightists.</p>

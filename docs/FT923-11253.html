			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Fishing: A Mecca in the West - Good-value hotels for fishing holidays THERE ARE salmon. And there is fishing. And then there are the fortunes sacrificed trying to connect the two. Three seasons ago I saw a thigh-booted character off-loading fish from the back of a Bentley. Five minutes and 28 fish later he told me that he was 'reasonably satisfied' with his haul, caught on the prawn on the Tay, in Scotland. I remarked that his fishing must be expensive on such a great river. He inhaled deeply and held up his cigarette. 'Stop for a fag and the time'll cost you 12 quid.' The Tay, Spey and Tweed are the holy trinity of salmon rivers, but the lesser meccas for the fisherman lie in England's West Country. The rivers babble through Exmoor, Dartmoor and Bodmin, jolly rather than grand, surrendering their fish to those with luck and doggedness rather than fist-thick wallets. The river Barle clatters past within view of the Carnarvon Arms' dining-room, hurrying those still at breakfast. The hotel, just outside Dulverton, on the Devon-Somerset border, owns 5 1/2 miles of fishing on both the Barle and its big sister, the Exe. Shaun Blackmore is wine waiter at night, ghillie by day, able to advise on both a burgundy and the hook size of a Mallard &amp; Claret. He oversees the fishing-fly cabinet next to the reception desk, at the end of a hallway lined with rod-rests and two sets of scales. Utterly wild, scarlet-spotted, West Country trout eat frugally in the peaty water and seldom weigh more than three to the pound. A pounder is a specimen. A two-pounder has abandoned the meagre insect protein; he is a cannibal. 'Of course, you could try for an early spring salmon,' suggests Shaun, now in ghillie role. Half-an-hour later, flicking a Silver Doctor over the Exebridge Pool, I am joined by a dipper, which bobs briefly before disappearing underwater in search of caddis-fly larvae. Good fishermen concentrate on fishing, not birds. Gazing upwards, gathering in the line ready for the next cast, it stops abruptly. The rod tip is jerked downwards - but sadly an algaed branch, not a silver salmon, slides to the surface. The chill of Exmoor water decanted down a slipping wader is sufficient inducement to return to the hotel's drawing-room. There are three to choose from in this most old-fashioned of hotels, each with apple-log fires and soporific armchairs. The wine list is reasonable and packed lunches are readied at an evening's notice. The hotel's seclusion makes it popular with couples. The Half Moon Inn is so secluded it could hide Elizabeth Taylor. Secreted in Sheepwash, north Devon, it is known only to locals and fisherman, the latter migrating there every April and May. This is a serious fishing inn. The two Inniss brothers have run it since 1958, Benjie keeping the vast wine cellar while Charles juggles cooking and fishing. Charles is initially brusque: 'Everybody who's here this weekend is a regular. Been coming for years. So we don't get the prats who whinge if they don't catch a fish.' This event statistically becomes ever more commonplace. Charles explains: 'When my parents bought this place 35 years ago there were six fishing pubs on the Torridge and the 2 1/2 miles of river we had here at Sheepwash would produce 80 salmon. Now we have to rent some of the best beats on the Torridge to catch 30.' The statistics do not unduly worry the many anglers huddled into the fire-place end of the flagstoned bar, where they are outnumbered, two to one, by the malt whiskies. Opposite the bar is a photo-montage of anglers cradling salmon, as happy as if they were holding their first-born (actually, they look happier). The faces around the bar match the pictures; this is a fishing inn for the cognoscente. Beginners would do better to book in at the Arundell Arms Hotel in Lifton, two miles away from the Tamar, beyond which Cornwall begins and, so Devonians maintain, England ends. The hotel is run by Anne Voss Bark, a woman of poise and authority; she is also chairman of the local branch of the National Rivers Authority. Four rivers - the Thrushel, Wolf, Carey and Lyd - spill down from Dartmoor to her fiefdom, where they merge with the Tamar. The Arundell Arms has the fishing on 20 miles of them, with beats of between half-a-mile to 1 3/4 miles. Salmon run the Tamar and the Lyd, and at night both rivers will surrender sea-trout, but only to anglers who can cast a fly with the delicacy of a diplomat. Those who crack their fly rod like a Ben Hur charioteer will find these wild fish unforgiving. However, salvation is at hand. Anne Voss Bark's husband, Conrad, runs a series of courses, ranging from a weekend's introduction for tyros to advanced salmon-casting. The salmon run to 10lb, though lurking leviathans are suggested by the tubular brass-scale in the hallway, marked 'Salmon' and calibrated to 22lb. Even more optimistic is the trout-scale, notching up the half-ounces to the 4lb mark. Only Horace ever reached that weight. Embalmed in varnish, he stares glassy-eyed over the instruments of his destruction lining the hotel entrance - a brass Hardy reel; a bamboo fishing-pole; a collection of battered fishing flies. For years this tyrant trout was a finny friend of all who stayed at the hotel, then under the command of Major Oscar Morris, who ran it for his chums. All initiates to this charmed circle were invited to drop a fly over Horace's nose. Disdain was the only reaction. One Commander Chilton knew nothing of this when, in 1942, he broke off from war to spend some leave at the hotel. He came. He cast. He caught Horace. Returning triumphant, the Commander was met by disbelief, then horror. The stuffed fish remains, in admonishment. Jonathan Young is editor of The Field.

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Cut and rally DEALING in all the major currencies will be affected by the extent of today's cut in the Bundesbank's official interest rates, writes James Blitz. If the Germans had not pledged to cut their official rates, the unilateral devaluation of the Italian lira could have led to a run on sterling and other weaker currencies in the exchange rate mechanism this morning. However, the Bundesbank's promise to cut its official rates for the first time since 1988 could trigger a rally for the dollar and sterling in European trading today. Early operations in Australia and New Zealand showed how wild markets could be today. In New Zealand, the dollar surged as high as DM1.51, after opening in New York on Friday at DM1.4503. Sterling was at a high of DM2.81, two pfennigs above its close in London. The French franc was trading as low as FFr3.2923 against the D-Mark, having been at around FFr3.40 for the last few weeks. Even if the Germans cut rates, however, the outcome of Sunday's referendum on Maastricht could still create tensions for European currencies. France must hope that a cut in German rates will be followed by a cut in French rates and that this will increase the Yes vote on Sunday. If it does not, trading next Monday could be no less intense. The day will also bring the first test of whether devaluation can save the Italian lira from further interest rate rises. The experience of Finland is that devaluation, far from stopping the rot, only brings more pressures on the currency. Some dealers think that a 7 per cent devaluation is far too small, and that the lira was already overvalued against the D-Mark by around 15 per cent until last night.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Tec chairman's contracts defended The awarding of contracts by a training and enterprise council to a company owned by one of its board members was defended yesterday by the Tec National Council.

Mr Howard said that in late 1991 Mr Albert Gable, then head of finance, asked Raytel to arrange personal pensions for some staff members, again without putting the contract out to tender.

A number of brokers were invited to bid for the account, and Mr Clegg chose to transfer all 30 plans which were placed with Raytel to the Tec National Pension Scheme. Mr Chris Humphries, director of policy and strategy at the Tec National Council, said: 'The whole point of a Tec is that it is based in a community and requires you to have local people on your board.'</p>

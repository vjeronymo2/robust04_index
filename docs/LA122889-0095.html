			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOUGH OTHER RATES HAVE FALLEN, PRIME IS STUBBORNLY HIGH  </P> <P> When the nation's economy slows, the Federal Reserve Board eases credit and  banks help rekindle business activity by lowering the interest rates they  charge for loans.  </P> <P> So goes a classic scenario. But this year there's been a hitch, for banks have  been unusually tardy in lowering their prime lending rate, to the surprise of  economists and the dismay of some borrowers.  </P> <P> By most rules of thumb, "the prime should have come down weeks ago," said David  M. Jones, chief economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a big government  securities dealer in New York. "But in a year of bad real estate loans and bad  loans to developing countries, they must feel they've got reason to maximize  profits."  </P> <P> The prime rate is the basis for many fixed- and variable-rate loans to small  and medium-sized businesses and to consumers. Banks have historically been  quick to raise the prime when their borrowing costs are rising and slow to  lower it when their borrowing costs decline.  </P> <P> The longer they delay in lowering it, of course, the more they pad their  profits. And this year, they have been slower than usual, analysts agree.  </P> <P> The prime has declined from a peak of 11.5% last spring to 11% in June and to  its current 10.5% in August. But since then it has not budged. In early  November, one bank, Southwest Bank of St. Louis, cut its rate to 10%. Three  weeks later, however, Southwest raised it back again.  </P> <P> Economists predicted on Wednesday that with recent signs of easing by the Fed,  the prime could finally fall as early as next week or at least sometime during  the first quarter of next year.  </P> <P> These economists expressed surprise that banks have not moved since last week,  when the Fed signaled a further easing of credit by allowing the widely watched  federal funds rate to fall to 8.25% from 8.5%. The federal funds rate is what  banks charge each other for overnight loans.  </P> <P> By convention, banks lower the prime when it is more than 1.5 percentage points  higher than their cost of borrowing. The banks' borrowing costs -- as measured  by the rates they pay on 3-month certificates of deposit -- are now between  8.25% and 8.5%. That's a generous 2 to 2.25 percentage points below the prime.  </P> <P> "The banks feel they can keep the prime up, give special rates to their best  customers and keep up their net interest (profit) margins while holding on to  their market share," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist with First Fidelity  Bancorporation, parent of Philadelphia's Fidelity Bank.  </P> <P> The preferred customers who receive the preferential rates are businesses. But  consumers, who receive no such breaks, are likely to face the full brunt of the  higher prime, Levy acknowledged.  </P> <P> And by keeping the prime relatively high at year's end, banks will help  themselves in 1990 because interest rates on some adjustable consumer loans  next year will be based on where rates will stand at the end of this year.  </P> <P> The banks' eagerness to keep the rate high is understandable. Weakening real  estate in the Northeast, Arizona and other areas has forced writedowns of loans  and other defensive moves at such institutions as Bank of New England, First  Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles and Chase Manhattan Bank. Other prominent  lenders, such as Manufacturers Hanover in New York, are still suffering the  effects of soured loans to less developed nations.  </P> <P> In the third quarter, the nation's banks as a group lost $744 million because  of shaky loans on real estate and to developing countries. In the first half of  the year, by contrast, the banks earned record profits.  </P> <P> Ken Ackbarali, an economist with First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles, said the  gap between the banks' borrowing costs and the prime actually peaked in the  spring, when the prime rate began edging downward. At some points in June and  July, the prime was as much as 2.35 percentage points above the banks' costs --  higher than it has been "for several years," Ackbarali said.  </P> <P> Economists suggested several other reasons for banks' reluctance to cut the  rate.  </P> <P> The Fed has lowered rates extremely slowly this year because of its concern  about inflation, which continues at an annual rate of about 4.5%. "You actually  couldn't reduce rates much slower than they have," said S. Jay Levy of Levy  Economic Forecasters in Chappaqua, N.Y.  </P> <P> As a result, "banks have been uncertain on the direction of short-term rates,"  said Ackbarali.  </P> <P> Economist Jones said the prime's "stickiness" may also be due to the fact that  it is no longer the kind of rate it once was. While the prime was for many  years the basis for loans to banks' best corporate customers, it is  increasingly the yardstick for consumer loans, such as auto loans and home  equity loans.  </P> <P> As a result, banks may regard the prime increasingly as a rate that fluctuates  little, like rates on credit cards and many auto loans, Jones said.  </P></p>

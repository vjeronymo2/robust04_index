			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / Letter: Vive la reine Sir, To have stated in your story 'Queen to be first UK monarch to meet Irish president' (May 22/23) that 'even the French have been known to wave flags for her' will, I hope, arouse the fury of many French readers who, like myself, are enthusiastic admirers of the Queen. The devotion of the French public to the British royal family is without equal outside the UK. G Sabbagh, 65 rue de Javelot, 75645 Paris, Cedex 13, France</p>

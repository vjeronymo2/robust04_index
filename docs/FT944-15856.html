			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Crowning glory for the last of his line: Russia's harassed president will meet Queen Elizabeth II today / A look at the royal visit When Queen Elizabeth meets Mr Boris Yeltsin, on her first state visit to Russia which starts today, she will be greeting a man who is certainly the last of his line. No future president of Russia will be a former member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Mr Yeltsin has fought hard to avoid the fate of being 'the Queen of England', as the decorative presidency to which the former Supreme Soviet of Russia wished to confine him was popularly known in Russian political circles. But in that struggle, which reached its climax a year ago, he exhausted himself, unable now to muster the consistent energy needed to build institutions of democracy. That leaves him occupying one of the most powerful presidential chairs in the world without the appetite or will to use its power in a way which will fully meet the challenges which press on him. From the Queen's point of view, the timing of the publication of Prince Charles's authorised biography has cast an unfortunate shadow over the beginning of her visit. That is not the only potential embarrassment. The last Tsar of Russia, Nicholas II, and the Tsarina Alexandra, both close relatives of the Queen's grandfather George V, were killed on Lenin's personal orders. Mr Yeltsin, in his Bolshevik period, levelled the house in Ekaterinburg where the Tsar's family met their deaths, in order to remove its potential as a shrine and presumably to advance his career. The bodies were buried in roadside graves from which they were exhumed only after the end of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: they have not yet been reburied, though are due to be, in the Peter and Paul Fortress in Petersburg, which the Queen will visit. The last Russian royal family is thus unlikely to come up as a subject of conversation between the toasts. Mr Charles Anson, the Queen's press secretary, said yesterday the issue had been discussed at diplomatic level but 'the question of the reburial of the Russian royal family and the Queen's visit are entirely separate issues'. Though President Yeltsin has made at different times before different audiences denunciations of communism and has apologised directly to the Japanese for Soviet treatment of their prisoners of war, he has not alluded publicly to the circumstances of the Tsar's death. Russia is not and perhaps cannot be a penitent nation as Germany has been. The British royal house also has a historical black spot which may inhibit it from pressing the matter. King George V, a man who professed Nicholas II to be a close friend as well as a relative and so like him physically as to seem in photographs more a twin than a cousin, personally refused the Tsar's family visas. Professor Dominic Lieven, in his biography of Nicholas, says 'the King  .took the lead in closing off the possibilities of asylum ..fearful of reaction from British socialists and the labour movement, King George did not want his dynasty to be associated in the public eye with the hated and now fallen Russian Tsar, let alone with his half-English wife.' Awkwardness of a different kind now attends Queen Elizabeth II as she, a British monarch, comes to Russia for the first time. Still, the visit of western Europe's most prominent constitutional monarch serves the purpose of highlighting President Yeltsin's crowning achievement. Like Mr Mikhail Gorbachev before him, he has realised, in what has been, for both men, the greatest test of their erratic but high courage, that it is not possible to take refuge for any length of time in the mailed fist. The process which Mr Yeltsin inherited from Mr Gorbachev roars on; he rules over it a little more than the Queen rules over her kingdom, but not much.</p>

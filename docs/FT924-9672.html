			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK government urged to rethink milk co-op plan THE UK GOVERNMENT was urged yesterday to think again before it went ahead with its plans to replace the statutory Milk Marketing Board with a single voluntary co-operative. Continuing his fierce opposition to the proposed reforms of the MMB, Mr Brian Smith, president of the Dairy Trade Federation, asked how a government that believed in free market competition could consider such legislation. 'What a recipe for a price explosion]' he told the DTF annual lunch in London. In a year when the regulatory bodies of other privatised industries had had to act to curb price increases, 'government is proposing to create a situation where a very dominant selling organisation of a product whose supply is fixed by quota is to have no regulatory checks and balances at all'. Mr David Curry, junior minister of agriculture, said the most important benefit of the reforms had been obscured by the 'hurly-burly of arguments for and against a single voluntary co-operative'. The fact was that the abolition of the MMB would mean that for the first time in 60 years producers would be free to sell their milk to whomever they wanted. 'It is a major liberalisation,' he said, adding that many individual producer would want to sell direct to dairy companies, while other producers would undertake joint marketing initiatives. He suggested that the DTF's regulatory fears were exaggerated. The MMB's successor would come under the full scrutiny of the European Commission as well as being 'subject to the full rigour of UK competition law'. At a later press conference Mr Smith said he had not been reassured by Mr Curry's remarks. DTF members were particularly worried about the proposed co-operative taking over all the MMB's assets apart from Dairy Crest, its wholly-owned dairy subsidiary, which is to be hived off. The concentration of assets in one co-op would not help the formation of other bodies, he suggested. Mr Curry pointed out that the agriculture ministry had been besieged by people clamouring to get out of the MMB rather than in. He would give no timetable fo the legislation, only saying that it would appear 'relatively soon'. But he stressed the importance of ending the statutory scheme before it collapse of its own accord.</p>

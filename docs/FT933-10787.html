			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / UK fears of redundancy rise despite drop in unemployment MORE THAN half of British workers fear they could lose their jobs over the next 12 months, the latest in a monthly series of MORI surveys published in the Financial Times today suggests. Fear of redundancy appears to have increased sharply over the past few weeks, despite five successive monthly falls in unemployment and government claims that economic recovery is under way. In May, 43 per cent of those questioned by MORI said they were either 'very concerned' or 'fairly concerned' about the possibility of being made redundant or becoming unemployed over the next 12 months. By July this had risen to 51 per cent. Those most anxious are males (55 per cent), full-time workers (53 per cent) and those living in the south (53 per cent). By social group, skilled manual workers feel the least secure, with 58 per cent worried about their future. Evidence of the public's deepening gloom about jobs is in sharp contrast to official pronouncement about a recovery. According to government figures published in mid-July, the number of people without jobs and claiming benefit fell by a seasonally-adjusted 7,600 in June to 2.91m. The unemployment figure was the lowest for eight months and coincided with the news that job vacancies notified to Jobcentres had climbed to their highest level for 2 1/2 years. The figures also showed overtime in May at its highest for nearly 12 months. The MORI survey, which has been tracking concern about unemployment since April, was commissioned by Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay and conditions research group. Mr David Martin, the group's editorial director, said: 'Business confidence is the key to Britain's sustained economic recovery. The latest IRS/MORI index shows that there is a significant and growing proportion of the workforce that does not have confidence in the future.' MORI interviewed 855 people aged 18 and over in full-time or part-time work, in their homes, across 147 constituency sampling points throughout Britain on July 22-26. Data were weighted to match the profile of the population. Details, Page 7 Strategy on jobs, Page 7 Consensus call, Page 14</p>

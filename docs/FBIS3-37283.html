Eighteen months of bitter power  struggle had brought Russia to the brink of civil war. Yeltsin  and Rybkin found themselves on different sides of the barricades.    A month ago 46-year-old Ivan Rybkin was elected speaker of  the Russian parliament's lower chamber and everyone expected  that the seemingly convinced communist, a member of the Agrarian  Party group in the State Duma, would immediately begin a  campaign of revenge against his political opponent in the  Kremlin and take every opportunity to make life difficult for  Yeltsin.    However, the reverse has happened. Most surprisingly Rybkin  has defended President Yeltsin in several critical situations in  the course of the first month of the new parliament. When  BERLINGSKE TIDENDE spoke to Ivan Rybkin here in Moscow at the  weekend it was natural to ask him about his relations with  President Yeltsin.    "On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the lifting of  the siege of Leningrad I stood by President Yeltsin's side in  Piskarev Cemetery in St. Petersburg where almost half a million  victims of the siege are buried. I saw how the tears ran down  the president's cheeks and at that moment I realized that more  than anything else Russia needs peace and calm and cooperation,"  said Rybkin, who is so busy trying to get cooperation with the  government and with President Yeltsin to work that he has become  unpopular among the ranks of his own party.    "The three times I have spoken to President Yeltsin the  conversations have been chiefly about the need for unity in  society. President Yeltsin and I are agreed that the political  forces in society must be consolidated, that the country needs  peace and quiet in which it can work. Without peace we cannot  continue the reforms," said Rybkin who comes from the southern  Russian region of Volgograd, where he trained as an engineer.    Rybkin talks so much about peace and quiet and cooperation  that many people view him with deep suspicion.    "Some people would like to see us coming to blows again, but  I have had the scent of civil war in my nostrils and the main  point of everything that I am doing now is about preventing a  repeat of the civil war which the country experienced in  1918-20."    Rybkin recalled a story by Soviet Russian author and Nobel  Prize winner Mikhail Shokolov which takes place during the civil  war after the revolution in 1917. Without realizing it an  elderly Bolshevik kills his own son who is fighting on the side  of the White rebel forces, and when he recognizes the birthmark  on his son's leg he shoots himself through the forehead.    "Russia will not survive such a confrontation again," the  speaker said emphatically and a quiver in his voice.    Rybkin said of himself that today he is as much a communist  as Boris Yeltsin, Mikhail Gorbachev, or Aleksandr Yakovlev. The  newly elected parlaimentary speaker described his own platform  as social democratic.    "Today President Yeltsin is the unifying political figure in  Russia. My own party or a similar party in the center of the  political spectrum could well become Yeltsin's political  platform. It is here that the sympathies of the emerging middle  class will lie, and it is obvious that every reformer must win  the support of the middle class."</p>

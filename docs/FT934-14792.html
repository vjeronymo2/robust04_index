			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Bell Atlantic to buy US cable company for Dollars 18bn: Deal with TCI set to transform telecommunications industry BELL ATLANTIC, the US regional telephone group, yesterday announced an agreement to buy Tele-Communications Inc, the largest American cable television company, for up to Dollars 18bn in a deal which will radically change the US communications industry. It will also be one of the country's biggest ever takeovers. The deal - which is bound to face strong regulatory scrutiny - would be the first full merger between a US telephone company and a cable business at a time when the two industries are converging to create a single, multi-media inter-active entertainment and information business. Bell Atlantic, the telecommunications group serving the middle part of America's eastern seaboard, has been one of the most aggressive telephone companies trying to enter the video industry. TCI, based in Denver, has been built up by Mr John Malone, its chief executive, over the past 20 years into a company serving some 20 per cent of cable homes. The share swap deal would also include Liberty Media, a cable programming company which TCI spun off in 1991. It announced plans to re-acquire the business last Friday. Yesterday's pact could have implications for the current takeover battle for entertainment group Paramount Communications. Liberty Media is an important shareholder in QVC Network, the home shopping channel headed by Mr Barry Diller, which is making a hostile Dollars 9.5bn bid for Paramount, in competition with a Dollars 7.5bn agreed bid from cable company Viacom. Analysts said the Bell Atlantic deal could help strengthen QVC's position. Mr Malone said yesterday that the QVC bid was peripheral to the Bell Atlantic deal, though he wished Mr Diller the best of luck and would personally do what he could to help him. Viacom, which has launched a legal suit trying to block the QVC bid because of Mr Malone's alleged 'monopolistic intentions' in the cable industry, yesterday called on Congress to 'take a hard look' at Mr Malone's record. Mr Raymond Smith, chairman of Bell Atlantic, yesterday hailed yesterday's agreement as a 'model for communications companies in the next century.' A letter of intent between the two groups calls for most of TCI and Liberty's assets to be merged into Bell Atlantic, apart from cable service companies owned in the region where Bell Atlantic is a telephone operator. These would be sold or spun off to shareholders separately. Under the 1984 cable act regional telecommunications companies are forbidden from buying cable companies in the area where they operate telephone services. The deal values TCI at Dollars 11.8bn, excluding the Liberty Media programming assets, which would be worth some Dollars 5bn to Dollars 6bn more if included in the takeover. Bell Atlantic would also take on some Dollars 9.6bn of debt. The approximate Dollars 28bn total compares with the Dollars 25bn value of the 1989 takeover of RJR Nabisco in a leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which also assumed some Dollars 4.5bn of debt.</p>

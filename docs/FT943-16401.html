			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / MoD admits failure on cost controls: RAF refurbishment to be probed The Ministry of Defence last night announced an independent investigation into how almost Pounds 400,000 was spent on refurbishing the official residence of Air Chief Marshal Sir Sandy Wilson. Mr Jeremy Hanley, minister for the armed services, said the total cost of Pounds 387,000 - Pounds 127,000 more than he indicated in March - implied a failure of the govern-ment's financial control system. In a reply to a question from Sir James Spicer, Dorset West, Mr Hanley said the external investigation would 'recommend appropriate action to ensure there is no repeat' of the spending which took place in the past two years. A further Pounds 9,000 was spent on routine maintenance. Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said: 'There appears to be one rule for the top brass, who get away with spending so much money on themselves, and another for the rest of the forces, many of whom are threatened with the sack.' The results of the defence-cost study, which started after the November Budget, is expected to lead to thousands of redundancies when it is announced in the next few weeks. The study is aimed at helping the ministry save about Pounds 1bn in its annual spending from the 1996-97 financial year. Labour fears it will lead to the loss of about 25,000 jobs. The MoD said an apparent failure of its financial control system could not be linked to the defence-cost study, which aimed at cutting costs without affecting the forces' effectiveness. Mr Clark said he feared a misuse of government funds in refurbishing official residences of other senior military officers. The government has set up a separate audit of expenditure on official residences to ensure that there are no other breaches of its financial control mechanisms.</p>

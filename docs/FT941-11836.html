			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Brussels steel plan faces collapse The European Commission's steel restructuring plan faced the prospect of collapse amid clear indications from private steelmakers that they are not prepared to offer much-needed capacity cuts, Mr Karel Van Miert, the EU competition commissioner, said yesterday. Referring to the unwillingness of private steelmakers to cut capacity, Mr Van Miert conceded: 'We cannot deliver the goods.' . Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr Van Miert said: 'I am very pessimistic about it.' He added that the absence of a single offer so far had forced 'a reassessment in the commission.' The commission plan requires cuts of 30m tonnes, about a quarter of EU steel output, in order to restore prices to economic levels. Under the plan, some 25m tonnes of capacity would be eliminated by private sector producers, 10.5m of them in voluntary cuts to be financed by the EU. Comm ission officials said last Friday that the European Commission and steelmakers would meet in Brussels to discuss capacity cuts on February 15. The deadline forproposals is March 21. Eurofer, the European steelmakers' lobby group, is scheduled to meet on February 12 to discuss a common strategy. Mr Van Miert said the commission had no intention of setting quotas. Private sectorproducers have complained that they are being asked to sacrifice more than state-owned producers. The most vocal complaints coming from the UK, Denmark and Germany. The German steel industry has indicated that no capacity cuts will be presented at the Brussels meeting. Germany's private steelmakers argue that the deal reached in December between the Commission and state-ownedsteel companies is grossly unfair to the private sector. The agreement offers DM11.5bn of subsidies to back 5m tonnes of capacity cuts at state-owned steel companies in Italy, Spain,Portugal and eastern Germany. Steel industry analysts said yesterday that the Italian industry ministry had only just begun to consider how the 500,000 tonnes of proposedcuts would come from the Italian private sector. In Italy, matters have been complicated by the government's decision to press ahead with the privatisation of Ilva, the state steel group.</p>

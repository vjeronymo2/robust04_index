However, it is now discussed in the  White House how North Korea can be forced to its knees. The  reasonable decision to cancel the Team Spirit maneuver will  probably be rescinded and Patriot missiles are to be sent on a  journey.    In former times, Kennedy had the Cuban crisis and Bush had  Kuwait. Clinton sticks to the K's [German spelling of Cuba is  with a K], while, of course, issues other than only Korea are  also at stake.    The trip by the U.S. secretary of state to East Asia was not  precisely a success. Exactly for that reason, it cannot hurt to  demonstrate to this region, above all to Beijing, that  Washington can show its teeth. This crisis is also good for  domestic use: The gossip about Clinton's Whitewater affair is  far too lustful. It is high time that topics of conversation  are imported.    At present, the favorite opponent in the Middle East is of  little use. First of all, it has to be forgotten that for  almost one month Washington prevented the Security Council from  commenting on the Hebron massacre. In the Balkans, ownerless  planes that can be destroyed cannot be found every day. In  Central America the United States is cutting such a figure with  its policy toward Haiti that it is better for everyone not to  look there.    Thus, what remains? Old Kim with his bomb, which perhaps  does not exist at all. A rigid regime, which has been driven to  the wall, is boasting as if it were a superpower, precisely at  the right time, so that Clinton can save the world -- in a way  that will only result in an escalation of everything if prudence  does not soon prevail.    Well, Clinton pretends to be Kennedy. It is true that now  the opponent is many numbers smaller, but it is Bill who is  acting. And if a fire breaks out, he will be big enough.</p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE FIRMS PLAN TO REDUCE OUTPUT OF KEY COMPUTER CHIPS  </P> <P> Leading Japanese semiconductor makers said Tuesday that they plan 10% to 15%  cuts in production of key 1-megabit memory chips because of falling prices and  lower demand.  </P> <P> Demand for 1-megabit dynamic random-access memory chips, or DRAMs, has fallen  in recent months, in large part because of stagnant sales of personal computers  in the United States, company officials said.  </P> <P> A 1-megabit chip, currently a mainstay of the computer industry, can store  about 1 million binary units of information, the equivalent of about four  newspaper pages.  </P> <P> An official at NEC Corp., the world's largest semiconductor maker, said his  company has decided to reduce production from 6 million chips to about 5  million a month in the first quarter of this year.  </P> <P> "With the price for a 1-megabit DRAM falling from around $24 last summer to  $9.70 today, NEC has decided to downshift production," he said.  </P> <P> Although computer sales in Japan have remained stronger than in the United  States, prices of 1-megabit DRAMs also have fallen here, to about $10.50 from  $14.  </P> <P> The semiconductor industry is known for its sharp business cycles. During a  1985-86 industry recession, Japanese makers, suffering from overcapacity, lost  an estimated $4 billion and began a series of price cuts that led to charges of  dumping overseas.  </P> <P> An Oki Electric official said his company plans to reduce its production of  1-megabit DRAMs this quarter from 3.5 million chips to fewer than 3 million  chips a month.  </P> <P> Hitachi's production has fallen from 4 million chips to about 3.8 million chips  a month, while Mitsubishi Electric's monthly production has fallen from about 5  million chips to between 4 million and 4.5 million chips, company officials  said. A Hitachi official said further cuts were possible if the market  continues to weaken.  </P> <P> Fujitsu officials declined to comment on their production plans.  </P></p>

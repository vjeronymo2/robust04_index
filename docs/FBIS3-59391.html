The improvement in the financial situation  contributed to the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of  the national economy.    Increase in the money release slowed down. In the  first half of the year, because of the overly rapid increase in  investment, large amounts of money were released continually. In  the first half of the year the net money release amounted to  52.8 billion yuan, representing an increase of 55 billion yuan  over the same period last year. With the implementation of  macroeconomic regulation and control measures, the situation of  excessive money release improved on a monthly basis after the  beginning of July. In July-September the cumulative net money  release amounted to 21 billion yuan, representing a decrease of  19.2 billion yuan from the same period last year. The main  reason was the increase in the credit and commodity recovery  capacities. Consumption funds increased in a calm manner.    Urban and rural savings deposits increased  significantly, thereby providing stable sources of funds for  banks' support of economic development. In  January-September the net growth in urban and rural savings  deposits amounted to 232.1 billion yuan, representing an  increase which was 57.6 billion yuan larger than the same period  last year. In this respect, the third quarter saw an increase of  107.7 billion yuan, an increase which was 66.6 billion yuan  larger than the same period last year. The main reason was that  the central bank substantially raised the interest rate for  deposits twice, thereby arousing residents' enthusiasm for  savings; in this way residents' savings deposits which had  declined for a time grew again, thereby stabilizing banks'  savings sources.    State banks increased their credit supply, thereby  forcefully helping satisfy the key needs of the development of  the national economy. In the first half of this year bank  lending of various types increased by only 99.3 billion yuan,  representing an increase which was 36.3 billion yuan smaller  than the same period last year. In the third quarter, after the  banks adopted measures "to eliminate irregular practices and  open legitimate channels," the People's Bank of China issued  100.8 billion yuan in loans to specialized banks; over the same  period state banks' loans of various types to enterprises grew  by 100.3 billion yuan, representing an increase which was nearly  30 billion yuan larger than the third quarter of last year.  Those funds were mainly used to satisfy the funding needs of the  state's key construction projects and produced good results.    Specialized banks' disbursement funds grew rapidly,  thereby alleviating payment difficulties. After the  beginning of July, the situation where specialized banks'  disbursement fund rate was lower the legally required  disbursement fund rate was changed through cleaning up  inter-bank loans in violation of regulations and vigorous  efforts to secure deposits. By the end of September specialized  banks' disbursement fund rate had exceeded 7 percent, and banks  at various levels had increased their payment capacity.    The state's foreign exchange reserves increased.  At the end of September the state's foreign exchange reserves  totalled $19.62 billion, representing an increase which was  $3.617 billion smaller than the same period last year; but the  rate of decline was lower. The amount of foreign exchange  reserves represented an increase of $177 million over the end of  last year, thereby changing the situation of net decline in the  previous several months. The RMB exchange rates were stable and  kept at a basically proper level, thereby providing a good  environment for foreign trade.    Since the beginning of the third quarter our country's macro  financial control has produced results, and financial operations  are getting normal; the financial disorder which existed for a  time has been resolved. The trends toward overly rapid increases  in investment and prices have been suppressed. In carrying out  macro financial control in the period to come, we must both  consolidate the results achieved and create conditions for the  various important reforms to be carried out by the state next  year, so as to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy.</p>

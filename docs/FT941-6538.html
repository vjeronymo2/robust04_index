			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Active buying returned to stock index futures yesterday, encouraged by a more favourable outlook on interest rates, a firm Wall Street and a positive mood in UK gilts, writes Joel Kibazo. The opening trade in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at a firm 3,282 and the contract moved steadily forward, with most of the early demand coming from US houses such as Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs. US houses were among last week's big sellers. A firm Wall Street boosted demand in the afternoon and March reached a peak of 3,327, before coming off the top to finish at 3,319, a 3-point discount to cash. Volume was a reduced 12,657 lots. In the new FT-SE Mid 250 futures contract, March closed at 3,964 on volume of 282 contracts, against last Friday's debut turnover of 617 lots. On the rival OMLX, a mere 29 deals were registered in the same contract as it finished at 3,966. In traded options, total volume came to 32,212 contracts, of which 10,644 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,014 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. Lasmo was the most active stock option with 2,534 lots traded, followed by Blue Circle with 1,525 and Lonrho at 1,467.</p>

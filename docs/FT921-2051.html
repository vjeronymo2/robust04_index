			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Flexible bets - Ballot Box Labour has regained the higher ground not only in some opinion polls, but also among City dealers. City Index, a small firm which makes markets in sporting events and has offered a price for the past two elections, quoted Labour as ahead for the first time on Tuesday. The party fell back on Wednesday, but nudged into the lead yesterday with a quoted bid/offer price of 302-309 against the Conservatives' 300-307. Punters pay an agreed price per point and will recover that price for every seat above the offer price. The aim is to offer more flexibility than the ordinary bookmaker without the downside of betting tax.</p>

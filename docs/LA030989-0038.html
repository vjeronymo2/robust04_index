			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: NEWSWEEK'S SCRAMBLE TO SCOOP TIME  </P> <P> Newsweek may be behind in its circulation and ad war with Time, but Newsweek  editor Maynard Parker is gloating that his magazine was ahead of Time Inc.'s  entire stable of publications on one of the hottest business stories of the  year: the pending merger of Time Inc. with Warner Communications Inc., an  $18-billion deal that would create America's largest media and entertainment  conglomerate.  </P> <P> Newsweek's staff was preparing to put the current issue to bed when the story  broke on Saturday, Parker said. But because they had kept up with the ongoing  merger rumors, "when the first flash came over the ticker at 2 or 2:30 on  Saturday, we were ready to roll."  </P> <P> "Obviously, we weren't scooped by our own competitor," said Edward Adler,  spokesman for Time Inc., which owns, among other enterprises, a huge assortment  of popular and special interest magazines as well as a book publishing  division, cable television companies and the Home Box Office programming  corporation.  </P> <P> "Historically, when there's big news about Time Inc. . . . it is covered in the  'Editor's Notes' or 'Publisher's Notes' columns" of the various publications,  he said.  </P> <P> So, while Newsweek slipped the story into its current issue -- dated March 13  -- Time Inc.'s coverage will start with the March 20 edition of People. The  company's other major periodicals -- from Time, Life, Fortune and Money to  Sports Illustrated -- will follow suit as they are published, Adler said.  </P> <P> "I think any news magazine worth its salt has to publish what is certainly one  of the biggest business stories of the week," Parker countered. "To ignore the  story seems to me to be short changing your reader."  </P> <P> In covering the story, Newsweek -- which last year had an average worldwide  base circulation of about 4 million to Time's 5.6 million, and $242 million in  advertising revenues compared to Time's $336.6 million -- couldn't resist a few  easy shots.  </P> <P> "The deal raises intriguing issues in the corporate office, like how Time's  publications will review Warner films," the article states. "Magazines will  also lose their traditional place as the flagship and 'soul' of the 66-year-old  company," the story continues. With the merger, Time becomes "a television  company -- period," the editor of the trade publication Channels observes.  </P> <P> "That's not true at all," Adler said. "Warner doesn't have magazines, per se,  and we're not going to change the way we run ours because of this."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unaffected by Merger  </P> <P> Time Inc. staffers have been assured that the magazine divisions will be  unaffected by the merger, Adler said, quoting from a memo written by Time  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer J. Richard Munro: "The traditional  integrity and independence of Time Inc.'s journalistic voice will be a  cornerstone of Time Warner Inc. And that voice will continue to make a  difference to America and the world."  </P> <P> As for the matter of reviewing Warner films, he said: "For years Time magazine  and People magazine have reviewed (Home Box Office) product. Sometimes they  praise it and sometimes they pan it. . . . They're under no orders what to  write about HBO and they certainly wouldn't be about Warner product."  </P> <P> With the merger, Newsweek's Parker expects "magazines will play less of a role  than they once did (at Time Inc.)." But he doesn't foresee any lessening of  competition between the two publications.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, while Newsweek took the lead in reporting the merger, Lester  Bernstein -- a former Newsweek editor who once wrote for Time -- presaged the  event in a well-timed cover story on Feb. 26 for the New York Times magazine.  </P> <P> Without detailing merger possibilities, he analyzed Time Inc.'s prospects in  the era of "megatakeovers," and pointed to some apparent ironies regarding  Time's place in the current market.  </P> <P> For Time founder Henry Luce, journalism always came first, Bernstein writes,  citing Luce's well-known dictum that in his empire, there would be an absolute  line separating the "church" of journalism from the "state" of the publishing  business.  </P> <P> So Luce often resisted diversification, Bernstein writes. "Once he scornfully  rejected a deal to buy a movie studio, something for which the company now  hungers. If he had to invest in leisure, he jeered in his memo of rejection, he  might consider horse and dog racing 'but I would exclude the service of  anesthetizing people by TV.' "  </P> <P> Merger or not, Time Inc.'s magazines seem to have lost track of the "higher  calling" founder Henry Luce envisioned, he writes. "Magazines like People, the  most profitable in the world . . . are journalistic voices whose independence  is largely irrelevant. And even Time, the venerable flagship of the  corporation, is now part of a national chorus of daily papers and newsweeklies  in which its once brassy voice is harder to distinguish."  </P> <P> Louis J. Slovinsky, vice president of corporate communications for Time Inc.,  dismissed the former Newsweek editor's comments. "You have to consider where  the author is coming from," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reason Plans a New Era  </P> <P> Robert Poole, editor and publisher of Reason magazine, thinks his publication,  which has trumpeted a laissez-faire credo for 20 years, is entitled to at least  a little credit for the climate of merger mania that deregulation has helped  engender.  </P> <P> But Reason, which moved from the backwater bliss of Santa Barbara to Santa  Monica in 1986 to increase its visibility, is still working to build clout and  thereby advance its libertarian ideals, Poole said.  </P> <P> To an extent, achieving that goal will depend on who replaces current  editor-in-chief Marty Zupan, who's moving on to a new job at the Institute for  Humane Studies at George Mason University in Virginia.  </P> <P> The competition has been whittled down to five contenders, Poole said: the  magazine's associate editor; the vice president of the libertarian-oriented  Cato Institute in Washington; a fellow at the Hoover Institute; another at a  Washington think tank, and a journalist with "a big-city Western newspaper."  </P> <P> What he's looking for, Poole said, is someone with "a vision for the magazine  for the next 10 years. We want to put Reason more into the mainstream of the  discussion of ideas in this country. We'd like to have Reason be as much of a  participant as the New Republic and National Review."  </P> <P> With that in mind, he asked candidates to complete "long written exercises,"  spelling out what the magazine's goals should be, and addressing tricky issues  such as abortion, Central America and nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> "The approach I'm looking for is more along the lines of the way New Republic  deals with issues -- create a large tent and allow a number of acts to go on  within that tent," he said. Editorial content would naturally "allow for  individual liberty, free enterprise and limited government." But it wouldn't  "necessarily adhere to a rigid party line."  </P> <P> To gain the sort of influence it covets, Reason will have to double its  circulation, from the current 30,000 figure -- which puts it at "the low end of  the think-magazine scale, alongside magazines like the American Spectator,"  Poole said.  </P> <P> "There's a natural audience out there that is not really represented by any of  the other think magazines. It's the people who are economically conservative,  and socially liberal or tolerant," he said.  </P> <P> Even with the 60,000 to 70,000 circulation that Poole envisions, the nonprofit  Reason would still be a pipsqueak among the giant magazines of which  megamergers are made.  </P> <P> But Poole has no qualms about the trend toward the big getting  </P> <P> bigger. Lawmakers such as Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, who has asked the Justice  Department to look into the antitrust implications of the Time-Warner merger,  are guilty of "typical political meddling," he said. "This small-minded  populism is a terrible barrier to American firms and what they're up against on  a global scale."  </P> <P> Liberal fears about the concentration of media power in fewer and fewer  corporate hands are unfounded, Poole believes.  </P> <P> "I don't think the hands are that few," he added. "When you have as open a  market as we have, with people able to start community newspapers and the  diversity of radio stations, I don't think there's any problem with viewpoints  getting expressed. . . ."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Marriage East and West  </P> <P> The constitution of the Soviet Union "guarantees that the state will bear  responsibility for the well-being of the family," Woman's Day magazine reported  last October, in an article accompanying a survey distributed simultaneously to  women in the Soviet Union and the United States.  </P> <P> Responding to the 17-question survey were 200,000 Russians and 30,000  Americans. But judging from the results, families are in trouble regardless of  where they reside, or who is responsible for their well-being.  </P> <P> Among the findings, to be published in a future issue of Woman's Day:  </P> <P>  -- 65% of the women in both countries responded "no" to the question, "Would  you like a daughter of yours to repeat your life experiences?"  </P> <P>  -- 79% of Soviet women and 43% of American women said alcohol was a major  cause of divorce.  </P> <P> Given the opportunity to complete the phrase, "A good husband should be," with  three of 16 choices, Soviet women voted for "faithful" and "a good head of the  family" (56% each), while manliness came in third with 27% of the vote.  </P> <P> On the other hand, 73% of American women want a husband who is "communicative "  and 72% want one who is "emotionally supportive." "Faithfulness" came in third  at 63%.  </P> <P> Eighty-eight percent of American women don't feel that society adequately  values the work they do at home, as compared to 45% of urban and 29% of rural  Soviet women.  </P> <P> As a press release on the survey points out: "28% of the Soviet women, who have  had state-financed day care for decades, believe their salvation lies in more  consumer goods while a comparable 24% of American women, who have had consumer  goods for decades, believe their salvation lies in day care centers!"  </P></p>

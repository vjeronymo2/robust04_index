			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Observer: Figure that Those who suspect accountants love paperwork will not be surprised to learn that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales may expand its already unwieldy council by a further 10 bodies, making a total of 70 elected members; it also has up to 20 co-opted members. The same council has also just ratified an increase in subsistence, bringing it up to Pounds 37 a day and Pounds 90 a night for attendance at council and committee meetings. Nice work if you can get it; and more and more are, it seems.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / People: Scotland's latest press baron Scotland has a new newspaper tycoon. Ian Macpherson, who takes over the chairmanship of Caledonian Newspaper Publishing this week, will head a company which publishes The Herald, Scotland's leading quality daily, and the Glasgow Evening Times, the UK's fifth largest evening paper. The 56-year-old Macpherson, an accountant by training, is keen to play down the idea that he will behave like a traditional newspaper proprietor. He describes himself as a professional chairman and points out that since he lives in St Andrews, 100 miles from Caledonian's Glasgow HQ, he will not be continually popping in to host lunches and interfere in editorial management. Caledonian, a Pounds 74m management buy-out from Lonrho in May, has been looking for a new chairman to take over from the veteran journalist Kenneth Harris. Liam Kane, Caledonia's chief executive, says that Caledonian's backers, which include several well known Scottish financial institutions, were looking for a 'financial exit' over the next three to five years and wanted a chairman with good City connections. Being a Scotsman clearly helped, but Macpherson describes himself as more a 'cousin' of Scotland's so-called 'financial mafia' than a fully-fledged 'brother'. He has spent a large part of his career south of the border after qualifying with Peat Marwick and Dundee's Alliance Trust. He was a partner of W Greenwell, the London stockbrokers, and opened Manufacturers Hanover Trust's Scottish operation. In 1979, he joined the British Linen Bank and rose to be deputy chief executive. He is currently chairman and chief executive of Watson &amp; Philip, Britain's third largest food distributor, and non-executive chairman of Low &amp; Bonar, a packaging and paper group. He also sits on the board of the London Stock Exchange. Macpherson sees his role at Caledonian as making sure that it meets its financial targets. However, the combination of the financial constraints of the MBO and the recession are bound to result in 'stressful conditions' and Macpherson sees an important part of his task as being a 'great encourager of people'. Meanwhile, at the other end of the country, the fifth generation of a provincial newspaper dynasty has started to appear. Kenelm Storey, 29, has been appointed a non-executive director of Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers which is headed by his father Sir Richard Storey. Kenelm, who is general manager of The Guardian International, is the fifth generation of the family to be involved in the business which was started by Samuel Storey in 1873. Like his father, who joined the board at the age of 25, Kenelm is a Wykehamist. ***** The top guard at Low &amp; Bonar is changing. Walter Telfer, 56, a former deputy group chief executive and currently head of international operations, is retiring at the end of December to pursue other personal and business interests. He joined Low &amp; Bonar in 1975 and for the past two years has been chairman of its North American packaging and plastics operations. His departure will coincide with the retirement of Roland Jarvis, 59, chief executive for the past eight years. Jim Leng, 46, chief executive of European operations, will take over from Jarvis as group chief executive on December 1. ***** Richard Stillwell, golf fanatic and chief executive of Imperial Chemical Industries' paints operations in the Asia Pacific, is forsaking the delights of Singapore's luscious golf courses for the watering holes of Brussels. He is moving to Belgium as managing director of ICI's polyurethanes business, part of ICI materials division. The move follows Robb Margetts elevation to the main board of ICI from his position as chief executive of the Tioxide group. Stillwell's predecessor at polyurethanes, Alan Pedder, is promoted to Margetts' job. He is swapping Brussels for Hammersmith, a less than exotic part of west London. ***** David Carter, 40, general manager finance of ICI Specialties, has joined ICI's eight-year-old corporate acquisitions team headed by 49-year-old John Dewhurst. Carter, who has worked on the financial side of ICI since joining in 1979, is the fifth member of a small team which was set up by Sir Denys Henderson, ICI's current chairman. Whereas many big companies use outside merchant banks to vet potential acquisitions, ICI is of such a size that it can justify its own in-house team. The team advises the ICI board on acquisitions, mergers and divestments, particularly on aspects such as scale, resources, merits and priorities. Since it was established, the unit has examined over 2,000 companies and been involved in 300 transactions. Probably the best known of the executives who have passed through the ICI acquisitions team is David Nash, Grand Metropolitan's current finance director. After 12 years with ICI, Nash was appointed group finance director of Cadbury Schweppes in 1987 before joining GrandMet in December 1989.</p>

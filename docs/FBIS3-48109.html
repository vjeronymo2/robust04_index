The masses were attended by monks of the temples, believers  and clergymen from the Central Committee of the Korean Buddhists  Federation and its provincial, city and county committees.    The preachers said that in order to realise the idea of  "getting rid of the pain and attaining happiness," the basic  idea of Buddhists, it was imperative to reunify the country at  an early date.    They stressed that the country should be reunified in the  form of a confederation and the best way to it was to implement  "10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for  the reunification of the country" laid down by respected  President Kim Il-song.    They called on all the Buddhists in the North, South and  overseas to closely unite with each other under the banner of  great national unity and make a tangible contribution to the  cause of national reunification, thus achieving the  reunification in the '90s without fail.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Matsushita set to launch Dollars 1bn global bond offering MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial, the world's largest consumer electronics maker, will launch a Dollars 1bn global bond offering in July. The issue will be the first global offering by a private company, and will be launched on US and European markets. Matsushita will use the funds raised to repay part of the debt related to the acquisition of MCA, the US film company. Matsushita's decision comes at a time when an increasing number of Japanese companies are dipping into the straight bond markets. Equity-linked financing has virtually halted due to the prolonged slump of the Tokyo stock market. Japanese banks are reluctant to increase aggressively its loan balances due to capital adequacy standards set by the Basle committee of central bank regulators, which must be met by the end of March next year. The company's announcement follows the Dollars 1bn Eurobond issue by Toyota Motor, the Japanese automobile group, launched on Wednesday. Toyota is one of several Japanese companies which must refinance maturing equity-linked bonds issued at the height of the Tokyo stock market boom in the late 1980s. During the last fiscal year to March, domestic corporate bond issues by Japanese companies rose 3.3 times from two years ago to Y2,426.7bn, while overseas issues increased by 3.5 times to Y3,877.1bn. Matsushita said it was not concerned about oversupply, since investors remained keen to buy triple-A rated paper. The company reckoned that there was large demand from investors wanting an exposure to Japanese blue chip companies, but wary of equity investment against the background of the weak Tokyo market. Matsushita said the maturity of the issue would be 7 to 10 years. It said soundings of interest among investors would begin as soon as registration procedures with the US Securities and Exchange Commission were completed.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Alitalia to cut 3,500 jobs Italy's state airline plans to cut up to 3,500 office and ground staff jobs in the next four years as part of a rescue package, trade union officials said yesterday. They said Alitalia, which lost Dollars 200m last year and a further Dollars 110m in the first three months of 1994, aimed to lose 1,500 jobs by the end of 1995 and the rest by 1997. At present, the group employs 20,000 people. A management report to the company's unions this week depicted the airline as heavily overstaffed and its structure as too bureaucratic and rigid. The managing director Mr Roberto Schisano has said the airline is in such bad shape that without drastic action Alitalia had only 500 days to live. 'The plan has a logic to it,' said Angelo Braggio, national secretary of the FIT-CISL trades union. 'To leave things as they are would quite simply lead to the airline being liquidated.' In return for backing the plan, unions want the state to guarantee a loan of nearly Dollars 1bn to recapitalise the airline.</p>

It  was chaired by Minister of Defense General of the Army of  Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy. The state program for the building  and development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was reviewed. The  members of the collegium analyzed the long-term plan for the  building of the Ukrainian military--the three stages of which  are planned to conclude in the year 2000--proceeding from the  provisions of the law "The Defense of Ukraine" and the military  doctrine of the state. That program will be submitted, after its  refinement, for the consideration of the State Defense Council.    Also considered was the question of measures for further  improvements in the training of skilled personnel at military  educational institutions. It was noted that the work on the  reformation of the system of military education in Ukraine has  been carried out with insufficient preparation and with a whole  series of mistakes. All of these errors have been taken into  account, and a system of measures has been developed to promote  improvements in the training of military personnel.    Representatives of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and  scientists took part in the work of the collegium.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Asprey and Mallett talks end ASPREY, the USM-quoted jeweller, has ended its takeover discussions with Mallett, the Mayfair-based antiques dealer. Mallett confirmed in December that it had received a takeover approach. Although it did not identify its suitor, the announcement came shortly after Asprey's chief executive, Mr Naim Attallah, confirmed that his company had acquired a 6.8 per cent equity stake in Mallett 'for investment purposes.' Yesterday Mallett announced that the talks had been terminated. It is understood that the two sides could not agree on a price. In its statement yesterday, Mallett, noted that at the time of the approach its interim results had shown a pre-tax loss of Pounds 485,000 (Pounds 680,000 profit) in the six months to June 30 and Mallett directors had passed the interim dividend. At that stage the group had said that trading was extremely difficult in all areas of the group, partly because of the strength of sterling. The full year results will be announced later this month, but the company said yesterday that the fine art market improved significantly in the final quarter of 1992 after the value of sterling slumped. As a result, Mallett made a profit in its second half and will announce pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 500,000 for the full year. In addition, Mallett said its borrowings, which reached Pounds 2.3m at one stage last year, had been eliminated and that it ended the year with net cash which should enable it to pay a 2p final dividend. The company statement added that although it was too soon to forecast the outcome for 1993, trading results so far showed a continued improvement compared with last year. Mallett's share price closed 2p lower at 68p.</p>

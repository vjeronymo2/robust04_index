			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / MURRAY WEIDENBAUM: SETTING PRIORITIES FOR BUDGET  CUTS  </P> <P> President Bush seems sincerely determined to avoid a tax increase. But unless  he leads a new effort to cut federal spending, the pressure to reduce the  deficit via new tax proposals may overwhelm his resolve.  </P> <P> There is an ambivalence -- likely quite unintentional -- in the Bush  Administration's action to date on the two sides of the budget. When the  subject of revenues comes up, the President is the solid conservative anxious  to avoid increasing the proportion of the national income flowing through the  federal Treasury.  </P> <P> But when the spending side of the budget comes up, a much more liberal -- some  would say "enlightened" -- George Bush comes to the fore. Of course, increases  in federal appropriations for fighting acid rain, homelessness, illiteracy,  savings and loan bankruptcies and nuclear waste are all worthy undertakings.  </P> <P> But expanding such outlays increases the gap between federal revenues and  expenditures. Identifying new priorities is only the first and easiest step in  reordering budget priorities. The process is not complete, however, until the  second and more difficult action is taken -- cutting back programs that are to  be assigned lower priority.  </P> <P> Virtually all who have examined the details of the federal budget -- be they  Republicans, Democrats or independents -- conclude that many things on which  the federal government spends money are not worth the cost. These marginal  items benefit individual localities, specific industries or particular interest  groups. That is why they are in the budget. But, from the viewpoint of the  nation as a whole, they are a poor investment.  </P> <P> Budget cutting should be guided by two principles: fairness and effectiveness.  To be fair, it should be very broadly based. An old Budget Bureau adage comes  to mind: Good budgeting is the uniform distribution of dissatisfaction. No  federal department or agency should be off limits to the budget cutter.  </P> <P> The second principle is based on the fact that America competes in an  increasingly global marketplace. Government spending is now dominated by  outlays that promote consumption. Very small portions of the federal budget are  devoted to investment. A new budget restraint effort should focus on cutting  items that do not promote a stronger economy.  </P> <P> On the basis of these two principles, we can identify numerous candidates for  budget cutting. Because conservatives are often criticized for beginning their  search for budget cuts with Social Security, Medicare, and other  "entitlements," let us save them for last.  </P> <P> We can start by identifying low-priority subsidies to business. This notion  will shock some conservatives who always assume that the term subsidies must be  preceded by the word farm. The fact is that a variety of federal agencies award  credit subsidies to a relatively few lucky enterprises.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cut Selective Subsidies  </P> <P> Government credit is provided at interest rates below those that the Treasury  pays for the money it borrows -- and often substantially lower than the  interest rates charged to unsubsidized borrowers (the rest of us). Federal  agencies providing these goodies include the Rural Electrification  Administration (which has run out of farmers who do not have electricity), the  Export-Import Bank (which subsidizes foreign companies competing against  American firms), the Small Business Administration (which picks lucky smaller  companies) and the Department of Commerce (which picks larger firms).  </P> <P> Agricultural price supports, a multibillion-dollar annual drain on the  Treasury, are justified by the plight of the family farm. However, most of the  benefits of the Agriculture Department's largess go to the largest, wealthiest  farmers. Supporting farm prices gives special advantage to the largest farms  whose low costs arise from economies of scale.  </P> <P> Another candidate for budget cutting is subsidies awarded by the Department of  Labor, such as those provided by the Davis-Bacon Act. A vestige of the Great  Depression, this law increases the cost of government construction projects by  setting a floor under, rather than a ceiling over, costs. It requires the  secretary of labor to determine the level of construction wage rates that  "prevail" in the area of any government-financed project. The government can  award contracts only to companies that pay those "prevailing" wages.  </P> <P> The Department of Labor has been known to use the Pittsburgh area's high wage  levels to set the standard for rural Appalachia. Ditto for using Boston's high  levels in rural Maine. Where the department does not have its own data, it has  used union wage scales.  </P> <P> No analysis of budget cutting would be complete without special attention to  the Pentagon. The truly large examples of waste do not include the hammer  purchased for $125 but are the multimillion-dollar weapons that Congress  regularly adds to the military budget in order to favor the constituencies of a  few powerful members. Paying retirement benefits to healthy 38-year-olds is an  example of both fiscal and economic waste. So is the congressional requirement  for the military to do the equivalent of "carrying coals to Newcastle." Our  European bases are required to stockpile U.S.-mined coal even though the local  product is much cheaper.  </P> <P> We have saved the biggest targets for budget cuts for last -- the entitlements.  This category is supported by arguably the most politically powerful group in  Washington -- the American Assn. of Retired People. Although howls of outrage  are heard every time the point is made, public policy treats senior citizens  better than "junior citizens." The average worker is not fully protected  against inflation, but every Social Security recipient is. Adjusting benefits  by less than the full cost of living -- a "diet" COLA (cost of living  allowance) would save the Treasury billions.  </P> <P> The typical Social Security recipient did not pay for the bulk of his or her  monthly check (even when the employer contribution is included, plus interest).  The largest part of the monthly benefit is a gift from the working generation.  Like other gifts, it should be fully taxable. If it were, low-income Social  Security recipients would not pay any federal income tax, but middle and upper  income beneficiaries would.  </P> <P> The potential budget cuts presented here are meant to whet the appetite for a  tough-minded review of all federal spending. So long as the federal budget  remains a mechanism for converting private investment into publicly sponsored  consumption, tax increases are hardly the desirable response to our budget  deficit woes.  </P></p>

Our reporter Mario Espinoza has some information:    [Begin recording] [Espinoza] The executive branch believes  the negative U.S. Government report on drug enforcement in  Bolivia focuses on the first part of 1993. Social  Communications Minister Ernesto Machicado has said the report  contains positive aspects. He added that during its 1993  electoral campaign, Bolivia indisputably failed to fulfill its  commitments to the U.S. Government.    [Machicado] I would like to underscore three aspects. First,  the United States will continue to cooperate with Bolivia--be it  in drug enforcement or in any other area where cooperation  exists. Everything will remain the same, there will be no change.    Second, the U.S. Embassy in Bolivia states that coca  eradication was delayed entirely due to the administration of  former President Jaime Paz Zamora, especially during the  electoral campaign. Prior to the 1993 elections, the former  Patriotic Accord administration decided to stop coca eradication  efforts in the Chapare region basically for political and  electoral reasons.    The third aspect is that the U.S. report clearly  acknowledges  the efforts of the current administration which has led to the  arrest of several drug bosses and the breaking up of large drug  rings.

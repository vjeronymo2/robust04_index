			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> SPENCER IN HURRY TO GET BACK INTO PLAYING FORM  </P> <P> Running back Tim Spencer practiced Wednesday with the Chargers for the first  time since he was released during exhibition season. Spencer was signed Tuesday  to replace running back Joe Mickles, who was put on injured reserve because of  a quadriceps injury he sustained in Sunday's loss to Seattle.  </P> <P> "I've got to get in shape real quick, like in about two or three more days,"  said Spencer, who played for the Chargers from 1985-89. "I've been doing some  things but there's a difference when you're running full speed on your own  versus trying to run full speed against somebody who's been running full speed  for 10 weeks."  </P> <P> Coach Dan Henning likes what he sees so far.  </P> <P> "He looks fine for a real estate salesman," Henning said.  </P> <P> Tight end Arthur Cox, who has refused to talk to reporters since his two costly  fumbles in Sunday's game, broke his silence Wednesday.  </P> <P> Briefly.  </P> <P> Cox was listed on the Charger injury report with a thigh bruise. Asked if he  had a minute to talk, he said: "I'm in a rush."  </P> <P> And the injury?  </P> <P> "It's a bruise. It's nothing I can't play with this week."  </P> <P> The Chargers rushed for a season-high 224 yards in the first meeting with the  Jets, a 39-3 Charger victory. Henning said that wasn't particularly  significant.  </P> <P> "The inordinate amount of yardage is the fact that we got ahead in the game and  we were able to run the ball more," he said. "Our yards per carry are about the  same in that game as they have been in other games."  </P> <P> Quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver said the Chargers changed the use of their tight  ends in that game, which helped open up the running attack.  </P> <P> Linebackers Junior Seau (ankle/groin) and Billy Ray Smith (elbow) are listed as  questionable on the Charger injury report, but Henning expects both to play.  </P> <P> Jet injuries: Linebacker Joe Kelly (knee) is out; guard Mike Haight (toe) is  doubtful; defensive end Jeff Lageman (arm) is questionable.  </P> <P> The approximate number of tickets distributed for Sunday's game is 44,000,  according to Jack Teele, assistant to the president. Teele said the game will  not be a sellout, which means it will not be televised locally. DON PATTERSON  </P></p>

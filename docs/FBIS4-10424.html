			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 Apr (PL)--Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina on 9 April gave an account here of the progress  made in his country's process of opening to foreign capital  investment. Robaina also spoke of the bustling international  activity in Cuba and asked for solidarity against the economic  blockade imposed by the United States over three decades ago.    In that regard, Robaina asked for international solidarity  in  light of this pressure tactic, which it considers unjust.  Robaina reiterated Havana's willingness to discuss any topic  with the United States so long as no strings are attached.    Following a meeting with Guido Di Tella, his Argentine  counterpart, Robaina said that he had informed Di Tella of the  economic measures Havana has implemented as well as the steps it  is taking toward integration with Latin America and the  Caribbean.    Robaina also spoke to Di Tella about Cuba's criteria for the  democratization process of the United Nations; the preparations  for the upcoming Ibero-American summit in Cartagena, Colombia;  and a presidential summit called by Washington at the end of  1994.    Robaina, who is here on an official visit on 13 and 14  April,  made a stop in Buenos Aires as part of a tour that began in  Uruguay and will continue with Peru and Paraguay.    Robaina gave a news conference following his one-hour  meeting  with Di Tella and said that Cuba and Argentina are living in a  "new phase with a smoother communication."    Commenting that Cuban-Argentine relations "have overcome  difficulties," he pointed out that "the things both nations have  in common are stronger."    Cuba is currently opening to the investment of foreign  capital. That, he emphasized, is of great interest to Argentina  and its businessmen.    Regarding Cuba's debt with Argentina, estimated at some $1  billion, Robaina reiterated Havana's intention to "unfreeze" the  topic and have experts from both countries begin talks in that  regard.    Argentine Foreign Minister Di Tella called his meeting with  Robaina positive, fruitful, and sincere, and added that topics  of mutual interest were discussed in a respectful manner.    Robaina gave numerous interviews to major local and foreign  media throughout the day.</p>

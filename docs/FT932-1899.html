			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / National Express leads airport bids NATIONAL EXPRESS, the coach group, yesterday emerged as the favourite but undeclared bidder for East Midlands International Airport at Castle Donington, Leicestershire. Mr Chris Gilliatt from the Nottingham office of accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, which is handling the sale of the airport for its local authority owners, told senior airport executives their attempt to stage a management buy-out had been rejected. He apparently refused to disclose the name of the successful bidder because of Stock Exchange regulations. The only UK quoted company believed to be on the bidding list is National Express. Apart from the management team, the other declared bidders are Regional Airports, a private company, and Lockheed, the US aerospace group. National Express refused 'to comment on press speculation and industry rumour'. Mr Gilliatt also refused to discuss the bidding, noting that 'nothing is agreed until it is signed and that means a contract'. It is thought that National Express has entered an agreement with the airport owners which gives it the exclusive right to negotiate a purchase. This could take until August. The airport owners are the Derbyshire County Council with 44 per cent, Nottinghamshire County Council with 33 per cent, and Leicestershire County Council and Nottingham City Council with 11 per cent each.</p>

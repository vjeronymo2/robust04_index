			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: De Beers raises dividend 7% as earnings climb De Beers, the South African company which dominates the world diamond trade, is lifting its total 1993 dollar dividend by 7 per cent. The lift confirms the stout turnround in the diamond business from the difficult conditions in 1992. The dividend is increased to 84.4 US cents a share from 79.1 cents in 1992. Earnings rose 16 per cent to 230 cents from 199 cents a share. The shares reacted strongly to the news, climbing to a new high of R116 on the Johannesburg stock exchange, before retreating to R115 at the close. Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said he was 'pleased' with the results, which were underpinned by the first increase in four years in global retail diamond sales. The group's Central Selling Organisation (CSO) sold a record Dollars 4.37bn in rough diamonds in 1993, against Dollars 3.42bn the year before, led by good demand in the US and east Asia. Mr Jeremy Pudney, CSO marketing director, said Korea, Taiwan and Thailand had overtaken France and Germany as the group's most important markets after the US, Japan and Italy. However, demand in Japan and Italy remained weak. Mr Gary Ralfe, a director, said the group's relationship with Russia remained uneasy, although sales in December of uncut diamonds from the country's Treasury stockpile - in breach of a marketing agreement between De Beers and the government - had not been repeated so far this year. Pre-tax income rose to Dollars 789m from Dollars 728m, reflecting the overall improvement in the jewellery trade and an increased contribution from South African operations, boosted by the build-up to full production at its new Venetia mine. Mr Ogilvie Thompson said results from Centenary, De Beers' Swiss-based arm, were hit by retrenchment costs at Namibian mines and the Irish-based industrial diamond division, plus its smaller share of total diamond sales as Venetia's output increased.</p>

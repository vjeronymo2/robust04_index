			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / IRA takes aim at centre of Belfast UNIONIST MPs and Northern Ireland civic leaders are demanding improved security following a massive IRA bomb explosion yesterday in Belfast's commercial centre. The blast came hours after an earlier powerful explosion had caused millions of pounds worth of damage. The two attacks represent a partial reversion to the IRA tactics of the mid-1970s, when a high-intensity campaign was undertaken against economic targets. Meanwhile, the government is stepping up its drive against terrorists who try to extort money from businesses in the province in an attempt to stem funding for the IRA. The initiative is spearheaded by C13, a police squad attached to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and a new government unit composed of civil servants with expert knowledge of the taxation and financial systems. It is estimated that the bill for civilian damage in Northern Ireland during the past year will be some Pounds 60m. The latest explosions follow a stepping up of fire-bomb attacks in the province, which can be carried out by less experienced IRA units. They also come against a background of successful job creation by the government, which has moved some Inland Revenue and social security jobs to the province. After the latest explosion Mr Richard Needham, Northern Ireland economy minister, promised to look carefully at 'every conceivable method we can adopt to ensure we try to keep the bombers out of Belfast city centre'. But Mr Peter Robinson, Democratic Unionist MP for East Belfast, said the government had demonstrated its 'inability to win the war against terrorism'. Meanwhile the army admitted last night that 500 extra troops drafted into Northern Ireland in November to tackle the upsurge in terrorist violence had been withdrawn. In Lancashire, police appealed to the public for help to catch an IRA unit operating in north-west England after the discovery of a 6lb bomb near Weeton Barracks, Blackpool. A 43-year-old man was operated on last night after being shot in both legs in an apparent reprisal shooting in north Belfast. The business of fear, Page 10</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["fy"-initialed report: "It Is Not To Be a Mud-Slinging </F> Campaign"]    [Text] Bonn, 13 Apr -- The Christian Democratic Union  [CDU] and Christian Social Union [CSU] do not want to let their  election campaign become a mud-slinging campaign, but they are  striving for a strong polarization to make the voter decide  between "red-green" or the CDU/CSU. This has been agreed upon  by the leading politicians of the two parties in a talk, which  lasted more than five hours and was held in the chancellor's  office on Tuesday evening [12 April]. CDU Secretary General  Hintze said that the CDU/CSU is on the verge of "rising to its  greatest election campaign strength and bringing about a change  in the mood."    The party leadership, which met under the chairmanship of  their heads Kohl and Waigel, established a working group. It is  to work out a government and working program for 1994-98 and  present it before the summer recess. In addition, an election  campaign committee was formed to coordinate that European and  Bundestag election of the CDU and CSU. Hintze said that in the  election campaign of the CDU and CSU, the conflict about  safeguarding jobs by strengthening the upswing is the top  priority. In addition, the CDU/CSU works for Germany's internal  unification and the further development of the equalization of  burdens on families toward an equalization of benefits for  families with children. Hintze and [CSU Secretary General]  Huber were not able to say what this should be like. In  addition, the CDU/CSU wants to work for a more efficient  combating of crime and a further increase in housing  construction. The record of 500,000 new apartments should be  exceeded in the next few years. In addition, the CDU/CSU wants  to stress the value of a stable currency and promise a tax  reduction in the long run. The main opponent of the CDU/CSU is  the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. Scharping will be  presented as a "political shirker" who tries to cover up the  real intentions of the SPD.    CSU Secretary General Huber stressed the will of the  Bavarian  sister party to get as close as possible to the CDU. This time  there will not be an election campaign against Bonn, he added.  The tenor of the election campaign will be the statement:  "There is no alternative to Kohl, the experienced chancellor."  Despite the well-known results of opinion polls, his party  considers the outcome of the elections to be "open." It will  try to win the elections by winning over the largest possible  part of the so far undecided people eligible to vote, which  oscillates between 25 and 40 percent. In addition to the person  of the chancellor, one intends to stress the reliability of the  financial policy characterized by Theo Waigel and contribute to  the polarization by campaign Waigel and Lafontaine, who is  envisaged by the SPD as finance minister. The CDU and CSU also  want to gain profile as "parties of property" and point to the  disastrous consequences of the SPD's proposal to tax real estate  property on the basis of the market value instead of the basic  value. One intends to act tough against the Republikaner and  the German People's Union and tell the people that "decent  Germans" cannot vote for these parties. The Greens are a  security risk because of their intention to dissolve the  Bundeswehr and to leave NATO -- and this is how they will be  presented.</p>

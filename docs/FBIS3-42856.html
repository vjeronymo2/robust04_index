			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Elmar Vebers, doctor of philosophy and Viyesturs </F> Pauls Karnups, member of Saeima: "The Foreigner Problem"]    [Text] The central databank of the Register of  Residents summarized data on 2,410,763 residents, i.e. on 97.9  percent of individuals included in the initial registration.    Discussions concerning the law on citizenship and the status  of foreigners in Latvia, which remains undetermined, are  continuing in Latvia. Various opinions and evaluations could be  better substantiated if political workers and the interested  parties had a better knowledge of the actual situation. Data of  the Register of Residents, which is currently being summarized  in a centralized databank, will be indispensable in a future  determination of the actual situation. Even though this data is  not yet absolutely precise, inasmuch as it has not been  qualified and verified, it can, however, already be used in  political, economic, social, and cultural life.    At present the Register of Residents lists 2,462,196  individuals. According to data of the State Committee on  Statistics 2,566,000 persons lived in Latvia at the start of  1994. Consequently 96 percent of the residents were registered.  The initial registration of residents has remained unchanged for  several months. This makes it possible to believe that the  initial registration can now be considered as being complete.    As commonly known, the Register of Residents does not  include  Russian military personnel on active duty and members of their  families. Unfortunately the Department of Citizenship and  Immigration Affairs is thus far unable to provide precise  information on how many of these people there are. Some 29,618  temporary residence permits have now been issued, which amounts  to 1.2 percent of the total population of Latvia.    It is clearly necessary to also take into account the fact  that there are people who are consciously avoiding registration  or doing so because of the pressure of circumstances. They are  individuals, including Letts, who do not register because they  were on active duty in the Soviet army and are now receiving a  pension from Russia.    It is understandable that the Register of Residents is being  ignored by a large number of those military personnel who were  discharged and are getting a pension from Russia. The total  number of such individuals may reach 70,000, or 2.7 percent of  the Latvian population. It is likewise not known what number of  citizens of Russia residing in Latvia have registered with the  Register of Residents. Finally, those who intend to leave Latvia  in the immediate or distant future are attempting to circumvent  the Register of Residents. In 1993 the migratory balance (the  difference between those arriving and those departing) amounted  to 28,000 people. That is considerably less than in 1992 when  the migratory balance came to 47,200. As commonly known in 1991  that balance constituted 11,200 persons.    The central databank of the Register of Residents summarized  data on 2,410,763 residents, i.e. on 97.9 percent of individuals  covered in the initial registration. A more detailed analysis of  this data is given below.  <H5>  Citizens </H5>   Some 71.4 percent or 1,720,302 persons of those included in  the databank are citizens of the Latvian Republic. As commonly  known those who held the citizenship of the Latvian Republic  prior to 17 June 1940 and their descendants are citizens of the  Latvian Republic. Consequently after registering with the  Register of Residents it is possible to become a citizen of the  Latvian Republic also if only one of the parents is a citizen of  the Latvian Republic.    A total of 432,200 citizens of Latvia live in Riga, 453,300  in Vidzeme, 319,200 in Latgale, 242,900 in Kurzeme, and 272,600  in Zemgale, while in cities like Jurmala there are 33,600  citizens, in Liepaja--47,700 citizens, and in Daugavpils--  72,300 citizens.    Both parents of 1,309,500 (71.1 percent) of the Latvian  citizens hold Latvian citizenship. In Riga there are 312,400  (72.3 percent) such persons, 357,700 (78.9 percent) in Vidzeme,  228,600 (71.6 percent) in Latgale, 196,800 (81.0 percent) in  Kurzeme, 213,900 (78.5 percent) in Zemgale, 21,000 (62.5  percent) in Jurmala, 38,200 (80.1 percent) in Liepaja, and  47,800 (66.1 percent) in Daugavpils. There are less than 60  percent of such citizens in the city of Rezekne, 50.3 percent in  the Rezekne Rayon and 59.7 percent in Gulbene Rayon.    Some 135,000 individuals (7.9 percent of the total number of  citizens of the Latvian Republic) received citizenship on their  maternal side. In Riga there are 52,700 such persons (12.2  percent of the citizens of the Latvian Republic living in Riga).    A total of 114,100 persons (6.6 percent) received  citizenship  on their paternal side. In Riga--39,400 (9.1 percent).    As we can see more people obtained citizenship on their  maternal side than on the paternal side. This is apparently  explained by the fact that women enter into mixed marriages more  frequently than men, as a result of which the probability of  them marrying foreigners increases. It is likewise necessary to  take into account the fact that the specific share of women in  the population of Latvia is higher than that of men.    In addition to that 101,900 individuals (5.9 percent of  citizens of the Latvian Republic) received citizenship on their  maternal side without indication of the father's citizenship.  The same applies to 22,600 (1.3 percent) of the citizens of the  Latvian Republic who obtained citizenship on the paternal side  without an indication of the mother's citizenship.    As commonly known, in accordance with the terminology of the  Register of Residents those foreigners who are not citizens of  Latvia and have a permanent residence permit in Latvia are  registered as former citizens of the USSR in the initial  registration.    In the case of some of those registered, as already  mentioned, the citizenship of the parents is not mentioned. In  individual cases the citizenship of the parents may truly be  unknown, for instance, in the case of elderly people who  received citizenship of the Latvian state in the first years of  its existence, the citizenship of whose parents has not been  determined.  <H5>  Foreigners </H5>   A total of 690,461 persons (28.6 percent of those in the  databank) are foreigners, or, in other words, residents of  Latvia who are not citizens of the Latvian Republic. In the case  of 634,000 of them neither the father nor the mother are  citizens of the Latvian Republic. For the remainder the  citizenship of either the father or the mother or of both  parents is not indicated.    Most of the foreigners consist of citizens of the USSR who  entered Latvia illegally during the years of occupation. But  they are not the only ones. The number of foreigners is also  supplemented by Letts who returned to Latvia (most often from  Russia) and in accordance with the existing law on citizenship  are not citizens of the Latvian Republic.    Their number totals 22,031. It is possible that there may be  more of them inasmuch as during Stalinist times as well as  subsequently, some of the Russian Letts became "Russians"  (according to passport entry) even though they consider  themselves to be Letts.    In addition to that the category of foreigners includes  Polish and Lithuanian agricultural workers, who entered Latvia  legally before the war and have lived here all of these years,  as well as their descendants.    Some 466,600 (67.6 percent) of the foreigners entered Latvia  from some other country, most from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus,  while 223,900 (32.4 percent) of the foreigners were born in  Latvia. Fifty percent of the foreigners born in Latvia were born  in Riga.    During the occupation 9,800 persons on the average entered  Latvia every year and remained living here. The greatest influx  of foreigners into Latvia took place in 1946 (11,950), 1947  (11,500), 1960 (11,750), 1961 (11,200) and 1973 (10,730). It is  characteristic that in 1957, 1958, and 1959 the number of those  who arrived (and those who stayed) is smaller than in 1956,  while in 1960 that index again showed a sharp increase. Those  who are presently "heroically" reprimanding E. Berklavs should  give some thought to the reason for that phenomenon.    Some 337,200 foreigners, which comes to 48.8 percent of  their  total number in Latvia, live in Riga.    Most of the foreigners wish to obtain citizenship of the  Latvian state. It is characteristic that Latvian citizenship is  most often desired by those foreigners who came here and not by  those born here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Analysis of data from the Register of Residents indicates  that the foreigner problem is actually a "matter" facing Riga.  There the share of foreigners is 43.8 percent. The problem is  particularly acute in the Kurzeme suburb where the share of  foreigners amounts to 51.2 percent. The share of foreigners,  however, does not exceed 25 percent in any of the krays of  Latvia--Kurzeme, Latgale, Vidzeme, Zemgale.    Naturally, if we study separate data on citizens of the  Latvian Republic and foreigners by electoral districts, it will  turn out that, as anticipated, the foreigner problem is also a  problem in the largest cities of Latvia. At Liepaja, for  instance the share of foreigners comprises 49.0 percent, in  Daugavpils--37.9 percent, in Jurmala--36.6 percent, in Yelgava  (including the rayon)--34.4 percent, in Ventspils (including the  rayon)--31.7 percent, and in the Riga Rayon--27.5 percent.

Cited below is a survey of the largest groups of citizens of  the Latvian Republic and foreigners and their distribution by  nationality.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Distribution of Citizens of the Latvian Republic and Foreigners by Nationa-|  |lity                                                                       |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nationality       |Citizens          |Foreigners        |Total             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Letts             |1,355,259         |22,031            |1,377,290         |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Russians          |278,087           |444,399           |722,486           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Poles             |38,333            |24,060            |62,393            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Belarusians       |20,455            |82,849            |103,304           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Lithuanians       |7,062             |26,206            |33,268            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jews              |6,638             |8,074             |14,712            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gypsies           |6,146             |673               |6,819             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ukrainians        |3,929             |59,853            |63,782            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Estonians         |1,309             |1,566             |2,875             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Germans           |926               |2,636             |3,562             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Armenians         |277               |1,917             |2,194             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Livonians         |179               |1                 |180               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Others            |1,702             |16,196            |17,895            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Virtually all of the Livonians living in Latvia are citizens  of the Latvian Republic along with 98.4 percent of the Latvians,  followed by Gypsies--90.1 percent, Poles--61.4 percent,  Estonians--45.5 percent, Jews--45.1 percent, Russians--38.5  percent, Germans--26.0 percent, Lithuanians--21.2 percent,  Belarusians--19.8 percent, Armenians--12.6 percent, and  Ukrainians--6.2 percent. The overall share of citizens of the  Latvian Republic among Ukrainians and Armenians is rather low  for the reason that they are not historical national groups in  Latvia. The same can also be said about Tatars whose overall  number totals 3,200 individuals with a 95.5 percent share of  foreigners.    The centralized databank has not yet provided information on  the national composition of krays and rayons of Latvia. If such  data is obtained, along with information on the composition of  citizens and foreigners in each district and city, that will  make it possible to work out naturalization tactics for each  kray and city of Latvia in accordance with the interests of  Letts and citizens of the Latvian Republic.</p>

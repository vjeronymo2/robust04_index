			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE RULES THREE IN CONFLICT OVER LOS ALAMITOS VOTE  </P> <P> Three members of the California Horse Racing Board were in conflict of interest  when they voted against a request by harness interests for additional racing  rights at Los Alamitos Race Course, a Sacramento Superior Court judge ruled  Tuesday.  </P> <P> In ruling on a suit against the racing board, Judge Allen Fields said that CHRB  chairman Leslie Liscom, Ray Seeley and Rosemary Ferraro should have  disqualified themselves from voting because of connections with Hollywood Park,  which owns Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> Liscom works for and has a small interest in an insurance brokerage that does  about $1-million of business with Hollywood Park. For several years, Seeley has  been allowed to park his motor home track property without paying rent. Ferraro  accepted in excess of $250 in meals and drinks from Hollywood Park during a  12-month period, a violation of state regulations.  </P> <P> The seven-member racing board had designated a 17-week harness season at Los  Alamitos, but harness officials wanted to extend the season by five weeks.  Their request was denied, which prompted the suit against the CHRB.  </P> <P> The racing board will have to reconsider the application for an extended  harness season, which was scheduled to end March 25. Tuesday's decision leaves  Los Alamitos' quarter horse season, which was to begin next week, in limbo.  </P> <P> "This is a major victory for the harness industry in California," said Ron  Zumbrun, a spokesman for harness interests. "This shows that the racing board  must start following the statutes and not let itself be subjected to  manipulation."  </P> <P> Liscom declined to comment. Bob Forgnone, Hollywood Park's attorney, was  unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Lance Olson, a CHRB attorney, said: "They (harness officials) lost, not us,  because they wanted the judge to give them the extra weeks and he didn't do  that."  </P></p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar recovers some ground THE DOLLAR yesterday recovered some of its recent sharp fall as dealers moved to cover short positions, writes Peggy Hollinger. The US currency gained just over one pfennig on Friday's DM1.5595 close in London to finish yesterday at DM1.5705. During the day the dollar had two brief surges, hitting a high of DM1.5785. In New York the dollar ended at DM1.5781. Traders said there had been some outright speculative buying which had helped briefly to boost the US currency. Generally, however, it appeared the market was shrugging off talk of an imminent rate cut in the US - preferring instead to concentrate on the depressing economic pictures broadcast by Germany and Japan. One senior dealer even suggested that a rate cut in the US would be good news for the dollar. 'The market would see an early rate cut as evidence of the Fed's determination to get the economy moving,' said Mr David Cocker of Chemical Bank. He added that investors were looking for excuses to buy the US currency, but so far they had been thwarted by depressing data. 'In the present environment, the market does not like the look of Germany and is not keen on Japan . . . if there is a piece of good news (from the US), you will not see the dollar for dust,' he said. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist with Yamaichi International, said he expected the interest rate differential to move in the dollar's favour by the end of the year, pushing the US currency as high as DM1.80. The generally pessimistic view on the Japanese economy, and short covering, gave some strength to the dollar against the yen. The US unit jumped from Friday's close of Y125.20 to finish at Y126.70 in London. In New York it rose to Y126.78. Political scandal, economic weakness, and even talk of an earthquake have conspired against the Japanese currency. Mr MacKinnon suggested that Japan could announce a rate reduction before the end of the month, when the government publishes its Tankan survey covering manufacturing investment plans and business confidence. 'There is evidence from monthly figures to suggest that the Japanese economy is decelerating quickly,' he said. The D-Mark also strengthened against the yen, moving from Friday's close of Y79.96 in Frankfurt to its highest for a month at Y80.60. The German currency's gains against the yen did not disturb the European exchange rate mechanism. As usual, sterling remained stubbornly at the bottom of the grid, pinned down by a strong peseta. Spanish consumer price figures out later this week will do little to encourage authorities to cut rates there. The pound closed unchanged against the D-Mark at DM2.8675, and weakened slightly against the dollar at Dollars 1.8260 from Friday's close of Dollars 1.8380.</p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Letter: Council tax and house prices Sir, There have been a number of recent articles in quality papers concerning the bands to be used for Britain's council tax. The bands are based on two-year-old house prices. According to the government 'the bands are so wide that reflecting the fall in house prices would cause little movement between bands'. The problem is worst in the south and East Anglia, where house prices have fallen most dramatically. I do not believe that anyone has yet considered the mathematics involved. If every house and flat in the country dropped into a lower band then the price for each band would have to increase in order to raise the same total amount of tax. It will be difficult to convince people that it is fair to charge tax based on what a house was worth in the past. Government spokesmen should remind the public that the prices used to set the banding are a snapshot at a point in time and that those prices would have continued to be used if prices had carried on rising. The government could learn from the private sector marketing experts. They consider how to influence the perception of the customer. An example is retailers who increase prices and soon after offer 20 per cent off] W A James, 'Swanland', Haynes Mead, Berkhamsted, Herts HP4 1BU</p>

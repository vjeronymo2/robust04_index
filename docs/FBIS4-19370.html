			<p>BFN     [Text] The Turkish National Assembly's decision [as heard]  to turn Ayia Sofia into a mosque represents another provocation  by Turkey.    Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou said that this  development causes concern. Public Order Minister Stilianos  Papathemelis described the Turkish decision as an advanced form  of provocation. New Democracy issued a statement asking for the  World Council of Churches to convene and for mobilization of all  Greeks throughout the world to prevent the desecration of Ayia  Sofia.    Commenting on the proposal to turn Ayia Sofia into a mosque,  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that, given its  everyday practices, Turkey needs to prove that it has some kind  of relation with what is called European civilization. Turkey,  the spokesman said, has the duty to prove that.    Archbishop Serafim of Athens issued a letter to the United  Nations and all other international and church organizations as  well as to the leaders of Christian churches regarding the  threats against the Ecumenical Patriarchate by Islamists.</p>

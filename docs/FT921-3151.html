			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Japanese politicians urge interest rate cut THE Bank of Japan came under renewed pressure at the weekend to cut interest rates to boost a slowing economy and revive a sagging stock market. Thinly-disguised calls for a further cut in the Official Discount Rate, the central bank's principal indicator of monetary policy, were made by Mr Shin Kanemaru, the LDP's deputy president, and Mr Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister and key party boss. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, has insisted he will not bow to political pressure. But there is growing speculation in Tokyo that he will soon decide of his own accord to cut rates, given mounting evidence that the economy is slowing faster than the authorities had hoped. On Saturday, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business daily, said the next cut in the discount rate could come this month. Since the beginning of last year, the rate has been cut three times in 0.5 percentage point steps to 4 per cent. Economic data published since the rate was last cut at the end of December indicates the slow down in economic activity is spreading, with the initial decline in spending on property, capital investment and luxury goods steadily extending to consumer markets. The central bank's recent survey of short-term business trends showed business confidence declining sharply. Mr Mieno thus has plenty of grounds for action without appearing to bow to political pressure. Mr Kanemaru's weekend comments were particularly significant because he caused a minor storm last month when he suggested Mr Mieno should be sacked if he did not cut rates. This time he was more circumspect, saying at a private meeting that the economy was slowing and the risk of a fall 'into the abyss' should not be ruled out. The comment stands in sharp contrast to the oft-repeated view of Mr Mieno that there is very little risk of the slowdown turning suddenly into recession. Mr Takeshita, for his part, called for 'decisive' pump-priming action. Though neither politician mentioned the stock market, LDP leaders are known to be very concerned about the health of the financial markets, not least because many potential contributors to LDP funds have been starved of profits from financial investments. The Nikkei index stands close to the 20,221.86 figure which marks the bottom of the range it has established since the bear market started with sharp price falls in early 1990. Investors were relieved that complex futures-related settlement trades were carried out on Friday without a further decline in prices. Futures-related trading has been blamed by some Japanese brokers and officials for eroding confidence in the cash market, though foreign companies, which are heavy traders of futures, say the fault lies in the general weakness of sentiment. With little sign of foreign investors buying stocks as much as last year and Japanese institutions and individuals staying clear of the market, there are grave fears that the Nikkei index could fall below 20,000 - back to its lowest levels since 1987.</p>

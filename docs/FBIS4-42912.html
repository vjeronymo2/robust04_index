			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by Jean-Michel </F> Lamy; place and date not given: "Juppe: `No' to Europe as Mere  Free Trade Area"--first paragraph is LES ECHOS introduction]    [Text] Just three days before the elections, Alain Juppe,  foreign minister and secretary general of the RPR [Rally for the  Republic], stated his beliefs with regard to Europe. France can  make its voice heard in Brussels, he said, citing the example of  GATT. He reaffirmed the objective of a single currency and  called for a return to narrow fluctuation bands within the EMS  [European Monetary System]. With a view to the reform of  Community institutions planned for 1996, he proposed, among  other things, extending the term of the presidency of the  European Council. With regard to the major issue of enlargement  to include the countries of the East, the minister pleaded for a  plan for the gradual integration of candidate members, which he  listed. Alain Juppe clearly opted for a more efficient and more  democratic European Union [EU], rejecting the possibility of  Europe becoming a mere free trade area.    [Lamy] Is Europe not starting on a downhill slope?    [Juppe] The impression of "Europessimism" that seems to  prevail in Europe is not shared abroad. The EU maintains a  strong power of attraction, since numerous states want to join  it. It is respected not only by the United States but also by  Russia and Japan. And the image of it in Third World countries  is that of a fortress rather than of a ship adrift. This being  so, what is the source of the skepticism that is being  expressed, especially in connection with the campaign for the  election of the European Parliament? First, from the feeling  that successive enlargements of the Community have taken place  to the detriment of its coherence. Second, from the fact that  the complexity and weight of EU institutions are now so great as  to paralyze them.    Last, Europe is accused of having failed to provide a  convincing response to the concerns of Europeans: the struggle  against unemployment and both internal and external security.  These criticisms, often justified, must be answered. There is  no shortage of ideas.    [Lamy] How would you evaluate the functioning of the Council  of Ministers in Brussels? Can France make its voice heard in  them?    [Juppe] My evaluation is clear. Yes, France can make its  voice heard, as is shown by GATT and Bosnia. But we can do  better. After 15 months' experience, I think that two kinds of  improvement can be made. The first is the more simple one: It  concerns working methods. Everyone can see that the practice of  systematic "roundtables" consumes a great deal of time -- at  least two hours among Twelve, perhaps four or five hours if the  Union some day has 25 members. Some measures of a practical  nature can be envisaged: to settle more issues at the level of  the Council of Permanent Representatives (senior officials  representing France in Brussels), to increase written  procedures, and also, as the French Government has suggested, to  organize more frequent meetings of the ministers responsible for  European affairs.    The second class of reforms must aim to improve the  efficiency of the decisionmaking process. To this end we should  consider extending the term of the presidencies, creating one or  more deputy presidencies, or increasing the personnel or  resources of the Secretariat General of the Council (and thus  also extending the services of the Commission). We will have  these suggestions in mind during preparations for the  intergovernmental conference in 1996.    [Lamy] According to the public, Bosnia illustrates Europe's  impotence to a grotesque degree. What is France's role?    [Juppe] Before talking about Europe's impotence, let us  recall first that it provides the largest share of humanitarian  aid, which has made it possible to save hundreds of thousands of  lives over the past two years. This is by no means negligible!  It is also the Europeans who have deployed the most blue  helmets in Bosnia. Last, it is Europe that has proposed the  only plan for a political settlement of the conflict, and this  plan, having been almost accepted by all sides in December,  still remains on the table.    [Lamy] France has always performed a guiding role among the  Twelve: It is by far the largest contributor of troops, ahead  of Britain; it was the initiator, with Germany, of the EU peace  plan; and it was behind all the political and military measures  that made it possible to drive back the Serbs: the sanctions  against the Belgrade regime, the establishment of safe havens,  and the ultimatum to Sarajevo. In other words, we have no cause  to feel ashamed about what we have done, and we must not relax  our efforts to achieve a political settlement, which is the only  possible solution to this conflict. During President Clinton's  recent visit to Paris, I noted that the Americans and French now  hold the same stance: We must do our utmost to persuade the  three communities to conclude a peace agreement before the  summer, on the basis of the 13 May Geneva declaration. This is  a considerable accomplishment for French diplomacy!    [Lamy] What role do you envisage for the WEU [Western  European Union], the body responsible for defense? Could we  envisage the Eurocorps, as it is now, intervening in the medium  term?    [Juppe] It is the destiny of the WEU to merge with the EU  sooner or later. European defense depends both on a  strengthening of the effort made by the Europeans themselves  ands on maintaining a strong trans-Atlantic link. This is why  France pleaded successfully at the latest NATO summit for the  latter to be able, in some instances, to place its resources  under WEU command. France and Germany are determined to pursue  this path, as shown by the latest Franco-German summit, which  achieved in particular a very notable advance on the issue of  space observation satellites, which Europe will need in order to  have its own strategic analysis capability.    The increased strength of the Eurocorps, to which Belgium,  Spain, and Luxembourg also contribute, is a priority. If, as I  hope, Germany succeeds in resolving the constitutional problem  associated with troop deployment abroad, the Eurocorps will  grant Europe the military wing that it now lacks. There are  other major projects under way, such as the establishment of an  aeronaval force with Spain and Italy, which will contribute to  the same objective.    [Lamy] How are we to deal with an increasingly pressing  demand on the part of the countries of the East to join the EU?  How do you intend to handle it?    [Juppe] This is a major challenge for Europe in the years  ahead. We cannot act as though nothing had happened in 1989, as  though the countries of Central and East Europe had not carried  out a peaceful revolution, restored democracy, and opened up to  the market economy. For almost five years France has argued for  an enlarged Europe at last free from the divisions of the Cold  War. If we disappoint those countries' expectations, we risk  both casting them back toward nationalist temptations and  prompting them to return to their former options.    This is why the French Government, in full agreement with  Germany, believes that the EU must be extended to the countries  of East Europe. This, moreover, was the conclusion reached by  the European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993.    So it is not the principle of enlargement that is in  dispute,  but the means of achieving it. It is necessary, first, to draw  up a list limiting the number of countries involved: These are  the countries of Central and East Europe and the three Baltic  countries, to which Slovenia could be added. Second, the  adherence of new member states must not entail a dilution of  European building. As Chancellor Kohl clearly stated at the news  conference after the Franco-German summit at Mulhouse, we refuse  to allow Europe to become a mere free trade area. So before  moving ahead, we must work, with a view to the intergovernmental  conference in 1996, for a thorough revision of the institutions,  to make the Union more efficient and more democratic.  Furthermore, an enlarged Europe must enjoy stability; its  members must settle their disputes like good neighbors: The  stability pact, work on which is due to finish at the beginning  of 1995, provides them with a suitable framework for doing so.    Last, imagination will have to be displayed to bring  together  within the same Union countries whose levels of development and  economic conditions are still very different. This is why we  are considering a plan for the gradual integration of the  candidates for membership. We have started to work in this  direction by associating the countries of central and East  Europe in terms of foreign and security policy and by granting  them, on the basis of a Franco-German proposal, the status of  associate membership in the WEU. This organization's council  spoke out favorably in this regard at its 9 May session.    [Lamy] The other major anxiety concerns Europe's inability  to  create jobs and to defend itself commercially. Is the record of  GATT negotiations a positive one, on balance?    [Juppe] Europe has created fewer jobs in recent years than  the United States or Japan. The first reason for this has to do  with the weak growth -- actually negative in 1993 -- that we  have experienced since 1990. Some degree of optimism in this  regard is justified by the fact that all the institutes forecast  growth of 1.6 percent for 1994 and growth above 2 percent in  1995. Second, there are structural obstacles in Europe to the  creation of jobs. Brussels last December embarked, on the basis  of the Commission's white paper and of the national  contributions that it received, on a very extensive program  designed to stimulate job creation. It involves on the one hand  facilitating major infrastructure networks such as the new  eastern high-speed train service, which is one of the 10  priority projects that will be approved at the European Council  in Corfu. The other objective is to establish EU actions in the  field of education, increased flexibility of labor, and the  development of proximity services.    As for the GATT negotiations, I think, as I have had  occasion to say several times, that it is extremely positive.  Without going back over it in detail, I will mention its  crucial achievements -- increased openness to third markets, the  safeguarding of the Common Agricultural Policy, which was  threatened by the draft Blair House agreement; the recognition  of cultural exception; the establishment of the World Trade  Organization [WTO]; and the broaching of new issues, such as the  environment or different levels of social protection. Of  course, we must remain vigilant with regard to the  implementation of the GATT agreement, which must be ratified by  all sides before their implementation in 1995.    France believes that the establishment of the WTO offers  real  chances of combating the unilateral trade policies which  profoundly affect international trade. Moreover, we are now  better equipped to respond in the event of a continuation of  such practices. On our initiative, on 15 December 1993, at the  same time as it approved the results of the Uruguay round, the  EU strengthened its own instruments of trade policy.    [Lamy] Do you think that the credibility of the objective of  a single European currency has been enhanced now?    [Juppe] This remains the objective. In order to achieve it  we must first strengthen the convergence of the European  economies. In 1993 we succeeded in surmounting a serious  monetary crisis thanks to close cooperation with Germany. We  must now make the best use of the second stage of economic and  monetary union [EMU], which began on 1 January 1994 with the  establishment of the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt.  This stage must be marked in particular by a strengthening of  coordination between central banks, further development of the  public and private use of the ECU and a coordinated reduction of  interest rates.    We must also establish narrower fluctuation bands among  European currencies. If these objectives are achieved, the  transition to the third stage of EMU, that is, the single  currency, will be within our reach.    [Lamy] You mentioned a Europe of "variable solidarity". Is  it enough? Is it not necessary to envisage a proper reform of  EU institutions, a new founding act among the real advocates of  political union?    [Juppe] First, I would like to point out that "variable  solidarity" is not a new idea. It is the principle adopted  within the framework of the EMS, in connection with industrial  cooperation (the Airbus and Arianespace are two examples), but  also in the field of research, where some programs -- such as  JET [Joint European Torus], which has permitted considerable  progress to be made in thermonuclear fusion -- do not involve  all members states and are conducted in association with third  states.    The WEU, whose task it is to formulate a common defense  policy, does not comprise all the members of the EU. And the  Eurocorps, which is the precursor of common armed forces,  permits those who so wish to associate their efforts on a  voluntary basis. The larger the EU grows, the more this kind of  process will be necessary, because in a community of 20-25  members not everyone can do everything together, nor at the same  pace. This is by no means incompatible with the idea of a  "tough kernel" of member states wanting to establish together a  very advanced union. This is the main significance of  Franco-German cooperation, the vitality of which has just been  demonstrated again by the Mulhouse summit.    Let us not labor under any delusions: The 1996  intergovernmental conference cannot content itself with what I  would call technical superficial adjustments; it must examine  matters in depth and, to use your expression, result in a new  founding pact guided by our vision of the Europe of the year  2000. A Europe determined to meet the two great challenges that  face our societies -- employment and peace. France is ready to  proceed further along this path.</p>

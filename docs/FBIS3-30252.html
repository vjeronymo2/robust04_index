			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Last year, the Slovak Republic exported arms and  ammunition worth approximately $45 million. This was  communicated to NOVY CAS daily by Karol Dropa, deputy head of  department of special production at the Slovak Ministry of  Economy. The essence of this export, in his view, was only one  contract--namely, the export of tanks to Syria.    For the sake of comparison, the daily says that last year  the  Czech Republic exported military equipment and materials worth  approximately $167 million, which is $17 million more than  similar exports in 1992 by the former federation.</p>

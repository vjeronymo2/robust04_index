			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Daf shares remain suspended TRADING in Daf, the lossmaking Dutch truck manufacturer, remained suspended for a third consecutive day yesterday as the company, its bankers and government authorities in the Netherlands and Belgium continued to work on a refinancing and recovery package. Daf's shares were suspended early Monday morning ahead of an announcement about the rescue scheme originally scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, but the four parties involved in the talks have so far failed to reach agreement. A spokesman for Daf could not say when the company would be able to unveil the package. The Amsterdam stock exchange said Daf's shares would remain suspended until further notice. Mr Cor Baan, Daf's chairman, told 2,000 demonstrating employees that he was 'neither optimistic nor afraid' that the talks would fail. 'I am, however, greatly concerned that the uncertainty will last too long,' he added. Mr Baan said the problem lay in conditions attached to the financing package, but gave no details. One obstacle is thought to be job and other guarantees sought by the government of the Belgian region of Flanders, where Daf makes truck cabs and axles.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Insurance Department will tighten the rules on  life insurance companies sending their profits to parent firms  abroad in order to encourage them to invest more money in  Thailand, according to Department Director General Pracha  Charutrakunchai.    A maximum of 60 percent of life companies' net profits can  now be sent abroad, with some leeway permitted by the registrar  of insurance companies, who is the department's director-general.    Rapid economic growth helped enlarge the insurance market  and  some companies should invest more of their increased earnings  locally, he said at the weekend.    The department would not set a formal ceiling for the amount  of net profit which a company could remit abroad. It would  consider the issue case by case, he said.    The move is aimed at the only foreign-owned life insurer  operating in Thailand, American International Assurance, but Mr.  Pracha denied that the company would suffer, saying treatment  would be fair and would not affect the Government's policy of  promoting foreign investment.    Only five foreign companies had non-life insurance  operations  in Thailand, New Hampshire Co, Universal Co, Guardian,  Commercial Union, and part of the AIA operation. These five  altogether remitted around 100 million baht in profit to their  head offices abroad.    American International Assurance has more than 50 percent of  the life insurance market in Thailand. From January to  September 1993, about 216,700 of the total of 792,580 life  insurance policies held by AIA clients represented 11.7 billion  baht in premiums, compared with 24.2 billion baht for the  industry as a whole.    The AIA took 3.28 billion baht in first-year premiums for  the  first nine month of 1993 compared with 6.57 billion baht  generated by all 12 life insurance companies in Thailand.    In 1992 the company sent abroad about 700 million baht  accounting for 48.5 percent of its total net profits.    The company reported healthy growth in profits last year in  line 17-18 percent for the industry overall.    Mr. Pracha said he appreciated the AIA's apparent investment  of large sums in the stock market, loans and property investment.    Its investment was worth as much as 30 billion baht, but he  would still seek greater local input by the company.</p>

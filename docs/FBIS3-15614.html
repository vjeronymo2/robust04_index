			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] CONTACT news agency reports that the leader of  Georgia's Social Democratic Party Professor Guram Muchaidze sent  an address to the leaders of the Georgian political parties  saying: By order of the Social Democratic Party's political  council I have the honor to address you and call on you to view  with complete understanding parliament's decision on Georgia's  joining the CIS charter. Although this decision has been adopted  somewhat late, which is an unforgiveable mistake of the  authorities, it still gives us an opportunity to retain and  reinforce the state independence toward which we have all made  invaluable contributions. I hope that the leaders of Georgia's  political parties will manage to overcome isolationism and work  with a deep sense of responsibility for raising the role and  authority of our country within the CIS.</p>

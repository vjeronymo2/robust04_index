			<p>BFN     [Text] Al-Sulaymaniyah, northern Iraq, 9 Jun (INA)--Pitched  fighting has continued in various areas in the al-Sulaymaniyah  Governorate between Jalal Talabani's troops on the one hand, and  the forces of the so-called Islamic Movement and the gunmen of  the Kurdistan Democratic Party allied with it on the other.    Today's edition of the newspaper AL-'IRAQ published here  today quoted news reports originating in the al-Sulaymaniyah  Governorate as saying that the most violent battles witnessed  there were those waged in Qal'at Dizah, Banjwin, and Halabjah.  The reports added that the gunmen of Mas'ud Barzani managed to  kick Jalal Talabani's loyalists out of Qal'at Dizah and  completely occupy the entire city after killing several of these  loyalists. Jalal Talabani's loyalists fled the city, leaving  behind them the bodies of their dead and wounded. Moreover,  hundreds of citizens fled the city to neighboring villages and  mountain caves, seeking shelter and safety.    The news reports also confirmed that battles continued in  the  areas surrounding the al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate. The elements  of the so-called Islamic Movement, which supports Mas'ud's  group, are attempting to control some areas inside the city of  al-Sulaymaniyah, the reports added. Tension and fear spread to  other areas and places in the Autonomous Region of Kurdistan  because of the mistrust between the two groups of Mas'ud and  Jalal.</p>

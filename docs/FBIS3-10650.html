			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Prisoner of the Past"] </F>   [Text] As the only self-proclaimed candidate for the  presidency of the Republic -- in the middle of his campaign and  with a comfortable 30 percent acceptance -- Luis Inacio Lula da  Silva has obtained fixed coverage in the newspapers and an early  image of invincibility. Yet, while on a honeymoon with the  future, he nonetheless begins to show signals of decline.    Although this advantage over his probable contenders remains  unchanged (an advantage that will now begin to shrink), a recent  poll shows that the rejection rate for Lula jumped from 54  percent in September to 80 percent at the beginning of February.  This shows that his excursions through the interior of Brazil  are being neutralized by the internal crisis in the PT [Workers  Party] and by the backward and intransigent image of this  opposition party.    Voters have certainly noticed the incongruity of one who  attacks Brazilian leaders just as they are recycling themselves  in democracy and who suggests as an alternative for Brazil a  model that did not work anywhere in the world.    Surprisingly, Deputy Jose Genoino (PT-SP) [Sao Paulo]  recently stated in an article that the decision by the party to  abstain from the constitutional reform process -- which was  imposed by the radical majority of the PT executive board -- is  equivalent to partially curtailing the political mandate of PT  congressmen.    What is worse, this abstention has seriously damaged the  PT's  public image by disseminating the idea that it is a sectarian  party. Genoino believes the decision resembles the centralist  and authoritarian tradition of the decayed Communist parties,  and that it will harm the candidacy of Lula just as a ferocious  struggle over state reform and economic matters that affects the  workers' lives is taking place.    We must repeat: These opposition party members are not  progressive; they are conservative, they do not evolve, they  block congress sessions, and they torpedo initiatives. Their  stubbornness in defending the intangibility of a Constitution  they did not even sign is incongruous. The only explanation is  that the PT does not believe a market economy cannot be refined,  and it harbors the unconfessed wish to destroy it.    The public is nonetheless receptive to test demonstrations.  It is very well known that the privatization of the iron and  steel mills has increased the productivity of that industry,  lowered prices for its clients, and improved the lives of the  workers and employees who bought their shares.    In face of this highly obvious fact, what is the meaning of  the position of a Trotskyist economist member of the PT  executive board like Marcus Sokol, who intends to annul all the  privatizations already done? How did these fundamentalists --  who are middle-class professors, lawyers, journalists, and  sociologists -- kidnap the party from the hands of the Catholic  and labor union leadership?    It was very simple: The concentration of PT congressmen in  Brasilia and Lula's indecisiveness in face of the dogmatic wing  has made the congressmen prisoners of abstract principles and  simplistic slogans. Although he has the power to exert a vote  of wisdom -- as president of the PT -- in favor of participation  in the constitutional reform process, Lula preferred to abstain  from giving an order and opened the back door to the Shiites.    That is the reason for the PT's disquieting polarization,  ambivalence, and double talk. Touring the north and northeast  with his entourage, Lula -- wearing a straw hat -- said the PT  star "is the guide for the birth of Jesus" [as published]. In  Rio Grande do Sul Lula promised farmers that he would reduce  imports and increase subsidies. At the Fiesp [Sao Paulo State  Federation of Industries] he made people believe his party's  radical positions are not for real.    The fact that Lula used the word "citizons" ["cidadoes,"  instead of "citizens"] is not serious, but to lead a party  haunted by contradictory ghosts of reform and revolution, of  competency and subsidies, and economic criteria and populist  messianism, is serious.    The serious fact is that Lula lacks administrative  experience, he has never been mayor or governor, but now he  intends to know Brazil through a hurried tour from the dry  shrublands to the pampas. VEJA magazine's front page article  this week is about Lula's visit to southern Brazil, and it  states: "Just 48 hours after spending a few moments in southern  Brazil, Lula had earned the right to say; `I know Brazil from  Oiapoque to Chui.'"    For Lula, hurriedness and perfection go together.</p>

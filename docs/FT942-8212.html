			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey sets up Japanese joint venture Johnson Matthey, the precious metals technology group, has tackled two key elements of its corporate strategy in a deal with Mitsubishi Kasei, the Japanese chemicals company. They are to set up a joint venture to supply sputtering targets to the Japanese semiconductor industry. Sputtering targets are made of high purity metal - aluminium or titanium - and used to deposit a thin film on semiconductor chips and computer processors, both for the metal's electrical properties and to control the heat generated in these devices. Mr David Davies, chairman, said yesterday the deal would enable JM immediately to have profitable operations in Japan while at the same time expanding its electronic materials business to become worldwide market leader in sputtering targets. The partners will merge their existing Japanese operations into the new joint company, Ryoka Matthey, which will continue to manufacture at a plant in Noetsu. JM's initial cash contribution will be 'small' but after five years it will take its stake from 50 to 66 per cent at a cost of Pounds 1.8m.</p>

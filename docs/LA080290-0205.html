			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEARING SET ON TORRANCE PROJECT  </P> <P> A Torrance city proposal to change the financing and timetable for a major  redevelopment project will be reviewed at a hearing later this month.  </P> <P> The City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, on Tuesday scheduled the  hearing for Aug. 28.  </P> <P> There was no discussion of the proposal, which would amend the city's  industrial redevelopment plan.  </P> <P> State law requires a hearing before the plan can be changed. The city will  notify property owners in the redevelopment area, as well as others who live  within 300 feet of it, about the hearing date, said Mike Bihn, senior principal  planner.  </P> <P> The city had set a ceiling of $90 million to rehabilitate 292 acres on its east  side. But the project -- due to be completed in 2013 -- has proven more costly  than planned.  </P> <P> The proposed amendment would allow the city to spend another $90 million on the  project and extend the timetable 20 years, to 2033. Los Angeles County  officials have said they would be entitled to a larger share of property taxes  from the amended project.  </P> <P> The hearing was set for 7 p.m. in the City Council chambers. Council members  could take action on the plan that night, Bihn said.  </P></p>

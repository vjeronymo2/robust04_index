			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Storage Technology share price plummets STORAGE technology's shares plummeted by more than 20 per cent yesterday when the manufacturer of computer data storage systems announced lower-than-expected earnings and said testing of its much-heralded new product, the Iceberg disk array, had slipped behind schedule. The stock price fell from a Monday close of Dollars 56 1/4 to close at Dollars 45 yesterday. Net income for the first quarter was Dollars 12.5m, or 30 cents per share, compared with Dollars 13.4m, or 36 cents per share, in the same period last year. Analysts had been projecting first-quarter earnings of about 52 cents per share. Revenue for the quarter totalled Dollars 333.7m, an 8 per cent decline from Dollars 361.2m in the first quarter of 1991. 'While results for the first quarter fell somewhat below our expectations, we remain optimistic about our prospects for the year,' said Mr Ryal Poppa, chairman. Storage Technology's stock rose sharply in January, when the company announced Iceberg, an advanced disk array product for mainframe computers. Analysts said that it appeared unlikely the company would install Iceberg at customer sites until the third quarter rather than in the current quarter as had been expected.</p>

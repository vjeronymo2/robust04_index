			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ukrinform, Press Service of the President of </F> Ukraine and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine: "Fuel for the  Village"]    [Text] On 9 February, Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, performing the  duties of the Prime Minister of Ukraine, convened a conference,  in which issues connected with the securing of fuel and  lubricants for the agro-industrial complex were reviewed.    It concerned the fact that the government has to secure  delivery for the countryside of these materials in volumes that  correspond to the contract for state purchases of agricultural  production. All possible channels for getting energy supplies  will be used for this--both in Ukraine, and from the countries  of the near and far abroad. The transportation and other  participating departments have been assigned to secure  uninterrupted reception and unloading of petroleum products for  agricultural consumers. Operative control over the work of the  transportation production line has been established.    At the conference, it was announced that the necessary means  for reducing costs of fuel and lubricants will be used. The  prices for these will be set no higher than world prices. This  must prevent an increase in cost of the supply of other  production of the rural economy, coming from the new harvest.    Volodymyr Demyanov, Vice-Prime Minister of Ukraine, took  part  in the conference.</p>

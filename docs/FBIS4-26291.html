			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 20 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam today ordered government departments to begin  thorough preparations for a possible summit meeting between the  two sides of the Korean peninsula.    Kim gave this directive following a ministerial meeting  related to the unification of Korea, presided over by Deputy  Prime Minister and National Unification Board (NUB) Minister Yi  Hong-ku here Monday [20 June].    Seoul has proposed to Pyongyang to meet on June 28 to  prepare  for the summit, which will be the first in half century.    Chances for an inter-Korean summit are at an all-time high  with the top leaders of South Korea and the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea (DPRK) agreeing in principle to the meeting.    Kim Yong-sam accepted the proposal by DPRK President Kim  Il-song through the mediation of former United States President  Jimmy Carter last Saturday.    Carter was in South Korea and the DPRK from June 13 to 18 in  "a private capacity" and exchanged views with Kim Yong-sam and  Kim Il-song respectively on the Korean situation, including the  nuclear issue in the DPRK.    Kim Yong-sam, upon hearing of Kim Il-song's wish to meet  with  him at any time, anywhere, without pre-conditions, and at an  early date, told Carter that he will accept the offer "without  any hesitation."    The South Korean Government has begun comprehensive  preparations for this meeting by forming a working-level task  force headed by vice-minister of the national unification board,  Song Yong-tae.    His group is making a variety of preparations, and is  engaged  in discussions to gather more details such as the time and place  for the summit meeting.    Observers here said that barring any unexpected developments  an inter-Korean summit is likely to occur in the near future.  It would be the first in the half-century of national division  on the Korean peninsula.    The nuclear dispute and other major issues existing between  the two sides could then be discussed, providing historic  momentum toward progress in inter-Korean relations, the  observers added.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (4): People are fed up with the empty promises - There is a crying need for political leadership IF THERE is one word which sums up the political mood of Poland today, it is disenchantment. Poles of all social strata grumble about the depressed economy and the squeeze on their living standards. Most of all, they are fed up with the empty promises and petty manoeuvrings of their politicians, who seem incapable of charting a coherent or candid path through the present economic pain. There is a crying need for leadership to deal with the manifold political, industrial and financial challenges facing the country - but no-one capable of providing it. The fruits of this disenchantment were plainly visible in last October's parliamentary elections and their aftermath. Only 42.5 per cent of Poles even bothered to vote, and the parliament that emerged, under Poland's complex form of proportional representation, was impossibly fragmented between a multiplicity of small parties; even the largest party, the centre-left Democratic Union led by Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the former Solidarity prime minister, gained little more than 12 per cent of the vote, and the former communists of the Democratic Left Alliance were uncomfortably close behind. Not surprisingly, it took several weeks of discussions in smoke-filled rooms for a government to emerge: a ragbag coalition of Catholic and peasant parties, led by the one-time Solidarity lawyer, Mr Jan Olszewski, who since he took office in December has found himself constantly having to patch together slender parliamentary majorities for the minutest of political decisions. It is scarcely a government of conviction; if it has a sense of common purpose, it stems mainly from the almost unbearably tight constraints on its freedom of manoeuvre imposed by the need to frame economic policies acceptable to the international financial institutions. Even that much was in doubt during the coalition's turbulent early weeks, when it lost its finance minister as a result of disagreements over budgetary policy. The message has not been lost on ordinary voters, as research by the government's own opinion polling centre shows. Asked recently whether the government had a chance of leading the country out of its present predicament, 50 per cent of those polled replied 'definitely not'. In the words of Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Congress who preceded Mr Olszewski as prime minister: 'The mood in Poland is that everything is getting worse because there is no very clear vision of the future. Also there is no feeling among the people that the executive is determined to push ahead with decisions. You have to show people that the decision-making process is working.' Poland's essential problem is that it lacks a real centre of power following the ousting of the communists and the acrimonious splintering of the anti-communist Solidarity alliance over the past three years; it lacks someone prepared to take responsibility for the economic transformation whose future is now in the balance, or to explain to the populace the costs and benefits of reform. The scale of the tasks facing legislators is immense: they include passing the austere budget required to meet IMF criteria, agreeing to enabling legislation that will cut back welfare payments, framing electoral reform and a package of constitutional changes, and ratifying Poland's precious association agreement with the European Community. By the same token, at a time when unemployment is rising rapidly and the collapse or restructuring of state industry will send it higher still, there is great scope for demagogic politicians minded to obstruct change. And although there is a broad consensus in Poland on the need to embrace reform as a means of gaining EC membership, politicians that have other ideas are by no means silent: the post-communists and the right-wing Confederation for an Independent Poland, which stands ready with its blend of nationalism and populist economics to exploit popular discontent. 'It's hard to say who's in the government and who's in the opposition,' says Mr Jerzy Urban, the former spokesman of the Jaruzelski communist party regime who is now a successful and wealthy magazine publisher. 'Everyone's in opposition, but we no longer know who they're in opposition to.' His complaint is echoed frequently among the intellectuals and activists whose combined efforts made Solidarity such a potent force in the demise of communism. And many of them think they know whom to blame: the man who led the movement and who is now ensconced in Warsaw's Belweder palace, President Lech Walesa. Much of what is said about Mr Walesa by the Warsaw intelligentsia may well be unfair. According to the cynical version of events, he deliberately presided over the fragmentation of Solidarity to bolster his own bid for the presidency in 1990; then, when he had attained that goal, he tried to use his position to divide and rule, undermining the government in the run-up to last autumn's parliamentary elections. What is certainly true is that Mr Walesa has made a particular contribution to the sense of unreality that permeates Polish politics today. For one thing, he has yet to clarify how his role fits in with that of other parts of the body politic. Partly by his own design at the time of the 1989 round-table talks between the communist regime and the opposition, the presidency's powers are not strongly defined. As a result, Mr Walesa has found himself flailing around on the sidelines of politics, acting in effect as a sort of unlicensed opposition to his own government. 'The president has turned out to be so competent that he has managed to pick fights with virtually everyone,' says Mr Adam Michnik, the former Solidarity activist who now edits one of Poland's leading dailies, Gazeta Wyborcza, which last week published a scathing six-page attack on the president. 'He has fallen victim to his own political strategy - the war at the top, dividing the parties. He won that battle, but that was the moment at which he lost the war.' The problems Mr Walesa can create have been evident in his often unhelpful interventions over economic policy. The president made a series of extravagant promises of 'jam tomorrow' on the campaign stump last year as he sought to confront the bizarre populist challenger for the presidency, Mr Stan Tyminski. Even now he continues to suggest unrealistic ways of producing handouts for ordinary Poles - most recently, a scheme to provide every citizen with interest-free credit to the tune of Dollars 10,000 for the purchase of state property or shares in state industries. 'It's true that people have to be given some hope, to be shown some light at the end of the tunnel,' sniffs the former prime minister, Mr Mazowiecki. 'But it can't be done on the basis of multiplying miraculous solutions that have no substance at all.' In recent weeks, Mr Walesa's search for a role has led him into potentially more dangerous waters: a struggle with the civilian government over control of the 300,000-strong armed forces, in which the defence minister, Mr Jan Parys, accused members of the president's staff of attempting 'to overthrow democracy with the aid of the army'. It was not clear at the time of writing how this issue would be resolved, but it has thrown the whole power play between Mr Walesa and the government into sharp relief. The political system and the politicians, then, have conspired to bring about a sort of institutional paralysis. If the necessary decisions are to be taken, something will have to give. One way forward would be to stage another parliamentary election. But Poles are already weary enough of politics, and few would favour another campaign; in any case, there is no guarantee that another poll would produce a very different result. Some senior politicians, including the prime minister, have been working to come up with their own response to the public mood: Mr Olszewski has been talking to a number of other parties, including Mr Mazowiecki's Democratic Union, for some weeks with a view to forming a 'grand coalition' that would agree to push controversial measures, including laws implementing the budget, changes to the welfare system and political reforms, through parliament quickly. Such a move would be an important step forward, but it would not be assured of success: the danger is that it would simply transfer disagreements in parliament to within the ruling coalition, and that the paralysis would persist. Creation of a grand coalition could also heighten tensions between the Catholic parties already in the government and secular-minded members of the Democratic Union over the role of the Church, a highly sensitive issue in post-communist Poland. Last week, the prospect of such a government seemed to recede as inter-party talks broke down. The alternative scenario, and one which worries more than a few Polish politicians, is that the president might take matters into his own hands. On numerous occasions after last October's elections Mr Walesa vowed to appoint himself as his own prime minister; at other times he has spoken of trying to rule by decree. Such a shift towards a more or less authoritarian course is a possibility that has not gone away. Says Mr Mazowiecki, one of the wiser voices on the Warsaw political scene: 'This would not be a dictatorship, but a kind of half-democracy. I wouldn't like to see Poland being in the vanguard of this sort of development in central and eastern Europe.'</p>

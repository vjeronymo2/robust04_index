			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Rabin firm as protesters try to storm his office ISRAELI POLICE in riot gear last night prevented up to 50,000 right-wing demonstrators, some armed with revolvers, from storming the office of Israel's prime minister in protest against the proposed Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, dismissed opponents of a deal as 'prattlers and liars' and Israeli and Palestinian officials continued to insist an historic deal could be signed next Monday. Protests 'won't budge me at all,' Mr Rabin said hours before 2,500 police armed with tear gas set up a double cordon around his office in Jerusalem. Last night the security forces repelled several onslaughts by protesters, who included Jewish settlers from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. There were no injuries but there were fears the protests could turn more violent later. In Washington, President Bill Clinton formally offered to host a signing ceremony for the agreement in the White House on September 13, if details of the accord have then been completed. The sticking point remained final agreement between Israel and the PLO on the precise terms governing statements of mutual recognition, after which both sides would be ready to sign the declaration of principles governing interim Palestinian self-rule. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, in Cairo refused to be drawn on when this last hurdle might be overcome but a PLO official in Tunis said it could be 'within 24 hours.' Israel is seeking commitments from the PLO over its covenant. Palestinian officials say they are prepared to supply such commitments, but say any change in the organisation's charter would require the endorsement of the Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile - something Mr Arafat and his colleagues wish to finesse to avoid both delay and potential internal opposition to the accord. Mr Arafat left Cairo for Oman yesterday. He is due to return to PLO headquarters in Tunis today for a meeting of the organisation's executive committee, or cabinet, to discuss the accord. In spite of yesterday's demonstration - which gathered under the banner 'Israel is in danger, don't give in' - political momentum in Israel continued to gather behind the deal. Mr Zalman Shoval, a leading member of the opposition right-wing Likud party, conceded in an interview that his party had little option but to accept the agreement and look forward to a general election in 1996. He said: 'It is a done deal. It is irreversible.' In Cairo Egypt's foreign minister, Mr Amr Moussa, seemed in buoyant mood as he spoke of progress towards a deal in which his country has played a considerable behind-the-scenes role. Mr Moussa told the Financial Times that while there were still differences between the two sides over mutual recognition, he was 'cautiously optimistic' that the gap could be bridged by the weekend. 'We see good intentions on both sides,' he said. But 'formalities are formalities, and technicalities are technicalities, so discussions continue.' While Mr Moussa did not wish to claim credit for having facilitated negotiations between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Israelis, there is no doubt that Egypt is assuming crucial importance in helping to deliver an historic agreement between once bitter foes. Mr Arafat has visited Egypt three times since details emerged late last month of a ground-breaking agreement with Israel, using the Egyptian capital as a staging point for his forays into the wider Arab world. In Cairo yesterday, he held yet another round of talks with Egyptian officials, including President Hosni Mubarak, before heading off to Oman in the Gulf to drum up support. Mr Arafat had been unwelcome in almost all the Gulf states since his embrace of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein during the Gulf crisis of 1990-91. Mr Arafat's stance alienated his most important paymasters, the Saudis and Kuwaitis. Egypt, the only Arab state to have made peace with Israel - the two countries signed their peace agreement in 1979 - is providing the benefit of its experience in negotiating detailed agreements with the Jewish state. Interestingly, several officials providing counsel to Mr Arafat were intimately involved in the Camp David process following late President Sadat's groundbreaking 1977 visit to Jerusalem. Among these officials are Mr Moussa himself who was head of the international department of the Egyptian foreign ministry at the time of Camp David, and Dr Osama al-Baz, who was a key aide to Mr Sadat and is now Mr Mubarak's political adviser. The two men were among a small number of Egyptian officials who were aware of developments from an early stage of the secret Palestinian-Israel negotiations in Norway. Mr Moussa was careful in describing Egypt's role, saying merely: 'The Palestinians I would say trust our judgment. Our opinion is given honestly with no ulterior motives. We provide advice when needed.' While the minister was careful about claiming credit for positive developments, he was less coy about his own country's interest in a successful outcome. As the only Arab country to have made peace with Israel, Egypt is anxious that other Arab countries should join it in making peace with Israel. It also believes that peace between Israel and its neighbours is the best antidote to the worrying spread of Islamic extremism throughout the Arab world. Egypt itself has been a particular target. Describing Camp David as the first stage in a long process aimed at calming the region, the Madrid conference of 1991 as the second, and the proposed mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO as the third, Mr Moussa said: 'The major instability in this region emanates from this particular problem. If it is settled it will contribute to the amelioration of the general climate, and it will militate in favour of a more stable Middle East.' In Washington yesterday Israel and Syria said they made no progress at Middle East talks in a crucial meeting to discuss the principle of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights in return for peace.

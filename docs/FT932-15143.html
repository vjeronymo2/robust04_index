			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour claims success on jobs UNEMPLOYMENT has risen five times faster in Conservative-controlled counties than their Labour counterparts, Labour claimed yesterday as it opened a fresh line of attack in its local election campaign, David Owen writes. Launching a survey on the 'success' of Labour councils in protecting companies and jobs, Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief Treasury secretary, said Labour had promoted economic development despite 'disastrous' Tory economic mismanagement. Labour said the jobless total in the last four years had risen by 193 per cent in Tory-controlled counties against an average of 37 per cent in Labour counties. The party also used a mid-campaign press conference and a party political broadcast to reinforce its principal election message that Labour councils provided better services and cost local taxpayers less. Labour claims that average council tax bills under Labour councils were Pounds 14 less than under Tory councils.</p>

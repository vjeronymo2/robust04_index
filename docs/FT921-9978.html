			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Golf: The last of the mega-projects - John Hopkins finds Robert Trent Jones is bucking a depressing trend UNTIL I heard about Les Domaines de Vidauban in Provence, I had thought the era of big golf course projects had gone the way of the small ball and the No 10 iron. All over Europe, particularly in Britain, big projects were being put up for sale or being restructured - victims of the recession and concern for the environment. Remember the Pounds 52m project on the banks of Loch Lomond that was to have rivalled Gleneagles for luxurious facilities? Or East Sussex National, the course that had designs on Augusta National, the site of the US Masters? The ambitious Scottish venture is still in the hands of the receivers 15 months after they were called in by the Bank of Scotland. No realistic buyer is in sight. East Sussex survives, thanks to a successful rescue operation, but as a shadow of its proposed self. Another casualty was Slaley Hall, the Pounds 20m golf and country club in Northumberland that went into receivership late last summer with debts of more than Pounds 20m. Liquidators Touche Ross recently turned down a Pounds 20m bid for the property. Clubs on mainland Europe have also been affected by the recession. In Austria, the lavish and luxurious Gut Altentann complex, where the Austrian Open is played on a course designed by Jack Nicklaus, has changed hands twice at least since it opened three years ago. Chateau les Forges, a 36-hole complex built by Swedes near Poitiers, western France, was due to open last August. Instead, it was up for sale. The Swedish management team have been removed, banks have taken the property over and it remains unsold. The asking price is FFr60m (Pounds 6.14m). And then I came across Vidauban, which is little more than a small town by the side of the motorway that runs between Toulon and Cannes and Nice. If the town is insignificant, the project certainly is not. Les Domaines de Vidauban is being built on rolling, wooded land 15 miles from St Tropez. When it is finished it will be the biggest golf-orientated project in Europe, bigger even than Sotogrande in Spain. It will eventually contain three golf courses, swimming pools, 40 tennis courts, horse riding, polo, two artificial lakes equipped for water sports, a nature reserve and six hotels. Each of the three courses will have 200 homes on it, which is not particularly dense compared with some courses in the US and Spain. Robert Trent Jones Snr, the golf course architect, bought the 2,500 acres at Vidauban 20 years ago when he saw that its pleasantly undulating, wooded landscape would be ideal for golf. He and his son Bobby have laid out the golf courses. 'The site represents one of those happy coincidences because the farmer who sold it to my father thought he was getting a bargain because it couldn't be farmed. It was too rough,' says Bob Jones. 'My father wanted it because he saw the land differently. He recognised the rolling terrain would be ideal for golf. It had lots of movement in it.' It was not until two years ago, when Bob Jones met Pierre Schnebelen, the Frenchman who developed Tignes as a ski resort in the French Alps, that sufficient development skills were brought to the project to get it started. Robert Trent Jones and Schnebelen became partners, and an initial Pounds 25m was raised. Then Schnebelen brought in Malik Bencheghib, chairman of Fonciere Malbe, to help with the finance and building, and Bencheghib in turn brought in Interconstruction, the French construction company which had built the Arche de la Defense in Paris. With a further injection of Pounds 15m, the project got underway in mid-summer last year. Now they are moving ahead rapidly. The show village was opened in the autumn. On January 1 this year a German businessman arrived from Munich and looked around. The next day he left having paid Pounds 1.3m for a house by the side of a fairway. The supporters of Vidauban point out that although France has quite a number of golf courses, and more are being built all the time, there are few if any venues this size. Claude Temple of Vidauban describes other courses in the region as providing 'le golf aperitif: small, short courses that do not feature good architecture. This is golf immobiliere, golf to sell houses.' With his tongue not too far into his cheek he says enthusiastically: 'The world is full of people waiting for Vidauban. Its time has come.' It is easy to be beguiled by Provence in January, when the mistral is not blowing and there are not hordes of holidaymakers dashing to St Tropez. The rugged red landscape stands out vividly beneath a gun-metal sky. Toulon airport, soon to be enlarged, is only 30 minutes away by car, and when the TGV stops at Vidauban it will be possible to travel from Paris to Vidauban in 3 1/2 hours by train. There are other pluses. In fire-ridden Provence, a golf course with sprinklers is considered to be a fire break, and thus seen to be good environmentally. It is also a bonus to have the considerable experience of Schnebelen, a man who spends time in a monastery, has written two books about meditation and is also building an enormous ski resort in Idaho. At Heathrow airport, returning from Provence, I was handed a sticker advertising a company called Pink Elephant Parking. It made me think: I hope Vidauban is not going to be a white elephant.</p>

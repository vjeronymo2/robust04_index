			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Appliance of UK science: The lessons of this week's white paper This week's science white paper follows in a long line of government policy statements whose central theme has been the need to harness UK research more effectively to wealth creation. The reorganisation of the Office of Science and Technology will give industry a bigger say in the way the government distributes its Pounds 1.2bn-a-year science budget. And the technique of 'technology foresight' will be introduced to pick those areas of research that are most likely to lead to winning products. But the evidence suggests that the emphasis of the white paper - adapting the science base to the needs of industry - should be the other way round. The overwhelming priority is for industry to reform itself to make better use of the excellent UK science base. Certainly, the success of the new strategy will depend far more on the attitudes of industrialists than on researchers or the government itself. International comparisons continue to give a high rating to British science across all subjects from clinical medicine to astrophysics. Its global impact far exceeds what would be expected from the UK's 5 per cent share of the world's research budget. Analysis by the US Institute for Scientific Information shows that since 1981 UK spending on science has fallen sharply compared with other industrialised countries, but the output has held up both in quantity and in quality. And there has been no decline in the performance of physics and engineering research compared with chemistry and the life sciences, to match the changes in the pattern of British manufacturing such as the rise of pharmaceuticals and decline of electronics. In the field of optics and acoustics, for example, UK scientists published 58 per cent more papers during the period 1988-92 than in 1981-85 and their influence - as measured by citations in other scientists' research - rose from 21 per cent to 46 per cent above the world average. Southampton University's opto-electronics research centre made a particularly important discovery in 1987 - how to make optical fibres carry messages for thousands of miles without loss - which Professor Alec Gambling, the director, says will rank in importance with the invention of the transistor. It has already been licensed by more than 30 users worldwide. In short, British universities and research laboratories offer a healthy flow of scientific expertise and new discoveries. But as Lord Flowers, chairman of the House of Lords science committee and a former rector of Imperial College, put it this week: 'Helping the horse to water will do little for his health unless he can be persuaded to drink. British industry must be induced to increase its commitment to research and innovation, or it will continue to fall behind.' Academic leaders understandably hate the idea that they may be forced to devote scarce public funds to industrial research that should be done by industry itself. 'Japanese companies invest about three times as much in research, development and training as UK companies - leading to innovative products and processes,' Dr David Harrison, chairman of the university vice-chancellors' committee, pointed out in his response to the white paper. According to the Department of Trade and Industry, UK manufacturers' spending on R&amp;D per employee is less than half that of their competitors in the US and Germany. That is why many of the 800 written submissions during the white paper's consultation period urged the government to introduce direct tax incentives for corporate R&amp;D - an idea which Mr William Waldegrave, the minister for science, rejected on the grounds that special tax subsidies encourage creative accounting and distort commercial investment decisions. Yet people familiar with industrial research know that discoveries are more likely to be commercialised if they are made and developed in-house than bought in from an outside laboratory - the well-known 'not invented here' syndrome. In fact, exciting results and discoveries are not the main thing that companies want from the science base, according to managers responsible for R&amp;D in industry and the DTI. 'Goodies sitting on the universities' shelves are fairly low down the list of priorities,' said one. At the top of the list, by general consensus, is a reliable supply of well-trained scientists and engineers. In that context, the most important policy announced in the white paper may be a shift in postgraduate education: more masters' degrees and fewer doctorates. Indeed the normal pattern will be for a student to complete a year's MSc before he or she is considered for a three-year PhD. The change is intended to reduce the large number of expensively trained PhDs looking for a much smaller number of academic posts - and at the same time give more people industrially oriented skills in the form of an MSc. But it has drawn a lukewarm response from industry. After trained manpower, industry wants new ideas from the science base. It is here that the government's 'technology foresight' proposals for identifying spending priorities could eventually pay a large dividend. The Office of Science and Technology stands a good chance of breaking down the academic-industrial divide if it draws enough experts from universities and industry into the 20 or 30 foresight panels which it plans to set up. They should include young enthusiasts as well as the greying men who have traditionally been delegated to liaise with government. British science continues to create a vast amount of knowledge and wealth for the world. The national question is whether it can be harnessed more effectively for the UK.</p>

Dr. Abu-Nuwar said the treacherous hand wherever it might be  will not succeed, and Jordan, led by His Majesty King Husayn,  will go forward without hesitation. He prayed for God's mercy  for the martyr who joined the galaxy of righteous martyrs.    The Senate members recited the opening sura of the Koran for  the martyr's soul.</p>

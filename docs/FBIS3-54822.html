"We would draw the attention of the international community  to these declarations, which probably mark the end of democracy  in Russia," the statement by the Estonian parliament said,  referring to New Year's eve comments by Yeltsin.    "Russia is choosing to emphasize so-called discrimination  against Russian-speakers. This risks a gradual hardening of  relations between the two countries. We must remain vigilant,"  the statement, released to AFP by a spokesman of the parliament,  said.    Yeltsin addressed a part of his New Year's message to  Russians living outside Russia, stressing that their rights  would be protected.    On Monday ITAR-TASS quoted Yeltsin's spokesman Vyacheslav  Kostikov as saying he wanted to protect "the rights of Russians  and the Russian-speaking population within the framework of  international law and based on the notion of pan-national  solidarity."    The comments were seen as a threat to the Baltic republics  of  Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, which have large Russian-speaking  minorities.    On Saturday the three states called on Yeltsin to ensure the  complete withdrawal of Russian troops from their soil by the end  of the year. All Russian forces have already left Lithuania,  but a number of units are still stationed in the other two  states.    The three states voiced concern last month when  ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy made an unexpectedly strong showing in legislative  elections.</p>

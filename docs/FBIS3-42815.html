			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> ["Commentary" by Irina Demchenko: "The Ukrainian Is Becoming </F> a Foreign Worker"]    [Text] By presidential decree, the Statute "On Recruiting  and Utilizing Foreign Manpower in Russia" was introduced  effective mid-December, in accordance with which citizens of any  foreign state, including states of the near abroad, may receive  jobs only by license and according to the quotas of each region  for recruiting foreign manpower overall and by occupational  specialty. Quotas have not been allocated, however, as the  Russian Federal Migration Service has noted.    In the words of Vladimir Volokh, deputy director of the  service, foreign workers, including Ukrainians, who are  presently working in Russia must be "licensed" and appropriately  registered. Otherwise they face threat of eviction. When job  vacancies arise, priority in filling them now goes to Russian  citizens according to the law; next in priority are refugees  from the near abroad, then persons who reside permanently in  Russia, and lastly--foreign workers. According to the new  statute, the dumping of a national labor force is not permitted,  i.e., a foreign citizen must receive no less for his labor than  what a citizen of Russia would be paid in his position. True, as  Vladimir Volokh noted, this international regulation is  routinely violated in all countries, especially by small-scale  private employers. A foreign worker has the right to receive the  same types of medical, cultural, and sports-related services as  do his Russian colleagues, as well as the same right to all  types of social benefits, including accrued labor tenure by  occupational specialty, compensation for injury incurred during  the course of labor activity, and so forth. All these provisions  apply not only to the worker himself, but to members of his  family residing with him as well.    However, not a single Ukrainian traveling to Russia to earn  money has to date been registered with the Directorate on Labor  Migrant Affairs of the Federal Migration Service. The only  exception is the rotating work crews that traditionally work at  oil production enterprises in Siberia and the Far East. In  Tyumen Oblast alone, according to the clearly understated  assessment of directorate chief Grigoriy Barabanov, about  150,000 Ukrainians are working at present, and in no way do all  of these comprise rotating work crews. In total, the directorate  believes, not fewer than 300,000-400,000 Ukrainians are working  in Russia, and this number is increasing every day. No one in  state organs knows--or, more accurately, they prefer not to  know--what kind of discrimination these people are subject to on  the job and in everyday life, and how dangerous for  Ukrainians--and for Russians as well, incidentally--the chase  after the "easy Russian ruble" is becoming, a pursuit that has  encompassed the near abroad.    The migration service explains that the requirement for  mandatory licensing does not apply to foreigners engaged in  science or culture who are working at institutions established  in Russia by intergovernmental agreement, crew members on ships  at sea and river vessels, students undergoing on-the-job  training at Russian enterprises, accredited journalists,  lecturers, instructors, and certain other categories of citizens.</p>

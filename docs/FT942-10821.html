			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Biotechnology (1): A long and arduous journey to success - While raising cash to support science is tricky, the profits to be gained from developing a top drug remain a strong magnet Stephen Peroutka is happy, excited and perhaps just a little nervous. Aged 40, he has just given up a senior job at one of the world's most successful biotechnology companies, Genentech. He now employs a staff of nine in a spartan office by California's interstate-101 freeway about 25 miles south of San Francisco. He is embarking on a journey that thousands of other entrepreneurially-minded scientists have made before him. He has started a company, Spectra Biomedical, that plans to discover how a disease works. Once the disease is understood, a team of scientists he has yet to recruit will find a way to treat it. A development team will take the treatment through several years of clinical trials to the doors of the Food and Drug Administration in Washington and its equivalents around the world. Finally, marketing and sales executives will put the newly approved treatment in front of doctors who (it is hoped) will be impressed enough to authorise its purchase by the truckload. Mr Peroutka will become a saviour to thousands of afflicted people, a millionaire - possibly a billionaire - a Nobel prize winner and revered elder statesman of the world's healthcare industries. Perhaps the most extraordinary aspect of the biotechnology business is that people believe in the possibility of successes such as this, and back their beliefs with cash. There are now more than 1,400 biotechnology companies around the world, half of which are in the US. More than 250 have achieved stock market quotations. Only five or six make an operating profit. One certainty is that Mr Peroutka's story will be different scientifically from those that have gone before. A decade ago, the drug interferon was hailed as a cure-all. It has turned out to have only limited use in cancer therapy. By the end of the 1980s proteins were all the rage. The idea was to make something that is already present in the body and avoid all the difficulties of side effects. Today, proteins are regarded as difficult to make, unstable and tricky to use because they have to be injected rather than swallowed. The latest fashion is in 'small molecules' - essentially the business end of a protein. With all the unnecessary parts discarded, a small molecule can mimic the action of a protein and is cheap as well as easy to make, store and administer. But while science moves quickly, the business of raising the money to support it remains gruelling. Mr Peroutka has got off to a good start by securing the personal backing of one of the doyens of California venture capital, Eugene Kleiner, a man behind many of the electronics and computer industry start-ups of the 1960s and 1970s. Mr Peroutka's team is already working to find the genetic basis of migraine. He has attracted attention from potential corporate partners in the US and in Europe. Soon he will do deals with venture capitalists, pharmaceuticals companies and Wall Street. Three thousand miles away, in Cambridge Massachusetts, Alison Taunton-Rigby, an expatriate Briton, is well into the second round of venture capital financing for her company Mitotix. Her company has been recruiting fast, searching for the cell scientists which it wants in order to develop cancer treatments. It has taken advantage of the restructuring of the pharmaceuticals industry. With job security no longer guaranteed, a biotechnology company promises growth rather than contraction. Yet times are tough for a small biotechnology company. Mitotix has 40 employees and its few dollars of venture capital are beginning to look small. Wall Street is unenthusiastic about the whole healthcare industry so Mitotix is looking for corporate partners. 'We approached nine Japanese companies of which four to five have expressed interest and that has been narrowed down to three companies,' says Ms Taunton-Rigby. Talks are still going on. One day, Mitotix may find itself in the position of a company such as British Biotechnology. With 300 employees and an asthma collaboration with Europe's biggest drugs company Glaxo, it has just completed a financing round that raised more than Pounds 90m over two years. Or it could go the way of fellow Massachusetts company Vertex which has used a string of corporate deals as the basis for building cash reserves of Dollars 104m, almost Dollars 1m for each of its 115 employees. The company has a contract in Aids research with UK drugs company, Wellcome, in which Vertex believes it drove a hard bargain because it had both the expertise - in an area called proteases - and a strong financial position. 'Wellcome had to do the deal,' explains Joshua Boger, company president. 'We took advantage of that. Merck (the biggest US drugs company) and others were already into proteases.' Vertex's financial strength brings it more than further cash. 'We are especially pleased with the non-cash resources that have been put into these deals,' he says. 'In Wellcome's case the details have not been released, but French company Roussel put in more than 30 scientists in Paris and Swindon.' Mr Boger makes little attempt to hide his ambition to become a global force in the healthcare industry. Back in California, Chiron Corporation has almost done so. Last year it saw the approval of multiple sclerosis treatment Betaseron, which it now makes for Schering of Germany to sell. It has made profits for five quarters in a row and promises more thanks to joint ventures with Swiss company Ciba to develop Aids and herpes vaccines and licence deals in other areas with Germany's Bayer and Johnson &amp; Johnson of the US. Chiron remains a biotechnology company in technological terms. In financial and management terms, it is practically a drugs company. Edward Penhoet, chief executive, has 2,250 employees and deals with the problems that face ordinary companies. 'When we get too big we divide it to try to keep the small company culture. We keep the management structure flat. Our target is five layers and we get close to it,' he says, sounding like a career general manager. But Mr Penhoet is not so different from Mr Peroutka. He gave up security as a tenured professor at Berkeley just over a decade ago. He moved three miles south from one of the US's most prestigious academic institutions to offices in disused dockyards across the Bay Bridge from San Francisco. In the 13 years since he and two colleagues started Chiron, Mr Penhoet has seen many rivals fall. Chiron itself took over Cetus in 1991. Last year saw the spectacular failure at late stages of development of sepsis drugs made by established stock market quoted companies Xoma, Centocor and Synergen. Both in spite of and because of such failures, the life cycle of a biotechnology company embodies the US way of doing business. Sheer belief can make things happen; success attracts success. Investment draws in talented people who get things done and attracts further finance. Waves of investors get in and then sell out at a higher price to the next wave. Many down the line will find they have bought worthless paper. The idea that seduced them failed. The scientists move on, the entrepreneur starts another company, the next scientific fashion is in vogue. But the ultimate goal is no longer a dream for southern California's Amgen. Fourteen years old and with 3,100 employees, it already has one product - blood treatment Epogen - which is among the world's top five selling drugs. By the end of the decade it will have two in the top five and Epogen will have displaced Glaxo's ulcer treatment Zantac at number one, according to forecasts from analysts at stockbroker Lehman Brothers. Amgen stands at the top of the biotechnology pyramid. Like many before him, Stephen Peroutka has begun his climb. He will not be the last.</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT VOIDS TEXAS SCHOOL-FUNDING SYSTEM  </P> <P> The Texas Supreme Court found "glaring disparities" between the state's rich  and poor school districts and ruled Monday that funding within the nation's  second-largest system is unconstitutional.  </P> <P> Spending varies by as much as $17,000 per pupil per year from rich to poor  districts, the court found.  </P> <P> "A remedy is long overdue," Justice Oscar Mauzy's opinion said. "The  Legislature must take immediate action."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Enormous Implications  </P> <P> The 9-0 ruling could have enormous financial and social implications for the  3.3-million-student Texas school system, second in size to California's.  </P> <P> The court found that the public school finance system violates the 113-year-old  constitutional provision for an "efficient system" of public schools. It set a  May 1, 1990, deadline for legislators to find a solution.  </P> <P> State attorneys had argued that the word "efficient" was intended to suggest a  "simple and inexpensive system."  </P> <P> But the court said: "The state's school financing system is neither financially  efficient nor efficient in the sense of providing for a 'general diffusion of  knowledge' statewide.  </P> <P> "It must be recognized that the constitution requires an 'efficient,' not an  'economical,' 'inexpensive' or 'cheap' system," Mauzy said.  </P> <P> "A Band-Aid will not suffice; the system itself must be changed," the court  warned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Special Session Planned  </P> <P> Gov. Bill Clements said that he will call a special 30-day session of the  Legislature in the spring. Nearly $10 billion in state money will be made  available for public schools in 1990-91, and almost $12 billion is expected to  come from local districts.  </P> <P> A state district judge in Austin had ruled that the school funding system was  unconstitutional in a case brought by school districts with low property values  against the state education commissioner and others. That ruling was overturned  last December by a 2-1 vote of the Austin-based 3rd Court of Appeals.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, known as Edgewood vs. Kirby, was filed in 1984. Public schools are  funded largely through a combination of local property taxes and state aid. The  federal government also contributes.  </P> <P> Because of the disparities in district property wealth, annual spending per  student ranges from $2,112 to $19,333, the high court said.  </P> <P> The case got its title from the lead plaintiff, Edgewood Independent School  District in San Antonio, and lead defendant, William Kirby, education  commissioner.  </P> <P> Edgewood School Supt. James Vasquez led about 1,800 students and teachers in a  celebration rally Monday. The high school's marching band played and students  waved banners with sayings like "Victory" and "Edgewood All the Way." A marquee  at the stadium's entrance read "Texas Children 9, Kirby 0."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Toughest' District  </P> <P> "Today, we can begin to say we're no longer the poorest school district in  Texas -- we're the toughest," Vasquez told cheering students and teachers. "We  took on the state of Texas and we beat 'em."  </P> <P> In Dallas, Education Commissioner Kirby said, "As the lead defendant in this  case, I have been required to defend the constitutionality of the system. But I  have always maintained that it is not adequate and have pressed for additional  amounts of money to improve equity."  </P> <P> Olivia Besteiro, president of the Texas State Teachers Assn., said, "History  will mark this day as the opening of the door to opportunity for tens of  thousands, even millions, of children. These children have been the victims of  'segregated' opportunity determined by a geographical roll of the dice."  </P></p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Indigestion drugs gain over-the-counter approval Two powerful indigestion remedies have been approved for sale without a doctor's prescription. The UK is the first country to license over-the-counter sales of Tagamet and Pepcid. Together they represent the most important extension of the OTC market for more than a decade. The two drugs will be in competition, since both work in the same way by suppressing acid production in the stomach. They were developed originally to treat ulcers. SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet was the world's best-selling prescription medicine in the 1980s until overtaken by Glaxo's ulcer drug Zantac, which is not yet available without a prescription. Last year Tagamet sales were worth Pounds 673m to the UK-US pharmaceutical group. Pepcid has a more complicated corporate background. It was developed by Yamanouchi of Japan and licensed to Merck of the US. But Pepcid's OTC sales in the UK are handled by Centra, a UK joint venture of Merck and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Both drugs will be promoted for relief of heartburn, dyspepsia and excess acid. Centra plans to spend Pounds 5m over the next year advertising Pepcid. They will be competing against a wide range of traditional antacids, which give short-term relief by neutralising stomach acids but do not have the same long-term effect on acid-producing cells as Tagamet and Pepcid. The UK market for OTC indigestion remedies is worth about Pounds 60m a year, said Ms Sheila Kelly, executive director of the Proprietary Association of Great Britain, the trade body for non-prescription medicines. But the two newcomers are likely to add substantially to the total sales in this sector, she says. 'At present, one quarter of all indigestion episodes are not treated at all.' SmithKline Beecham hopes that the new non-prescription market for Tagamet will make up for some of the sales lost when the drug loses its main US patent in May. The Food and Drug Administration is still looking at SmithKline Beecham's application for OTC Tagamet.</p>

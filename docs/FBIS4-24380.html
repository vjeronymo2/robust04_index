			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 28 (AFP)--Chinese dissident  intellectual Yu Haocheng left Beijing Saturday for the United  States, more than three years after he first applied to the  authorities here for an exit visa, his wife said. "Yu left this  morning on a Northwest Airlines flight for New York," where he  is to take up a research and teaching post at Columbia  University, his wife said.    A leading expert on constitutional law, the 68-year-old Yu  was placed under house arrest in the northern suburbs of Beijing  for more than one year after the June 1989 pro-democracy  crackdown. On May 14, 1989, Yu had joined 11 other  intellectuals in a public appeal to the government to declare  the student-led pro-democracy campaign "a patriotic democracy  movement."    Formerly a director of the Public Security Department's  Masses Publishing House, Yu was effectively forced into  retirement in 1986 for allegedly publishing "questionable" books  and advocating political and legal reforms.    Since his release from house arrest in late 1990, he  continued to speak out on the need for fundamental legal reforms  and to publish dissident-style views in the foreign media. Yu's  repeated applications to leave China so that he might accept  invitations from abroad had previously all been turned down, but  he finally received a passport on May 9. The decision to grant  Yu a passport was widely seen as as a gesture to the United  States in the run up to President Bill Clinton's decision on  whether to renew China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading  status. Freedom to leave China had been one of the conditions  set by Washington for MFN renewal.    Clinton renewed China's MFN Thursday with only limited  sanctions, and abandoned his policy of linking trade issues with  human rights.</p>

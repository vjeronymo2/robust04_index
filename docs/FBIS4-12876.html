			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Vijay Dutt] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, March 28 -- Prime Minister P.V.  Narasimha Rao's visit to the U.S. in early May, expected to make  a significant breakthrough in the Indo-U.S. relations, is also  likely to help in the projection of issues and problems of the  south countries to the Clinton Administration, coming that his  visit is soon after the G-15 summit in New Delhi.    A believer in a conciliatory rather than confrontationist  attitude over international developmental issues, Mr. Rao, as  the leading statesman from a major Third World country, will  convey the conclusions at the G-15 meet to President Clinton,  who has the primacy in G-7. It is expected that the two leaders  would confer on the programmes of the developing countries and  draw attention of the G-7 members for their coordination and  collaboration on a global scale. Mr. Rao is likely to charter a  closer working alliance between G-7 and G-15.    The date of the visit, tentatively fixed for May 6, will be  firmed up when Mr. Strobe Talbott, number two in the State  Department, comes to Delhi for discussions on April 6 and when  India's Ambassador Siddharta Shankar Ray would also be present.    Mr. Talbott is presumed to come with a better understanding  of India's stand on Kashmir, its views on the proposed supply of  F-16s to Pakistan, the measures taken in regard to human rights  and more crucially the depth of resentment in the country at the  anti-India tilt in the statements of Ms. Robin Raphel in the  last few months. He is also expected to dispel the impression  that Ms. Raphel is, for President Clinton the primary  policy-moderator on South Asia and has prejudiced him against  India.    Ms. Raphel's visit, according to sources, was basically  treated at official levels, as a prelude to Mr. Talbott's, when  wide-ranging discussions would be held for firming up the agenda  for Mr. Rao's visit.    Refuting the criticism that too much importance was given to  a junior Ievel U.S. official and that Mr. S.B. Chavan and other  senior officials bent backwards to appease Ms. Raphel, a  spokesperson said that she was just given the opportunity to  explain the nuances of her recent statements and posture.  India's uneasiness at them was firmly conveyed to her and its  impact reflected in her statement at the end of her stay here.    Ms. Raphel did attempt to erase the impression that her  seemingly Pakistan bias determines America's South Asia policy.  Mr. Talbott is also likely to bolster this further in an  attempt to prepare positive atmosphere for Mr. Rao's Washington  trip.    There is a guarded optimism on both sides regarding the  visit. President Clinton, whose passion for domestic affairs  borders on the frantic, is likely to strike a cordant note with  Mr. Rao, who has been explicit in stressing that his economic  policies are aimed at reaching the benefits of development to  the underprivileged.    President Clinton too has been ambitious about his domestic  agenda and been wary of letting his involvement with foreign  affairs affect it. He has been, despite controversies arising  over pursuing them, concentrating on health care programme and  social security plans in an attempt to bring the poor into their  ambit.    In his several meetings with foreign heads of state,  President Clinton has shown greater keenness in discussing their  development policies than international affairs. He and Mr. Rao  are sure to find themselves on the same wave length when it  comes to perceptions on social welfare. Their pursuit of  development for the lowest layer of the social pyramid, hope  officials, will be the basic meeting ground to build on the  relations, presently under strain.    The Clinton Administration shaken by the Whitewater  controversy and charged with nonchalance in matters relating to  foreign relations, would be eager to notch a few positive  conclusions from the visit. This will send the right signal to  other Third World countries of Washington's serious approach for  good ties and cooperation.    The Americans are aware that Mr. Rao's acceptance of their  invitation is based on the sober assessment of the excellent  economic relations, traditional ties in various fields and the  fact that both countries share similar democratic values and  respect each other's adherence to democracy.    Looking over all these positive factors, the view of those  who felt that a certain coolness should be conveyed and the PM's  visit kept on hold, was prevailed upon by those who firmly  believed that the Prime Minister, especially after his extremely  fruitful visit to the UK and India's diplomatic victory in  Geneva, would surely succeed in projecting the status of Jammu  and Kashmir and the steps taken for human rights to President  Clinton, his senior officials and the intellectuals and  opinion-makers whose views matter in Washington.    The extra-sensitive concern whicb the Clinton Administration  is exhibiting over supposedly human rights violations is again  based on the premise that it is legitimate for them to interfere  in domestic human rights situation anywhere in the world. Be it  Salvador or India, it considers itself perfectly justified in  playing the role of a guardian of human rights. The U.S.  Administration is woefully unaware of the steps taken in India  for preserving human rights.    The move for the one time uplifting of the Pressler  Amendment  to enable the sale of F-16s to Pakistan is also a serious matter  of concern to India. Senator Pressler, who is bitterly opposed  to it, went public but the Administration is reportedly  confident of persuading the Senate to permit the sale of 38  (instead of the earlier plan for 71), which would double the  number of F-16s Pakistan has presently.    All these aspects, which have become irritants in the  bilateral relations and have caused apprehension about  Washington's attitude towards India are expected to be thrashed  out, even if they cannot be satisfactorily resolved immediately.</p>

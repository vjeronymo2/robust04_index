			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Plan to speed up EC justice The parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a proposal yesterday to make recourse to the European Court of Human Rights quicker, Reuter reports from Strasbourg. At present, a group or individual taking a case to the Court goes through the European Commission on Human Rights, which weighs whether cases should be referred to the Court and rejects some 90 per cent of them. The proposal by the parliamentary assembly, which would have to be approved by foreign ministers from the 27 member states of the Council, suggests dropping the Commission so that cases would go direct to the Court and be filtered there.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the Court's request that the parties confer, OFCCP placed on the record herein the statement that such are precisely the terms presented to Commonwealth. In contrast, Commonwealth asserts that even such an arrangement does not protect it from liability to the individual employees. This exchange, which occurred after the Court announced its decision, persuades the Court that Commonwealth is irreparably harmed, since OFCCP lacks the requisite ability to shield Commonwealth from all liability in the event Commonwealth extends offers of employment and later succeeds here. These facts, therefore, are not parallel to those which existed in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Uniroyal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Going on to the third element, public interest, and the fourth, harm to others. The Court has heard testimony concerning Commonwealth being a new company with a different approach. The Court has also heard testimony concerning administrative delay. There is a legitimate public interest in wanting employers to offer employment opportunities to everyone regardless of disability, regardless of age, gender, race, all of those factors. If this heightens the public interest, then it also heightens the government's responsibility. If there is a high government responsibility, then waiting seven or eight years to render an opinion frustrates the purposes of the Rehabilitation Act. In the Court's opinion, the government has acted, if not unconscionably, perhaps unfairly. Therefore, in the Court's opinion, the public interest_if it does swing over to the side of the government at the outset_swings back because of the administrative delay that has occurred here. Whether this case is considered on an expedited basis or not, there is no further harm to the government. There is some value in the employer being able to rely on its understanding that at some point a proceeding is ended. It is not reasonable to wait seven years and come in and do something and then expect immediate compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As far as harm to any third parties, the employees who are still in the work force are working now. To the extent that Commonwealth should lose this case on its merits, those employees can gain monetary relief, and that will be satisfactory. The Court will not hear a claim about the public agency's harm to it because of the delay that has been involved here. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Preliminary Injunction and Order <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Based upon the foregoing Findings and Conclusions, it is Ordered and Adjudged  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

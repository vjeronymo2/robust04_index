			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Clean-up prior to going on sale: The urgent need for reform of central Europe's banking system For more than three years the bankers of post-communist central Europe have been waiting in vain for economic growth to solve the problems of loss-making state enterprises. But growth has proved elusive. Ironically, this is partly because the banks, ill-equipped to assess risk and weighed down by large levels of bad debt inherited from the communist past, have been unable to respond flexibly and imaginatively to the needs of a rapidly expanding private sector. Now, as Poland and the fast-track economic reformers of central Europe stand poised for a resumption of growth, a radical overhaul of the banking sector, including privatisation of state-owned commercial banks, has become a high priority for governments, central banks and western lending institutions. The need for urgent modernisation was highlighted in a recent report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a joint study by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund into the specific ailments of the Hungarian banking system (see below). EBRD officials estimate that bad debts represent some 60 per cent of the balance sheet of the largest east European banks, adding that recapitalisation and the introduction of competition, ideally through privatisation, was now urgently needed. Throughout the region, singling out the main bad debtors has become the first stage in tackling the wider problems of undercapitalised, debt-laden banks. The second, more expensive stage of recapitalisation requires privatisation and funds from both tightly stretched national budgets and international institutions. It is in Poland, where the dangers of an unregulated banking system were graphically illustrated three years ago by the failure of the ART-B bank with an estimated loss of Dollars 500m, that the privatisation process is most advanced. It began four months ago with the sale of Wielkopolski Bank Kreditowy, the first of nine state-owned commercial banks to be privatised in the region; the EBRD is a principal shareholder. Last month the government announced that 60 per cent of Bank Slanski, the leading bank in the industrialised Silesian province, would be auctioned to private foreign and domestic investors shortly. Seven other state-owned regional banks, all hived off from the National Bank of Poland, the central bank, four years ago, are also earmarked for sale. While the Poles have taken the lead on reform, the Czechs have taken a different approach which involves, first, the partial removal of bad debt from the books of banks awaiting privatisation. The Czech government has set up a special institution, the Konsolidacni Banka (Consolidation Bank), to tackle inter-enterprise debt. This has accumulated as factory managers have bypassed the banks by supplying each other with goods and services that they have not paid for. An idea of the compulsive limits that this process can reach was revealed in a recent report by Salomon Brothers, the New York-based investment bank. The study noted that mutual default on payments between enterprises grew 82-fold in Russia over the first half of last year and had become the main source of financing economic activity in that country. Central Europe does not have a problem on the Russian scale. But in 1991 a third of the total Kcs250bn debt portfolio of Komercni Bank, the largest Czech state-owned commercial bank, was transferred to the Konsolidacni Banka, which acts in effect as a state-financed 'dustbin' for non-performing loans. A different approach is being attempted by the former Yugoslav republic of Slovenia, which has issued 30-year government-guaranteed bonds worth DM3.5bn. The bonds will be swapped for specific portions of the bad debt held by Ljubljanska Bank and other state-owned commercial banks. Across eastern Europe, refinancing inherited bad debts and 'cleaning' balance sheets is being undertaken as a prelude to privatisation. It is accompanied by an explosion of spending on training and new equipment and a big effort to strengthen the supervisory functions of the central banks. The Czech banks alone have created 50,000 jobs in the past three years. In some cases, as in newly independent Slovakia and Slovenia, central banks have had to be created. Elsewhere, existing central banks, which used to deal with virtually all banking business in the centralised communist system, have been remodelled on western lines and told by their governments to concentrate on banking supervision. Governments have also introduced banking laws covering bankruptcy and related issues, to bring financial markets legislation into line with the European Community. To attract much-needed expertise as well as fresh capital, western banks are being encouraged to set up local branches or take stakes in the new state-owned commercial banks (hived off from central banks) and the small, under-capitalised local private banks. Many of the smaller private banks were set up in the lawless early days of post-communist euphoria by private entrepreneurs or enterprising state factory managers to raise capital for their own needs. Some have already folded and most face rapid demise unless they receive injections of capital and knowhow. Some, like Poland's ART-B, have been closed after the belated discovery of large-scale fraud and embezzlement. The introduction of western-style laws, with their demands for greater financial transparency and minimum reserve requirements, has exposed the fragile condition of many of the region's banks. The loan books of state-owned commercial banks are full of what were once regarded as the jewels of socialist industry. But most of these so-called jewels, especially the privileged defence plants, were found to be severely tarnished with non-performing loans granted under political, rather than economic, priorities. 'Now the state-owned banks are caught in a trap,' said Mr Gyorgy Suranyi, a former governor of the Hungarian central bank, who runs Central-European International Bank, the oldest, largest and most profitable of the private joint-venture banks set up with Hungarian and foreign capital. 'Bad loans mean higher provisions. These require higher profits, which in turn require the state-owned banks to seek higher spreads (between borrowing costs and lending rates) and higher fees. In this way the banks gradually lose their best clients or weaken the performance of those which remain,' he said. The handicaps borne by the new state-owned banks have placed them at a big disadvantage as they try to confront competition from banks such as CIB and other joint-venture banks, formed with foreign partners or with the local branches of wholly owned overseas banks. Unencumbered by inherited debt burdens, the banks with foreign links have lured away many of the state-owned commercial banks' best customers, including the multinational corporations and other foreign investors who have poured more than Dollars 9bn into central Europe over the past three years. For instance, CIB has grabbed some General Electric business from Magyar Hitel bank, Hungary's largest commercial bank. Experienced and globally well-connected, the foreign banks have also been able to pick up a growing share of profitable niche services, such as foreign trade finance. But the specialised state-owned foreign trade banks, such as Bank Handlowy in Poland or Hungary's Kulkereskedelmi Bank, which in the communist era enjoyed a near monopoly of trade finance, have managed to hold on to a large share of this business despite the inroads by new players. As the World Bank, the EBRD, and governments throughout the region prepare to invest heavily in an effort to clear the decks for what they hope will be profitable lending in the future, many of the region's most experienced private sector bankers, like Mr Suranyi, argue that the need for further capital injections will persist until the privatisation process is complete. But central European governments cannot afford repeated bail-outs while committed to tight IMF-imposed budget constraints and a host of competing claims on their slender resources. Ultimately, their lack of cash will prove the most powerful force behind the drive to modernise and privatise the banking system. From then on, it will be up to the managers and shareholders of banks to shoulder the responsibility for making lending decisions on a purely commercial basis - and to pay the price if they fail.</p>

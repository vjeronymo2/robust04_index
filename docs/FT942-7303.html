			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Skills gap with Germany revealed British manufacturers continue to trail their German opposite numbers in the training of technicians and the use of postgraduate engineers and scientists. That is the conclusion of an analysis of chemical and engineering companies in the two countries by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. In a survey last year, the researchers found a bigger skills and performance gap in four pairs of engineering companies compared with three pairs of chemical companies. The British engineering plants had improved productivity substantially over 15 years, but still trailed the German plants. They were also 'followers' in technical innovation. 'British price competitiveness still depends heavily on favourable movements in exchange rates,' says the report. By contrast, the analysis in chemicals pointed to a similar performance between the two countries. 'Most British plants were at least equal to and sometimes ahead of their German counterparts in the use of new, sophisticated capital equipment.' The German plants were well ahead on shopfloor qualifications: in chemicals 45 per cent of Germans had a craft apprenticeship compared with 23 per cent in Britain. In engineering the gap was wider, 57 per cent to 20 per cent. These differences were even sharper at the intermediate-technician level, with virtually all German supervisors trained to meister level and only 5 per cent of British supervisors with any specific training for their role. The proportion of technical and higher-degree graduates was similar in the chemical industry, but the German plants had more than double the British level in engineering. Germany is taking more postgraduate level students who are regarded by UK employers as 'over-qualified' and lacking commercial aptitude.

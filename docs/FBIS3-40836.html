			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by C. Raja Mohan: "U.S. Offers To Push Indo-Pak </F> Talks"; quotation marks as published]    [Text] Washington, Jan. 5. The United States will continue  to prod India and Pakistan to work at resolving various issues  that bedevil mutual relations, according to sources in the  Clinton administration. They see the just concluded round of  dialogue in Islamabad as a useful first step in a process with  significant potential.    The sources are not surprised at the testy nature of the  dialogue and its tentative outcome insisting that only India and  Pakistan can resolve their differences, the administration  expressed its readiness to help facilitate a forward movement in  the dialogue.    In a separate written response to reporters, the State  department yesterday declared its "strong support" for the  resumption of talks at the level of Foreign Secretaries. The  administration has for some time been pressing both countries to  resume the "high-level" dialogue that last took place in August  1992. Although Washington did not publicly take credit for the  resumption, the American pressure apparently was a key factor in  the renewal of the Indo-Pakistani dialogue.    The State department welcomed the "agreement in principle"  reached in Islamabad to continue the talks at the `Foreign  Secretary or other levels.' The administration hopes that  `further talks can take place soon.'    The State department said, "We agree that a meaningful  dialogue is needed to peacefully resolve the issues between  India and Pakistan. To that end, we encourage both parties to  approach the entire range of issues constructively with the aim  of achieving tangible agreements leading to reduced tensions."    To another written question on the U.S. mediatory role, it  declared that "we do not see ourselves in a mediator's role."  However, "the U.S. is willing to assist India and Pakistan to  reach and implement agreements if they both so desire."    Dialogue on Kashmir: The written response made no  direct mention of the Kashmir dispute. But sources in the  administration referred to its complex nature and the difficulty  both India and Pakistan face in making hard political and  psychological adjustments to their traditional diplomatic  posture on Kashmir.    The sources also believe that the process of the dialogue on  Kashmir should be seen as being productive by the people in the  valley. India needs to go beyond the small steps it has taken on  the human rights front, and initiate a genuine political process  in the troubled State. The sources regret that despite much talk  about a political initiative, New Delhi is yet to set in motion  a new process in the valley. They also note that the  Indo-Pakistan dialogue on Kashmir would be a long slog.    Questioned on the basic tension between the Pakistani  approach to emphasising the resolution of the core issue --  Kashmir -- and the Indian call for progress on a broad front of  bilateral relations, the sources suggest that this may not be  unique to the sub-continent. They point to West Asia, where  Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation have made  substantial progress in resolving their bilateral conflict,  sidestepping the so-called core issues like the status of  Jerusalem. This pragmatic, and typically American, approach to  problem-solving is widely shared in Washington.    Dr. Mitchell Riess, a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Centre,  suggested that progress on other issues should not be held  hostage to the resolution of the Kashmir dispute. Noting that an  agreement on Siachen is at hand, Dr. Riess pointed out that  movement on resolving smaller issues could generate a political  momentum and the right diplomatic ambience to address the larger  issues. "Solve what you can and keep talking."    Welcoming the resumption of the dialogue, Dr. Michael  Krepon,  director of the Henry L. Stimson Centre which has in recent  years taken consistent interest in Indo-Pakistani  confidence-building, noted that several impediments to conflict  resolution and confidence-building measures in the Sub-continent  had been removed. The positive results of the latest elections  in Pakistan and India, he believes, may have paved the way for a  sober approach to problem solving in the Indian sub-continent.    Dr. Krepon is apprehensive that without a political  initiative at the highest level it may not be possible to  realise the full potential of the Indo-Pakistani dialogue. But  sources in the administration note the constraints on the  leadership in both the countries imposed by the partisan  rhetoric and their political opponents. They refer to the  enormous concrete work that needs to be done in New Delhi and  Islamabad to push the dialogue forward.    In one important Pakistani response available here, Mr.  Abdus  Sattar, who recently served as the Foreign Minister of that  country, wished that the Islamabad talks had resulted in a more  tangible progress. Mr. Sattar, currently a distinguished fellow  at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, was earlier the  Foreign Secretary of Pakistan and posted twice as High  Commissioner to India. Mr. Sattar lamented that while there was  an incredible movement in conflict resolution in South Africa,  West Asia and northern Ireland, India and Pakistan had lagged  behind.    Interestingly, the recent dialogue has attracted little  attention in the U.S. media. The written response of the State  department came only when the spokesman, who had no prepared  answer, was questioned by the reporters from the sub-continent.  For all anxieties in India and hopes in Pakistan about an  American role in Kashmir, the issue barely figurtes in the  foreign policy discourse in Washington. Only the few South Asia  hands inside the State department and outside in this town  appear concerned about the future of Kashmir or Indo-Pakistani  relations.  <H5>  Raphael Comments `Unfortunate' </H5> <H5>  PTI reports from New York </H5>   Mr. Gary Ackerman, Chairman of the U.S. House subcommittee  on  South Asia and Pacific Affairs, has described as "very  unfortunate" and "regrettable" the remarks by Ms. Robin Raphael,  Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia, questioning the  legality of the accession of Kashmir to India. "I think it does  not indicate any shift or change whatsoever in the official U.S.  policy."    Asked about Pakistani-trained militants indulging in  terrorism in Kashmir, he said terrorism anywhere was of great  concern to humanity. "There are problems in Kashmir. There are  those who foment trouble. There are always those who commit  terrorist acts. It is time when Governments should exercise  their legitimate rights to maintain order."    In this connection, Mr. Ackerman stressed the need for  "appropriate handling" of the cases of excesses that the  security forces sometime committed while handling terrorism.    On human rights, he was `very happy' to see that the  situation in India was improving all the time. Replying to a  question, he said India's nuclear programme so far "seems to be  fairly responsible." But India must sign the nuclear  non-proliferation treaty and open facilities to inspection. He  would like to see New Delhi open up the process completely and  be a member in good standing of the treaty.    The U.S. had same concerns with India as with other nations  whether friendly or not. "We have the same concern with China on  a larger scale and everywhere there is nuclear (weapon)  potential or nuclear capability." "We have a terrible problem  with China's nuclear programme. We have a terrible problem with  North Korea and the Ukraine."</p>

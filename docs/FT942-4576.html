			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Hauliers warn on Channel tunnel Eurotunnel risks a crisis of confidence among customers if it has further problems with its freight shuttle service through the Channel tunnel, the Road Haulage Association warned yesterday, Jimmy Burns and Charles Batchelor write. The warning came after the temporary suspension of a train service yesterday because of technical problems - the second such incidence in 11 days. Mr Sydney Balgarnie of the association said: 'If they haven't got this problem cracked soon, there is going to be trouble. People do not want to get stranded in the tunnel. People want reliability and if they don't get it they will use the ferries instead.' Eurotunnel said the two incidents were unrelated although both involved warning lights that signalled non-existent faults. In one the warning indicated that the ramps used by trucks driving on to the shuttles were extended, while in the second a light warned that a train's anti-skid mechanism was not working. In yesterday's incident drivers of lorries travelling on the shuttles were evacuated from the tunnel. Mr John Noulton, Eurotunnel's public-affairs director, said: 'These were irritations. It is what you would expect at this stage of introducing a new railway. The trains could have continued normally but at this stage of the system our procedures are very strict and we followed them to the letter.' Eurotunnel has been operating for just over two weeks and has run about 200 trains through the tunnel.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PREVIEW: FESTIVAL BRINGS A BIT OF THE EMERALD ISLE TO L.A.  </P> <P> Dennis Doyle vividly remembers the Sunday morning 15 years ago when a visiting  Irish priest conducted Mass in Gaelic. Doyle, a third-generation Irishman, had  never heard the ancient language of his ancestors.  </P> <P> "Something inside me stirred," said Doyle, an English teacher at Glendale  Community College, and church pianist. "I woke up. I wanted to learn about my  culture, my history. I began studying the harp. It's the national instrument of  Ireland."  </P> <P> Today, Doyle, 37, is an acclaimed harpist, specializing in Ireland's  traditional forms of music. He tours festivals and gives concerts and lectures  throughout the country several months each year. Doyle will perform at the 16th  annual Grand National Irish Fair and Music Festival, from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.  Saturday and Sunday at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center.  </P> <P> "Dennis is not only a fantastic musician, but he's also the director of the  festival's entire traditional music section," said Terrance Anderson, president  of the Grand National Irish Fair. Other performers at the fair include Patrick  Street, Paddy Noonan's Irish Cabaret, Barley Bree's Irish Showband, Paddy  Reilly and Eileen Ivers.  </P> <P> Traditional Irish songs date back 2,000 years. Unlike the popular pub songs of  today, old-style music was exclusively for the aristocracy, Doyle said. A big  change in Irish culture occurred following the Battle of Boyne in 1692, when  the British defeated the Gaelic forces. "The Gaelic language was outlawed," he  said. The Gaelic music of the upper-classes was driven underground. It was  passed on and maintained by peasants, he said.  </P> <P> "Now it's Irish folk music. Sometimes it's called 'hedge school' music because  the Irish couldn't study their language or music in schools, so they secretly  gathered along the hedges to learn," Doyle said.  </P> <P> In addition to old-style Gaelic music, entertainment at the two-day fair  includes storytellers, jugglers, magicians, Irish step dancing, theater  readings, an Irish wolfhound show and the West Coast Connemara Horse Show, said  Anderson, a Studio City resident and founding member of the festival.  </P> <P> There will also be gifts and food available.  </P> <P> "Our first year's attendance was about 1,500," he said. "We're looking at about  50,000 people now -- not really surprising when you think about how many  Americans have some Irish blood," Anderson said. "But it's more than that. The  Irish have a joy of life that permeates the very soul. Just think about it.  What's the one holiday that everyone celebrates? The wearing of the green --  St. Patrick's Day."  </P> <P>  The Grand National Irish Fair and Music Festival from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.  Saturday and Sunday at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center, 480 Riverside Drive,  Burbank. Admission is $12, $7 for seniors, $4 for children 13 to 17 and free  for children 12 and younger. For further information: (818) 509-8177. HEATHER  W. MORGAN  </P></p>

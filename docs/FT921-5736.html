			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Stop dragging feet on world trade talks, Germany tells EC GERMANY told its EC partners yesterday to stop dragging their feet over long-delayed world trade talks, Reuter reports from Brussels. 'Any further delay in the negotiations at this stage ..could increase the acute danger of failure,' Mr Jorgen Molleman, trade minister, told a meeting of farm and trade ministers. The ministers met for an informal lunch at which France made it plain it would seek a tough stance against making concessions in Gatt talks, already more than a year over schedule. Mr Molleman said he believed the US was ready to talk, though it could still show more flexibility, and that the EC should do likewise without more ado. Success at Gatt is seen as one of the few available ways of stimulating the world economy out of its current stagnation. Mr Ray MacSharry, European farm commissioner, said before the meeting that the Commission was pressing on with work on starting points for a possible accord, summarising the current situation concerning levies on individual commodities. Technically, the EC has missed a March 1 deadline for sending these schedules to Geneva. Diplomats said France was arguing that even giving Gatt such historical data as a basis for an accord was tantamount to agreeing to the entire draft agreement of Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general. Mr Molleman said his call for progress in the talks had been endorsed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. It was Germany's clearest expression so far of a pro-Gatt stance, distancing itself from French caution. France, the EC's biggest farm producer in absolute terms, was on the offensive yesterday, because the EC has been asked to give Gatt a catalogue of starting points for trimming tariffs if an accord is reached. France argues that even doing this is tantamount to accepting a compromise plan from Mr Dunkel which the Commission has said is unacceptable as it stands. After the farm and trade ministers' joint session, agriculture ministers were to gather alone for a formal meeting to pursue work on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. Portugal, which holds the rotating presidency of the EC, will be presenting a new working paper. 'The presidency is presenting a compromise with some elements we would like, and some we don't, but the basic thrust is the same,' Mr MacSharry said. His plan is based on a big price cut for cereals, which would be fully compensated providing participants sign up for a scheme to take land out of production with limited compensation. He was quoted as saying later that his bottom line was a combination of production controls, prices cuts and adequate compensation. He was prepared to be flexible about how it was all done. Officials say farm ministers will work through Tuesday and possibly Wednesday on reforms. Whatever the outcome of the joint farm-trade meeting, farm ministers then have to resume their own negotiations on an overhaul of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy. They look set for some headway this time, diplomats said. Commodities, Page 32</p>

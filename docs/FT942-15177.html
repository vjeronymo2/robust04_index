			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: Merchant Retail acts on Normans Directors of Merchant Retail Group have initiated a restructuring programme at subsidiary Normans, the food retailing division, to 'improve its profitability and maximise cash generation'. Since last November Normans has been available for offers but none has been received which has been in the best interests of shareholders and it had been decided to retain it, directors stated. They propose to make provisions in the accounts, for the year ended April 2, of some Pounds 3.5m for the effects of the restructuring. These comprised principally redundancy costs, and stock and equipment write-downs. Although not completed, a valuation of group properties reveals a diminution in the order of Pounds 8.6m. As a result of this and the reorganisation provision, distributable reserves would be eliminated, and there is no payment of the ordinary dividend for the present year, or the preference due on July 1.</p>

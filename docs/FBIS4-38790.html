			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ihor Nykorovych report on interview with Ukrainian Deputy </F> Defense Minister Ivan Bizhan with unidentified correspondents:  "The Deputy Minister Is Pleased With the State of Affairs in  Our Troops"]    [Text] We have already reported that a large group of  officers from the Defense Ministry headed by Deputy Minister of  Defense Colonel General Ivan Bizhan visited our oblast on an  inspection mission. After the commission finished its work, the  colonel general, as he had promised, met with representatives of  the local mass media. The new commander of the Ciscarpathian  Military District, Colonel General Petro Shulyak, and the  commander of the formation, Major General Anatoliy Kalashnykov  were also present at the news conference.    The deputy minister pointed out that it was the first time  that such an inspection was conducted in the Ukrainian Armed  Forces. It so happened that the inspection started precisely  with the formation whose headquarters is situated in our oblast.  The goal of the inspection was to see the actual state of  combat readiness of our troops.    According to Colonel General I. Bizhan, proper attention is  being given to combat training in the formation. The units are  ready to fulfill their tasks, although things are not in perfect  order everywhere. However, there are objective reasons for  that. For example, this year, the funds allocated for combat  training were quite limited. It is, therefore, difficult to  expect good results from those servicemen, who, for example,  could not take the complete course of training due to the  shortage of fuel. At the same time, there are commanders who,  on the pretext of difficulties, do not do their work at all.  Consequently, organizational measures will also be taken based  on the results of the inspection.    The deputy minister pointed out that he was very familiar  with our formation and that, after new commander Major General  A. Kalashnykov took over, the situation in the troops changed  for the better. There is every reason to believe that the  shortcomings revealed by the inspection will be eliminated.    Then Colonel General I. Bizhan answered the following  questions by journalists.    [Question] How do the Ukrainian Armed Forces compare to  armies of other states, for example, Russia?    [Bizhan] I wouldn't say that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are  trained worse than the Russian ones. Just two years ago, they  were within the same army. Nor are there, so far, any problems  with up-to-date weapons or military technology. However, I am  concerned about the future. We do not have funds for developing  new types of weapons or technology. That is why, in about five  to 10 years, the Ukrainian Army may find itself in quite a  difficult situation.    [Question] At present, the question of creating some  independent armed forces is being raised in the Crimea. What is  your attitude toward this? What is, in general, your attitude  toward the problem of the [Crimean] peninsula?    [Bizhan] Both we and leaders of other states, in particular,  the United States and Russia, regard the Crimea as a constituent  part of our state. After all, this question is political rather  than military, and armed forces must an external party. At the  same time, we take into account the situation in the Crimea and  the way in which it may change. The creation of any militarized  formations there is at variance with the laws of our state.  Well, this is, so far, at the level of talk and plans.  However, we are alarmed by the fact that these ideas are voiced  by Crimean leaders. That is why, if they start doing anything  for the implementation of those ideas, I think that it will also  be necessary to take practical measures to counter their  activities.    [Question] What specific assistance could our oblast render  to the units of the formation stationed on its territory?    [Bizhan] The shortage of housing is one of the most painful  problems of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. More than 80,000 of  Ukraine's officers and warrant officers have no apartments.  Military construction bodies would be able to build housing, but  the lack of funds prevents them from doing that. I know that  other people are also confronted by this problem, but if we  could get local help in this question, the army would greatly  appreciate it.</p>

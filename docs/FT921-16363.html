			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Woman in the News: Bull in a Wall St bear garden - Elaine Garzarelli There is no better embodiment of the extraordinary wave of optimism that has been sweeping through the US stock markets than the person of Ms Elaine Garzarelli, one of Wall Street's best-known analysts and among the most vociferously bullish. For Ms Garzarelli, who shot to celebrity status in 1987 when she correctly forecast the October crash, reckons that the remarkable stock market rally of the past 10 days is but a foretaste of a strong surge in equity prices over the next year. And this week Lehman Brothers' leading equity analyst was busily putting her money where her mouth is, buying shares for her own account in General Motors and International Business Machines - lumbering blue chip companies which are being hurt severely by recession and suffer from very low stock market ratings. 'When they're at these levels,' she says with a chuckle, 'you can't go wrong.' Views like this put her at one end of a Wall Street spectrum which runs through mild concern that the market is getting ahead of itself, anticipating too much good news, to pessimistic warnings that the Christmas rally could merely be the prelude to a market slide, if the US economy remains stuck in recession or enters a prolonged depression. Yet Ms Garzarelli's track record in recent years is impressive. Not only did she predict the 1987 crash, but she had the prescience to do so on television. She rightly dismissed the sudden downturn on Wall Street in October 1989 as a blip and accurately called the bottom of the bear market in the autumn of 1990. She urged investors to get into equities just ahead of the Gulf war, when Wall Street was consumed with gloom, and was vindicated by the Dow's subsequent 500-point surge. Ever since 1984 fund managers polled by Institutional Investor magazine have voted her the leading US quantitative analyst - that is someone who predicts significant market turning points by feeding statistics into their own computer models. Nor have the 39-year-old Ms Garzarelli's powerful personality and flair for self-publicity hurt her reputation. Her personal style is arresting  - a combination of frizzy hair, designer clothes and stiletto heels, which has earned her the nickname of 'Wall Street's Barbra Streisand'. The daughter of a Philadelphia banker, she has a reputation for being a highly strung loner, a workaholic and commanding a salary of Dollars 1m or more. 'The market,' she says, 'is a passion. It's fun.' She lives alone in a Greenwich Village apartment building, where she closets herself for two weeks a month while working on her forecasts. But she insists she has been developing a social life and was recently quoted as saying she would like to adopt a child with a 'parental syndicate of three men'. Her investment advice is not without blemishes. Wall Street rivals point out she has made some poor short-term predictions, including tipping General Motors last summer before its share price plunged. Nevertheless, she claims her system of 13 indicators has predicted all the big market moves of the past 20 years. The indicators are broken down into four groups, each of which has a roughly equal weighting - the economy, monetary policy, share price valuation and investor sentiment. She owes her success, she says to 'following my indicators, even when they tell me to do things that are totally against my emotions'. If changes in the direction of the market can be deduced in this manner, why have others not copied her? The answer is that Ms Garzarelli's framework and weightings, built up over 10 years, are uniquely hers. She claims, for example, that no one else has the contacts to match her monitoring of institutional cash holdings - an important factor in market liquidity. So what makes her so much more optimistic now than most of her rivals? In December, she says, 11 of her indicators were bullish and two neutral, giving one of the strongest readings in their history. Like most of Wall Street, she thinks the US is in the final stages of a recession, and that the significant easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve on December 20 - the prime reason for the stock market's recent rally - shows the central bank will 'hold the economy's hand until it is up and running'. That, she thinks, could feed through into average 22 per cent growth in corporate earnings in 1992. The more pessimistic analysts, however, argue that the Fed's easing move is more a sign of desperation and of the depths of the economy's problems. They maintain that with high unemployment, weak consumer confidence, an overhang of corporate and personal debt from the 1980s and softening overseas economies, the US recovery could be extremely sluggish and 1992 corporate earnings could be disappointingly small. Many analysts think that the ratio between the price of US shares and corporate earnings - one of the most basic tools of stock price analysis - shows that the US equity market is already assuming rather too much good earnings news for comfort. But Ms Garzarelli will have none of it. She says her rivals are making the mistake of placing too much emphasis on earnings in the current recession year, rather than 1992 and 1993, or are not discounting one-time write-offs by companies which are in the process of restructuring. She reckons that fair value for the Dow, given current interest rates, is 3,276 on the basis of prospective 1992 earnings and 3,520 for 1993 earnings. However, Ms Garzarelli adds that the stock market usually tops out well above fair value when economic growth is a long way from peaking and Fed policy is easy, as is the case now. And this creates scope for the Dow to rise by 20 per cent or more over the next 12 months, possibly to about 4,000. The current rally, she argues, could last another two months and then be followed by a 4 per cent to 7 per cent downward correction - not sufficiently serious to merit selling shares. Stocks Ms Garzarelli thinks will do particularly well include big players with lowly market ratings in sectors which tend to mirror the ups and downs of the economic cycle, such as General Motors, Westinghouse Electric, the troubled conglomerate, and retailer Woolworth. 'With these you know you are going to make gains twice as much as the market,' she declares. And judging by the Christmas rally, an awful lot of investors would like to believe her.

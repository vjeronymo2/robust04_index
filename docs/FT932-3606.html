			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / China's Investment Revolution: Careful planning key to rewarding ventures CHINA'S remarkable progress may tempt unwary foreigners to believe they can simply invest in a joint venture, sit back and wait for the profits to roll in. Not so. Joint ventures require enormous preparation and constant attention. The Chinese economy has moved some way towards the market, but businesses still need the right contacts to ensure success. Problems need to be worked out through persistent negotiation. Businessmen and lawyers with experience of China say that the rewards are there, but they have to be earned. They offer these suggestions: Identify what you want out of a joint venture, and try to anticipate what a potential partner would want. You may have an eye on the domestic market, but a Chinese company may be looking to export. Mr John Beyer, director of the China-Britain Trade Group, says: 'Quite a lot of joint ventures have fallen by the wayside because the two sides have not identified overlapping aims.' Find the right partner, whose most important qualification will be good connections in relevant city, provincial and state bodies. Mr Robbie Robertson, director of strategic relations for GPT, which has a successful joint venture making PABX telephone systems in Shanghai, says: 'If a venture is not with the right people, it will not succeed.' A partner provides access to a skill and labour base, as well as the local clout to ensure that a venture receives materials for which state or municipal authorities remain responsible. Pick the right location. Though investment has poured into special economic zones where set-up costs may be lower, the quality of infrastructure, particularly for transport, will be more important in the longer run. Get a good contract including a reasonable amount of detail. Mr Stuart Valentine, a solicitor at Clifford Chance in Hong Kong, says this is important even though Chinese and western views of a contract may differ. The Chinese are likely to treat it as a framework for discussion in the event of problems. 'You can't bang the table and say 'this is what the contract says',' Mr Valentine says. Resolve problems through negotiation. There is little point in pursuing a claim through courts in China, and lawyers say they know of no case in which a judgment in a foreign court or arbitration tribunal has been enforced in China. Use expert advice and the experience of others. For British businesses, the China-Britain Trade Group runs seminars and plans a 'mobile workshop' in China in the autumn as part of an investment mission.</p>

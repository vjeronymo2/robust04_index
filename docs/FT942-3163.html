			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Caracas bank closures under fire The decision by the government of President Rafael Caldera to shut down eight troubled financial institutions provoked criticism in Venezuela yesterday, although it was viewed by some economists as the best way to stem a drain on the government's budget. The Venezuelan banking council, which represents the private banks, sharply questioned the government's move and said its members had not been consulted. In Congress, Deputy Gustavo Tarre, leader of the opposition Christian Democrat Copei Party, described the government's decision as 'late', but agreed that official financial aid to the banks could not continue indefinitely. Seven banks (Amazonas, Bancor, Barinas, Construccion, La Guaira, Metropolitano, and Maracaibo) and a finance house, Fiveca, were closed. They were controlled by some of the country's most prominent business families such as the Mendozas (Banco La Guaira), the DiMases (Banco Construccion) and the Brillembourgs (Banco Metropolitano). The closing of the banks, which included the government takeover of more than 50 subsidiary financial companies, represented a heavy blow to the Venezuelan economy, already in the second year of an economic recession. The move raised questions about whether there would be a further loss of confidence in the banking system, already damaged by the collapse of the second-largest bank, Banco Latino, at the start of the year. The banking collapse has come at a time when the government has been trying to get its budget under control. The government has announced action - including accelerating privatisations - to bring down the budget deficit, which was running at a rate of 8-10 per cent of gross domestic product earlier this year. The government has been helped by higher oil prices than forecast and the bolivar's devaluation - which raises the local currency revenues from oil sales abroad by the state oil company. But the bank crisis has cost the government dear: the estimated cost so far is estimated at Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) - half of which has gone in financial assistance to the eight banks. The administration finally decided the banks' losses were getting out of control and it had to stop the continued loss of official aid funds. IDEA, an economic analysis company and the London School of Economics said yesterday the banks' closure does not mean the drain on public finances is over, since the government may decide to further reimburse depositors. 'Nonetheless, a one-off reimbursement of depositors is a far better situation than a continuing bleeding of public finances through attempts to bail out unprofitable banking concerns,' they said. The closure affects around 2m account holders in a nation of just over 20m, and an estimated 14 per cent of deposits at the country's 49 commercial banks. Calculating the true volume of deposits held is tricky, since many banks held large sums in offshore subsidiaries that did not appear on their balance sheets. As of May 30, the government estimated their total losses at over Dollars 2.1bn, or around 30 times registered capital as of the end of 1993. Venezuelan officials said that the banks could reopen after a week or so to begin repaying depositors up to the equivalent of approximately Dollars 24,000. However, the final disposition of these banks remains in doubt. Former owners have until June 29 to come up with cash to re-capitalise their banks and recover control. If this does not occur, the most likely option is liquidation.</p>

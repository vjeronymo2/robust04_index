			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Sunday ruling fails to produce open-and-shut case: The implications of the European Court decision THE European Court ruling on Sunday trading was unexpectedly clear, but did little to end the confusion surrounding the issue. The EC Court of Justice ruled Sunday trading laws in England and Wales did not clash with European trade laws and were enforceable. The ruling has intensified calls for a review of the current laws. 'It's a historical decision rather than one of historic significance,' said Mr Nigel Whittaker, corporate affairs director of Kingfisher retail group, which includes B&amp;Q, Woolworth and Comet. 'It leaves the way clear for the Home Office to press ahead with new legislation.' The court was not ruling simply on the legality or otherwise of shops' opening on Sundays. Rather, it was asked to guide the English courts in interpreting an apparent clash between the Shops Act of 1950, which is supposed to regulate Sunday trading in England and Wales, and Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome, which forbids any barrier to trade between member countries. Retailers said their turnover was reduced if they did not open on Sunday, meaning they needed to import fewer goods from Europe - a form of trade barrier. The counter-argument from the anti Sunday-trade lobby was that the aim of the Shops Act, to protect workers, justified any breach of trade laws. The European Court had to decide whether the Shops Act was 'proportionate', in other words whether its effect on trade was no more than necessary to achieve its objective of worker protection. Its decision was clear-cut: 'Article 30 of the Treaty is to be interpreted as meaning that the prohibition which it lays down does not apply to national legislation prohibiting retailers from opening their premises on Sundays.' The ruling must now go to the Lords for ratification. But the Home Office indicated that it was now up to councils to decide whether to prosecute shops opening on Sundays, and several said they would do so. Others are thought unlikely to spend time and money trying to enforce what is seen is a dying law. The ruling is not the end of the story. The existing legislation is clearly doomed, and new proposals will be put to parliament. The first will be the private member's bill sponsored by Mr Ray Powell, Labour MP for Ogmore, due to be debated on January 22. The bill aims to rationalise the Shops Act, taking into account the retailing needs of the 1990s, and provide adequate protection for Sunday workers. It is based on the proposals of Keep Sunday Special, the campaign group, which would permit the opening of shops in four categories: recreation, emergencies, social and travel - hence the acronym Rest - at council discretion. The recreation category includes sports centres, historic buildings, newsagents, garden centres and florists. The emergency category covers chemists and small food shops, while the social category includes restaurants, take-aways, pubs and off licences. The travel section would cover petrol stations, motor spares shops and motorway service stations. Ministers are unlikely to force Tory backbenchers to attend and vote against the bill, so its progress will depend on Mr Powell's skills as a whip (he is a senior member of the Labour whips' office) and on backbench opposition to it. Even assuming it is allowed to proceed in January, there is practically no prospect that it will become law. Discussion on backbench bills cannot be guillotined, and time available for them is very limited. So the realistic route for a change in the law is government legislation. The Conservatives promised in their last two manifestos to reform Sunday trading laws, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, told parliament in November that he planned to present a so-called 'options' bill. That would give MPs the chance to choose between complete deregulation of Sunday opening (Mr Clarke's favoured option but considered unlikely to gain widespread support); the KSS/Rest proposals; and partial deregulation as proposed by the Shopping Hours Reform Council. The reform council, whose proposals are supported by retail groups including J. Sainsbury and Kingfisher, wants all shops to be allowed to open for all or part of the day, depending on their size. Shops below 3,000 sq ft would face no restriction, but larger shops would be allowed to open for only limited hours. The council also wants legislation to include protection for shop workers, outlawing any attempts to force workers to work on Sundays or discrimination against those who refuse. Premium wages should also be paid for Sunday working. Mr Clarke's desire to press ahead with legislation on Sunday trading is not in doubt. More in question is the enthusiasm of Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, for introducing a bill that would be time-consuming and divisive. The business managers say that the legislative programme is already full of controversial measures, not least the Maastricht bill and the legislation to privatise British Rail. So Mr Clarke may lose his battle for a bill to clear up the confusion before next Christmas. Even if he wins it, the passage of the legislation will be far from a formality. Although ministers are relaxed enough about the extent of deregulation to include three different options, they have no intention of giving in on the question of employee protection. The campaign to get premium wages for shop employees who choose to work on Sundays and give future as well as existing shop workers the right not to work on Sundays unites both the KSS and the reform council. For a Tory administration that sees as one of its lasting achievements of the 1980s as the removal of government intervention from industrial relations, the prospect of reintroducing that in the form of wage regulation might well prove unacceptable. But Labour MPs are unlikely to refuse the invitation to join in defeating the government over workers' rights.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY SECTION BASEBALL  </P> <P> In other baseball games:  </P> <P> Monroe 6, Reseda 6 (forfeit) -- Reseda forfeited the game when pitcher Tony  Valdez faked an injury in the bottom of the eighth inning of the Mid-Valley  League contest at Monroe.  </P> <P> According to Monroe Coach Kevin Campbell, Reseda Coach Steve Stone did not want  Valdez to pitch in the eighth inning, but Valdez had taken his warm-up pitches  and was therefore required to pitch to at least one batter.  </P> <P> Upon throwing his first pitch to Ernie Echeveste, Valdez fell to the ground  holding his ankle. At that point, the umpire called the game.  </P> <P> "The umpire saw what happened, said Reseda forfeited the game and was gone,"  Campbell said.  </P> <P> Monroe's Henry Valdez had tripled in two runs with two out in the bottom of the  seventh to tie the score.  </P> <P> Taft 7, Canoga Park 3 -- The Toreadors exploded for four runs in the fourth  inning to break open a close contest in the West Valley League game at Lanark  Park.  </P> <P> Jason Shapiro led off the game with a single, extending his hitting streak to  eight games. Taft (6-2, 3-0) won its third game in a row.  </P> <P> Kennedy 19, Granada Hills 7 -- Mike Murray hit a three-run home run and walked  five times for Kennedy in the North Valley League game at Granada Hills. Four  Granada Hills pitchers gave up 15 walks and 15 hits.  </P> <P> Garrett Anderson paced the Golden Cougars with four hits and four runs batted  in. Travis Bourne and Pat DeBoer each had two hits and three RBIs for Kennedy  (6-2, 2-1), which scored in every inning except the first.  </P> <P> Van Nuys 7, Birmingham 1 -- Lorenzo Morales had a double and a triple and  scored three runs, and Mike Engler added a three-run home run for Van Nuys in  the Mid-Valley League game at Birmingham.  </P> <P> Matt Mowry doubled for the Braves' only extra-base hit. Van Nuys won its third  consecutive league game without a loss.  </P> <P> Grant 11, Sylmar 0 -- Javier Delahoya, who struck out seven and limited Sylmar  to four hits, hit a three-run home run in the fifth in the Valley Pac-8 League  game.  </P> <P> Neil Simon contributed to the six-run fifth by hitting a bases-loaded double.  Jeff Boardo hit a double and single.  </P> <P> Poly 17, North Hollywood 2 -- Adulfo Hernandez hit a triple and a three-run  home run and had five RBIs to pace the Parrots in an East Valley League game at  North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Eddie Chavez had five RBIs and Harold Whiteside hit a three-run home run.

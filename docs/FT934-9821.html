			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Arts: Tchaikovsky's 'Cherevichki' - Opera Chelsea Opera Group's concert performance of Cherevichki at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Sunday was an imaginative contribution to a Tchaikovsky commemoration otherwise largely lacking in enterprise. The centenary of the composer's death (which fell the day before) has been duly marked, but few audiences will have gained fresh insights into Tchaikovsky's work. Opportunities to explore the neglected byways of the composer's output have been missed, familiar music has been aired over and over again. This year opera houses around the world have seen a proliferation of Onegins. No Western company seems to have ventured Mazeppa or The Maid of Orleans. Chelsea Opera Group, which in the past has given memorable concert versions of both, might this time have dusted off The Enchantress or The Oprichnik. But Cherevichki ('The Tsarina's Slippers') was still a good choice: last month (as David Murray reported on this page) it was the hit of the Wexford Festival - anyone who encountered it there will have welcomed another chance to hear it - and, importantly, Tchaikovsky himself thought highly of it, calling it 'musically well-nigh my best opera'. The neglect of Cherevichki is unjust. Tchaikovsky laboured hard at it (the opera as premiered at the Bolshoy in 1887 was an extensive revision of his 1874 Vakula the Smith), producing a score of uniformly high inspiration. Deeply influenced by folklore - it is a setting of Gogol's Christmas Eve - the work is full of colourful, lyrical earthy music. It remained the composer's only comic opera. The fantastic plot, familiar to London opera-goers through the recent ENO staging of Rimsky-Korsakov's later setting of the story, was clarified at the QEH in Arthur Jacobs's lively translation. Three singers stood out. With a husky mezzo, Ann Atkinson was delightful as the witch Solokha, and Jonathan Veira sang robustly and with relish as the Devil. Peter Sidhom was a splendid, solemn Potemkin. Though taxed by the demanding role of Oxana, Alice Hyde made a credible heroine - and the slight edge to her voice suggested authentic Russian tone. Both the Vakula and Chub, roles requiring larger-than-life singers, were undercharacterised. The conductor, Martyn Brabbins, welded his forces - including a ragged chorus - with flair and Tchaikovskian feeling.</p>

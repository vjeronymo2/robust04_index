			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Letter: Misleading to say pay increases in manufacturing self-financing Sir, You suggest that pay settlement levels still pose a threat to economic recovery ('Industry pay deals remain stuck above 4 per cent', August 10). The Engineering Employers' Federation agrees. Pay settlements have fallen dramatically since late 1990, but that does not mean the wage-price spiral is broken. Recession, not yet a new pattern of pay expectations, has provided the downward pressure on pay and inflation. The average recent pay settlement among EEF members has been about 4 per cent. With 'pay drift', this could amount to some 6 per cent on earnings. At the bottom of a recession, 6 per cent earnings growth is far too high if inflation is to be reduced to 2 or 3 per cent. It has been claimed that pay increases in manufacturing are 'self-financing' through productivity gains. That is highly misleading, because competitive pressures often require manufacturers to reduce prices. A productivity gain passed on through lower prices is not available to 'finance' increased pay. The EEF supports the CBI's call for no increase in the public sector pay bill and for a shift in public spending from consumption to investment. However, complacency now about pay increases in the private sector would be a certain recipe for renewed inflation when the economy recovers.

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Germany moves to act on EC legislation KEY amendments to Germany's constitution, granting both chambers of the national parliament sweeping powers to oversee and propose changes to draft legislation for the European Community, have been given the green light in Bonn. The changes were approved by the joint constitutional commission, representing both Bundestag and Bundesrat, and all the political parties in the parliament. The two parliamentary chambers can now insist that the German government present all Community legislation to special EC committees - and that it must take the committees' views into account in its subsequent Brussels negotiations. German parliamentarians believe the plan would give them even more powers to control Brussels' decision-making than those currently enjoyed by Britain and Denmark, which have hitherto been the two member states with the toughest controls. The move represents a big shift in German thinking towards the EC, in favour of national control of European legislation, as practised in London and Copenhagen, rather than multi-national control through the European Parliament. 'The constitutional commission is not entitled to issue directives. . . on strengthening the powers of the European Parliament, but it can ensure that the actions and policies of the German representative in Europe are subjected to more intensive parliamentary control,' the commission announced yesterday. The amendments would set up a European Union Committee of the directly elected German Bundestag, and a European chamber of the Bundesrat, in which the 16 German federal states are represented. German parliamentarians say their committees will be bound to back all measures promoting 'democracy and federalism' in Europe, in line with the rest of the German constitution. The British and Danish EC oversight committees have tended rather to resist moves towards greater European integration. The constitutional changes will eventually have to gain two-thirds support in both houses of parliament, but they already enjoy the necessary cross-party backing to do so.</p>

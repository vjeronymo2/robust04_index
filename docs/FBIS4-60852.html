			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [News department report: "Levon Ter-Petrosyan: `Constitution </F> Is an Accord'"]    [Text] Armenian Republic President L. Ter-Petrosyan spoke  yesterday in the parliament. The nation's existence--this is  what national accord means, said the president. The nation has  always been united by common concerns, customs, ideas of the  future. Disagreements, on the other hand, existed between  political forces. Nor does Levon Ter-Petrosyan recognize such a  notion as national ideology. In his opinion, in a democratic  society it is impossible to unite democracy around one idea,  since the final outcome may be fascism, as world experience has  proven. Armenia must have a national program of democratization  and development that, in addition to traits mentioned in its  title, must be universal and humanitarian.    "A constitution is an accord! All citizens, as well as  different political forces in Armenia, must obey it," said  Ter-Petrosyan.    The president believes that a referendum is the most  effective way to adopt the basic law. He expressed certainty  that the Armenian people will adopt their constitution and thus  remove tension in the sociopolitical life of the country. The  president said once again that a violent change of  authority--the way it had happened in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and  Tajikistan--is impossible in Armenia. Further on L.  Ter-Petrosyan proposed his plan for pulling out of the crisis.  First: The parliament expresses confidence in either the  Constitutional Commission's draft or the draft of "the six" and  without discussion votes on submitting one of the drafts to a  referendum vote. Second: If this does not happen, both drafts  are put to a referendum and then a second round of the  referendum may be needed. Third: In the event the draft of six  parties passes, the president and the government resign. Fourth:  If the Constitutional Commission's draft passes, new elections  for president and National Assembly are held. And fifth: Before  this session ends, the parliament must adopt a law on Armenian  Republic citizenship and elections to the republic's National  Assembly.</p>

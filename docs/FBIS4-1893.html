			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Chun (0491 6511): "Striking </F> Self-Employed Traders in Gongbei Resumed Business Yesterday"]    [Text] Zhuhai, 1 Apr--All 68 striking shops run by  self-employed traders on Buxing Street in Zhuhai City's Gongbei  Market resumed normal business at 1400 this afternoon after the  industry and commerce department temporarily suspended the move  to raise shop rents.    At about 1000 yesterday, the owners of all 68 shops on  Gongbei's Buxing Street closed their shops and went on strike to  show their resentment against the industry and commerce  department's decision to raise shop rents. This attracted the  great attention of the concerned departments in Zhuhai City.  Early this morning, the leaders of the City Bureau of Industry  and Commerce went to the Gongbei subbureau to hold a meeting to  find a solution to the issue. They also held separate meetings  of the directors of the self- employed laborers association,  some shop owners, advanced backbone self-employed traders, and  family dependents, to listen to their views and to discuss how  to settle the matter.    At 1100, this reporter found that all 68 shops in the  Gongbei  Market had closed their doors and stopped doing business. An  official in charge of the Gongbei Industry and Commerce  Subbureau told this reporter that, at about 0800, six shops  opened their doors to do business, but closed them again not  long after. At 1200, the industry and commerce department put  up a placard in Buxing Street that read: "Business Suspended  for Consolidation."    At noon, the industry and commerce department decided to  postpone the rent readjustment and hoped the owners of the shops  would first resume business and then negotiate for a solution  later. At about 1400, all 68 shops resumed business.    The striking shop owners said that the shop rents were also  readjusted in the past, but the readjustments were all within  the range of 10 to 20 yuan, and that they went on strike because  this time the readjustments were greater than they could afford.</p>

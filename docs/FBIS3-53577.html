			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz in </F> his office in Beirut by unidentified Lebanese Broadcasting  Corporation correspondent in Geneva; date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Buwayz] I believe that whoever expects this  [U.S.-Syrian] summit to be preplanned is wrong. Whoever  believes that this summit is an uncalculated adventure that was  not prepared for is equally wrong. I think that this summit  will involve basic principles and main courses that will be  agreed upon. It will also involve certain limits to be  negotiated.    [Correspondent] In your view, what are the main topics that  will be discussed?    [Buwayz] I believe that this summit will discuss different  topics, including the Israeli occupation of the Syrian Golan and  ways to guarantee Israel's withdrawal from this region, the  peace process, Gaza-Jericho, and regional stability -- or rather  the strategic vision of the future situation in the region.    [Correspondent] Do you believe that the U.S. side has  shifted  from its role as an impartial mediator to that of the full  partner, as al-Asad wants, and that it is trying to convey a  specific Israeli proposal to Syria to move negotiations ahead?    [Buwyaz] This summit undoubtedly comes after an obstruction  to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, as well as a stalemate on the  Jordanian- Israeli and Syrian- and Lebanese-Israeli tracks. I  believe that the United States is fully aware of the need to  abandon the theory of seeking independent, unilateral agreements  and to work toward a comprehensive peace involving all.    Judging by that principle, which governs the Geneva meeting,  I think that the United States has a new dynamism and that a new  daring approach might characterize the U.S. role in this summit,  and maybe after it. This new approach is based on a U.S. belief  that the stalemate that characterized negotiations for more than  two years must be handled by a different approach.    [Correspondent] President Ilyas al-Hirawi yesterday said  that  President al-Asad is negotiating on behalf of all Arabs,  particularly Lebanon, and that he will not relinquish Arab  rights. However, U.S. Ambassador in Beirut Mark Hambley said a  few days ago that Lebanon might not be a separate topic on the  summit agenda. Can you comment?    [Buwayz] In fact, these two views do not conflict. I believe  that President al-Asad this time and at this particular moment  embodies a basic regional power that has influence at the  Palestinian level and accordingly influences what happens in  Gaza and Jericho, on a moral level in Jordan and in Lebanon, in  addition to the Syrian level, of course.    Accordingly, President al-Asad is, of course, a regional  negotiator in this summit, because what he will talk about will  go beyond the occupied Syrian Golan. Moreover, President  Clinton represents an international power. After the collapse  of the Soviet Union and the eastern bloc, the United States has  become the sole superpower, holding many political, economic,  and technological cards.    Hence, I believe that the Lebanese issue--that is Lebanon's  rights--might not be discussed in this summit. The issue is not  under discussion. The issue is very clear: Either there is a  real and comprehensive peace and Israel will accordingly  undertake to withdraw fully from south Lebanon to the  internationally-recognized borders [sentence as heard].  However, the Israeli occupation involves some points related to  the regional situation. So long as there are regional  solutions, solutions to these points could also be found.</p>

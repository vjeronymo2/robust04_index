			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Lautro warns on pension switches NEW RULES to be announced later this week will warn sales agents from life insurance companies against encouraging members of occupational pensions schemes to switch to personal pensions. A draft of the document by Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, says that the rules are likely to mean that after an analysis of each potential client's situation, 'many' will be advised not to make a purchase. Personal pensions have been among the most significant sources of new business for the life insurance industry, accounting for 39 per cent of all new business underwritten in the year to March 31. Lautro is to release an enforcement bulletin for sales agents because, according to a draft document, it is concerned 'that adequate care was not always being taken by company representatives in establishing whether or not it was bona fide in the interests of members of occupational pension schemes to transfer to personal pension plans'. Mr Brian Sharp, secretary to the Association of British Insurers' Life Council, said he believed the rules were already best practice within the industry and were unlikely to cause a stir. Mr Ron Spill, pensions manager at Legal and General, said the rules embodied what was already followed at his company and would not force any change in practice. However, Lautro has noted a sharp rise in complaints from the public of high-pressure sales tactics used to encourage workers to leave attractive employer-sponsored schemes. For this reason it decided to make new rules. Occupational schemes offer many benefits that personal pensions cannot - such as additional contributions from employers, inflation-adjusted benefits and survivors' benefits for death in service. Those who transfer out of occupational schemes often receive lump sums worth far less than benefits they would have been entitled to had they stayed in the scheme, even if they had switched to a new employer and stopped contributing to the original scheme. The draft rules also suggest that companies receiving complaints from those who have been urged to transfer out of an employers' scheme into a personal pension scheme should consider whether the new guidelines were followed when the sale was made. In addition, the rules seek to limit the amount of commission that can be charged to clients up-front. Life insurance companies typically deduct up to two years premiums to pay sales costs on long-term insurance contracts. The new rules will limit commissions on personal pensions to a percentage of each year's premium - typically 4 per cent to 5 per cent.</p>

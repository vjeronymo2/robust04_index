			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Motion attacks Mirror boss THE CHIEF executive of Mirror Group Newspapers, Mr David Montgomery, last night faced a storm of criticism from Labour MPs following this week's resignation from the Daily Mirror of Mr Alastair Campbell, its political editor. Mr Neil Kinnock and Mr Roy Hattersley, the former leader and deputy leader of the party, tabled a Commons motion deploring the actions which 'forced' his departure. As senior Labour officials voiced fears that Mr Montgomery was set on abandoning MGN's traditional support for Labour, more than 150 of the party's MPs signed the motion. Noting that other changes instituted by Mr Montgomery had jeopardised the newspaper's 'traditionally high standards of journalism' and 'its independence from Conservative politics', the MPs said they had no confidence in him as chief executive. Mr Montgomery insisted that the paper had no plans to change its traditional allegiance to Labour. But officials close to Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said that there were now severe strains between Mr Montgomery and Lord Hollick, the Labour peer and MGN board member behind his orginal appointment last October.</p>

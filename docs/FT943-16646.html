			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Russian oil giant entices west Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company, will offer more than 20 per cent of its shares to the public and a further 15 per cent to foreign investors within the country's second round of privatisations which began at the weekend. Lukoil, which produces approximately 50m tonnes of oil a year, 15 per cent of total Russian crude, from western Siberia is the first large oil company to offer shares to western investors. The company has been the main beneficiary of the break-up of the old Rosneft holding company and has inherited unquantified reserves which it claims to be among the largest in the world. In the past six months the company has frozen the price of its products and lowered production costs by cutting out layers of management and reducing drilling and repair teams. It is also investing in a new refinery in association with the Swiss-Swedish ABB Brown Boveri power engineering company, at Krasnodar, in southern Russia, near the oil port of Novorossisk. Mr Vagit Alegperov, the company's president, noted that the distance of existing refineries from the ports increased transport costs. The company's strategy is to turn itself into a competitive energy company with associates in the former Soviet states as well as abroad. It has taken a 10 per cent share in the BP-led consortium to develop oil reserves off Azerbaijan - a project which Mr Alegperov said should be ready for Azeri government approval by September. However, oil quotas, which should have been lifted on July 1, will stay in place at least until next January, according to Mr Oleg Davydov, the Russian trade minister. He said that the measure was 'untimely' because of the need to ensure fuel for vital projects such as harvesting. Energy production in Russia fell sharply in the first six months of the year  -oil by more than 14 per cent, coal by 10.4 per cent, electricity by 6.5 per cent and gas by 2 per cent, compared with the same period last year. The Energy Ministry blamed the fall on the debt crisis which has seen energy companies run up debts of nearly Rbs40,000bn by June 1 as credit was cut or priced too high for the enterprises to borrow. The debt crisis is also held responsible for the widespread delays in payments to oil workers, many of whom have received no wages for up to six months. A hunger strike has started by oil workers in Usinsk, in the norther Komi Republic, because of a backlog of wages to February this year. Mr Mikhail Shmakov, head of the Independent Trade Unions of Russia, said that the situation in the oil fields could 'get out of hand' if the wages backlog were not addressed.</p>

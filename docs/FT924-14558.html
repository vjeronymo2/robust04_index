			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Hongkong Land to fall short of Trafalgar target HONGKONG Land is expected to fall far short of the 29.9 per cent stake it hoped to acquire in Trafalgar House, the property, construction and engineering group, when it announces the result of its tender offer later today. Four of Trafalgar's biggest institutional shareholders yesterday said they had decided not to sell any more shares; a further two said they were unlikely to sell; while one confirmed that it sold its stake last week. Hongkong Land, one of the colony's leading property investment and development companies, has acquired 14.9 per cent of Trafalgar and is tendering for another 15 per cent. It has until 4.30pm today to increase its stake to 29.9 per cent. Trafalgar's ordinary and A shares yesterday closed at 86 1/2 p and 83 1/2 p respectively - above Hongkong Land's offer price of 85p per ordinary share and 82p per A share. The group yesterday said that its board would discuss the succession to Sir Nigel Broackes, chairman, and Sir Eric Parker, chief executive, soon after the close of today's tender offer. While the board has not yet discussed possible replacements, Trafalgar confirmed that Mr Allan Gormly, head of the group's engineering division, is the favourite to replace Sir Eric as chief executive. The move is designed to assure shareholders that the group's strategy and management was already changing before Hongkong Land launched its attempt to control 29.9 per cent of the group. In a circular to shareholders earlier this week, Sir Nigel said the group has been 'considering for some time management succession plans for senior positions in the company'. This would be in addition to the appointment of extra non-executive directors. The performance of Sir Nigel and Sir Eric has recently been criticised by some of the group's institutional shareholders. One shareholder said it believed that Hongkong Land was hoping to get at least another 5.1 per cent of the stock to get it over the psychological 20 per cent barrier. However, according to some of Trafalgar's biggest shareholders Hongkong Land faces an uphill struggle to achieve its objectives. Lex, Page 22; Market, Page 44</p>

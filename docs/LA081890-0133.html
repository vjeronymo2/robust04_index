			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1,452 POUNDS OF COCAINE SEIZED IN COMBINED RAIDS  </P> <P> Authorities scored a victory in the local war on drugs Friday, seizing a large  stash of cocaine from a Yorba Linda condominium and arresting the alleged  principals of a $100-million-a-year cocaine ring that supplied drugs to Los  Angeles and 43 states.  </P> <P> Officials estimated the street value of the cocaine at more than $250 million.  </P> <P> The seizure late Thursday night of 1,452 pounds of cocaine took place at three  locations in Orange and Los Angeles counties, but most of it was discovered at  a Yorba Linda condominium, officials said Friday.  </P> <P> "These actions, I hope, will do more than just scratch the surface," said one  federal drug enforcement agent, who asked that his name not be used. "These  busts are gigantic, but they're becoming more commonplace in Southern  California.  </P> <P> "That's a sad state of affairs, but we're working on it."  </P> <P> The arrests Friday of at least 16 members of an alleged drug-trafficking  operation centered near Los Angeles International Airport was described by  police as "significant."  </P> <P> The raids began Thursday night when a swarm of drug officials from Orange and  Los Angeles counties converged on a pinkish-beige condominium in the 6400 block  of Pepper Hill Drive in a quiet Yorba Linda neighborhood. Officers said they  seized 1,320 pounds of cocaine, a 9-millimeter handgun and two luxury cars.  </P> <P> Suspects identified as Jairo Sarbia Ayala, 37, and Jose Jesus Novoa, 26, were  arrested at the condo and are being held without bail by federal authorities.  </P> <P> Two more seizures of cocaine totaling 132 pounds were made in Montebello and  Van Nuys, officials said.  </P> <P> At a morning press conference at Los Angeles Police Department headquarters,  officials refused to answer questions about the events leading up to the  arrests or the men's suspected role in cocaine trafficking.  </P> <P> Officials also declined to discuss how the cocaine was transported to Southern  California and whether it was destined for distribution outside the state.  </P> <P> Officials said, however, that there may be more arrests in the case.  </P> <P> In addition to Los Angeles police, other agencies involved were the FBI, the  Santa Ana and Brea police departments, the Orange County Sheriff's Department  and the Orange County Regional Narcotics Suppression Program.  </P></p>

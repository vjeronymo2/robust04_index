			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TOURNAMENTS POSE LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Before writing his commentary about the attitude of 2 private golf clubs toward  hosting a Seniors Tour tournament, Rich Tosches should have done a little  research. He might have learned that clubs in the Los Angeles metropolitan area  were obliged long ago to drop major tournaments for some very practical  reasons.  </P> <P> Foremost among the barriers is logistics. Tosches pointed the finger at  Lakeside Golf Club, so let's use that club as an example. The Lakeside parking  lot accommodates perhaps 200 cars. Other than residential streets, there is no  available public parking within several miles. How would Mr. Tosches suggest  that Lakeside handle the "upward of 50,000 spectators" (his figures) who would  attend a Seniors Tour event?  </P> <P> If that were not a sufficient deterrent, consider the damage to a carefully  maintained golf course by the trampling of thousands of feet (high heels  included) for 4 days. Full recovery could be a matter of weeks or months.  Member-owned golf clubs are operated for the benefit and enjoyment of the  members and not for profit. To charge outsiders for the use of their facilities  would be in conflict with their nonprofit status.  </P> <P> How long since you have heard of a tour event at El Caballero, Wilshire,  Bel-Air, Annandale, Hillcrest or Los Angeles Country Club? Sure, the L. A. Open  is coming up at Riviera.  </P> <P> Riviera is privately owned and presumably operated for profit. Riviera also is  uniquely situated to cope with large galleries.  </P> <P> JACK JOHNSON,  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

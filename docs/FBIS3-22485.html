The district nursing officer, Sister Winnie Fadzai  Mavedzenge, last week said incidences of sexually transmitted  diseases among schoolchildren, which recently represented about  60 percent of recorded cases, had been "reduced tremendously."    She attributed the reduction to a vigorous anti-AIDS  awareness campaign which sparked off a "condom riot" at  Gutu-Mupandawana growth point as people dropped unprotected sex.    "People are coming on their own to collect condoms which we  have flooded in all night spots at the growth point," she said.  Cde. Mavedzenge said STD had tumbled down to fourth on the list  of problem diseases in Gutu after acute respiratory infections,  injuries, and skin diseases since the launch in 1990.    The Ministry of Health and Child Welfare went on the  offensive following reports of mounting STD and HIV cases in the  district of nearly 200,000 people.    Under a recently unveiled knowledge, attitudes and practices  programme, public health officers studied socio-economic  profiles of vulnerable groups such as schoolchildren housed in  illegal boarding camps before prescribing durable solutions.    "We told the heads of schools that all pupils not housed in  proper boarding places had to go back to their villages where  they fall under their parents' authority," she said.    In 1989, Gutu was shocked when the then district medical  officer, Dr. David Blankhart, said that at least 100 patients in  Gutu Mission Hospital had tested HIV positive.    Although his statistics were holy disputed, the spiral of  infection continued to rise sharply as no fewer than 2,000 STD  cases were recorded per year in the district between 1991 and  1993.    Sister Mavedzenge, however, said since the launch of the  campaign, numbers of "ladies of easy virtue" had dwindled  considerably at Gutu-Mupandawana owing largely to a rapidly  disappearing clientele.</p>

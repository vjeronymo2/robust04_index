			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE;  </P> <P> SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON SEEKING BIGGER PIECE OF MORTGAGE-SERVICING PIE  </P> <P> Large mortgage bankers don't make their money by selling the loans they  originate to investors. They generate most of their income from fees they  charge for servicing those loans -- sending out bills, collecting payments and  paying taxes and insurance for the investors.  </P> <P> And it is a big business.  </P> <P> Shearson Lehman Hutton Mortgage Co. in Newport Beach, one of the nation's  largest mortgage bankers, was servicing more than $14.1 billion in loans at the  end of December. That made it the nation's sixth largest -- and California's  largest -- mortgage servicing firm last year, according to American Banker, a  daily trade newspaper.  </P> <P> Though the company would not reveal financial details, mortgage firms typically  receive a fee of about 0.4% of the loan amounts they service, the American  Banker said. That's $60 million in revenue for a firm servicing $15 billion in  loans.  </P> <P> The company expects its servicing unit to grow even larger this year. It is  considering the purchase of servicing rights to $5 billion in loans, said  Walter P. Blass, the firm's chairman and president.  </P> <P> The company, a subsidiary of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., also is negotiating  to build a 150,000-square-foot structure to house enough servicing operations  to handle up to $50 billion in loans. The company plans to build on one of four  sites near its current San Bernardino servicing center.  </P> <P> The goal is not to be the biggest servicer, just the best servicer and the most  profitable one, Blass said. The biggest is Citicorp Mortgage Inc., a St. Louis  subsidiary of New York's giant Citicorp banking company. Its servicing  portfolio had $52.2 billion in loans last year.  </P> <P> There is certainly room to grow. Despite its size, Citicorp had less than 2% of  the market. In fact, the top 100 mortgage servicing operations accounted for  less than 20% of the $3 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt, according to the  American Banker.  </P></p>

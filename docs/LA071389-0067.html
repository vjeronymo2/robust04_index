			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCOPE: VOLUNTEENS CHANGE THEIR STRIPES  </P> <P> When Mona Dyjor returned home she could not stop talking to her family about  what she had just witnessed while on duty at Downey Community Hospital.  </P> <P> "You see it on television and in the movies, but nothing is like the real  thing," Dyjor said.  </P> <P> "Seeing the mother's expression when she sees the baby for the first time. . .  ," she said, waving her hands but stopping short of describing fully the birth  she had watched.  </P> <P> Dyjor is a Candy Striper, but instead of running errands and answering  telephones, she and 60 other young volunteers from Downey schools were working  in the hospital emergency room, obstetrics, the labs and with patients.  </P> <P> Dyjor, a recent Warren High School graduate, was participating in the Volunteen  Program at Downey Community Hospital.  </P> <P> It was as part of the program that she found herself in the delivery room  watching the birth of a child. "I was only in there for the last 10 minutes of  the delivery," Dyjor said. "The nurses showed and explained everything to me,  step by step."  </P> <P> The Downey hospital last year began allowing Volunteens to work in the medical  departments.  </P> <P> "Before, we just sat at the desk. Now we have more physical contact with  people," said Jennifer DeKay, 16, of Downey High School. She has been a  Volunteen for two years and believes the change has been for the better. "You  get to see what it is really like."  </P> <P> The result has been an increase in enrollment and more male participation, said  Dari Caldwell, director of nursing administration.  </P> <P> The premise of Downey Community's Volunteen program is simple: introduce the  young person to as many aspects of the health field as possible so that he or  she will consider a career in the medical field.  </P> <P> Candy Stripers still wear the traditional pink and white striped uniforms, and  state law prohibits the volunteers, and all non-medical personnel, from  administering medicine or offering medical advice.  </P> <P> Caldwell is one of three advisers in the program who was instrumental in  bringing about the changes. The hospital's auxiliary had coordinated the old  program since its founding in 1965 and allowed youths to work only at menial  tasks.  </P> <P> Now, the Volunteens have their own bank account and officers. They raise funds  that will be used to purchase equipment for the hospital at the end of the  year.  </P> <P> Three annual scholarships have been established by the nursing administration's  retention and recruitment committee to encourage graduating high school seniors  to pursue nursing careers at an accredited college and to consider Downey  Community Hospital as their first work choice when they complete the college  nursing program.  </P> <P> The Volunteen program attempts to make the teen-agers more responsible, and it  succeeds, Caldwell said.  </P> <P> "It has been a growing experience for a lot of these workers," Caldwell said,  adding that she is amazed at how much they mature during a year at the  hospital.  </P> <P> Downey High School sophomore Henry Castro has worked about 100 hours since he  started volunteering last September. He is most helpful to the Downey Community  Hospital when the waiting room in the Emergency Room is backed up with  patients, according to Lynn Danes, charge nurse.  </P> <P> "Henry helps calm people down when language is a barrier," Danes said. Castro  often acts as interpreter for the staff and patients. "With younger kids he has  a rapport. He shows people that they are not . . . being ignored. He makes it a  lot easier on us," Danes said.  </P> <P> Castro is one of five young men participating in the Volunteen program.  Although he has not told his male buddies at school that he is a Volunteen, he  says his volunteer work is important.  </P> <P> "You get the feeling that you actually are doing something to help somebody. I  like that feeling," said Castro, who hopes to become a cardiologist. "It shows  kids what they can do and a way to go. A lot of kids don't know what to do in  life."  </P></p>

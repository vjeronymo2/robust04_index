			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV ORDERS ARMENIA MILITANTS TO GIVE UP ARMS;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: HE CITES 'GRAVE CRIMES.' SOME IN THE REPUBLIC SAY THE DECREE  COULD STIR MORE BLOODSHED.  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev moved personally Wednesday to halt mounting  violence by armed bands in Armenia by ordering them disbanded and authorizing  the police and KGB to seize their weapons if they are not surrendered.  </P> <P> Armenians predicted that Gorbachev's decree could spark more bloodshed in their  strife-weary land, but it showed Moscow's exasperation at what Soviet officials  call the clear connivance of Armenian authorities with thousands of armed  militants, considered by many in the Caucasus republic to be their best line of  defense against ethnic attack.  </P> <P> In Armenia, locked for 2 1/2 years in an often bloody territorial dispute with  neighboring Azerbaijan, ethnic tensions have increasingly been accompanied by  attacks on Soviet Interior Ministry troops and other agents of the central  government, which many Armenians say are not the acts of nationalist bands but  of common criminals.  </P> <P> In one 48-hour period last week, three police posts in the capital of Yerevan  were besieged and 10 pistols taken. About 60 armed men forced their way into a  police station in the Talin area and ransacked it. In the Masiss district,  gunmen hurled Molotov cocktails at a traffic police post and burned it to the  ground, while 20 carloads of gunmen blockaded the headquarters of the Armenian  Interior Ministry in Yerevan.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's presidential decree, carried by the official Tass news agency,  showed that Moscow's tolerance for such acts has reached an end. He declared  the units of armed irregulars illegal and ordered them disbanded within 15  days. Members must hand over weapons, ammunition and explosives to police, said  Gorbachev, who also had ordered Lithuanians to temporarily turn over their  firearms when the Baltic republic declared independence in March.  </P> <P> If the militants do not comply, police and KGB units are empowered to seize  their arms. If the bands still "endanger the safety of the populace and the  state," Interior Ministry troops and regular army detachments may be deployed  to fight them.  </P> <P> Soviet media have put the strength of the Armenian irregulars in the tens of  thousands, and one lawmaker, Galina Starovoitova, has said they total from  40,000 to 50,000 men. Some Armenians, however, say such numbers are a fantasy  and that the groups have no more than 4,000 members.  </P> <P> In May, more than 20 people were killed when gunmen clashed with troops in the  southern republic. Guerrillas ambushed troops at Yerevan's railway station, and  seven men died in the ensuing gun battle.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said it is time to halt the groups' "grave crimes" that have led to  casualities among innocent people. He said criminals, draft-dodgers and  deserters from the Soviet armed forces have been swelling their ranks.  </P> <P> His decree unmistakably was motivated by the recent events in Armenia, although  he did not refer specifically to the republic. The decree may be used,  therefore, to combat armed militants in Kirghizia, Uzbekistan or other  strife-torn Soviet regions.  </P> <P> Lt. Gen. Boris Smolny, first deputy commander of Interior Ministry troops, told  Tass this month that Armenian authorities have given terrorists "a free hand,  and instigate them to take more daring and cruel actions toward not only the  police and troops but those compatriots who have changed their minds about  illegitimate armed groups."  </P> <P> However, there was disagreement in Armenia about the effects of Gorbachev's  decree.  </P> <P> Khovik Vassilian, chairman of the Aidak nationalist organization, said  Gorbachev's action could whip up tensions even more.  </P> <P> "The situation will be fraught with serious consequences, since it may lead to  bloodshed," he said.  </P> <P> Vassilian is one of many Armenians who deny that the kinds of illegal acts  mentioned by Gorbachev's decree have anything to do with the self-defense  units, which Armenians have dubbed fedayin, a word for "commando" that  Vassilian said they have borrowed from the Turkish.  </P> <P> "The fedayin are carrying out self-defense functions, and as a rule they never  pose any problems," Vassilian said. "But some of the firearms have gotten into  the hands of a dozen criminal groups, which use them when settling accounts."  </P> <P> Martin Martirosyan, another Armenian activist, said, "Everything depends on  what will be meant by the phrase 'illegal armed groups.' " He said the  republic's Supreme Soviet, or legislature, will discuss whether to declare the  fedayin a "republican army" because of the purported failure of Soviet troops  and police to protect Armenians' lives and property.  </P> <P> One reason for Armenians' apprehension at the results of Gorbachev's decree is  that past uses of Soviet army and Interior Ministry troops to combat  manifestations of nationalism in Transcaucasia have led to great bloodshed.  </P> <P> Troops armed with shovels and gas attacked pro-independence demonstrators in  Georgia in April, 1989, and killed 19. In January, soldiers drove into the  Azerbaijani capital of Baku to break a nationalist blockade, and as many as 200  people were killed.  </P></p>

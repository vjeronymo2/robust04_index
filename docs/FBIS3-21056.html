			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by JB: "Lotem Studies the Conductibility of </F> Geological Layers"]    [Text] Frankfurt--Lotem is the name of a geophysical method  to detect petroleum and natural gas deposits, by studying the  property of conducting electricity of geological strata. As  reported by Dr. Andreas Hoerdt at the Institute for Geophysics  of Cologne University (Albert-Magnus-Platz, Cologne), the Lotem  method is cheaper, and in some cases also more precise, than  conventional prospecting methods.    When a region is to be studied for potential deposits of  hydrocarbons, a cable approximately one kilometer in length is  first stretched over the search area. The cable is grounded by  two electrode plates at the ends. If a current of between 20 and  100 amperes is now sent through the cable, it becomes a  transmitter of electromagnetic waves. The waves penetrate into  the ground to be studied.    The direction of the current is reversed at certain  intervals, which produces induction currents in the ground.  These currents now persist longer the better the electrical  conductibility of the layer in question. The induction currents  produce an electrical and magnetic field, which can be measured  at the surface.    The measurement instruments are induction coils or copper  sulfate electrodes, which function as receivers. When measuring  the terrain the transmitting cable remains in the same place;  only the receiving equipment is moved. This way a cutaway view  of the geological formation of the underground can be obtained.    In the context of oil exploration, the profile can then be  used for, among other things, determining the most suitable site  for test drilling. Financially, this is a big help, since test  drilling is expensive. At present, a five-kilometer-deep bore  hole costs about 20 million German marks [DM].    Lotem has already been successfully tested by Cologne  University both in Germany and within the framework of a BMFT  [Federal Ministry for Research and Technology] project in China  and India. The display of the geological profile was recently  made even more graphic by using the current-image interpretation  method. With this method the specific electrical resistance of a  layer is visualized directly in the form of various colors or  gray levels.    Although Lotem is relatively inexpensive compared to  conventional methods of prospecting, such as seismic  prospecting, its application is still limited. This is due to  the low resolution of the procedure. Complicated faults cannot  yet be measured.    On the other hand, Lotem can very well distinguish between  water and oil-bearing strata, which is not possible with seismic  methods. Furthermore, Lotem is not hindered by volcanic rock  covers, which transmit electromagnetic but not sound waves.</p>

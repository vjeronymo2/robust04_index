			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'LIVING UNIT' MAY MEAN HOUSING HOPE FOR POOR  </P> <P> San Diego would become the nation's first home for a new form of low-income  housing under a plan approved Monday by the City Council to build three  demonstration "living unit" projects downtown.  </P> <P> Generally bigger than single-room-occupancy hotel rooms but smaller than studio  apartments, "living units" combine elements of both dwellings in an effort to  provide a solution to the city's critical shortage of low-income housing.  </P> <P> Two people would reside in each living unit. Their combined rent, set by the  city, would be $431 or $496 a month, depending on the amount of parking  provided at the project. Council approval of the project Monday marked the  first time the city has established a rent-controlled dwelling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Finding Home Of Their Own  </P> <P> The living units "will allow two people who are, say, living in a shelter, to  be able to find a place to live," said Joan Dowd, a member of a panel composed  of the leaders of the city's community planning groups. "They can go and find a  home that is their own."  </P> <P> Devised by the city's Planning Department to complement a program that  encourages construction of single-room-occupancy hotels, the living unit  concept required state legislation, signed into law by Gov. George Deukmejian  on Jan. 1, 1988, that defined such a dwelling unit under state building codes.  </P> <P> On Monday, the day before the election to fill four council seats, the council  considered delaying the project over concerns about allowing construction in  residential areas. Instead, it settled on construction of three demonstration  projects, all of which must be in the downtown Center City planning area.  </P> <P> No developer has proposed construction of a living unit building, according to  Senior Planner Judith Lenthall, architect of the concept. But Lenthall added  that availability of "tens of millions of dollars" in state subsidies beginning  Jan. 1 could spur construction of the dwellings. The money was included in  ballot propositions approved by voters last year, Lenthall said.  </P> <P> San Diego, like most major American cities, suffers from an acute shortage of  affordable housing for the poor, primarily because of billions of dollars cut  from federal housing programs in the 1980s.  </P> <P> According to the Planning Department, the city would have to produce 4,500  low-income housing units per year to accommodate recent increases in the number  of poor in the city. In the last three years, developers have built 258 such  units.  </P> <P> Living units are aimed at getting the poor off the street or out of shelters.  They would allow two minimum-wage earners to pool resources to share the  dwellings, which must have at least 150 square feet. In a building composed of  living units, the average size of all the units can be no more than 270 square  feet.  </P> <P> Unlike SROs, where rooms can be as small as 70 square feet and kitchen and  bathroom facilities are generally communal, each living unit must contain a  kitchen sink, a toilet, a counter top, a closet and electrical outlets for a  refrigerator and a microwave oven. Laundry facilities and communal bathrooms  are required in buildings where units do not included complete bathrooms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Limited to Certain Areas  </P> <P> In comparison, under state law studio apartments must be at least 220 square  feet and include complete kitchen and bathroom facilities.  </P> <P> Under the Planning Department proposal, living units would be allowed in areas  zoned for hotels and motels and in high-density multifamily zones near major  hospitals, colleges, large military installations or major transportation  corridors.  </P> <P> The plan to evaluate three demonstration projects before allowing further  construction came when council members Gloria McColl, Ed Struiksma and Bruce  Henderson said they had too little knowledge of the plan.  </P> <P> However, even the demonstration projects will have to wait until a developer  demonstrates interest in the plans.  </P> <P> No living units would be permitted in Barrio Logan, Golden Hill, San Ysidro or  Southeast San Diego, which already have disproportionate shares of the city's  low-income housing.  </P></p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Slough Estates Slough always needed a rights issue to relieve its balance sheet - the question was when and how much. In the event a convertible looks the sensible way to limit dilution, though the terms had to be generous and the Pounds 137m proceeds may not suffice for the longer term. The immediate effect is to cut gearing to a little over 50 per cent, a figure which could edge back above 60 per cent this year without asset sales. From the market's point of view the important thing is that the waiting is over. But the shares will only prosper with signs that the bottom has been reached in the industrial property cycle.</p>

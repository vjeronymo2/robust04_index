			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Bangkok falls 7.3% on selling flurry Late afternoon index-linked buying lifted prices, and the Nikkei average finished 1.7 per cent higher, posting its sixth consecutive rise, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index added 308.63 at 18,793.88 after a low of 18,301.93 in the morning and a high of 18,807.08 just before the close. The sudden wave of demand after a mainly quiet day took most investors by surprise, with some traders saying much of the buying was speculative. The Topix index of all first section stocks closed 10.59 up at 1,511.43, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 4.68 at 1,252.09. Volume came to 410m shares, against 441m. Rises led declines by 792 to 234, with 144 issues unchanged. Corporate investors continued to take profits ahead of the March book closing, depressing bank stocks. Active buying by foreign investors, seen during the past few trading sessions, was absent, while some dealers also took profits. Housing and real estate shares were supported by reports that Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, was planning to set up a task force to study measures to revive the real estate market. Tokyu Land rose Y18 to Y666 and Daiwa House Industry put on Y10 at Y1,610. Shipping issues, considered relatively cheap, were bought, with Dawasaki Kisen Kaisha moving ahead Y15 to Y345 and Iino Kaiun Kaisha Y15 to Y575. Some banks were lower on profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan receded Y10 to Y2,860 and Sumitomo Bank also lost Y10, to Y1,980. In Osaka, the OSE average firmed 117.73 to 20,502.48 in volume of 41.7m shares. Roundup Pacific Rim markets remained in an extremely volatile state yesterday, with sharp falls seen in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Singapore. However, Mr Jonathan Dennis of HG Asia commented that there was no common theme to link the day's falls; each of the markets was reacting to local developments. He noted that the day's falls had returned the indices in the four markets close to the levels seen on December 21 as the speculative bubble seen over the Christmas and new year period had finally burst. This begged questions about whether there would be the traditional run-up to the Lunar New Year from February 10 to 12. BANGKOK plummeted 7.3 per cent, its sharpest ever one-day fall, as foreigners and local investors joined in a selling flurry that hit the recent gainers hardest. The SET index shed 117.30 to 1,487.76 in turnover of Bt24bn. Finance, property and banking led the falls, with finance issues down 9.2 per cent. KUALA LUMPUR tumbled 6.4 per cent, having been more than 12 per cent down at one stage, after the central bank took tougher measures to sap liquidity and flush out hot money from the banking system. The composite index was off 73.33 at 1,066.22 after a day's low of 1,015.14. Yesterday's fall came on top of a 5.6 per cent slide on Tuesday after a warning by a government adviser that the market had risen too steeply. HONG KONG continued its steep slide as it saw further profit-taking by foreign, mostly Japanese, institutions. The Hang Seng index dropped 443.08, or 4 per cent, to 10,712.73, having been 562 points down at one stage. Turnover amounted to HKDollars 7.78bn. SINGAPORE saw another plunge amid heavy retail and institutional selling which left the Straits Times Industrial index 87.89, or 3.7 per cent, lower at 2,260.31. TAIWAN finished weaker in shrinking turnover as the market consolidated and an official was quoted as saying that the central bank would act to correct excessive flows of funds into the market. The weighted index fell 25.18 to 6,215.21. MANILA was down for the fourth straight day, although bargain hunters emerged for selected stocks. The Manila index shed 111.39 to 2,978.00. SEOUL picked up on demand for blue chips and shares with low price/earnings ratios, in spite of further selling by the Korea Stock Market Stabilisation Fund. The composite index put on 5.29 at 886.31. BOMBAY moved sharply higher after the market was shaken out of a dull start by a fresh round of buying in later trading, brokers said. The BSE 30-share index finished 123.69 ahead at 3,903.79. KARACHI remained at a record peak and the KSE 100-share index rose 35.73 to 2,382.87.</p>

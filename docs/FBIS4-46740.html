			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Galina Andreyeva: "Execution of the Ob's </F> `Sentence' Postponed Until Autumn"]    [Text] A report on the situation at sewage pumping  station No. 14 and the discharge of polluted drainage into the  Ob, respectively, thoroughly alarmed city residents last  week.    Dust was raised for two days on the winding road that leads  to a small two-story structure in the valley of the Kamenka  River, a structure that from its looks is barely noticeable and  does not in any way reveal anything particular about its  functional significance to the vital activity of the life of the  city. In the words of the workers of the pumping station, the  television reporters and the newspapermen were getting tiresome.  Although neither the steady drone of the pumps in the KNS  [sewage pumping station] nor the homey appetizing aroma from the  domestic area--it was getting close to lunchtime--gave any sign  indicating an emergency at the station.    A.N. Kolesov, the station foreman, clarified the emergency  in  question, since the station had not stopped and was operating  according to the usual regime.    However, it was not without reason that the alarm was raised  in the city regarding the next ecological disaster. This time  thunder struck in the Maritime region, where the wall of an  intake reservoir of one of the KNS collapsed. Learning a lesson  from the mistakes of others, the Gorvodokanal [city water  channel administration] decided to investigate the condition of  the pumps in the city. However, it was not possible to execute  this plan at KNS 14, where the sluice gates, "stop logs," did  not function, and it was not possible to stop the flow from the  input collectors. The attempt to establish a temporary gate also  ended without result.    Does every cloud have a silver lining? Alas, no! The defect  of the sluice gate, according to the statement of the station  workers, which lies on the conscience of the builders from the  day the station is put into operation, only postponed the  prediction of an inevitable massive pollution of the Ob. An  inspection of the KNS and preventive repair, in any event,  cannot be avoided. Not only at this station but at all the  others, and there are about two dozen of them on the city's  right bank alone. But the total daily volume of city sewage is  almost 1 million cubic meters. And all this sooner or later  empties into the river. It is fortunate that the contamination  from the KNS did not pass on closer to summer. Otherwise,  farewell to the swimming season. And not only for Novosibirsk  residents but for the "lower neighbors" as well.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Thos Robinson agrees Pounds 41m offer from BM THOMAS ROBINSON, the debt-laden engineering group, yesterday recommended an all-paper offer worth Pounds 41m from BM Group, the construction equipment distributor and manufacturer. BM is also raising Pounds 60m in a 4-for-21 rights issue. Most of the proceeds will be used to reduce Robinson's indebtedness, with about Pounds 15m earmarked for the acquisition of a Canadian distribution business, which is still under negotiation. The offer of 10 new BM shares for every 148 Robinson shares values the latter at 25.8p, compared with the 12 1/2 p at which they were suspended last Friday. Robinson's shares rose to 24p when trading resumed yesterday. BM's shares also returned from suspension at 400p to close 18p lower at 382p. BM owns 2.99 per cent of Robinson's shares and already has acceptances representing a further 35.4 per cent of the capital. Robinson grew rapidly by acquisition at the end of the 1980s under the chairmanship of Mr Graham Rudd, whose brother Nigel heads Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate. Mr Rudd left Robinson in July, when the company warned that it was heading for heavy losses. Despite Robinson's difficulties, Mr Roger Shute, chairman of BM, said the acquisition would not dilute earnings and would enhance growth prospects. Mr Rudd was replaced by Mr Roy Barber, the company doctor, who started selling businesses to reduce Robinson's debt. Net debt stood at Pounds 40m at the end of 1991, while Mr Shute said net assets had shrunk to Pounds 23m. Mr Barber said: 'Borrowings continue to be at a high level and the outlook for 1992 remains poor. It is unlikely shareholders will receive a dividend before 1994.' strongly attracted by Robinson's Wadkin business, which makes woodwork machinery, and also its strong brands in fasteners, such as Nettlefolds and Unifix. The acquisition will decrease BM's reliance on distributing construction equipment, which accounted for 70 per cent of sales last year after its Pounds 55m acquisition of Blackwood Hodge, the ailing distributor of earth-moving equipment, in November 1990. Mr Shute paid tribute to Mr Barber's achievement since taking over at Robinson, saying: 'He has done a good job in stopping the rot.' This deal means Mr Barber will have more time to devote to Astra Holdings, the troubled munitions and fireworks company of which he is non-executive chairman. Mr Shute felt that, before Mr Barber's arrival, Robinson had failed to actively manage its rapidly acquired subsidiaries. When attempts were made to rationalise overcapacity, they came too late and were made in a 'panicky' fashion. BM has been reducing its debts since that acquisition. The fund-raising means that the enlarged group would have net assets of Pounds 200m and gearing below 45 per cent. The rights issue has been fully underwritten by Hambros Bank, BM's financial advisers, with Kleinwort Benson Securities and Albert E Sharp as brokers to the issue. Robinson's financial advisers are Schroders.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["eli."-signed report: "Military Leadership Supports </F> Ruehe's Bundeswehr Plans"]    [Text] Bonn -- Bundeswehr Inspector General Klaus Naumann  has unreservedly backed Defense Minister Volker Ruehe's plans  for a Bundeswehr reform. In an interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE  ZEITUNG, Naumann said the conceptual guidelines for the future  of the armed forces are also supported by the military  leadership. Those who bury the concept ignore the facts: With  the armed forces' present budget of 47.5 billion German marks,  370,000 men cannot be financed. "Those who claim the contrary  lose their credibility," Naumann said.    According to the key features that have become known so far,  the Bundeswehr is to be reduced from 370,000 to 320,000 or  340,000 men, and military service is to be reduced by two months  to 10 months. Naumann said the objective is to achieve a  consensus among the parties on the mandate, the defense system,  and the finances of the Army and to give the armed forces a  rough structure before the Bundestag election. Now, the point  is not to hold a discussion on positions. These details of the  Bundeswehr planning can only be defined by next spring when the  cornerstones of the concept are accepted, he said.    Since the turn of the year, Naumann has prepared the defense  policy guidelines "in close cooperation" with Ruehe, as he said.  He stressed that the concept will also be supported by the  military leadership if two conditions are fulfilled: the  service compensation time for draftees -- the compensation of  overtime by time off, which is regulated by law -- has to be  discontinued because otherwise, useful military training cannot  be ensured any longer in 10 months. Moreover, the money saved  by the new organization must be preserved for the defense  budget, "otherwise the problem of an insufficiently financed  Bundeswehr that devours itself by its operations will be  repeated." If this condition were fulfilled, the investment  share in the budget could be increased to about 28 percent by  1990.    Naumann affirmed that he is looking for a way "to show the  troop again the light at the end of the tunnel." If a troop  strength of 370,000 men is fixed with the present budget, the  situation will no longer be tolerable. He is sure that the  troop will also support the changes "because everyone knows that  things cannot go on like this." A "hollow" Bundeswehr with  370,000 men who neither have modern equipment nor challenging  training is not the political instrument that is needed for the  security of the country, he said.    According to Naumann, political will has to be shown to  discontinue the service compensation time for draftees. Only in  this way can a service of 10 months be justified. He is  convinced that the military quality of training will not suffer  if the service lasts 10 months. Rather, the draftee will be  challenged during the whole of his service, it will be possible  to organize the training better in all military services, and  their efficiency might even be increased. However, details sill  have to be intensively examined, he said.</p>

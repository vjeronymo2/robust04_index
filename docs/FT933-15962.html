			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Japanese railway operator seeks listing EAST JAPAN Railway, one of the seven regional companies created in 1987 by the break-up of Japan National Railways, the former national operator, yesterday applied to the Tokyo stock exchange for listing in late October. The share sale was initially scheduled for last year, but the plunge in the Tokyo stock market last August forced the government to postpone the offering for the first tranche. The aim is to ease the mounting debt at JNR Settlement Corp to which the debts of JNR were transferred. JNR Settlement holds the shares in the six passenger companies and one freight company. The success of JR East's listing is crucial for other semi-privatised companies, such as Japan Tobacco, and the remaining six JNR spin-offs. The government also still holds 65.7 per cent of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the telecommunications giant privatised in 1986. The sale was welcomed by the country's brokers, who hoped the sale of a low-priced stock would bring back retail investors, discouraged by the slump in share prices and the plunge in NTT shares over the past three years. Half of JR East's 4m shares, with a face value of Y50,000, are scheduled to be offered in the first tranche. A total of 600,000 will be auctioned in August to institutional investors to determine the initial offering price. When the offering price has been fixed, the Tokyo stock exchange will accept orders from individual investors from September to late October.</p>

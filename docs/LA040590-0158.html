			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEEP SCARS LEFT BY SENEGAL'S CONFLICT WITH NEIGHBORING MAURITANIA;  </P> <P> WEST AFRICA: NEW SHOPKEEPERS TAKE OVER IN DAKAR. BUT THE IMPACT IS DEVASTATING  ALONG THE FRONTIER RIVER.  </P> <P> Soap, sugar, milk -- any staple a family might need -- is ranged on the shelves  around Ngaido Ba in the cramped shop he runs on a corner of one of Dakar's  oldest quarters.  </P> <P> Ba took over the shop just a few months ago after its previous occupants, a  Mauritanian family, fled during a wave of attacks last April on thousands of  their countrymen living in the Senegalese capital.  </P> <P> "We have everything here," Ba remarked to a recent visitor, "just like before,  when the Mauritanians were here."  </P> <P> Hundreds of miles away, in the tiny village of Ngaoule on the Senegal River,  the undeclared war between Mauritania and Senegal looks a little different.  </P> <P> One evening in January, a stray rifle shot from the Mauritanian side of the  river punctured the pirogue from which villager Mamadou Mberry Sarr was fishing  and killed him. When the village chief remonstrated with the local army  commander, he was asked, "Why did you let the man go out?"  </P> <P> There was no choice, the chief replied. With the farmland and pasture they were  accustomed to using on the Mauritanian side now out of bounds, the need to coax  a living out of the river is greater than ever.  </P> <P> In the cities, where Mauritanian shopkeepers once controlled as much as 80% of  the retail market for consumer goods, the worst fears of the Senegalese about  the economic impact of the loss of their shopkeepers have proved unfounded. The  stores vacated by fleeing Mauritanians were quickly rented to Syrians, Lebanese  and Senegalese, like Ba.  </P> <P> The Mauritanians had operated an unusual credit system for their customers, who  would deposit their monthly salary not in a bank but with a shopkeeper, then  buy down the balance with daily purchases.  </P> <P> The new shopkeepers have yet to build up the level of trust that would enable  them to do business in this way, but there have been few other dislocations.  </P> <P> "We were very afraid of shortages," one Dakar professional said. "I sent a lot  of supplies to my mother, just in case. But nothing happened. According to  official accounts, there are more shops now than before."  </P> <P> But the conflict has had a devastating impact along the 500-mile stretch of the  Senegal River that separates the two countries.  </P> <P> Mass deportations and the border closure struck directly at people who lived in  one country and pastured their herds in the other. They lost thousands of head  of cattle, and farmers were cut off from their fields. All now live in fear of  the occasional outbreak of military gunfire from bank to bank.  </P> <P> Several villages have been leveled by what the Senegalese say are unprovoked  artillery assaults from the Mauritanian side. Every month brings reports of  civilians, including children, killed by gunfire.  </P> <P> "Everyone tells us that Senegal doesn't want war," a village chief told a local  magazine. "But all that's happening -- isn't that war?"  </P> <P> The year-old conflict underscores the costly fragility of border relationships  throughout Africa. Senegal may be one of the continent's most peaceful lands,  but with the rupture of relations with Mauritania, it is at odds with three of  its four neighbors: A 12-year-old conflict with Guinea-Bissau over fishing  rights has erupted again in recriminations, and a 1982 agreement on political  and economic confederation with Gambia, the snake-shaped river country that  bisects Senegal, has been dissolved.  </P> <P> As a result, the fishing industries of Senegal and Guinea-Bissau are  stalemated, and Senegal has all but closed the commercially busy border with  Gambia, provoking power outages, food shortages and unemployment in Gambia and  costing Senegalese truck drivers and shippers millions of dollars in lost  consignments.  </P> <P> Relations with the fourth neighbor, Mali, have also been strained by the  Mauritanian conflict. Senegal recently complained about Malian workers flooding  into Mauritania to take over the jobs given up by expelled Senegalese.  </P> <P> Still, the rupture with Mauritania is viewed as the most serious -- and not  only here. The violent dispute between the two largely Muslim countries  threatens to mar one of the Islamic world's major showcases: the summit meeting  next January in Dakar of the 46-member Organization of the Islamic Conference.  </P> <P> It will be the first time that the summit meeting takes place in a country of  black Africa. The meeting is designed to underscore the strength of Islam in  this region.  </P> <P> But there are signs here that more than just political ties have been damaged.  Many people lament the severing of cultural and historic bonds. Islam reached  Senegal through Mauritania, and many of the country's earliest religious  leaders were either Mauritanian or educated in Mauritania. Among Africans in  both countries, ethnic distinctions were blurred.  </P> <P> "We were closer to Mauritania than to any other country," Babacar Toure, owner  of the weekly Senegalese magazine Sud-Hebdo, said in a recent interview. "We  mixed with them -- who is a Senegalese without Mauritanian blood? I saw it as  my second homeland. In this newsroom, people cried."  </P> <P> In the region of the fleuve, as the river is known, there was so little  political distinction between villagers that ferry and boat passage was  unrestricted. When the two countries jointly built a dam across the river at  Diama, near its Atlantic outlet, the pathway over the dam had no immigration or  customs authorities at either end.  </P> <P> In part, this freedom was a product of economic necessity. There were herdsmen  and farmers on both sides who could not reach their land from their homes  without crossing the border.  </P> <P> In a sense, the incident that provoked last year's violence was a product of  that liberty and cooperative spirit. Senegal, Mauritania and Mali have long had  a tripartite program to develop both riverbanks, the only land in the arid  regions of all three with any potential for agricultural development.  </P> <P> In the last few years the program has improved irrigation in the area, turning  desert-like tracts into highly productive rice paddies. In Mauritania, this  intensified a racial tension that had never been far below the surface. The  country is run politically and controlled economically by its white Berber  elite, who look down on their black African countrymen. An attempt by Berbers  to displace blacks occupying the southern region eventually provoked a violent  confrontation between a handful of Senegalese and Mauritanians over an island  in the middle of the river.  </P> <P> The dispute should have been localized and minor, many say in both capitals.  But when word reached major Senegalese cities, it galvanized into mobs the  idlers and unemployed who have gravitated to places like Dakar.  </P> <P> Simultaneously, the Mauritanians were taking things out on Senegalese laborers  in their country. There, however, the violence fed on racial tension. Black  Africans carrying legitimate Mauritanian papers were accused of acquiring them  fraudulently and deported -- if they were not attacked and butchered first.  </P> <P> In the end, tens of thousands of both countries' citizens were forcibly  repatriated to homelands that many had not seen in decades. Many now have new  jobs, and they say that not even a political settlement will restore their old  life.  </P></p>

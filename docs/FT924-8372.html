Although the figures compared with Pounds 1.22m and Pounds 79m respectively for the same period of the previous year directors said 'robust trading' was experienced at its discount supermarkets and department stores. Trading profits of the Normans supermarkets fell to Pounds 1.36m (Pounds 2m) but at that level were considerably ahead of those for the second half of the past year.

Earnings on the enlarged capital emerged at 0.44p (0.97p).</p>

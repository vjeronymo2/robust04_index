According to the Estonian Security Police, the material  originates from scrapped Russian minesweepers. The  radioactivity of the radiation sources in military use may be  lethally high, the Estonian authorities warn. Ulla-Maija  Maeaettaenen reports from Tallinn:    [Maeaettaenen] The Estonian Security Police have already  investigated the origin of three pieces of metal the size of  attache cases and containing radioactive substances found here.  The first was found in mid-January in the stores of the  Estonian state metal export company, EMEX. The others were  found somewhat later, one in a truck container in the port.  This consignment was on its way illegally to the West,  bypassing the state's export company.    Juri Pihl, the head of the Estonian Security Police, told  Yleisradio today that two pieces of metal containing radioactive  substances originate from two minesweepers sold by the Russian  Army for scrap. The parts belonged to the vessel's security  system. One piece came from a Hovercraft. All these  radioactive pieces have been buried near Tallinn in a store for  radioactive substances.    The vessels, from which the radiating scrap originated, were  sold to an enterprise operating in Narva. A Finnish company  acted as distributor of the metal. According to the Estonian  Security Police, it distributes most of the scrap metal exported  from Estonia to foreign countries. Juri Pihl, the head of the  Estonian Security Police, says that some 10 radiating pieces are  missing; a couple of radiating pieces may also be in Finland.  The radiation from one piece recently destroyed in Estonia rose  to about 200 roentgen an hour or about two sieverts an hour,  which means that the maximum annual dosage by Finnish standards  was reached in only a few minutes.    According to Juri Pihl, lethal metal pieces may find their  way to the West with scrap metal from Latvia and Lithuania too,  without anybody knowing. He is also concerned about seven  Russian Navy vessels lying at the bottom of the Tallinn mine  harbor. They may also carry parts containing radioactive  substances.    The metal trade is also being linked to organized crime. The  Estonian Security Police recently arrested here two of the chief  underworld bosses who are accused of unlawful possession of  weapons. The men in police custody were in total control of the  underworld, distributing so-called paid franchises to other  mafia groups.    According to the Security Police, three mafia groups are  permanently operating in Estonia. Many of their leaders have  fled the country; several may be staying either in Finland or  Sweden. They have Finnish and Swedish visas in their passports.  The trial of the recently arrested mafia bosses will begin here  in Estonia this week, Juri Pihl told Yleisradio.

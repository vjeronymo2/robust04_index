			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Alcan deficit deepens to Dollars 20m in the first quarter ALCAN Aluminium, which suffered a 6 per cent decline in first-quarter sales to USDollars 1.73bn due to depressed fabricated metal prices, reported a net loss of Dollars 20m, or 11 cents a share, for the term, compared with a loss of Dollars 15m, or 9 cents, a year ago. The recession in Japan also affected Alcan's results. Its share of equity-accounted companies, including Nippon Light Metal, the Japanese associate, resulted in a Dollars 2m loss against a Dollars 22m profit. In Canada, where Alcan produces most of its ingot, losses were substantially lower. US operations, which include primary, fabricated and rolled products, showed a small loss against a slight profit. However, Brazil improved. The European units weakened, especially in Italy and France, because of the recession. Shipments of fabricated products were down 3 per cent and average realised prices slipped 12 per cent. Ingot shipments were lower but average prices received gained a little. Mr David Morton, chairman, said aluminium was likely to remain over-supplied in the near term, with depressed prices. Cost reduction and productivity gains remained the top priority.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Virgin still holding out Business travellers have been promised greater competition on the London-Johannesburg route for almost three years. Mr Richard Branson's UK carrier, Virgin Atlantic, applied to compete with the present carriers in 1991. Since then he has launched a service to Hong Kong and next month starts flying to San Francisco, while Johannesburg remains just an intention, writes Daniel Green. The London-Johannesburg route is precisely the kind of business over which Virgin likes to fight. As with Hong Kong and San Francisco, there have been two main carriers, British Airways and South African Airways, each making a lot of money. The unrestricted business class return fare can be Pounds 2,639. Virgin blames its inability to get the suitable slots at Heathrow for the delay in starting the services. It also acknowledges that uncertainty over change in South Africa has made other routes a priority.</p>

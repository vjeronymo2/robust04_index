			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / International Company News: Spanish bank rises to Pta29.9bn BANCO POPULAR, Spain's sixth-largest commercial bank in terms of assets, said its consolidated net profit for the first half of 1993 had risen 7.6 per cent over the same period last year, to Pta29.9bn (Dollars 221.5m). Although Spanish banks had become accustomed in the recent past to report double-digit profit increases, performance has been badly hit in the past year by recession and mounting bad debts. Analysts in Madrid said yesterday that Popular's figures could be regarded as very strong in the circumstances. Popular is consistently the most profitable of Spain's larger banks and is frequently rated as one of the most profitable in the world. The bank eschews the large industrial holdings common among its Spanish rivals and it has quietly and successfully avoided being drawn into the many market share battles being fought among Spanish banks for savers and consumers. Popular said it had made provision for loan losses and other costs of Pta11.7bn, a 32 per cent increase on the first half of 1992. But operating income rose 12 per cent to Pta104bn, faster than the 8 per cent increase in operating costs. Nevertheless, the figures showed that while the bank's consolidated financial margin grew 14.1 per cent over 1992, the cost of deposits grew by more than 17 per cent, reflecting tighter margins as competition intensifies. Total assets, which fell slightly in the first quarter, increased by 3.5 per cent overall in the first half to Pta2,903bn.</p>

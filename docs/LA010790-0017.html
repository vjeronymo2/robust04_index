			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE LIVES: GUMHEAD CONFIDENTIAL;  </P> <P> KICKING THE NICORETTE GUM HABIT CAN PUT YOU OUT OF YOUR RIGHT MIND  </P> <P> AFTER two days of suffering, I thought of a solution: Kill Moe. It wasn't that  I disliked him -- quite the contrary, but he was the only barrier between me  and a supply of my beloved Nicorette, the prescription chewing gum with  nicotine that helped me quit smoking.  </P> <P> Frankly, I liked Miss Nicky (the gum character in Doonesbury) much better than  I ever liked Mr. Butts. When I smoked, I had to brush my teeth every 20  minutes. And every time I inhaled a cigarette, I felt guilty about endangering  my health.  </P> <P> But I never felt guilty chewing (actually you don't chew, you park it on your  gums); instead I enjoyed a mild nicotine rush and the keen sense of moral  superiority and relief that goes with becoming a nonsmoker. I was very grateful  the gum was there for me.  </P> <P> And it would still be there for me if Moe, my pharmacist, hadn't opened his big  mouth. "You've got to stop chewing this," he exclaimed when I went to pick up  my weekly supply. "It's pretty obvious when someone's hooked," he chided,  adding that most people manage to give up the gum in a few months. I stammered  something about not really being a gum junkie. But Moe wouldn't let it drop.  "You don't go around shaking and dribbling at the mouth," he said. "And you're  not selling your body on the street. Still, it's not that difficult to spot a  problem." How? "Forty-eight refills is a clue," he said with a superior smile.  </P> <P> "I can stop whenever I want," I said defensively. But why would I want to stop?  I loved my wonderful gum. With cigarettes I faced public humiliation and social  ostracism. But not with Miss Nicky. There were no "Chewing" and "No Chewing"  sections in restaurants and airplanes. Strangers didn't lecture me on the  dangers of second-hand gum fumes. I wasn't ordered outside in the middle of a  dinner party if I wanted a chew.  </P> <P> Hardly anyone knew I was chewing. And who cared? There were no ashes, no  overflowing ashtrays, no foul odor clinging to my breath, clothes and hair.  There was no danger of starting a fire with gum. I wasn't going to accidentally  burn down a forest or a bed, or even singe a sofa. Once in a while, a piece  might get stuck to a sofa cushion, but a little ice would take it off.  </P> <P> It was no big deal, except to Moe. If it hadn't been for him, I wouldn't have  casually suggested to my husband, "Hey, honey. Let's drive to Tijuana." Duke  looked at me with alarm. I loathe Tijuana, but it's the only place on the  planet I know where they have flyers for the farmacia ("We have Retin-A!") in  the government tourist office. And in Mexico they sell Nicorette over the  counter.  </P> <P> "Have the doctor call the prescription in to another pharmacy," Duke said. I  considered it, but I knew I'd still imagine Moe's accusing voice saying,  "Gumhead, gumhead!"  </P> <P> So there I was, crazed, frantically rummaging through the wastebasket, hunting  for scraps of Nicorette; gnawing four packs of Chiclets a day. Chiclets  wouldn't do. Finally, I hit on the solution: Kill Moe.  </P> <P> It would be really easy.  </P> <P> He and my husband are longtime acquaintances, and we often run into each other  at social gatherings. In fact, we expected to see him that night at a benefit  on the Santa Monica Pier. I'd lure him over to the end of the wharf, on the  premise of discussing my addiction. And then a quick shove would do the rest.  </P> <P> But Moe didn't come. I didn't see him for three weeks. And by then, I was  already over the worst withdrawal symptoms. It wasn't just physical, oh no --  that discomfort lasted only a few days. What really rankled was the utter lack  of social cachet involved in my noble sacrifice. When I told my friends that I  was quitting smoking, I got compassion, I got admiration, I got useful tips.  But when I said that I was giving up Nicorette, eyes glazed, subjects changed,  people remembered urgent previous engagements.  </P> <P> Later, I called an expert to find out what diseases I'd managed to avoid.  "There's no disease caused by Nicorette gum," said Nina Schneider, associate  research psychologist at UCLA and the first American to study Nicorette.  "There's no evidence that it's unsafe. Even if you're on gum for five years,  you're not going to get emphysema, lung cancer or even heart disease."  </P> <P> Still, I guess I'm glad I quit. Duke's proud of me. And so is Moe. Recently, I  confessed I'd planned his murder. "Nobody's ever told me that," he said. "It's  a pharmaceutical first." I was about to tell him I appreciated his concern. But  Moe said, "You know, I would have given you another box. I'm not stupid. You  may have been addicted to the nicotine, but at least you weren't smoking."  </P> <P> I think I'm going to kill Moe.  </P></p>

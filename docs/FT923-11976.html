			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / People: Williams seeks window of opportunity George Williams, the 64-year-old founder of the recently floated Anglian Group, is back in business and planning to challenge his old company for the leadership of Britain's replacement window market. Williams, who started Anglian from one small workshop in 1966, has been appointed executive chairman of Aspen Windows, which has been formed by executives made redundant by Anglian. The firm, which will shortly move out of a chicken hut on Williams' Norwich estate, is a minnow compared with Anglian - valued at Pounds 184m when it was floated on the stock market this month. However, for a seven-month-old company, it has made an impressive start. It employs 250 people, has a dozen showrooms and in its first seven months has generated Pounds 4m of turnover. This is small beer compared with Anglian's annual turnover of close to Pounds 150m, but Williams has big ambitions. Among his executive team are several Anglian veterans including Malcolm Woodcock, Fred Searle and Denis Allen who either lost their jobs or retired. 'I believe we can put Aspen Windows in the top three window companies within five years. Maybe even become market leader,' Williams says. However, he stresses that he is not 'doing it for the money, but for the pure enjoyment'. He made a sizeable fortune when he sold Anglian to BET in 1984, and although he retired from Anglian in 1989 he says he misses the window business. Although some might question the wisdom of starting a new business in the midst of a recession, Williams is confident. He says that people are 'virtually giving away' showrooms and he has no difficulty recruiting professional staff. 'It was the case of the blind leading the blind in my early days,' he says. Anglian, whose stock market debut was marred by the general nervousness of investors, seems unruffled by its new competitor. It says that it has certain covenants with Aspen preventing its sales people competing for its business until January 1993. It also notes that it is a business where there have always been lots of small competitors.</p>

			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / McGowan to resign as chief executive at Williams Holdings ONE of Britain's best known management double-acts will be dissolved today when Mr Brian McGowan announces that he is to resign as chief executive of Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate. Mr McGowan, 48, will tell shareholders at the annual meeting that he will be stepping down at the end of the year. He is to be replaced by Mr Roger Carr, the managing director, who has headed Williams' so-called hit squad, which is sent into every company Williams has acquired. Mr Nigel Rudd will remain as executive chairman. There had been no hint from the group until now that Mr McGowan was about to break the successful partnership he has had with Mr Rudd since they acquired a controlling stake in the company at the end of 1981. However, Mr McGowan had privately made clear for some time that he was considering retiring, though it is understood he first told Mr Rudd two months ago about his intention to resign at the year-end. While both men have proved to be expert in identifying undervalued companies, Mr McGowan has concentrated more on the mechanics of takeover bids. Last night a friend of his said the company had not made a substantial bid for the past 18 months. 'It is time for the group to grow organically. As the acquisition man, he decided it was time for a change.' It is understood there was no acrimony between the two men. Mr McGowan is to remain chairman of Burnfield, a small industrial equipment company, which will only take up part of his time. He is to pursue his private interests such as fishing. Mr McGowan and Mr Rudd have transformed Williams from a small, lossmaking engineering group - in effect a shell company - into a diversified conglomerate which last year made pre-tax profits of Pounds 161m and is a member of the FT-SE 100 share index. In a string of substantial acquisitions, they have bought such well-known businesses as Yale locks, Swish curtain rails, Rawlplug, Polycell and Valor Heating. At the end of last year, Mr McGowan owned 766,000 Williams shares, worth Pounds 2.5m at yesterday's closing share price of 320p, which was 2p lower on the day. He also had options over a further 2.2m shares. His 1992 remuneration was Pounds 670,000.</p>

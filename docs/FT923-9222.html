			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Futures buying lifts Frankfurt and Paris STRATEGISTS were not inclined to take Frankfurt's improvement to their hearts yesterday, especially given indications that futures-related trading lifted both German and French shares yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT turned an early decline into a slight gain on futures-related buying. At midsession the FAZ was just 0.99 lower at 636.62 and by the close, the DAX index, hovering above 1,600, stood 17.30 or 1.1 per cent higher at 1,628.81. Turnover rose from DM4.1bn to DM5.0bn. Deutsche Bank's 3 per cent decline in first-half operating profits were below the trend for banks in general, but indications of a softening economy raised hopes that the Bundesbank would not increase the Lombard rate at today's meeting. Strong points included the interest rate-sensitive Bavarian banks, the cyclical chemicals and steels and Allianz, the top insurer which came under pressure last week. Deutsche Bank did not rise in line with the market, ending DM5 higher at DM635. Also trailing were the carmakers Daimler and BMW, up just DM1.50 to DM674 and DM3.50 to DM564 respectively. Daimler's denial of rumours of short-term working at Mercedes-Benz was not reported until after hours. PARIS was again driven by opinion polls on French voters' intentions in the Maastricht referendum. The CAC 40 index ended 10.35 higher at 1,797.98, but fell short of 1,800, in thin turnover of FFr1.4bn. Dealers said that trading was becoming increasingly technical and driven by the futures market. Euro Disney continued to recover as some investors sought over-sold situations and several brokers published buy notes. The stock added another FFr2.35 or 2.7 per cent to FFr89.10. Peugeot remained weak, falling FFr10 to FFr667 on news of a 2.9 per cent increase in first-half turnover to FFr82.61bn. Ciments Francais dropped FFr15 or 4.4 per cent to FFr325 after reporting a 5 per cent drop in first-half turnover. MILAN ran out of steam after its two-day rally, although rumours that the government was planning measures to support the market lifted prices after hours. The Comit index fell 4.98 to 419.63 in turnover estimated at L80bn after L67bn. After hours, Assogestioni said that Italian investment funds had a net outflow of L794bn in July, compared with a net outflow of L26bn in June. ZURICH followed Frankfurt to end higher on moderate turnover, as chemicals and financials led the SMI index to a gain of 14.9 at 1,820.3. Dealers were also looking for a slowdown in Swiss inflation today, possibly to a July figure of between 3.8 and 3.9 per cent after 4.2 per cent in June. AMSTERDAM was firmer ahead of today's half-year results from Philips and Royal Dutch. Royal Dutch rose 60 cents to Fl 146.40 while Philips added 10 cents to Fl 25.10. The CBS Tendency index closed up 0.7 at 118.1. KLM advanced 70 cents to Fl 32.30 after reporting a 14 per cent increase in airline traffic in July from a year earlier. COPENHAGEN fell to a new 1992 low with the all-share index down 2.05 at 303.64, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. Banks weakened on expectations of disappointing half-year results. Danske Bank and Unibank both lost DKr5, to DKr245 and DKr156 respectively. OSLO featured a record low in Uni Storebrand, the free shares closing down NKr1.50 at NKr20.50. The all-share index lost 4.68 or 1.24 per cent to 371.93 in turnover of Nkr150.9m. STOCKHOLM saw losses in the banking sector offset by Astra and Volvo as the Affarsvarlden index ended 1.2 lower at 863.1 in thin turnover of SKr224m. Astra B shares rose SKr6 to SKr551 274 while Volvo added SKr4 to SKr346 on the back of good US car sales. VIENNA slipped to an intraday all-time low of 759.32 before recovering slightly to close down 6.55 at 764.05. Austrian Airlines eased Sch26 to Sch1,580 after announcing a first half pre-tax loss of Sch251m. MADRID was mixed with the general index gaining 0.10 to 217.87, but turnover remained very low. Repsol slipped Pta25 to Pta 2,635 but with only 87,000 shares traded. BRUSSELS rose at the close of the trading account. The Bel-20 index gained 2.47 to 1,138.75 in low turnover of BFr521m. ISTANBUL retreated in technical trading. The 75-share index fell 16.33 to 4,174.37 in turnover of TL165bn.

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Observer: Whips' cream As European members of parliament prepare to vote on the ticklish subject of EU enlargement tomorrow, spare a thought for the whips feverishly trying to ensure a respectable turnout. Unlike their domestic counterparts, the bully boys of Strasbourg suffer an embarrassing paucity of sticks and carrots. With a houseful of backbenchers and no cabinet, how can you reward the dutiful - and more pertinently, punish the wayward? Conservative chief whip Lord Inglewood has learned one or two tricks since he took up his birch at the beginning of the year. The division of committee spoils in the next parliament is one focus of considerable interest, for instance. Apparently the real bogey for Conservatives is - un-PC thought coming up - being assigned to the women's rights committee. For the Labour party, it's legal affairs. 'I'm on that,' Inglewood reveals. An equally effective tool, he goes on, is the lure of a place on one of the 'interparliamentary delegations' - the most popular junkets being to the US or China. Yep, MEPs are uncomplicated beasts, really.</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANUFACTURERS' FIRST-QUARTER PROFIT DIPS 5%  </P> <P> Manufacturers' after-tax profit totaled $28.6 billion in the first quarter of  the year, down 4.9% or $1.5 billion from the final quarter of 1989, the  Commerce Department said Monday.  </P> <P> After-tax profit averaged 4.2 cents per dollar of sales in the first three  months of the year, a decline of 0.2 cents from the previous three months, the  department's Census Bureau said.  </P> <P> "We've seen profits bear much of the brunt of the economic slowdown," said Lynn  Reaser, senior economist at First Interstate Bancorp. "Profits were weak  through much of last year and that softness has continued."  </P> <P> But Reaser added: "I think we'll see some improvement in the latter part of the  year. Manufacturers have pared down their payrolls. They have become very lean  as companies attempt to protect their profit margins."  </P> <P> Sales in January, February and March totaled $683.5 billion, a gain of 0.4% or  $2.9 billion from October, November and December, the department said. The  figures were adjusted to reflect seasonal factors.  </P> <P> Food and printing businesses contributed to a significant decline in  first-quarter profits for the makers of non-durable goods.  </P></p>

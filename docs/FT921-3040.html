			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK shipyard to build two Oman warships BRITAIN'S Vosper Thornycroft shipyard has been told to go ahead with construction of two missile-carrying corvettes for Oman, in the first significant foreign order for British warships for more than three years. The deal, confirmed at the weekend after months of negotiation, is worth more than Pounds 150m including support. Details of the planned armament for the ships, due to be build over the next four years, are being kept secret. The 83-metre corvettes represent the UK's biggest naval export order since Vosper Thornycroft received the go-ahead from Saudi Arabia in 1988 to build the first three in a planned series of minehunters. Mr Chris Girling, the group's finance director, said the Oman order would not affect plans already under way for 350 redundancies at the yard. But he said it would assist Vosper Thornycroft's competitiveness in other export markets by enabling it to resume steel shipbuilding work in addition to vessels made of glass-reinforced plastic. In 1989, the Southampton-based shipbuilder was set to build three corvettes of the same type for Brunei. But the Brunei government subsequently decided to re-open the contract to international competition and has yet to invite fresh bids.</p>

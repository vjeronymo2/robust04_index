			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Business and the Environment: Why a hamburger should cost Dollars 200 - The call for prices to reflect ecological factors Most economic modelling concludes that the arduous negotiating exercise recently concluded in Geneva under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will give the world economy a new impetus. Ecologists, however, believe the world's trade ministers can only tinker with an economic system that is fundamentally flawed by its failure to count the ecological costs of production. 'This could leave us with a world where there's lots of money but dirty air and water and environmental degradation,' says Alan Thein Durning, author of Saving the Forests: What Will it Take? from the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental group. What is needed is a system of 'full-cost pricing' that includes environmental costs in production of goods, he says. This would radically alter cost structures. A mature forest tree in India would then be worth Dollars 50,000 (Pounds 34,000), according to the Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi. A hamburger produced on pasture cleared from rain forests would cost Dollars 200. One hectare of a Malaysian forest, providing carbon storage services and helping to prevent climate change, would be worth more than Dollars 3,000 over the long term, according to Durning. Environmentalists fear the costs of not moving towards ecological pricing will only become clear after it is too late. Deforestation is accelerating; two-thirds of the planet's original forests have already disappeared. There are numerous projects to demonstrate the value of the forests. A new scheme announced by Conservation International, a US environmental group, includes two US universities, two pharmaceutical companies and a botanical garden in an effort to expand the drug discovery industry in Surinam. CI will raise Dollars 1m over five years to finance the development of drugs from flora identified by forest dwellers, who have been collecting healing plants for centuries. The project proposes to institute an 'ethnobotanical premium', paying 50 per cent of royalties from future sales of drugs developed to a Forest People's Fund for the support of local communities in Surinam. Durning also insists the rights of forest dwellers must be honoured. He recommends 'joint management' arrangements between the indigenous peoples and their governments, because forest programmes under exclusive control of the state 'routinely fail'. Political reform is also necessary to reforestation efforts. 'To varying degrees, a bond between timber money and political power is found in all the world's main timber economies,' says Durning. 'In less democratic societies, those who question the prerogatives of economic power all too often end up as murder statistics in human rights reports.' Durning alleges that in countries like Malaysia - the world's largest exporter of tropical timber - elected leaders distribute to their loyal supporters contracts for the exploitation of public resources. Even in the US, the government moves reluctantly against the entrenched timber, mining and beef interests. He would like full-cost pricing phased in over 10-20 years through user fees, green taxes and tariffs. He reckons that a Dollars 3-a-day charge to visitors to US national forests would raise more money than timber sales from US government-owned lands. But first, governments must stop subsidising forest destruction. In the US the Clinton administration is edging towards raising prices for grazing lands, mining resources and, eventually, timber sales. Last April, it announced that it would halt the sale of timber from 62 of 156 national forests because of the money lost on timber sales. However, that decision has still to be implemented. No country can move to full cost pricing alone without risking having their industries undercut by foreign producers whose governments do not make environmental destruction costly. Global action is necessary.</p>

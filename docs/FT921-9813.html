			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Employers face transfer fee for poached staff EMPLOYERS who poach expensively-trained workers from competitors could face demands to repay training costs under a government plan to be unveiled this week. The former employers of poached recruits would be entitled to reclaim at least part of the cost of training if a worker left within a certain period, a white paper will propose. The move is designed to promote investment in training by those companies which may currently be discouraged by the prospect of losing recruits soon after training. The white paper will also contain proposals for vouchers for career guidance and counselling for adults as well as encouragement to employers to make the best use of their female employees and older workers. The government's intention is to attempt to raise its profile on training and employment issues as the election approaches. The white paper will come in a week when the 22nd consecutive monthly rise in unemployment is likely to be recorded: figures due to be released on Thursday are expected to show unem-ployment heading towards 2.6m Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, yesterday refused to be drawn on details of the white paper but said he was working on a 'whole series of ideas' that would bring qualifications within reach of everyone. 'And I'm talking about people in work - people who've left school or college some considerable time ago, perhaps without any qualifications,' he said. It is possible under the white paper scheme that employees could find themselves responsible for paying back training costs if they left a company. The costs of proposed training and the length of service required would be set out in contracts of employment. The notion of a 'transfer fee' for valuable employees has been debated in personnel circles for more than 20 years but has generally been viewed as impracticable. The Confederation of British Industry has not shown enthusiasm in the past for such a scheme. Mr Tony Blair, Labour employment spokesman, said he could not see how the proposals would work but the government's plan was 'at least an acknowledgement that training could not be left to market forces'. The plan was condemned by the independent training policy consultancy Fullemployment UK as being 'rigid and bureaucratic' and a 'potential leviathan'. Mr Peter Ashby, senior consultant, said the idea would 'not last more than a few weeks'.</p>

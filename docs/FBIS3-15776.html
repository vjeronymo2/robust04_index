			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There are various rumors circulating in the republic  alleging that the opposition forces would start riots in  Dushanbe and other towns and rayons of the republic on 13, 15,  or 21 March, and the armed groups of the opposition would  organize armed incursion on the Tajik-Afghan border.    The Tajik Security Ministry, Internal Affairs Ministry, and  Defense Ministry state with full responsibility that these  rumors are groundless and the republic's social and political  situation is under full control. The situation on the  Tajik-Afghan border is under control as well. The border is  safely controlled by Russian border troops in Tajikistan. The  border units of the Tajik Army, Russian servicemen of the 201st  motorized rifle division, as well as the units of the CIS  coalition peacekeeping forces render all-round assistance to the  Russian border troops.    There is no doubt that Tajikistan's border and territory  will  be protected from any kind of invasions. The ministries firmly  state that in the republic and on its borders there are no  forces able to violate the peace and tranquillity of Tajik  citizens.</p>

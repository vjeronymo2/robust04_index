In his today's  statement Kostikov says hasty conclusions are being drawn out of  a private incident, conclusions that affect the essence of the  U.S.-Russian relations.    As the press secretary noted, there can be no question of  preventing foreign visitors' contacts with opposition leaders.  It is in the Russian Government's interest that the full  picture of political life in Russia is known abroad. It was  expected that Richard Nixon, a well-known supporter of  democratic transformations in Russia, will use his visit to  Moscow with such an aim in mind. However, the ex-president's  meeting with Aleksandr Rutskoy created a certain context that  touched upon the complicated political moments in Russia's  internal affairs, the press secretary believes. According to  Kostikov, considerable part of the Russian public see Aleksandr  Rutskoy as one of the main organizers of the October revolt and  a serious threat to democracy and civil accord.    As regards to relations between Moscow and Washington, Boris  Yeltsin has repeatedly stated the importance of developing  friendly, partner-like ties with the United States, the  statement says.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Compel Compel Group, the computer systems and services company, yesterday announced a sharp increase in full year profits ahead of its flotation next month. Pre-tax profits more than trebled from Pounds 604,000 to Pounds 2.06m as the group benefited from a wide-ranging restructuring in the year to June 30. Mr Neville Davis, chairman and chief executive, said the outsourcing and consultancy businesses had grown strongly following the shake-up, which saw staff numbers cut by 14 per cent to 227. Launching the pathfinder prospectus, he added: 'Overheads have been cut but we need to raise fresh funds to continue growing the business.' The company hopes to raise about Pounds 5m of new money from the flotation, involving the placing of shares worth about Pounds 11m.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Since the issuance of that AD, improved and modified bearings have been approved by the FAA for these model helicopters. Additionally, the manufacturer has issued The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Service Information Letter (SIL) No. 0110, Revision B, dated March 18, 1993, that extends the previous visual inspections to include the Model F&hyph;28C&hyph;2 helicopters. The SIL describes an approved swashplate modification and indicates that the SIL should only apply to those affected helicopters manufactured prior to January 1, 1981. In addition, a swashplate modification that would constitute terminating action for the requirements of this AD has been approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 76&hyph;06&hyph;11 to require visual inspections of the lower swashplate bearings; expand the applicability to the Model F&hyph;28C&hyph;2 helicopter; establish a retirement life of 1,200 hours' time-in-service for certain upper and lower swashplate bearings; and correct the upper swashplate bearing part number in the existing AD. This proposed AD would also provide an optional terminating action from the requirements of this AD and limit the applicability of the AD requirements to those affected model helicopters manufactured prior to January 1, 1981. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 660 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 5 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $1,400 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,105,500. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

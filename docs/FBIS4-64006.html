			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov, Andrey </F> Krasnoshchekov, and Andrey Shtorkh]    [Text] Paris, 26 May (ITAR-TASS) -- During the interval  between plenary sessions of the Conference on Stability in  Europe a meeting was held at the initiative of France between  French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe, and Andrey Kozyrev. Galina Sidorova, political  adviser to the Russian foreign minister, told ITAR-TASS that the  French leaders thanked the Russian minister for his agreement to  take part in the conference and for Russia's active support for  the idea of holding it.    The main subject of the conversation was ways of deepening  relations between Russia and the principal European  institutions. The Russian side believes that this process has  not yet gathered sufficient momentum. The French leaders, for  their part, called for the earliest possible conclusion of an  agreement on partnership between Russia and the European Union  [EU]. They stressed that Paris no longer sees any obstacles to  completion of the negotiating process. All outstanding issues  were settled during the recent official visit to Russia by A.  Juppe. As we know, the main differences concerned conditions  for trade in materials of the nuclear fuel cycle.    France considers that the conclusion of an agreement on  partnership with the EU must be followed by further integration  of Russia with other European organizations.    The entire atmosphere of the talks and the fact that the  Russian minister was the only participant in the conference  received by the French leaders so early in the conference  testify to the present level of Russian-French cooperation,  including cooperation in the preparation of this important forum.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bass sells 46 pubs to Marston BASS has agreed to sell 46 public houses to Marston Thompson &amp; Evershed, the Staffordshire-based regional brewer, for Pounds 10.8m. This follows Bass's sale of 44 pubs to Greene King, the East Anglian brewer, last week for Pounds 17.5m. Mr John Denning, director of Bass Taverns, said yesterday: 'We continue to manage our portfolio of pubs to improve the overall quality of our estate and the return on capital employed.' Bass has opened 22 new houses so far this year and has a further 16 sites under development, representing a total investment of Pounds 34m. The pubs bought by Marston are mainly in south and south-west England and in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, areas in which the brewer is not represented in strength; 38 are freehold and 37 are under management, with the rest let to tenants. Mr David Gordon, managing director of Marston, said the outlets acquired increase the company's estate to 230 managed houses and 664 tenanted outlets.</p>

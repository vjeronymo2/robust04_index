A Boeing-737 from  Mainland China's Southwest Airlines was hijacked while en route  from Chengtu [Chengdu], Szechuan [Sichuan] to Fuchow [Fuzhou]  this morning, and landed at Chiang Kai-shek [CKS] Airport at  1042 [0242 GMT].    According to investigations, the man who hijacked the  airplane was 25-year-old [age as heard] Lin Wenqiang. His wife,  (Huang Chun-mien); his two children, (Li Hsin-yao) and (Li  Hsin-kao); and his 68-year-old foster mother (Li Yu-ying) were  also on board. The family of five were led by the aviation  police off the plane for further investigations.    The airplane has departed CKS Airport at 1444 [0644 GMT].  Except for Lin Wenqiang, his family and other passengers on  board were expatriated in the airplane.    It is understood that hijacker Lin Wenqiang, 25, is a Fukien  [Fujian] native. Today, he donned a uniform to pose as a  Communist Chinese armed police officer. To carry out the  hijacking, he carried a fruit knife and placed tissue paper in a  teacup to pass it off as an explosive device. According to the  hijacker's confessions, he hijacked the airplane to Taiwan in a  rage over the Communist Chinese local government's obstruction  of his application to set up a company.</p>

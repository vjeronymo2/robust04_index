			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT IN MURDERS OF MAN, WIFE ARRESTED;  </P> <P> CRIME: NEILL MATZEN, WHO CONFESSED TO THE SLAYINGS IN A LETTER TO A NEWSPAPER  AND VOWED TO KILL HIMSELF, IS DISCOVERED IN A FONTANA SHACK.  </P> <P> The latest twist in a bizarre murder triangle occurred Friday with the capture  of a tow-truck driver who confessed in a letter to a newspaper that he was paid  to kill a friend's wife, killed the friend in self-defense, then vowed to kill  himself in the desert.  </P> <P> Neill F. Matzen, 36, of Santa Ana was arrested at 11 a.m. in a squalid Fontana  shack on a warrant charging him with the Nov. 24 murder of Donna Connaty, who  was beaten to death with a lead pipe in her Buena Park home.  </P> <P> His blond hair matted and his clothes filthy from spending two nights in a  storm drain, Matzen did not resist capture, Buena Park Police Lt. Terry Branum  said.  </P> <P> Matzen had "befriended someone in the storm drain who told him how he could  make money selling scrap metal," Branum said. Matzen, who moved from the sewer  to a shack Thursday, deposited some copper wiring at the scrap shop in the  16000 block of Miller Street. The proprietor required him to show  identification and recognized Matzen's picture from newspaper and television  reports of his disappearance.  </P> <P> He then called Riverside County authorities, who notified Buena Park police.  They apprehended Matzen at 11 a.m. Friday in the lean-to, located near the  scrap shop.  </P> <P> During a two-hour interview in which police say he waived his rights, Matzen  allegedly gave police a story of the Connaty deaths that matched the story  offered in letters to police and his wife.  </P> <P> Later Friday, Matzen was housed at Orange County Jail, where he was held  without bail until his arraignment next week in North Orange County Municipal  Court.  </P> <P> Filled with allegations of trailer-park adultery and murder-for-hire, the  bizarre case first unfolded last month in Buena Park with the slaying of Donna  Connaty, a nurse at St. Joseph's Hospital in Orange who was estranged from her  husband, Richard.  </P> <P> She had charged her husband in court papers with abusing her and their three  children. As a result, Richard Connaty moved from their home to a Santa Ana  mobile home park, where his next-door neighbors were Neill and Cynthia R.  Matzen. Donna Connaty visited and at some point gave Cynthia Matzen a dog,  which later bit Matzen's daughter. The Matzens then sued Donna Connaty. The  events created bad feelings among the foursome, police said.  </P> <P> In Neill Matzen's letter to the newspaper, dated Dec. 7, he admitted beating  Donna Connaty to death in exchange for a promised $15,000 payment from her  husband, who was to get the money by refinancing the couple's house. Richard  Connaty was killed by Matzen on Dec. 3, after he ran into Matzen's Santa Ana  mobile home, shouted "You killed my wife," and shot Matzen in the left  shoulder.  </P> <P> Matzen then grabbed his pistol and shot Connaty squarely in the chest. Matzen  said in the letter to the Orange County Register that the shoot-out occurred  after he told Richard Connaty that he would no longer permit him to have an  affair with Matzen's wife.  </P> <P> Arrested for a brief time last week on suspicion of killing Richard Connaty,  Matzen was released from the jail ward of Western Medical Center in Anaheim  after the Orange County district attorney's office ruled that he shot Richard  Connaty in self-defense.  </P> <P> After the suicide and confession letters were received, Matzen was the subject  of a two-day dragnet in the remote Chiriaco Summit area of Riverside County,  where he had said his body could be found.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Marcida Dodson and correspondent Jon Nalick also contributed  to this story.  </P></p>

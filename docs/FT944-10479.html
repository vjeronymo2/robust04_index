			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Crime compensation scheme ruled unlawful: Appeal court says home secretary abused powers The government's new compen-sation scheme for victims of violent crime, introduced in April, was ruled unlawful by the Appeal Court yesterday. The decision is a further setback for Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary. The court said he had acted 'unlawfully' and 'abused his powers' by implementing the scheme without referring it to parliament. Mr Howard said last night he would be appealing against the decision to the Lords. The new tariff-based scheme sets fixed levels of compensation for different categories of injury, replacing the previous scheme based on personal injury compensation rules, which took account of individual circumstances. The government said the new scheme was necessary to curb compensation costs and unless changes were made, the annual cost of payments would rise from Pounds 224m to Pounds 550m by 2001. The ruling prompted immediate opposition demands for Mr Howard's resignation. It comes on top of a series of parliamentary rebuffs and prison security scandals which have already severely damaged his reputation as home secretary. Mr Jack Straw, shadow home secretary, said Mr Howard had 'arrogantly and foolishly' rejected Labour attempts to give the scheme legal backing. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the home secretary's position was 'untenable'. Opposition leaders pointed out that Mr Howard ignored warnings about the scheme from several eminent judges. Lord Carlisle, former Conservative minister who chairs the criminal injuries compensation board, opposed it. Senior Conservative backbenchers said the ruling would undermine support for Mr Howard, who is under fire from the right for failing to be effective on law and order. The decision was a victory for the TUC and 10 trades unions, led by the Fire Brigades Union, all of whose members run the risk of criminal injury at work. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said the judgment promised to stop Mr Howard 'doing great damage and injustice' to many victims of crime. Compensation awards are running at roughly one-tenth the level under the old scheme. Mr Ken Cameron of the FBU said firefighters killed or injured as a result of arson received Pounds 750,000 in compensation last year. Under the new scheme they would have received Pounds 75,000. If the government loses in the Lords, awards made since April will have to be reassessed under the old scheme. The Court said the 1988 Criminal Justice Act contained measures to put the old common law scheme on a statutory footing. The act gave the home secretary discretion as to when but not whether the statutory scheme should be introduced. He was therefore under a legal duty to implement the statutory scheme or repeal the legislation before introducing a new one. One more blot in Howard's annus horriblilis, Page 10</p>

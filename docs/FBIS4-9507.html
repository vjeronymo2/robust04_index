			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(bog, mh)": "Jozef Moravcik Has Been Elected </F> Chairman of the Democratic Union of Slovakia"]    [Excerpt] Bratislava--Delegates to the amalgamation  assembly of the Alliance of Democrats of Slovakia [AD SR] and  the Alternative for Political Realism (APR) elected Jozef  Moravcik chairman of the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS) on  Saturday [23 April]. Milan Knazko was elected first deputy  chairman, and Roman Kovac and Viliam Vaskovic were elected  deputy chairmen.    Rudolf Filkus was also a candidate for the post of deputy  chairman, but he did not gain the required number of votes. The  proposal submitted by E. Bartosova that the number of deputy  chairmen be increased to four to include J. Budaj was not  passed. The delegates elected a 50-member DEUS Republican  Council. R. Filkus and J. Budaj are members of it. Following  Saturday's assembly, DEUS has 18 deputies in parliament.    In the morning, each entity held a separate meeting, at  which  its delegates voted for the merger. We have learned that,  shortly after the AD SR meeting, one of its delegates, Jozef  Olejar, walked out. In response to a question from SME on the  reason for his departure, M. Knazko said at a news conference  that he was "not informed about it." According to him, Mr.  Olejar probably "drew the conclusions for himself" from the vote  on the merger. The joint meeting of the two entities was then  held.    At the beginning, 133 of the 140 delegates (70 each from the  AD SR and APR) agreed with the merger, six abstained, and one  was against.    According to its adopted program, DEUS would like to  represent a broad spectrum of liberal political views and values  that express the idea of citizen-community-state. The program  considers the most important objectives in the economic sphere  to be ongoing support for the economy's restructuring and  modernizing and speeding up privatization and making it more  transparent so that the majority of state property becomes  privately owned as soon as possible. DEUS wants to support the  citizens' individual responsibility for their own social  situation, and the priority in the foreign policy sphere is the  Slovak Republic's orientation toward European integration.    J. Findra, head of the Office of the President, read out to  the assembly a letter of greetings from the president of the  Republic. In it, the president emphasized, among other things,  that politicians should set an example of correctness,  tolerance, and polished manners. "Let us show that crudeness  and demagoguery have no place in our politics. Let us show that  decency and understanding are the characteristic traits of the  citizens of our country and not big gestures and intolerance."  DEUS Chairman J. Moravcik said after his election that the one  failing of the Slovak political scene is its atomization.    After the assembly, Deputy Chairman M. Knazko said the  following in connection with speculation that a second Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] has been formed by the merger:  "Do not speak of the devil; one is enough." He emphasized that  "this merger was not short-term and purpose-oriented but was  proceeded by a natural process from the Public Against Violence  Movement via the HZDS." In response to a question from SME on  whether representatives from all of the political parties were  invited to the assembly and why a representative from the  Christian Social Union [KSU], which is holding talks with the  HZDS about a preelection coalition, was invited, Knazko said:  "We invited the chairmen of both the HZDS and the Slovak  National Party, but, to everyone's disappointment, they did not  attend the assembly. The KSU, yes; we invited all of the  parties that are mentioned in public opinion polls and may  become our partners." [passage omitted]</p>

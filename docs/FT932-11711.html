			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: McCarthy &amp; Stone trims loss to Pounds 6.1m MCCARTHY &amp; Stone, Britain's biggest builder of sheltered housing for elderly, yesterday announced a reduced loss of Pounds 6.1m for the six months to the end of February, against Pounds 6.9m. The interim dividend is being passed as was last year's final after an interim payment of 0.5p. Losses per share fell from 11.1p to 9.9p. Mr John McCarthy, chairman, said it was a creditable performance given the recent difficulties in the housing market. Turnover fell from Pounds 27.2m to Pounds 25.7m despite a 16 per cent increase in the number of homes sold in the UK. Mr McCarthy said that the underlying increase was a little more than 3 per cent if a 'one-off' bulk sale of 41 units was excluded. The average price of a retirement flat had fallen from Pounds 68,500 to Pounds 61,100. As a result the UK made an operating loss of Pounds 500,000 compared to break even a year ago. Losses in France increased from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 400,000. Mr McCarthy said the group was 'looking to liquidate its overseas net operating assets of Pounds 14.4m as quickly as possible for re-investment in the UK'. The group, which has renegotiated its financing arrangements with its bankers until November next year, had net borrowings of Pounds 69.1m only marginally less than the Pounds 69.2m of a year earlier and compared with shareholders funds of Pounds 72.1m. The group said borrowings would have been less but for the adverse effect of exchange rates on Pounds 3.4m of overseas debt and fees of Pounds 2.9m payable on the renewal of bank facilities and lease finance. COMMENT McCarthy &amp; Stone's share price, which slipped a further 1 1/2 p to 31p yesterday, has languished while other builders have bounced on prospects of a UK housing market recovery. The shares have underperformed the FT Actuaries construction index by more than 50 per cent since the end of April last year. The arguments against the shares are that recovery in sheltered housing is likely to lag the traditional housing market. In addition gearing is very high and could constrain the group when sales do pick up. Losses this year are likely to be more than Pounds 7m, with the possibility of another small loss next year. It may be a buy at some stage, but not yet given the the size of borrowings and the risks in the sector.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONTREAL AIRPORT HEIST NETS $13.7 MILLION  </P> <P> Armed thieves ambushed a private plane as it taxied down a runway Saturday and  fled with about $13.7 million in gold ingots and other valuables in one of  Canada's largest robberies, police said.  </P> <P> The pre-dawn heist at Dorval Airport outside Montreal was carried out by at  least four men, including one armed with an assault rifle.  </P> <P> They used a garbage truck to smash through a fence, then drove off with the  loot in stolen vans, police said. The vans and the weapon were later found  about 3 1/2 miles from the airport.  </P> <P> The twin-engined jet plane, owned by Sky Services Inc. of Montreal, had been  chartered by Brink's Canada Ltd. and was returning from a regular overnight run  from New York via Ottawa and Toronto. It landed shortly before 4 a.m. local  time and ran straight into the ambush.  </P> <P> A masked thief carrying the rifle stayed on the ground while three others went  inside the plane, Police Lt. Andrew Theodosis said.  </P> <P> "They told the three people aboard -- a Brink's guard, the pilot and the  co-pilot -- to keep looking straight ahead, not to turn back. Then they started  unloading the cargo area," he said.  </P> <P> Police said no one was injured and no shots fired.  </P></p>

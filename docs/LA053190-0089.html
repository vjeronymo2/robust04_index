			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> U.S. REJECTS STATE PRODUCE RESTRICTIONS  </P> <P> Florida's petition to restrict California produce was shot down Wednesday by  the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which said that California's efforts to  contain the Medfly are ensuring the purity of state-grown fruits and  vegetables.  </P> <P> Florida's petition could be reconsidered within 30 days. But barring a major  new outbreak of the Mediterranean fruit fly in California, the federal  government will "leave things the way they are now, because California is  beating the Medfly," a spokesman for the department's Animal and Plant Health  Inspection Service said.  </P> <P> In rejecting Florida's petition to have all California produce be inspected and  certified free of Medfly larvae, the Department of Agriculture noted that no  Medfly has been caught since May 1 in any of California's more than 35,000  traps deployed in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties.  </P> <P> The policies outlined in Florida's petition, if ordered by the Department of  Agriculture, would have profoundly wounded California's multibillion-dollar  farm economy, much of which lies outside the areas where Medflies have been  caught. In addition to asking special inspection and certification, Florida  agriculture officials had asked the federal government to make California enact  tougher and broader Medfly eradication efforts -- to deploy more traps  statewide and spray malathion more often and over a wider area.  </P> <P> Florida, which is California's main rival in citrus and other Sun Belt crops,  has suffered from its own Medfly epidemic this year, and links its recurrent  pest problems to the import of California produce.  </P> <P> The crop-consuming insect attacked both California and Florida farms in 1981,  appearing first in California. Florida and four other states then tried to bar  California produce, but California successfully sued to overturn Florida's  attempted quarantine.  </P> <P> Last Friday, Doyle Conner, Florida's commissioner of agriculture, argued in  announcing the petition that Californian Medflies are "widely distributed" and  present "a very real and serious threat of being moved to Florida and other  Southern states by way of infested host fruits and vegetables."  </P> <P> "Therefore," Conner said, "strict and encompassing quarantine regulations must  be imposed in California to protect other areas of the United States."  </P> <P> Florida officials maintain that the California Department of Food and  Agriculture deploys too few Medfly traps to know the magnitude of the problem.  </P> <P> Since Jan. 26, when the first of 19 Medflies was caught in Southern California,  the state has installed about 30 traps per square mile within the federally  declared Medfly quarantine area, which embraces about 1,300 square miles of the  Los Angeles Basin. But in the rest of the state -- where no Medflies have been  caught -- the department places five traps per square mile in urban areas and  one trap per square mile in harvest areas.  </P> <P> Agriculture officials in Florida's Dade County, responding to the capture of 23  Medflies in a 15-square-mile area there in recent months, have mounted a strong  anti-Medfly campaign involving the placement of 10 traps per square mile and  spraying malathion three to four times in threatened areas before introducing  sterile male Medflies.  </P> <P> Connie Hiherd, assistant director of the Florida Department of Agriculture's  division of plant industry, said the California Department of Food and  Agriculture should do the same. She criticized the California eradication  effort for taking "shortcuts," such as spraying areas only once or twice.  </P> <P> "Their detection efforts are not adequate. The program there is not following  the advice of its advisers," Hiherd said.  </P> <P> But a group of high-ranking state agriculture officials on the National Plant  Board Advisory Council were not persuaded by the appeal from the Florida  representative. Members representing California, New Jersey, Maryland,  Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Alabama and Oregon were involved.  </P> <P> "Florida was the only state within the panel making a strong pitch for the  petition," said Isi Siddiqui, assistant director of the California Department  of Food and Agriculture, the state's representative to the advisory council.  </P> <P> Siddiqui said Florida's proposal would have cost California taxpayers "hundreds  of thousands of dollars in unnecessary measures to regulate millions of tons of  fruit."  </P> <P> Florida agriculture officials vowed to push again for the measure, particularly  if more Medflies turn up next month in California traps.  </P></p>

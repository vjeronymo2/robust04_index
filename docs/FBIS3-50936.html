According to a study coordinated and financed by the Latin  American Social Research Institute (ILDIS) and the State Reform  Commission (COPRE), carried out by sociologist Enma de  Ghinaglia, and included in the social agenda for the nineties,  "the distribution of family expenditures may be an important  indicator for gaining an understanding of what portion of income  is committed to meeting subsistence needs, and what proportion  could be allocated to other need categories, including housing."    According to this work, this indicator would be variable and  would be manifested differently in the various strata of the  population, depending on the development of inflation and the  mobility in the earning of income.    Enma de Ghinaglia notes that according to the family budget  survey carried out by the Central Bank of Venezuela, poor  households spent 50 percent of their income on food in 1989,  while the figures for the middle and upper strata were 42 and 31  percent, respectively.    This situation would seem to have deteriorated in the  1990's,  because the document in question says that "the portion of their  expenditures the poorest households allocated for food came to  68 percent of the family budgets in 1992."    On this point, it is also noted that at the present time the  lowest strata (D and E) no longer have available the 15 percent  they formerly devoted to basic housing maintenance.  <H5>  The Unattainable Ceiling </H5>   The work by Ghinaglia says that according to the data  provided by the 1990 Population and Census Housing, a gross  housing deficit of 880,083 units still existed. This figure  included 459,157 units deemed unacceptable, based on their  "physical-structural" condition, and 420,926 housing units being  shared by several families (functional deficit).    Based on certain indicators such as the purchasing power of  Venezuelan families, the study stratified current housing needs  in terms of possible availability and family expectations.    --Stratum I. The insolvent category, made up of families  with  incomes below the minimum monthly wage (9,000 bolivares). This  category includes 21 percent of the households that are below  the extreme poverty line (743,358 households). Satisfaction of  the housing needs of families in this category is postponed  because of the primary requirement of meeting survival needs.    --Stratum II. This category is made up of barely solvent  families with monthly incomes ranging between one and three  times the minimum wage (between 9,000 and 27,000 bolivares).  This category includes 49 percent of the households in the  country (1,741,774) hovering on the poverty line. For this group  as well, the need to provide other basic necessities overrides  the need to resolve this problem.    --Stratum III. This category is made up of families with  average solvency and earning monthly incomes ranging between  three and five times the basic wage (between 27,000 and 45,000  bolivares). This category includes 23 percent of the households  (835,011). These families have a limited portion of their own  resources available. Here, housing is an urgent need.    --Stratum IV. This category is made up of solvent families  with incomes ranging between five and 10 times the minimum  monthly wage (between 45,000 and 90,000 bolivares). It includes  6 percent of the households (200,553). Relatively speaking,  these families' needs are satisfied. Housing plays an important  role in family life.    --Stratum V. This category is made up of highly solvent  families with incomes exceeding 10 times the minimum monthly  wage. Only 1 percent of the households (40,270) are included in  this category. These families are able to satisfy a broad range  of needs. Housing is even perceived as a status symbol and as an  investment.    One of the phenomena brought out by this study is the  imbalance in housing demand, since "it can be seen that the  solvent strata absorb the supply intended for the weaker or less  solvent strata."    Among the factors believed to affect this phenomenon are the  following:     -  The impossibly high prices, in terms of purchasing  capacity.    -  The disparity between types of housing and family  expectations.    -  The lack of resources to meet the needs of Strata  I and III, according to the provisions of the Housing Policy  Law.    -  The high inflation rates.    -  Various legal restrictions.       With the implementation of the Housing Policy Law, this  sociologist says, 98.587 billion bolivares have been allocated  to this sector in the past three years. Of this sum, 70 percent  was designated for Assistance Area I in the law. It is expected  that a total of 38.822 billion bolivares will be allocated for  the financing of the law in 1993.    Between 1990 and 1992, the total number of units produced  was  186,111. This result, the researcher comments, would seem  limited to the production of housing units in the formal sector,  "if the volume of the resources allocated to Areas I and III is  compared with the results achieved in the effective period for  the Housing Policy Law and the magnitude of the needs of the  families."</p>

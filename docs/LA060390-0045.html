			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK'S FILM PICKS, BY TIMES CRITICS: ADOLESCENT ANGST, TALK RADIO AND TWO  RARELY SEEN CLASSICS FROM DECADES PASSED  </P> <P> Talk Radio  </P> <P> Oliver Stone's 1988 film makes you laugh, makes you mad and keeps you on edge  watching for the killers in the shadows. Eric Bogosian stars in this savagely  audacious movie of his play that is a dip into the dangerous games played  between a performer and his audience, a society and its malcontents and the  medium of radio and the faceless voices it broadcasts.  </P> <P> Bogosian's baiting call-in host offers listeners a stream of vituperation,  abuse and wild sarcasm.  </P> <P> Sunday at 9 p.m. Cinemax  </P> <P> House of Games  </P> <P> David Mamet's coldly absorbing, 1987 romantic thriller is almost as dry as  remembered sin and involves a Seattle psychiatrist (Lindsay Crouse) pulled by  desire and curiosity into the con games of the oily and smoothly antagonistic  Mike (Joe Mantegna).  </P> <P> Tuesday at 8 p.m. KCOP Michael Wilmington  </P></p>

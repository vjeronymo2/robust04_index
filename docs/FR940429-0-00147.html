Under those sections, if termination became effective during a payment period and a student had received a commitment to receive title-IV, HEA Program funds for that payment period before the effective date of termination, the student would receive those funds for that payment period as long as the institution continued to provide instruction to the student during that payment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters suggested that the end of the applicable award or fiscal year should not be used as the effective date for loss of eligibility as a result of a violation of the requirement to derive more than 85 percent of an institution's revenues from title IV, HEA program funds. They pointed out that the loss of eligibility has the effect of causing an institution to be liable for any title IV, HEA program funds disbursed or delivered after that date but before a compliance audit substantiating the institution's calculations is performed. These commenters suggested that institutions not be held liable for any such disbursements or deliveries of those funds made before the date on which calculations are audited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These comments have been addressed in connection with &sect;600.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 600.41&blank;Termination and Emergency Action Proceedings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three commenters supported the Secretary's proposed position in this section to use a show-cause proceeding for terminations of institutional eligibility only in instances where neither the facts nor the law would be in dispute during the proceeding. Two commenters objected to the use of a show-cause proceeding (in place of a proceeding under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G) for terminations of institutional eligibility for a violation under &sect;&sect;600.5(a)(8) or 600.7(a), claiming that violations of these provisions could involve questions of fact that are in dispute. A commenter also objected to the use of a show-cause proceeding (in place of a proceeding under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G) for terminations for loss of accreditation, preaccreditation, or State legal authorization. One commenter suggested that the Secretary always use a proceeding under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, for violations of provisions in part 600. One commenter suggested that the Secretary always use a show-cause proceeding, rather than a proceeding under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, for terminations of institutional eligibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary reiterates that because an institution itself reports that it is not in compliance with the applicable eligibility requirements of &sect;&sect;600.5 or 600.7, there is no question of fact in dispute in a termination action taken on those grounds. The Secretary continues to believe that a termination proceeding under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, is neither necessary nor cost effective when facts are not in dispute. The Secretary agrees, however, that it is appropriate to use the provisions of 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, when the Secretary undertakes to terminate an institution's eligibility when the facts giving rise to that termination are in dispute. However, even with regard to these institutions, the Secretary may take an emergency action against such an institution if that action is considered warranted, and if the institution challenges the emergency action, that dispute is heard in a show-cause proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, the Secretary certified that the proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Several commenters suggested that this statement was erroneous and that these rules will definitely have a significant impact on institutions, especially the smaller ones that are not computerized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary recognizes that the regulations will have an impact on small institutions. However, based on Department estimates of the impact, the Secretary does not believe that the impact will be disproportionately or economically significant. The Secretary therefore reaffirms his certification that the regulations would not have a significant economic impact or a substantial significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. To the extent that commenters are able to provide additional information on the economic impact of the regulations, the Secretary invites the commenters to submit this information so that it may be considered in reviewing the regulations to reduce regulatory burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, the Secretary provided an estimate for the total number of burden hours associated with these regulations. Several commenters suggested that this estimate was understated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In estimating the total number of burden hours associated with these regulations, the Secretary considers the best information that is available to the Department and computes the estimate based on that information. The commenters have complained about the burden but have not provided sufficient additional information to support a revised computation of burden hours. The Secretary appreciates the comments and recognizes that the requirements of the statute and regulations impose a burden. As a result of the comments and revisions to the regulations, the Department is modifying the burden estimates. The total annual reporting and recordkeeping burden that would result from the collection of the information is 20,375 burden hours for this package.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential costs associated with the final regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens specifically associated with information collection requirements were identified and explained in the NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

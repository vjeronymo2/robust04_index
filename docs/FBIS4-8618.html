			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Senada Cumurovic on a news conference by </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Bosnian  Croat representative Kresimir Zubak in Sarajevo on 14 April --  recorded]    [Text] [Cumurovic] Today's top-level meeting, as Kresimir  Zubak called it, by the authorized representatives and deputies  of the Bosniak and Croatian people was held in a positive  atmosphere, and the two delegations analyzed what had been done  since the signing of the Washington Agreement.    [Zubak] At the same time we discussed the measures and  activities that need to be undertaken to implement the  Washington agreement, that is, the constitution adopted by the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly.    [Cumurovic] Kresimir Zubak also said that some very  significant issues were raised today, for example, how to  reorganize the government so that it can function as the  government of Bosnia- Herzegovina and the government of the  federation, the question of the leading functions in the  federation and how to organize the next session of the  Constituent Assembly.    [Zubak] We agreed today to hold the next session of the  Constituent Assembly sometime between the 28th and 30th of this  month. We expect that by that time we will have agreed on the  issues that we discussed today. Today we agreed on the basic  principles in connection with the determination and nomination  of candidates for president and vice president of the republic,  and the prime minister and deputy prime minister. As Mr.  Silajdzic said, in about seven days we will hold another session  at the same level, when, I am certain, we will reach complete  agreement. Then we will nominate the candidates, and the  assembly session will be scheduled for the period of 28-30  April. I believe that the assembly [words indistinct] and we  will confirm [words indistinct].    [Cumurovic] Dr. Haris Silajdzic explained the results of  today's talks with the following words:    [Silajdzic] Our listeners and viewers will probably be  interested in what we agreed on for the interim period in order  to find an urgent solution to the problems of everyday life. We  (?agreed on the opening) of the entire energy system of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the repair of all the transmission  systems; therefore, on [words indistinct] Rama, turning on the  hydroelectric power station (?Globovica), on the delivery of all  the necessary materials for the full functioning of the thermal  power stations Kakanj and Tuzla. We discussed the problem of  the return of refugees, and we agreed, of course, on how to  enable people to return to their last abode of residence. That  is of course the view held before, only now it has been  confirmed.    We are talking here about issues that have been covered  before at the meetings of the commissions, and at today's  meeting all this was confirmed. Priority should be given to the  reconstruction of destroyed railroad bridges -- we believe that  is the priority on the Neretva River -- and the repair of the  railroad line from Stolac toward the west. The construction of  a bridge across the Sava River between Orasje and Zupanja has to  be taken most seriously. The telephone lines from the south to  Sarajevo have to be established, and thus the shattered  communications system reestablished. Telephone lines have to be  reintroduced to the left bank of Mostar, and the entire left  bank of Mostar has to be supplied with water, including the  reintroduction of the Studenac spring into the system. At least  two megawatts of electricity have to be allowed into that part  of the city. There is the question of coordinating the entire  humanitarian system, and placing that system in the hands [words  indistinct].    [Cumurovic] The talks between the two delegations led by Dr.  Haris Silajdzic and Kresimir Zubak were attended by Victor  Jakovich, U.S. ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Zdravko  Pancevic, Croatian ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina.    After making his statement on the results of today's  meeting,  Dr. Silajdzic answered several questions asked by foreign  reporters about the fierce chetnik attacks on civilians and  members of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR].    Addressing that issue, he said that he was astonished at the  enormity of the evil happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina, without  getting any real reaction from the international community. He  stressed that the people who destroyed Bosnia-Herzegovina,  people who murdered 200,000 citizens, people who were attacking  safe havens and UNPROFOR are still referred to as a side in the  conflict. He wondered what else they would have to do to  trigger any real action. And we would like to cite the following  part of Silajdzic's statement:    I would like to send a message to those Serbs on the  occupied  territories who might be deceived into joining Karadzic. They  can now see the Croats and the Bosnian Muslims living and  working together in a normal democratic state. If they want to  join us, they are welcome.</p>

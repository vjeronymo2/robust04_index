A document made public in Bishkek points  out that "the extremely grave crisis situation" has made them  take this step.    The parties demand, in particular, that measures be taken to  halt the production slump, that key state management posts be  filled by specialists as soon as possible, regardless of their  nationality or tribal allegiance, and that pensions and benefits  for the needy be increased. The document also demands that the  government devote the maximum attention to carrying out spring  field work.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Finance is  cautiously assessing the feasibility of allowing overseas  branches of Taiwan banks to do business with overseas branches  of mainland Chinese banks, Vice Finance Minister Li Chung-ying  said Monday [22 May].    Li made the statement at a seminar on Mainland China's  economic and financial affairs, which was jointly sponsored by  the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and the banking  institute.    Under the proposal, however, direct links between Taiwan  banks and mainland Chinese banks would still be banned.    The vice minister noted that five domestic banks -- Hua Nan  Commercial Bank, the First Commercial Bank, Chang Hwa Commercial  Bank, Chiao Tung Bank, and the International Commercial Bank of  China -- have applied to the ministry to do business with  overseas branches of mainland banks.    The banks must submit information concerning what the  relationship between their overseas branches and overseas  mainland banks would be, including agreeing to a place outside  of Taiwan, Mainland China, or Hong Kong where legal disputes  could be settled.    Hua Nan Bank, which maintains a branch in Hong Kong, is very  likely to become the first Taiwan bank to forge a cooperative  relationship with mainland counterparts, including the Bank of  China, once its application is approved by the ministry, Li  elaborated.    MAC Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian said that increased  cross-Strait banking ties would expand funding channels for  Taiwan investors on the mainland, but that whether the proposal  gets final approval is dependent on the extent to which it would  help make Taiwan more competitive and how it would affect  indirect cross-Strait trade.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / MMC's impact to be assessed A powerful committee of MPs is to investigate the effectiveness of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the competition watchdog. The Commons trade and industry committee intends to look at developments in a number of markets to assess the impact of past MMC rulings. Areas covered will include new cars, compact discs and beer. The cross-party body is expected to start its probe early in the new year. The inquiry comes after a year in which the government's competition policy has come under fire from consumer groups and others. In July Mr Stephen Locke, director of policy at the Consumers' Association, said competition policy was in urgent need of review and warned that the MMC  -which has an annual budget of Pounds 5.5m - was 'gradually diminishing into a toothless watchdog'. His comments came about two months after it emerged that senior officials at the Office of Fair Trading were increasingly concerned that the Department of Trade and Industry was softening its stance on competition policy to help create strong UK champions capable of competing globally. Last month it was announced that Sir Bryan Carsberg was to step down early as director-general of fair trading, after three years in which his strong advocacy of consumers' interests increasingly put him in conflict with the MMC. In August Mr Neil Hamilton, then corporate affairs minister, said that a review by Price Waterhouse, the management consultants, had concluded that the MMC had been effective in its role as an investigative body and had carried out its responsibilities in 'an independent, professional and fair manner'.</p>

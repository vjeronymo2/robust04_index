			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION CLEARS CITY PLANNING AIDE OF BRIBERY CHARGES  </P> <P> A Huntington Beach Planning Department employee who was suspended last  September pending an investigation of allegations of bribery and other  improprieties has been cleared of serious wrongdoing, city officials said.  </P> <P> Sergio Martinez, who checks building plans to ensure compliance with city  codes, returned to work Monday following a 4-month suspension with pay,  according to Mike Adams, the city's director of community development.  </P> <P> Adams said allegations that Martinez had duped a builder into paying him $2,000  to get construction plans approved in 1978 could not be substantiated in an  investigation by the Orange County district attorney's office.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade Monday declined to confirm that his office  was involved in any investigation of the charges. Wade, who is in charge of  special investigations for the district attorney's office, routinely declines  to acknowledge investigations that do not result in criminal charges.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Told of Conflict  </P> <P> Martinez did violate city personnel codes, Adams said, by approving plans for a  room addition drawn by his wife, who operates a drafting business out of the  couple's home. But Martinez had told his supervisor of the conflict at the  time, according to Adams, who said the supervisor erred in telling Martinez to  check the plans anyway.  </P> <P> Martinez, a 16-year city employee, said Monday that his lawyer, Zaiden R.  Corrado, was notified by the district attorney's office that its investigation  had turned up no proof of any bribe. He acknowledged that he had approved his  wife's room plan but said that it only happened on one occasion and that her  plan was treated no differently than others submitted.  </P> <P> "There was a policy established in the department in which I was authorized to  do that (work on his wife's plans) as long as those drawings were pointed out  to the supervisor and double-checked," Martinez said. "That's what happened,  and those drawings were in full compliance with city code. There was no  preferential treatment in the process."  </P> <P> Martinez, 58, a former Cuban government architect who fled that country in  1963, said the charges were investigated "fairly and professionally." He said  he has been told that there will be no disciplinary action against him.  Martinez studied architecture in Cuba but is not a licensed architect in this  country.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unnamed Developer  </P> <P> "I have been a professional all my life, and things like this occasionally  happen," he said. "It is water under the bridge now, and I am back without any  resentment."  </P> <P> Efforts to reach Corrado and Paul E. Cook, the city administrator, were  unsuccessful Monday.  </P> <P> Adams said the allegations originated with an unnamed developer, who claimed  that he was tricked into writing a $2,000 check to Martinez at a time when his  plans were subject to approval by Martinez. The developer, who had taken over a  project from another builder and said he was unfamiliar with city procedures,  was interviewed by Huntington Beach police and district attorney's  investigators, but could provide no proof of the payment, according to Adams.  </P> <P> "The developer made a statement that he wrote a check," Adams said. "His  statement was based on 10 years of memory, and he couldn't say whether it was  paid to Sergio or someone else. He could not recall who he did business with.  It was real vague."  </P> <P> Adams confirmed that when he was Martinez's supervisor, until about 2 years  ago, he knew of Doris Martinez's drafting business and required Martinez to  inform him whenever a drawing done by his wife was submitted for approval. In  the future, Martinez will have no involvement with work done by his wife, Adams  said.  </P> <P> Adams attributed rumors of broad wrongdoing by Martinez to "personality  conflicts" with other city employees.  </P> <P> Martinez has worked as the city's only plan checker with responsibility for  ensuring that projects include sufficient parking spaces, are built the  required distance from property lines and meet other non-structural  requirements. Other Planning Department workers, as well as part-time  employees, helped to absorb Martinez's duties during his suspension, Adams  said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Liberal-Democratic Party leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy told representatives of the Islamic Cultural Center  that after coming to power, his party would hold a referendum on  dividing Russia into guberniyas (provinces), the  Liberal-Democratic Party's Press Secretary Grigoriy  Serebrennikov told INTERFAX.

He also noted that Tatar  Akhmet Khalitov was his party's vice-chairman.

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: RPO sales play sweet music as Tring rises to Pounds 2.56m Tring International Group, the publisher of budget-priced compact discs and audio cassettes that was floated last February, is paying a maiden interim dividend of 1.42p. Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 rose by 19 per cent from Pounds 2.16m to Pounds 2.56m, while sales were 15 per cent ahead at Pounds 10.9m, compared with Pounds 9.47m last time. The group, which sells roughly one CD or tape for every Pounds 1 of turnover, ended the period with Pounds 2m net cash. An agreement with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra is helping to drive sales ahead. To date 24 titles have been released, a figure that is expected to have more than doubled by the end of the financial year. The CDs, which are sold for up to Pounds 3.99, are now available at 7,000 shops in the UK, including 300 branches of Tesco. The group will soon add WH Smith to its customers. Tring's range of recordings spans both popular and classical music. Its Hits of the Sixties compilation sold more copies last month  - after a relaunch  -than it did in June 1990, when the company was formed. However, it relies on no single recording for its sales. Mr Mark Frey, joint chief executive, said the group would soon introduce a range of budget video tapes, ranging in price from Pounds 2.99 to Pounds 4.99. The tapes will feature children's entertainment, sport, health and fitness and cookery, among other subjects. 'I see no reason why we cannot repeat our success with videos,' said Mr Frey. We can use the same distribution, the same sales team and in many cases we will have the same buyers.' The possible costs of legal action by other music companies against the company for alleged copyright violations were dismissed as insignificant. 'Litigation is an industry hobby,' said Mr Frey, adding that any damages against the company would be covered by warranties and indemnities. The prospectus said that the interim distribution would be roughly one third of the full dividend. Earnings per share were 3.98p, against a pro forma 3.57p. The shares, placed at 118p, were unchanged yesterday at 119p.</p>

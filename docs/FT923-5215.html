			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: ING and Skandia to retrench TWO LEADING European insurance companies are to scale down parts of their international insurance and reinsurance business. Internationale Nederlanden, the Netherlands' biggest insurer, is to stop writing new business at its Folkestone, UK-based Orion subsidiary, which specialised in aviation and marine insurance in the London market. Skandia, Sweden's largest insurer, announced it is seeking to sell its US and European reinsurance businesses. ING and Skandia are concentrating on the development of less volatile personal lines (home and motor) and life insurance. The ING subsidiary, Orion, has been badly hit by intense rate competition and heavy losses in the London marine and aviation market. Orion, acquired by its Dutch parent in 1976, had been a market leader in aviation business. London market operations are being closed although some of the group's 70 staff will be retained to handle claims on business already written. ING said it is negotiating with a potential buyer the sale of Orion's personal lines and health insurance business. After investment income losses amounted to Pounds 48.8m (Dollars 97m) in 1990 (against a premium income of Pounds 97m) and to Pounds 26.3m in 1991 (against a premium income of Pounds 108m). In 1990 claims on marine business exceeded premiums by over 100 per cent. ING said the company was too small in relation to the size of the UK market. Skandia, which has been hard hit by losses in its investments in real estate, said it is 'exploring possibilities to sell its New York-based reinsurance operation through an initial public offering'.</p>

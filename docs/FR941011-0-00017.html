This action requires repetitive tightening of the screws and quick-release fasteners on the wing/body fairing panels. This amendment is prompted by reports of loosened wing/body fairing panels. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent structural damage to the horizontal or vertical stabilizer and potential injury to persons on the ground due to loosened wing/body fairing panels that may separate from the airplane. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective October 26, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of October 26, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before December 12, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;171&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH, P.O.

The LBA advises that during flight testing, prior to certification of Model 328&hyph;100 airplanes, the quick-release (camlock) fasteners on the wing/body fairing panels were found to be loose on several airplanes. In another instance, an operator of Model 328&hyph;100 airplanes reported that a loosened fairing panel separated from an in-service airplane and struck an antenna on the empennage while the airplane was in flight. Investigation into the cause of these loosened panels revealed that the flex of the wing, coupled with the relative motion between the fairing panel and its supporting structure, may have caused the fasteners to back out. Such loosened fasteners may have allowed air loads to pull the panel loose from its supports, which resulted in the panel separating from the airplane. In addition, the tightness of the fasteners may have compressed the relatively soft material of the fairing panel, which may have contributed to the loosening of the fasteners. This condition, if not corrected, could result in structural damage to the horizontal or vertical stabilizer and potential injury to persons on the ground due to loosened wing/body fairing panels that may separate from the airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Dornier has issued Alert Service Bulletin ASB&hyph;328&hyph;53&hyph;004, dated August 2, 1994, which describes procedures for repetitive tightening of the screws and quick-release fasteners on the wing/body fairing panels. The LBA classified this alert service bulletin as highly recommended and issued LBA Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;009/3, dated September 8, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the Federal Republic of Germany. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in the Federal Republic of Germany and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the LBA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the LBA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent structural damage to the horizontal or vertical stabilizer and potential injury to persons on the ground due to loosened wing/body fairing panels that may separate from the airplane. This AD requires repetitive tightening of the screws and quick-release fasteners on the wing/body fairing panels. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is considered to be interim action. The manufacturer has advised that it currently is developing a modification that will positively address the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. Once this modification is developed, approved, and available, the FAA may consider additional rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

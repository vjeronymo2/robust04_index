			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HOT SUMMER DAYS BLOW LIFE INTO THE MAGIC OF BUBBLES  </P> <P> The 2-year-old's eyes grew practically as big as the shimmering bubble being  blown inches from his nose.  </P> <P> As the bubble floated free, the toddler, unable to contain his excitement  another second, reached out and shattered the gossamer sphere, then danced with  glee.  </P> <P> "Bubbles are sort of magic," said Mark Dorfman, the bubble blower, who runs  structured play sessions in Orange County for babies and preschoolers. "It's  all based on science, but the kids just know they have a good time."  </P> <P> People are forever blowing bubbles, but toy manufacturers say there is a bubble  season: the long, hot days of summer.  </P> <P> "Out West, your season is longer. In Minnesota, it's a short season," said  Myron B. Shure, chairman of the board of Strombecker Corp. of Chicago, which  makes Tootsie toys, Wonder Bubbles and Mr. Bubble, the biggest line of bubble  soap and toys in the nation.  </P> <P> Bubble wands, bubble hoops, bubble trumpets, a "Swiss army bubble knife" ("for  emergencies," according to Dorfman), bubble snakes, bubble pipes, bubble bears  (with a wand that pops up when the bear's belly is squeezed, cutting down on  bubble soap drips), toy lawn mowers that blow bubbles -- all line toy-store  shelves for the summer.  </P> <P> "It's the best time of year," said artist Michael Marks, who uses bubbles as an  art form. He exhibits bubbles and giant balloons for children at museums and  libraries. The La Habra Children's Museum hopes to host a Marks bubble exhibit,  a museum official said.  </P> <P> Other bubble exhibits featuring respected scientists and bubble enthusiasts  have been held at San Francisco's Exploratorium and at the Franklin Institute  in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Shure said bubble soap -- sometimes as cheap at 30 cents a bottle -- is the  biggest-selling toy, if you count bottles instead of dollars. He said his firm  sells 50 million bottles a year, "and if you figure how many bubbles you get to  a bottle, we're talking about billions and billions of bubbles."  </P> <P> Why such enduring popularity for an object made of soap and air and so  transitory that it seldom lasts a minute?  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Brief Love Affair'  </P> <P> "Bubbles are one of the few things in life that we are allowed to break," said  Tom Noddy, known as The Bubble Guy and author of the book "Tom Noddy's Bubble  Magic."  </P> <P> "They don't have a long life. So it's a brief love affair," conceded Luke  Knowles, sales manager of Small World Toys of Beverly Hills, an importer of  European toys. "A bubble is born and you enjoy it. It's the anticipation: How  big will it get, how high will it go? It allows adults to be kids, and it  allows kids to enjoy being kids."  </P> <P> Marks encourages children to forgo the commercial toys and to invent their own  bubble wands. A bent coat hanger, the pull tabs from beverage cans or a  six-pack holder can be "better than anything you can buy in the store."  </P> <P> A simple straw is a great bubble blower, Dorfman said. Or a coat hanger wrapped  with yarn. Or a string passed through two straws, then tied to form a rectangle  when the straws are held apart. You can even blow a bubble just using your  fingers formed into a circle, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scientists Fascinated  </P> <P> But bubbles are not just child's play. Scientists have been fascinated by them  for years, and bubbles pose mathematical questions that still go unanswered,  Noddy said.  </P> <P> A bubble is born, he explained, because mixing soap and water molecules  increases the distance between the water molecules, reducing the surface  tension and allowing the solution to stretch into a film. When air is steadily  blown into the film, it stretches until the film closes itself off into a  bubble.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Evaporation Enemy  </P> <P> The biggest enemy of soap bubbles is evaporation, which can make the bubble  wall even thinner, causing it to burst. Consequently, bubbles work best in  humid weather. "Bubbles are not so great in the desert," Shure said.  </P> <P> Touching anything dry -- a finger, a piece of dust -- means the end of a  bubble. To handle bubbles requires hands and equipment thoroughly doused with  soap solution.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reflected Light  </P> <P> A bubble's iridescent hues come from two sets of reflected light waves -- one  bouncing off the outside of the bubble, another off the inside, said Gary  Chanan, a UC Irvine physics professor. The colors result when the two sets of  light waves collide or "interfere," he said. Different thicknesses of the soap  bubble causes different light-wave interference and therefore different colors,  he said.  </P> <P> Recipes for soap solution vary. Commercial solution is quite light, making thin  walls so bubbles will float. Bigger bubbles require thicker, sturdier walls.  Enthusiasts often add glycerin as a thickening agent, and some claim that aging  the solution overnight improves it.  </P> <P> Dorfman, who often mixes his own solution, recommends a simple recipe: one  large bottle of baby shampoo (the tearless kind), one tablespoon of glycerin  and 2 tablespoons of water.  </P> <P> Marks mixes his own solution because he needs 40 gallons per exhibit, enough to  pour into the inflatable wading pools he uses in his shows. "You should see the  looks I get when I go into the store and spend $100 on soap solution."  </P> <P> Dorfman said he has learned to respect the power of the simple bubble. Toward  the end of each play session, tots flock to him, drawn by the pied-piper allure  of bubbles filling the air.  </P> <P> "Bubbles," he said, "are serious things."  </P></p>

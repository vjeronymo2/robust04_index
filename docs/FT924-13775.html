			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Japanese industrial investment depressed JAPANESE industrial investment, which has been falling for almost two years, is still depressed, according to official figures for new machinery orders published yesterday. The Economic Planning Agency said private sector machinery orders in August, excluding shipbuilding and electricity suppliers, rose by 3.9 per cent from the month before. However the increase was largely due to an extraordinary 204 per cent rise in orders from oil and coal producers. Excluding this surge which is likely to be temporary, overall private sector orders for new machinery fell by 2.4 per cent in August from the month before to a level 20 per cent below August 1991. The level of new machinery orders from the private sector is a closley watched indicator of investment trends. Private sector investment in plant and equipment, which accounts for about a fifth of Japanese gross national product, has been cut back severely as manufacturers cut costs in the face of a steep fall in domestic demand. In the late 1980s investment, which grew at a rate of about 15 per cent a year, was one of the main engines of economic growth. Car industry orders rose by 32 per cent to Y46bn (Pounds 223m) from July, but the level of orders is still about 15 per cent below the Y54bn of August 1991. Orders from the electronics industry, which rose by 6.7 per cent on July, were a third below their Y92bn level of August 1991. The paper, chemicals, rubber, ceramics and food industries saw falls in August ranging between 16 per cent and 45 per cent. Non-manufacturing machinery orders fell 12 per cent in August from the month before with information services orders down 63 per cent. Construction orders fell 15 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kwangju, South Korea, May 18 (YONHAP) -- Some 20,000  citizens and students marked the 14th anniversary of the civil  uprising for democracy here in 1980 in a ceremony held in the  provincial government plaza on Wednesday afternoon.    Kang Shin-sok, chairman of the 14th anniversary organizing  committee, called for investigation into the truth of a bloody  clash between pro-democracy demonstrators and Army martial law  troops that killed and injured hundreds of citizens and  students, saying the Kwangju problem would not be settled  without shedding light on the truth and punishing those  responsible for the killing.    The participants resolved to oppose the United States  pressing for market opening and arms import and have all  democratic forces united for national reunification.    Earlier in the day, over 5,000 people paid tribute to the  victims of the uprising in a memorial service held in the  Mangwol-tong Cemetery, while demanding punishiment of those  responsible for the killing and investigating into the truth of  the killing.    The late Park Kwan-hyon, who was killed while leading a  student demonstration as president of the Chonnam National  University student government 14 years ago, and Yun Chom-sun  were given the Kwangju Citizens' Prize. Yun has been active in  democratization movements over the past 14 years, while  supporting her mother who suffered an eye wound and lost her  sight during the uprising.    Memorial services were also held in Catholic and Protestant  churches.    The police deployed some 8,000 riot policemen at major  points  of the city to prepare for an emergency.</p>

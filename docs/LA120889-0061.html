			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PICUS WANTS HOUSES, NOT HIGH-RISES, IN WARNER RIDGE PROJECT  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus said Thursday she will seek to stop a  controversial office project in Warner Ridge by recommending that the city  change the zoning of the property from commercial to residential.  </P> <P> Picus said she will make the recommendation Tuesday to the council's Planning  and Land Use Management Committee, arguing that single-family houses are more  compatible with the surrounding Warner Ridge community than the planned  $150-million high-rise office project.  </P> <P> "It's the absolute right thing to do, and I'm going to push it very hard,"  Picus told a luncheon group of Times editors and reporters. "This project has  never been right for the area, and I'm going to fight it."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Planning Commission in May approved development of the  nine-building office complex at the northeast corner of De Soto Avenue and  Oxnard Street despite pleas by Picus and homeowner groups that single-family  houses be built on the ridge instead.  </P> <P> Picus said she had already had discussions about the project with Councilman  Hal Bernson, chairman of the Planning and Land Use Management Committee, but  said she did not know how the committee will vote. She added that she did not  know if the City Council, which has the final say, would vote against the  project.  </P> <P> Jack Spound, developer of the project, said he was not surprised by Picus'  announcement. "It's what I expected," he said. He said he had the support of  the surrounding community.  </P> <P> However, Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization Vice President Bob Gross said  residents wanted the property rezoned residential. "There's no way we want the  office project, and Joy Picus is doing the right thing," he said.  </P> <P> Planners had previously praised the 22 1/2-acre proposal as a "quality  development" with built-in safeguards to keep it from causing traffic jams in  the adjoining Warner Center area of the west San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> But opponents who have spent almost three years fighting the development said  the project would bring gridlock to nearby streets and the neighboring  residential community. They complained that high-rises would turn Warner Ridge  into a crowded urban area that would disrupt the residential atmosphere.  </P></p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 2.9% to its lowest level since March 1986 LIQUIDATION of holdings in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and other public utilities depressed share prices, and the Nikkei average fell 2.9 per cent to its lowest level since March 1986, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei fell 451.93 to 15,066.34, having opened at the day's high of 15,470.79 and fallen to its low of 14,929.55 by mid-morning. Investors facing additional margin calls on collateral due to the steep fall in prices liquidated share holdings, traders said. Short selling and futures-linked arbitrage unwinding also depressed sentiment. Volume rose slightly to 200m shares from 183m. Declines led advances by 887 to 53 with 61 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 32.67 to 1,148.56, the lowest level for the year and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed up 0.52 at 942.10. NTT's decline continued to weigh on the market, its shares losing another Y42,000 to a new all-time low of Y467,000. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, said that the ministry, which still owns two-thirds of NTT's outstanding shares, was considering postponing the public stock offering scheduled for this fiscal year. He added that he had ordered officials to review possible support measures for the market. 'The fall in NTT is prompting investors to re-evaluate other public utilities, such as electric power companies,' said Mr Yuichi Kohashi, strategist at Daiwa Securities. Traders noted an increase in short selling by individuals. 'Investors see that profits are easily generated by selling short and buying back shares,' said Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. He added that investors were searching for issues with negative news in order to create short positions. Institutional investors remained inactive. Most leading companies today enter the summer holiday week.

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: New Rothmans and Vendome lose appeal An appeal by New Rothmans and Vendome Luxury Group to have their shares included in FT-SE Actuaries share indices has been turned down by the appeal committee. However, the committee said it 'would strongly hope that a means may be speedily found whereby New Rothmans and Vendome Luxury Group may be included in the UK indices.' The shares were excluded by the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices Steering Committee because the companies do not conform to the definition of UK companies. A working party will now start to review the share indices ground rules on the inclusion of shares in companies with cross border capital structures.

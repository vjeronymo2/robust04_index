			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: The cost of Unesco Sir, It is gratifying to learn from the report of the foreign affairs select committee ('MPs in call to rejoin Unesco', August 4) that nothing stands in the way of Britain rejoining the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation but 'spending pressures'. The current assessment for UK membership is Pounds 10.6m a year, which will be reduced to Pounds 8m when the US rejoins. Modest as this is for what we get back (employment, sales of equipment, benefits of scientific research, etc), it has, since 1964, come out of our overseas aid budget, which Baroness Chalker is naturally reluctant to cut. But Unesco is not primarily an aid agency; its field of activity encompasses science, education, environment, culture and communications. If the office of public service and science and the education, environment and national heritage departments were to share the load with the Overseas Development Administration, each would be required to pay only Pounds 2.13m a year and would be getting an excellent bargain. And Britain would once again be in a position to influence international policy on matters of great concern. Margaret Quass, Friends of Unesco, 3 Whitehall Court, London SW1A 2EL</p>

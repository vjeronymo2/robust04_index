			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Arts: The Kirov's 'Kitezh' - Opera in Paris Since the end of the cold war other opera companies from the east have set about marketing themselves in the west, but none has done so with the determination of Gergiev and the Kirov Opera. True to form, Gergiev set out to trump every previous success for the company's Paris visit to the Theatre des Champs-Elysees, which lasts no less than two months and brings together the Kirov Opera and Ballet for the first time ever outside Russia. The programme includes four fully-staged operas, three full-length ballets and sundry concerts - an awesome exercise. Unfortunately, the Kirov Opera's opening night proved less than electric. To mark the occasion, the company had commissioned a new production of Rimsky-Korsakov's The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh, a four-hour grand opera blending mystic pantheism and romantic fairy-tale. It might be asking too much of the piece to suggest that the production should reveal any deeply serious dramatic themes, but all Andris Liepa made of it was a static evening of stand-and-sing in the dustiest Russian tradition. Ironically, a production like this would have been easier to accept if it had been old (and thus traditional) than, as it was, being advertised as brand new. The sets were a confectioner's delight, every one sickly sweet in a style that looked to western eyes like 1950s kitsch. It did not help that the Kirov's star of the moment, Galina Gorchakova, had pulled out through illness. The role of Fevroniya, a virgin who wanders through forests communing with nature, embodies all that the opera is about. The Kirov was lucky to have a singer of the stature of Lyubov Kazarnovskaya on hand, but she sounded unsure of herself and her constant ear-to-ear smile, as she frolicked up and down, tried one's patience. One more swish of her skirt and she looked likely to break into a chorus of 'The hills are alive'. Even that, though, would have been well sung. Kazarnovskaya has a warm, lyric soprano, probably closer to what Rimsky-Korsakov had in mind for the role than the dramatic Gorchakova. The Prince whom she marries after his death in a kind of mystic Never-Never-Land (cue chorus dressed like wedding decorations) Yury Marusin, white-toned but effective. Gennady Bezzubenkov, as Prince Yury, led his people in prayer with a fine, authoritative Russian bass. Nikolay Putilin brought intensity to his role as Poyarok, who is blinded by the invading Tartars. The smaller roles were strongly cast. The music of Kitezh is generally described as being influenced by Wagner, from whom Rimsky-Korsakov learned much about quiet religious ecstasy, rather less about how to sustain long paragraphs of musical thought. Gergiev could not help the tension slackening, but he did get fine playing from the Kirov orchestra. There was no faltering of tone quality or intonation in the most exposed passages, even at the end of a long evening, as midnight approached. The company's reputation for the finest musical standards remains unblemished. In Paris, however, the other three operas - Rimsky-Korsakov's Sadko, Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades and Musorgsky's Khovanshchina - promise to rouse more enthusiasm. Kirov Opera at the Theatre des Champs-Elysees until December 10; Kirov Ballet December 20-31.</p>

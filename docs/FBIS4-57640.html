			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Responses to an EL TIEMPO questionnaire on economic-related </F> campaign issues by Colombian presidential candidates Ernesto  Samper Pizano of the Liberal Party and Andres Pastrana of the  Conservative Party]    [Excerpts] [EL TIEMPO] What will be your economic policies?  What dangers and opportunities is Colombia currently facing, and  how will you handle these issues?    [Samper] My government's economic policies will attempt to  consolidate economic opening and to channel benefits from  economic development to all of Colombia and its people through a  program designed to step up economic growth, create 1.5 million  new useful jobs, and implement ambitious and modern social  policies.    Colombia's greatest opportunity is to invest intelligently  and carefully in tapping new oil fields, such as Cusiana, to  vigorously promote the socio-economic development of the country  and all of its regions. As for the greatest danger facing  Colombia, it is undoubtedly the revaluation of the peso, which  could harm exports, agriculture, the industrial sector, and  other production activities.    We need to implement the following plans: a macroeconomic  policy geared toward preventing peso revaluations and keeping  low interest rates to reduce inflation; a Strategic Exporting  Plan to double secondary exports within four years; a  Countryside Recovery Plan to enable peasants to regain their  jobs and income; an Industrial Modernization Plan to spark  growth of more than 7.5 percent annually and to make industries  more competitive; an ambitious program to support mini- and  mid-sized enterprises to take advantage of their job-creating  potential; priority programs to invest in people, education,  health, housing, infrastructure, and technological development;  and a special training and job-placement program for those  groups that encounter more difficulties when hunting for jobs  (youths, female heads of household, unemployed elderly people,  and handicapped people).    [Pastrana] The economic policies I will implement during my  administration will focus on broadening, improving, and  streamlining the structural reforms that make the economy more  efficient and more competitive internationally. They also will  set standards for the economy to grow at a sustainable 8-percent  annual rate, will create well-paying jobs for a highly skilled  labor, will promote adequate protection of the environment, and  will advocate an increased standard of living for the poorest  people.    The nation's best opportunity stems from the exchange of  products, services, and ideas that the world community has to  offer and that will allow Colombia to make a great leap forward  in its socioeconomic development process. Moreover, oil  resources must let us reinforce this process by implementing an  investment program in the areas of infrastructure, education,  health, science, and technology.    The greatest danger facing the nation revolves around  yielding to the temptation of closing the economy by  establishing barriers that will encourage inefficiency and hold  the country back.    The best way to take advantage of these opportunities and to  avoid these dangers is to reward the efforts of companies and  workers in order to improve their production by aligning their  efforts by way of educational programs, which are the only  mechanisms that will make these efforts viable, and to offer  assistance to those who cannot take full advantage of the  nation's new opportunities because of structural or  institutional hurdles. [passage omitted]    The tools I will use are:    A. A strategic commercial policy that will combine economic  opening with an export policy that supports technology,  marketing, the financing of successful projects, and  negotiations with foreign governments; legal and economic  support in international conflicts; and finally, strict and firm  action in matters such as unfair competition and barriers to  competition.    B. A reform of the educational system and science and  technology to convert education and knowledge into a factor of  production.    C. A public investment program with fiscal discipline and  the  modernization of the public sector.    D. The promotion of private savings and investment through  reforms to the financial system and the stock market, as well as  support for new forms of institutional savings.    E. Legal reforms to eliminate obstacles for the  participation  of the private sector in the financing, implementation, and  administration of public works and services.    F. The presentation of bills that will prevent and correct  the already mentioned barriers to competition.    G. The reorganization of the regional decentralization  process to guarantee autonomy accompanied by responsibility.    [EL TIEMPO] What can Colombians expect in terms of those  areas the next government will highlight in its budget?    [Samper] In my government, public investment will be devoted  to human capital (in areas such as health, education, and  low-income housing), infrastructure (roads, energy supply,  telecommunications, and land improvement), and technological  development.    [Pastrana] Education, potable water, infrastructure (roads,  energy, communications, irrigation districts), health, research,  and training and technical assistance in rural areas will be my  priorities in terms of public investment. [passage omitted]    [EL TIEMPO] What will happen to economic opening? Will you  modify it? How will you handle the concentration of wealth  caused by it?    [Samper] 1. Our intention is to consolidate opening with the  aim to increase exports and to create jobs so that the people  will benefit from it. We will implement the second phase of the  opening--the social phase. I will establish the principle of  "reciprocity" in international trade negotiations.    2. We must confuse "integration" with "concentration." The  country is interested in having strong, integrated enterprises,  but only as long as they do not use their strength to form  monopolies. To fight such practices, I will first use  international competition that results from the opening. Second,  I will resort to legal and administrative measures, such as the  ones I created when I was in the Development Ministry. When  public assets are privatized, the proceeds must go to the  general public in order not to concentrate them in a few hands.    [Pastrana] 1. I will maintain economic opening by placing  more emphasis on the microeconomic aspects of the reforms,  strengthening mechanisms against unfair competition, improving  customs, helping enterprises to run smoothly, and helping  producers who are facing structural impediments to enable them  to respond to increased competition.    2. The opening only leads to the concentration of wealth  when  it is not accompanied by measures that will engender real  opportunities in all regions, enterprises, and workers. For this  reason, we must immediately strengthen economic opening with  investments in infrastructure, education, technical assistance  for producers, adequate information systems, and stabilization  funds for the rural sector. In addition, all of this must be  done within the law, under a true regional decentralization, and  in a responsible way in an effort to discourage any  anticompetitive behavior. [passage omitted]    [EL TIEMPO] Will the minimum wage prove to be adequate? Your  decision will affect the lives of the Colombian people; how will  the wage increase be calculated?    [Samper] I will urge businessmen and workers to sign a  Social  Pact that will allow us to generate more and better jobs,  increase productivity, and heighten purchasing power. The pact  will seek to make all salaries rise in real terms in proportion  with the increases in productivity while keeping inflationary  pressures and the peso revaluation under control.    [Pastrana] A decision on a minimum wage will have to take  the  following into consideration:    A. The independence of all other price structures in the  economy.    B. Labor market conditions.    C. Better measures to constantly improve the income of less  qualified workers.    D. On-the-job productivity.    E. An agreement among workers, employers, and the  government.  In this agreement, each party will assume its share of  responsibility to reduce inflation, maintain macroeconomic  stability, and promote greater competition of national products.  [passage omitted]    [EL TIEMPO] Services, gasoline, and transportation. The  state  is in charge of setting price and fare adjustments. How will you  do this in the next administration?    [Samper] The prices and fares controlled by the state permit  the expansion and improvement of the financial underpinnings of  public service enterprises, but only as long as these  enterprises are run efficiently.    If they are run efficiently, then the government can adjust  fares in accordance with price and salary adjustments, thereby  allowing the state to stop giving a "bad example" in the social  adjustment of the economy. [passage omitted]    [Pastrana] The country is increasingly closer to giving up  its control over charges for public services and markedly  reducing the gasoline subsidy. This does not necessarily mean  that there will be a sustained increase in the prices of either.  I intend to move quickly in this direction. In terms of public  services, a strict state regulation of enterprises, when  combined as much possible with greater competition, will  guarantee that these enterprises will not transfer the cost of  their inefficiency or their financial mismanagement to the  public. In the case of gasoline, the outlook for national and  international petroleum allows us to think of the feasibility of  a four-year plan to free the oil market. ECOPETROL [Colombian  Petroleum Enterprises] can use its refining capacity to  stabilize internal oil prices. This process will be accompanied  by the liberation of transportation fares within a strict  framework of state regulation to guarantee quality, coverage,  and safety to passengers.    [EL TIEMPO] How will the Cusiana oil fields affect us? We  are  at the beginning of an oil bonanza. How will we manage these  resources and distribute the benefits?    [Samper] We will create a Fund for Oil Stabilization that  will keep part of these resources overseas during the years of  maximum production to allow us to maintain high investment  levels a few years later when production in these oil fields has  begun to decline.    We will draft mid-term investment plans that include both  the  national government and the regions to ensure that the resources  are invested in the country's top priorities: education, health,  low-income housing, improvement of infrastructure, and  technological development.    We will back institutional and technical development in  departments and municipalities to efficiently invest the large  revenues they are entitled to--revenues that will come from  royalties, allocations from the National Royalty Fund, and their  share of the nation's current earnings. [passage omitted]    [Pastrana] The Cusiana oil fields provide a great  opportunity  for the country and its regions to consolidate a process of  high, sustainable, and equitable growth in favor of the poorest  sectors of the population. For this purpose, I agree with the  experts who have proposed the creation of an overseas savings  fund. I will channel the country's revenues to improving the  quality and coverage of education, bringing potable water to all  Colombians, and overcoming the existing inefficiencies in the  infrastructure and technological development. I will reorganize  decentralization to guarantee that the regions will have fiscal  autonomy with political responsibility and economic efficiency.  I will guarantee that the government will contribute to  macroeconomic stability with greater efficiency in spending and  in tax collection. I will create conditions that enable the  private sector to contribute to stable growth by increasing its  rate of savings.    [EL TIEMPO] The agricultural crisis in Colombia. This has  been the most overlooked sector in the current administration;  how will it be treated by your administration?    [Samper] My administration will work to implement increased  land improvement; the creation and strengthening of  Stabilization Funds; insurance for crops to decrease price  fluctuations and other risks; technology; subsidies for  capitalization; support for those affected by unfair  competition; the strengthening of the Agrarian Fund, the DRI  [Integrated Rural Development Program], and the PNR [National  Rehabilitation Plan]; and a policy to recover tranquility in the  rural areas. This policy will include the modernization of the  Armed Forces, social investment, and the creation of jobs.  [passage omitted]    [Pastrana] I will reinforce measures to reactivate the  sector. I will guarantee a sustainable and efficient  agricultural system that will be integrated with industrial  processes that will offer stable and well-paying jobs. It will  be an agricultural system supported by modern services from a  business standpoint. It will be a system with investment in  infrastructure, development, transfer of technology,  capitalization, price and market information, marketing,  institutional strength, and a strong rural economy. It will  overcome the negative effects of problems such as drug  trafficking, illegal crops, and violence. [passage omitted]    [EL TIEMPO] The future of coffee growers. Will you subsidize  domestic coffee prices or will you go with international prices?    [Pastrana] As a matter of fact, the international price must  be the primary long-term reference point for the domestic coffee  price. In unfavorable conditions and for short periods, the  National Coffee Fund could receive government support in the  form of credits to prevent fluctuations or abrupt drops in the  income of coffee producers. As a general rule, any subsidy must  be studied in terms of its social cost and the most effective  and honest way to manage the subsidy. However, I believe better  results are obtained if producers are directly supported with  technology, marketing, access to credit, and so on, instead of  with subsidies.    [Samper] I have vowed to free coffee production from  macroeconomic control. I will channel budgetary resources to  finance infrastructure and social investment projects. These  were projects that used to be financed with resources from  coffee growers. I will support the efforts that the Coffee  Federation is making. I will promote a more aggressive and  deregulated marketing policy. The National Coffee Fund will be  used only to stabilize prices and coffee growers' income.  [passage omitted]    [EL TIEMPO] Low-income housing. How will your administration  treat purchasing power? What will be the role of the Savings and  Mortgage Associations?    [Samper] The Savings and Mortgage Associations  [Corporaciones  de Ahorro y Vivienda, CAV's] will play a key role in financing  the construction sector. We will implement an aggressive housing  policy with an investment of $1 billion over four years to  deliver 500,000 low-income houses to resolve this grave problem  for 500,000 Colombian families. This policy will support the  organizations that work in the area of low-income housing. The  CAV's will have the same rights and obligations that other  financial intermediaries have. [passage omitted]    [Pastrana] The UPAC [Constant Value Savings Certificate]  system has proven to be the best mechanism to convert cash  savings into long-term loans for construction, and its  importance to the country's development has been truly  invaluable. The consolidation of the system, the changes in the  construction sector, and most of all, the new framework for the  financial system in Colombia have resulted, on the one hand, in  a diversification in employing CAV resources and, on the other  hand, in new savings alternatives for investors. Therefore, they  offer possibilities that are different from those offered by  savings accounts in other institutions.    To handle this situation, changes become necessary within  the  following parameters:    1. They must respond to permanent, not circumstantial,  transformations in the economy.    2. They must be made to preserve the strength of the  system--a system based on stability, on the recovery of its  portfolio, and on its profitability.    3. They must maintain the basic identity of the system as a  source of long-term resources to finance housing for medium- and  low-income sectors of the population. [passage omitted]</p>

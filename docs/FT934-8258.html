			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (6): Games bid restores the balance  -Accommodation / A change in the law allowing developers to buy land has made way for the construction of badly needed hotels THE NUMBER and quality of Barcelona hotels was not one of the city's strong points when it was bidding for the Olympic Games. The city is a site of Spain's biggest trade fairs, but it was not unusual for visiting businessmen to commute via the shuttle from Madrid when one of the fairs was on, to avoid the difficulty and expense of finding a hotel room in Barcelona. Others would stay in hotels in coastal resorts as far away as Lloret de Mar. However, as with offices, the Olympic building programme has tilted the balance back in favour of the consumer, to the satisfaction of the city council. According to Manuel Ludevid, the city council's director of economic promotion, the city broke hold that hoteliers had on the market. This was a position that they had abused in the past, he said. In order to achieve this, the council had to change the law to allow land to be sold to developers, under a 50-year lease, as part of a general hotel plan. Eight projects were successfully auctioned, and the number of hotel rooms, which had been particularly scarce in the four and five-star brackets, has now increased by 60 per cent to 30,000. The most notable additions are the Hotel Juan Carlos I, which overlooks the city from the inland end of Diagonal; and the Hotel Arts, one of the two Olympic skyscrapers, which is about to open under Ritz-Carlton management. According to Enric Truno the councillor for hotels and tourism, 55 per cent of visitors to Barcelona are businessmen; and this has meant that its hotel trade has been vulnerable to the downturn in the economy which has led companies to cut back on expenses. Nevertheless, the number of visitors staying in hotels has risen to 1.25m a year from 850,000 since 1991, and occupancy rates of 52 per cent mean that the sector is withstanding the crisis, even if it is having to find new ways of promoting itself.</p>

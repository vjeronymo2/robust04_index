			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / The City Bombing: Insurers braced for large claims - Insurers face claims of Pounds 1bn LONDON insurers could face claims of up to Pounds 1bn as a result of the weekend's bomb blasts, according to industry analysts last night. Damage to property in the City has been estimated at about Pounds 300m, but claims from business interruption and loss of profits could more than double the total loss to insurers. Analysts stress that 'BI' claims were an important element of the Pounds 120m claim from the fire at the London Underwriting Centre in August last year - the UK's biggest property loss hitherto. In addition to a number of very large claims from the owners of the Commercial Union tower and the Baltic Exchange, there is likely to be a plethora of smaller claims to pay for damage resulting from shock waves caused by the explosion in the City and the subsequent one at Staples Corner in north London. Mr Nicholas Balcombe, managing director of Balcombe Group, a loss assessor acting on behalf of some of the companies affected by the Staples Corner blast, said: 'We haven't seen this sort of damage before in England.' A number of factories up to a quarter of a mile away from Staples Corner have sustained heavy damage. Mr Balcombe said: 'On the outside it looks as if there is no damage but you walk in and the place is crumbling about you. Inside the roof lights are broken and the suspended ceilings and partition walls have collapsed.' Overall losses are likely to be widely spread across the London market, but the UK composite (general and life) companies could be badly hit. Claims will aggravate the difficulties of insurers who have recently completed reporting pre-tax losses in excess of Pounds 1bn for last year. Loss adjusters Robins, Davies &amp; Little are still examining the extent of damage to the CU tower, but brokers estimated yesterday that the cost of physical damage alone could amount to more than Pounds 200m. In the City the firmest indications of losses have come from the Baltic Exchange, the ship freight market badly damaged by the first blast on Friday night. Rebuilding costs will amount to Pounds 150m, according to Mr Peter Tudball, its chairman. Royal Insurance confirmed that it led the exchange's insurance placement. Its exposure though is unlikely to amount to more than 10 per cent of the total. Insurers are also likely to face dozens of more modest claims from tenants of scores of buildings in the vicinity. Damage to windows and to the interiors of a number of offices has been surprisingly severe. Mr Michael Wade, chairman of brokers Holman Wade which occupies a building on Camomile Street overlooking the Baltic Exchange, said that his company's claims for replaced windows alone will amount to more than Pounds 100,000. At Staples Corner, the site of the second blast, claims amounting to more than Pounds 50m are expected from the owners of as many as 15 factories and warehouses. A superstore owned by B&amp;Q, the do-it-yourself supplier, was destroyed by the blast. It was adjacent to the the explosion, but most other properties are over a quarter of a mile away on an industrial estate.</p>

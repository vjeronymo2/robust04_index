			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> An article Friday on a bill to outlaw the possession of child pornography  incorrectly stated that Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) was one  of two Assembly members to vote against the bill. Friedman did not vote on that  measure. Assemblymen John Burton (D-San Francisco) and Robert J. Campbell  (D-Richmond) were the two who voted against it.  </P></p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Conseco cuts value of Kemper bid to Dollars 2.4bn The fate of Kemper, the US financial services group, was thrown into doubt yesterday as Conseco, the Indiana-based insurer, reduced the value of its bid for the company. The move could open the way for a renewed takeover approach from GE Capital, the financial services arm of General Electric, or another buyer. The new, lower offer, which values Kemper at Dollars 2.4bn, has been made because the original offer probably would not win the support of Conseco's shareholders, said Mr Stephen Hilbert, Conseco's chairman and chief executive. Many shareholders are believed to be unhappy that a fall in Conseco's share price since June, when the original offer was made, would leave Kemper shareholders with a far bigger proportion of the enlarged group once the deal was completed. The revised offer valued Kemper at Dollars 60 a share, Dollars 5 a share less than the earlier bid. GE Capital's offer of Dollars 60 a share in cash for Kemper in May was rejected by Kemper's board as inadequate. The decision to spurn that bid means it will be difficult for Kemper's directors to accept Conseco's lower offer without facing lawsuits from shareholders. Conseco said it had proposed the new offer to Kemper yesterday, but that its initial offer remained in effect. The cash portion in Conseco's revised bid is unchanged, at Dollars 56 a share. But Kemper shareholders will now be offered fewer Conseco shares. Under the new bid, Kemper shareholders would receive 0.1087 of a Conseco share, in addition to the cash, leaving them with around 17 per cent of the enlarged group. The original offer would give them between 0.1982 and 0.2418 of a share, depending on the value of Conseco's shares when the bid closed. With Conseco's stock yesterday at Dollars 37 1/2 , down from more than Dollars 50 in June, Kemper shareholders would receive the maximum allocation, leaving them with around 37 per cent in the new group. The revised offer would not need Conseco shareholders' support, since it would fall below the 20 per cent level requiring a shareholder vote. Kemper said its board would review the new offer 'in due course'.</p>

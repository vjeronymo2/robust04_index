			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["M.L.L."-signed report: "SZDSZ: Balanced Foreign Policy </F> Program"]    [Text] Foreign policy is a special area where the ideas of  the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP] stand closest to each other, [SZDSZ  foreign policy expert and deputy chairman of the Parliamentary  Foreign Affairs Committee] Istvan Szent-Ivanyi admitted at a  news conference on 11 February. The MSZP's foreign policy  program is "not typical of the party" in the sense that it is  free of the ambiguities that can be seen in the economic and  domestic political ideas. Anyway, the SZDSZ that has been  balanced all the time will not change something purely because  others also think similarly, Szent-Ivanyi added when he spoke  about the party's foreign political program.    He said that the idea of European integration, security  policy, and politics relating to the neighbors that includes  national minority policy as an organic part are the three basic  pillars of the program. The SZDSZ has managed to keep the three  issues in balance all along. The government's foreign policy  can be criticized precisely because the proportions have shifted  and the situation of the Hungarians living beyond the border has  been given a primary role. It can be said that the government's  foreign policy is bad compared to what it could have achieved.  Starting from a favorable position, it realized little of the  actual possibilities.    On the issue of joining Europe, Szent-Ivanyi pointed out  that, in the views of his party, rather than setting "magic  deadlines," the goals have to be implemented as soon as the  country's and the economy's condition facilitate it; haste would  only cause harm. For this reason, in his view, the government  should not, as a campaign measure, overhastily submit its  request to the European Union.    In the area of security policy, he emphasized that, in  addition to urging foreign guarantees, we mainly have to  strengthen our domestic efforts. This proposal does not mean  increasing the military force. A balanced and internationally  respected attitude, domestic stability, the development of the  democratic institutional system, and the improvement of the  economy are more important factors.    As for the policy concerning the neighboring countries, the  SZDSZ expects a slow progress and the basic agreements would  only move the processes from their deadlock at the most. These  agreements are not products that can be sold and bought; the  party clearly states that the borders cannot be changed but this  can only be included in agreements together with other  guarantees. We must not give up the collective rights of  national minorities, but unutilized reserves also exist in the  area of individual rights. The elimination of dual taxation,  investment protection, new cultural and scientific agreements,  and the opening of new border crossing points would increase the  confidence of the neighbors.    It is generally true that the establishment of a modernized,  attractive, democratic, and stable Hungary is a precondition to  implementing the concept, Szent-Ivanyi told NEPSZABADSAG. Also  speaking to our newspaper, he said that the changes in the  foreign affairs staff (which affected about half of the  diplomatic staff) often had political motivations. If the SZDSZ  came to power, it would only initiate the change of ambassadors  in 15 to 20 cases at the most.    Talking about integrated foreign representations,  Szent-Ivanyi noted that the economic diplomacy tasks of the  Ministry for International Economic Relations [NGKM] could be  drawn under the authority of foreign affairs, the licensing  functions could be transferred to the Industry and Trade  Ministry, and the services to the chamber [not sepcified] or the  National Federation of Entrepreneurs [VOSZ]. Szent-Ivanyi noted  the deficit of the foreign affairs budget which might result in  the apparatus becoming unable to function by the end of this  year unless a supplementary budget is made.</p>

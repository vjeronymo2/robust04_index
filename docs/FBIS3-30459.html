Investigations showed that the party's aims and activities  run counter to certain constitutional provisions concerning  civic rights and freedoms, particularly the right to human  dignity, minority rights and the equal rights of citizens.  Also, legal proceedings are under way against the leader and  another member of the party, on charges of incitement against a  community.    On the basis of the findings of the Chief Public  Prosecutor's  Office, the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has filed a  petition at the Metropolitan Court to dissolve the party.    As previously reported, on January 21 the National Security  Office lodged a complaint with the National Police Headquarters  against Albert Szabo, a dual Hungarian/Australian citizen who  heads the WNPRP, and Akos B., a juvenile activist, for allegedly  having committed the crime of incitement against a community.    The party, registered in October 1993, held a meeting in  Budapest in mid-January where they denied that the Holocaust had  ever taken place and defined themselves as successors to the  Hungarian fascist arrow-cross party and its leader, Ferenc  Szalasi, who was executed in 1946 for crimes against humanity.</p>

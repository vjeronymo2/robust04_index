			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by M. Satish: "U.S. South Asia Policy: Bound To </F> Fail"]    [Text] The Clinton administration's new concept of a  multilateral arrangement on nuclear non-proliferation in South  Asia is unlikely to succeed. There are only two possibilities:  either India changes its stance or it does not. The dialogue is  obviously doomed to failure if India does not budge from its  consistent stand that it would not accept any regional  non-proliferation treaty and would only be party to a regime of  nuclear non-proliferation, which is both non-discriminatory and  universal in character. But would such an arrangement succeed  if India bowed to international pressure and accepted some form  of regional restraint?    Before considering why it would not the new US approach  mooted at the London talks recently needs to be put in  perspective. It has been evolved out of the special report on  South Asia that US President Mr Bill Clinton presented to the US  Congress on April 29 last year. The report virtually indicated  the abandoning of the earlier proposal made by former Pakistan  prime minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif, and tacitly backed by the US,  wherein India and Pakistan would have signed a regional  non-proliferation treaty, with the US, China and Russia being  guarantors. India's objection then had been that China's  presence as a guarantor was unacceptable because that country  posed a security concern to India.    The most significant aspect that stood out in the report  (and  reflected in the new proposal) was a tacit acceptance of the  Indian position that any durable solution to the nuclear  imbroglio in the subcontinent would necessarily have to  effectively address its concerns both over China's nuclear  potential and the newly-developing nuclear uncertainty in the  Central Asian Republics following the disintegration of the  Soviet Union.    The US objectives, under the new approach, on the nuclear  issue in the region are: first to cap, then over time reduce  and finally eliminate the possession of weapons of mass  destruction (WMD) and their means of delivery.    A unilateral or regional cut-off of fissile material  production.    A regional agreement not to conduct nuclear detonations and  placing safeguards on new and existing nuclear facilities.    Since President Clinton believes that the whole issue is a  regional problem, it is worthwhile to consider what factors  would influence or come in the way of a regional solution,  especially in the context of his suggestion that while "each  region is different, both countries can benefit from the ideas  and experience that we have gained over the decade in arms  control and CSBMs (confidence and security building measures) in  discussions with the Soviet Union and others."    It is clear that the dialogue that the US is proposing is  basically a replication of earlier arms control treaties that it  had negotiated with the erstwhile USSR. However, there is one  major problem in trying to apply the same to South Asia. Major  breakthroughs in arms reduction talks between the two  superpowers have always come along with significant thaws in  political relations between them.    That is not the case between India and Pakistan. The mutual  mistrust between the two since 1947 has shown no signs of  improving and, if anything, the relationship is at its lowest  ebb now. Due to the perverse logic of partition Pakistan's  raison d'etre of being an Islamic state would, by extension,  succeed only if India's secular experiment is seen to fail.  This, added to the division of Pakistan in 1971 (the creation  of Bangladesh) and the peculiar sub- continental social  realities have only added to the growth of a disease of which  Kashmir at symptom.    Therefore, a solution to the Kashmir issue would be central  to a more basic thaw in bilateral relations and to the success  of any future CSBMs on nuclear non-proliferation that may be  agreed to. The US approach appears to be that an agreement on  nuclear non-proliferation and CSBMs would reduce political  tensions and lead to a solution on Kashmir (it may be recalled  that the US is now talking of a "deep freeze" on Kashmir and  concentrating on non- proliferation). The ground reality is  precisely the opposite. A durable regional agreement on  non-proliferation is possible only when the more fundamental  issue of Kashmir is first satisfactorily resolved.    And for that to happen, the geo-strategic realities of the  sub-continent at the moment warrant that a solution would  necessarily have to take into account the strategic importance  of J&amp;K to China and other neighbouring countries.    It should be remembered that the state of Jammu and Kashmir  shares a 350 km border with China's Xinkiang province. However,  this area forms part of Pak-Occupied Kashmir (POK) and, -- 1963,  Pakistan ceded the Raskam valley and the Taghdumbash Pamirs,  north of the Karakoram mountains, to China. For China,  therefore, the Xinkiang border from Siachen glacier to the  occupied Aksai Chin area is with India, while further east it is  with Pakistan. Since the area has immense strategic value to  China, it has a vested interest in the solution (or lack of it)  of the Kashmir dispute and cannot be considered as a  disinterested party. China is very much an interested party in  the Kashmir dispute by virtue of its holding Kashmir territory.    Other factors that need to be satisfactorily addressed  before  any regional non-proliferation agreement are India's security  concerns vis-a-vis China arising out of its defeat in the 1962  war, the consequent border dispute, the China-Pakistan military  axis and China's own attempts at improving its strategic depth  in the region. China's professed commitments to  non-proliferation are taken here with a pinch of salt. A  glaring example is that despite professing adherence to the  Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in 1992, The New York  Times of May 6 last year first revealed that there was evidence  from satellite photos that China was still shipping M11 missiles  to Pakistan. If China is violating the objectives of the MTCR,  what is the guarantee that it would adhere to any commitment  that would essentially mean a break in the China-Pakistan  military axis? Despite the thaw in bilateral relations during  the last few years, there are very few in India who believe that  China is altogether trustworthy.    Many Indian military experts and politicians still believe  that with China's ambitions of becoming a superpower and  achieving a semblance of nuclear parity with both the US and  Russia, the most effective Indian response to this cannot but be  to go about setting up a nuclear deterrent force and perfecting  delivery systems to have the capability to hit back at important  political, economic and military-industrial targets in China  even after taking a first strike.    With such a volatile ground-level situation, the psyche of  the people and politicians of the sub-continent is clearly not  geared to adhering to any regional arms reduction or nuclear  non-proliferation agreement while problems like Kashmir and  terrorism continue to simmer.    In such a scenario--of passions running high over Kashmir,  worsening Indo-Pak relations and China's overwhelming nuclear  superiority vis-a-vis India--it would be unrealistic to have a  workable regional non-proliferation a agreement, until the more  fundamental issues facing the three countries are first  satisfactorily dealt with.</p>

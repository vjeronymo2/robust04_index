			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Aluminium (7): Ford breakthrough - The age of the aluminium motor car draws closer FOR ALUMINIUM producers the most exciting recent news was the revelation by Ford, the world's second-largest automotive group, that it is testing a fleet of 20 Mercury Sables, a popular mid-sized US car, made largely of aluminium, writes Kenneth Gooding. This was the first clear indication that aluminium is suitable for the production of high-volume, rather than just low-volume 'niche,' cars. Sables and the Ford-badged equivalent, the Taurus - the best-selling car in the US  -are produced at an annual rate of more than 500,000. Ford, it seems, has overcome most of the problems associated with producing aluminium cars from an an infrastructure which was set up to produce them from steel. Ford worked with Alcan of Canada on this project. The automotive group wanted to be able to build aluminium cars on its existing equipment, including big steel presses, which represented a huge investment. Mr Gian Frontini, Alcan's vice president, technology and engineering, says the project involved two particularly big challenges: how aluminium could be formed on steel presses and how to join aluminium. These have now been solved. Alcan proved it was possible for aluminium to be shaped on existing steel presses - even using the same tooling in some cases. Ford made a break-through with special light welding robots. Mr Frontini says he has not been given any inside information by Ford about its future production plans but his educated guess is that the group will gradually add more aluminium body parts to certain models and in five or six years time a car with an all-aluminium structure will be launched. Mr Kenneth Kohrs, Ford's vice president of car product development, says the aluminium Sable was part of a Dollars 25m effort to see whether it was feasible to produce a volume car from aluminium. The experimental cars weigh about 400 lbs less than identical models made of steel. Another 20 aluminium Sables are being built for company and fleet testing. Ford also plans a big expansion in its use of aluminium over the next five years to penetrate the sheet, or 'skin,' usages that have traditionally belonged to steel. This includes aluminium fenders, hoods, decklids and trim on the next generation of the Taurus car, expected to be launched in the autumn of 1995. Mr Kohrs points out his group already is the biggest user of aluminium in the US motor industry. Significantly, Ford's experimental vehicle, Synthesis 2010, which is a rolling test bed for a variety of new automotive technology  -including a three-cylinder, two-stroke engine made of aluminium - has a body made of aluminium. Synthesis achieves weight savings of about 1,000 lbs compared with the present steel Sable while having about the same interior dimensions. Weight saving is the big incentive for the US and Japanese car industries to turn to light-weight aluminium. The US government is imposing ever-tightening fuel economy standards and aluminium enables the car makers to meet those standards by reducing weight without any loss of performance. The main incentive for European car makers is a conviction that car recycling will become a big issue in future. European companies are also enthusiastic about the high-performance characteristics aluminium offers. For example, Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, chairman of Audi, the upmarket subsidiary of Volkswagen, Europe's biggest car group, says that Audi's new, top-of-the range model, soon to be launched, will offer drivers 'a new experience because of its light weight, stiffness and rigidity and safety.' Audi worked with the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) on the new car and they took a different route to Ford and Alcan. As aluminium is initially much more expensive than steel, they believed it would be too expensive simply to substitute aluminium components for those traditionally made of steel. Instead, they designed a car that has many fewer individual components and structures than are used in a steel vehicle. They developed a spaceframe, a skeleton-like body structure, composed of fewer than 100 extrusions and castings compared with as many as 300 for a stamped steel body. New manufacturing processes had to be developed to produce these spaceframes and new aluminium alloys claimed to be safer than steel. For car makers, the new technology offers several advantages: it cuts the weight of a car's body by about 35 per cent compared with traditional steel bodies without reducing the vehicle's size it reduces tooling expense by as much as 50 per cent, and cuts the number of parts to be stocked and the time taken from design to production. Audi has spent about DM1bn (Pounds 400m) to bring its new luxury car to the market. Mr Kortum says: 'We have changed the rule that says the bigger and better the car, the heavier it must be.' However, it is not yet possible to promise that all Audi's cars will one day be using this technology. At present the process is economic only for production runs of up to 100,000 cars a year but the partners are looking for ways to make longer runs viable. Meanwhile, Alcoa has spent Dollars 70m for a plant at Soest in Germany where it is producing space frame components which it aims to sell to other manufacturers. Hydro Aluminium, part of Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest industrial group and Europe's biggest producer of aluminium extrusions, has a vested interest in the success of the space frame concept, which could be a big user of extrusions in future. Hydro has also been co-operating on car space-frame concepts since the mid-1980s with various groups, including Renault in France, Porsche in Germany and Pininfarina in Italy. This year Hydro started supplying aluminium sub-frames from a Michigan factory for General Motors' new Corvette sports car. The sub-frame was previously produced from stamped aluminium sheet. Mr Ted DiGuiseppe, vice president, sales and marketing, Hydro Aluminium Automotive Structures, says his company's sub-frame weighs only 11 kgs, or 2 kgs less than the stamped aluminium equivalent and also saves 75 per cent on tooling costs - an important consideration with a low-volume model to be produced at the rate of only 20,000 to 30,000 a year. In total the extruded sub-frame costs 18 per cent less than the stamped one. Mr DiGuiseppe remains to be convinced that the Ford-Alcan concept of replacing steel car 'skins' with aluminium will not be too expensive. He admits, however, that the companies offering aluminium space frames are having the difficult task of persuading car companies not only to use a new material but also new manufacturing processes. Alcan's Mr Frontini says: 'The choice of technology is up to the auto companies. And Ford has firmly decided that the stamped unibody is the answer.' The debate will continue, but whatever the outcome, one way or another the automotive industry will use a great deal more aluminium after the year 2,000. As Mr Bill Stuef, manager of Ford's advanced vehicle systems said recently: 'In a decade, the material of choice clearly will be aluminium.'</p>

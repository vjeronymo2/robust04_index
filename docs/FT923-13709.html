			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Jailing new women THE TIME has come for my annual inspection of Cosmopolitan magazine. I do this partly from nostalgia: there was a time when, surrounded by three teenage sisters, I counted myself well abreast of the Cosmopolitan world. But now consider it a man's duty to scan the journal once a year, if he has any solicitude for the opposite sex. 'Smart women carry Cosmo' is the legend. There is no better index of what makes a smart woman tick these days. I have July's issue before me. It is chunky and colourful and undeniably good value. Before one even approaches the printed matter, goodies spill from the pages. Two sachets of moisturiser have popped out of my copy, one of them rose-tinted. For a fellow whose face has been compared to stretches of Arctic tundra, it is a boon to have some rosy tints to hand. Gladdened by the gift, I turn to the first feature, which looks promisingly incisive. Its author is a penitent copywriter, and the thrust of his article is to deplore the stereotypes of women in advertising campaigns. 'When women run ad agencies, we'll see real women doing real things in TV commercials as a matter of course.' This seems a worthy sentiment. And since Cosmopolitan is staffed mainly by women, one might look to the magazine for enlightenment in this area. The current issue, accordingly, has no truck with the diligent housewife, the capable matron, or the fastidious hostess. Cosmo women are not repressed by such expectations. Cosmo women are out pedalling their bikes, swinging their briefcases, and extending their limbs on the sand. They wear stiletto heels. They drive small and snappy cars, usually scarlet. They cradle mobile phones in wine bars. They talk about Chippendales: perhaps the antique chairs, more likely the troupe of male exhibitionists. If they ever cook a meal, it must be one of those clever little elfin banquets Marks and Spencer do so nourishingly. No one familiar with magazines for smart women will be surprised at the absence of aprons and frumpiness here. But the image is not entirely comforting to a man concerned with women's lot. What is most striking about the models used by Cosmopolitan is their homogeneity. The Cosmo species may be broadly summarised as a sort of stick insect, marinated in rich moisturisers and then barbecued on a tropical beach. One might be reminded of Proust's dictum, that pretty women are for men with no imagination. More alarmingly, one might suspect a vast conspiracy operating here. Most of the words and images in Cosmopolitan encourage women to shed their clothes, shed their surplus flesh, and sizzle in the sun. Admittedly, it is a summer number: but the myriad advertisements for skin toners, plastic surgery, surefire diets and depilation doubtless continue through the year. No wonder readers have been given a sample of moisturiser. They will need all the moisturiser they can get to replenish the sun's robbery of body fluids. Smart Cosmo-oriented women do seem to have escaped the prison of domesticity. But they have signed themselves in for a new routine of confinement. It is a prison of perpetual dieting, overseen by an army of psychiatrists and experts in the laws of subcutaneous correctness, and upheld by a host of potionmongers and sunbed suppliers. The dereliction of the kitchen sink is no path to freedom if it leads straight into the trammels of endless aerobics and carrot salads. The apparatus of images and half-baked advice in the magazine puts it in a weak position for being incisive about matters more serious than carrots. Not simply the feature about women in advertising: also the angry paragraph about the statistic that only 3 per cent of university professors are women, and the reprimand issued to the Daily Express for describing Virginia Bottomley as 'blooming.' 'What about Michael Heseltine's hair? Norman Lamont's paunch?' demands Cosmopolitan. But Cosmo women are so tied up with restructuring their hips that they cannot possibly become professors; and the Cosmo advice to Norman, implicitly, is that he get down to a health farm and join the Chippendales. I am not saying that Cosmopolitan treats its readers like pea-brained flappers. At least, while they are being barbecued, the stick insects are given plenty of reading to get on with. Among the bibliographic suggestions, ironically, is Thackeray's Vanity Fair. But the main course in the promised 'feast of summer fiction' is unacknowledged. It is, of course, the fiction of female emancipation.</p>

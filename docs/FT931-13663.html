			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: BA's turbulent flight The outcome of British Airways' board meeting yesterday raises two contentious issues of control. The first is whether the reckless elements who instigated the dirty tricks campaign against Virgin will be brought under control by the establishment of a supervisory committee and code of conduct. The second is to what extent BA can make its influence felt on USAir following its revised Dollars 300m investment in the ailing American carrier. There is scope for doubt on both fronts. Yesterday's apologetic rhetoric suggests the company is chastened by the Virgin affair, but public contrition has been unmatched by effective action to prevent a recurrence. No one within BA has yet shouldered responsibility for the campaign. No one has resigned or been replaced. The same non-executive directors who neglected BA's original sins are now to oversee the supervisory regime. The new committee is a clear admission of doubt about the judgment of the top executive managers but it is a minimal solution, and a weak alternative to the clear separation of the role of chairman and chief executive. It seems unlikely to allay public unease and re-establish the credible leadership on which BA critically depends. The USAir deal has been carefully restructured to avoid the previous regulatory objections. BA is spending less money, but will enjoy a smaller operational reward. Fuller benefits depend on liberalisation in the US. BA's hopes on this score look implausibly optimistic, especially since its ability to argue its case has been substantially weakened by the Branson affair.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A squeeze in stock index futures sent the March Footsie contract sharply forward to a strong finish, after a dull and tentative start, writes Joel Kibazo. Dealers in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 reported a shaky opening to the session as the contract traded at 3,413 characterised by sideways movements, though little selling was reported. Renewed talk of a reduction in UK base rates was heard mid-morning just as several leading institutions had decided to start picking up stock, and the combination of the two factors saw March move slowly forward. Sentiment was boosted by firm trading in the fixed interest markets. The positive sentiment gathered pace during the afternoon with the firm opening on Wall Street, but it was strong demand from both institutions and independent traders (locals) as they covered short positions that brought a squeeze in March towards the end of the session. March closed at 3,460, up 45 on the previous session and 15 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 5 points. Volume improved to 13,048 contracts. There was also a slight improvement in turnover in the traded options. The day's total volume was 45,803 contracts of which 17,299 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 5,121 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. Hanson led the league table among the stock options, finishing with a total of 2,607 lots. It was followed by Land Securities at 2,093 and Abbey National at 2,079 following a big trade by Kleinwort Benson. Other active stocks included Dixons, and Tesco.</p>

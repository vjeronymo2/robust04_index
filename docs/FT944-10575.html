			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Brazilian rivals band together Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's president-elect, yesterday became actively involved in campaigning for next week's elections for state governors. But instead of backing politicians from his own party, he was giving support to a candidate from the left-wing Workers party (PT), his main opponents in last month's presidential poll. Mr Cardoso's meeting with Mr Vitor Buaiz, the PT's candidate for governor in the southern state of Esprito Santo, was prompted by shared concern about the increasing popularity for the other candidate, Mr Dejair Camata, a far-right protest candidate who has pledged to wipe out crime. Mr Camata is a former police corporal who, has pledged to erase crime in Esprito Santo and, if elected, would give criminals 24 hours to flee the state. According to opinion polls these types of populist promises are winning over the voters.</p>

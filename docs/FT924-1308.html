			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Reebok writes off Dollars 135m for restructuring REEBOK International, the US sports shoe maker, unveiled a substantial fourth-quarter restructuring charge and said it would put its Boston Whaler and Ellesse USA subsidiaries up for sale. Reebok is also writing-off the carrying value of its Avia unit. The company said it would take after-tax charges of about Dollars 135m, or Dollars 1.45 a share, against fourth-quarter earnings. This will more than offset one-time gains of Dollars 29.6m recorded in October on the sale of Reebok's CML Group. Reebok earned Dollars 74.4m, or 80 cents, in the 1992 third quarter and Dollars 49.7m, or 53 cents, in the 1991 fourth quarter. Reebok said the restructuring charges were mainly non-cash in nature and operating income should stay on target. Mr Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive, said Reebok had also considered divesting Avia but decided that its strategic value and improving prospects were sufficiently strong to retain the business. Reebok also plans to move its international headquarters in the UK to London from Bolton.</p>

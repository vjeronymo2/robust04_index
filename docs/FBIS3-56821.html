"Everything will be clear only after the meeting of Boris  Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze", he has told SNARK today. As  it has already been reported the Russia's president visit to  Georgia is planned on the first fortnight of February.    The general also refuted the rumors that the Russian special  purpose detachments would be located in the Tbilisi suburbs to  maintain order in the cities of Georgia. Moreover, he told some  units of the Russian troops are dislocated from Tbilisi and  Kutaisi to Adjaria.</p>

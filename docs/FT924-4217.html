			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Water rises to Pounds 72m YORKSHIRE WATER yester-day announced a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 64.1m to Pounds 71.8m for the six months to September 30. Profits were boosted by Pounds 4.4m from the sale of 50 per cent of Yorkshire's engineering business to Babcock International in May. Yorkshire and Babcock now operate the division, renamed Babcock Water Engineering Limited (BWEL), as a joint venture. Turnover increased 9.1 per cent to Pounds 239.5m. In Yorkshire's regulated water and sewerage business turnover increased 7.3 per cent, mainly due to average price rises of 7.1 per cent. Yorkshire Water Enterprises, which includes the company's unregulated businesses, reported turnover of Pounds 11.2m, compared with Pounds 6.5m in the previous period. Excluding profits from the sale of BWEL, enterprise profits were close to Pounds 1m. Mr Malcolm Batty, group finance director, said 'tight control' of costs, and improved efficiency, helped restrict the increase in operating costs to Pounds 166.4m, a 6.8 per cent increase. Pay awards of 4 per cent were awarded. The operating margin improved 1.5 percentage points to 30.5 per cent. In the regulated business, capital expenditure increased 8.7 per cent to Pounds 138m and is expected to total Pounds 300m for the full year, an increase of Pounds 10m. Infrastructure renewals increased 36 per cent to Pounds 26m. A cash inflow of Pounds 10m reduced net borrowings to Pounds 130m (Pounds 140m). Mr Batty said debt was likely to rise to about Pounds 200m by the year end as Yorkshire's investment programme continued. Earnings increased 11.3 per cent to 34.4p (30.9p). The interim dividend is raised 8.5 per cent to 7.05p (6.5p). The shares gained 1p to 502p. COMMENT As with the rest of the water sector this reporting season, Yorkshire's results contained few surprises. Although recession played a small part in reducing measured water volumes, the effect on turnover in the core business was more than compensated by new commercial property connections during the period. On the enterprise side, Yorkshire's environmental business and its moves to transfer non-essential operations outside the core do look promising. But profits will remain small for some time, even though second half profits should be lifted by perhaps Pounds 1m of property profits. Full year forecasts of Pounds 135m put the shares on eight times. That is slightly ahead of the sector, but looks about right given Yorkshire's solid reputation.</p>

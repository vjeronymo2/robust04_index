			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rain Ren] </F>   [Text] Lu Ping, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau  Affairs Office, will visit the territory next month for the  first time since Chris Patten took office as Governor.    He will attend meetings of the Preliminary Working Committee  (PWC) - China's "second stove" - but will avoid any contact with  Patten and other senior Hong Kong government officials.    There was "absolutely no way" that Lu would meet the  Governor  next month "no matter how many times he has been invited by  Patten", a senior Chinese official said yesterday.    Mike Hanson, the Government's spokesman, said Patten had  recently written to Lu to again invite him to Hong Kong but had  not received a reply. "We want to go on talking on a whole  range of issues. We are happy to do so.    "Lu is directly involved in all these issues and dialogue  must be useful for the long term well-being of Hong Kong,"  Hanson said. "The Governor has made it clear many, many times  that he would be delighted to welcome Lu Ping to Hong Kong."    Lu was last in Hong Kong to bid farewell to the previous  governor, Lord Wilson. His decision to stay away is seen as a  response to the controversial political reform plans Patten  published in October, 1992. The Memorandum of Understanding  (MOU) on the new airport stipulates that Lu and Patten should  "hold regular meetings" to discuss Hong Kong affairs. Lu will  attend the PWC's government and administration and economic  sub-committee meetings from May 2-5.    A Chinese official based in Hong Kong said there were  political considerations behind the decision to hold PWC  meetings in the territory. "It shows that the Chinese  government is determined to facilitate the work of the PWC and  to make it public that the so- called second stove, or shadow  government, is working effectively," he said. Lu will be  accompanied by his two deputies, Wang Fengchao and Chen Ziying.    Lu is expected to remain in Hong Kong for another few days,  a  Chinese official said, to "gather first-hand information about  Hong Kong's sentiments" towards the PWC's work.</p>

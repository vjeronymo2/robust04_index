			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Technology: Two heads are better than one - PCs are competing for power with minicomputers The ambitions of personal computer manufacturers extend way beyond the desktop. With the introduction of powerful, low-cost 'servers', the PC is now invading the turf of minicomputers and mainframe computers, the traditional workhorses of corporate computing. Local area networks (Lans) that link PCs throughout a department or office are already commonplace, but companies such as Compaq Computer, AST Research and the newly formed IBM Personal Computer Company foresee an even broader role for networked PCs. To make the leap from a 'local' to an 'enterprise-wide' network, PCs need access to high-powered 'servers' - machines that share computing, file storage or other resources among all of the PCs linked to the network. Enter a new generation of powerful 'multi-brained' PC servers; computer-age hydras whose performance can be multiplied by the addition of extra multiprocessor chips. These multiprocessor PCs boast the power of a minicomputer at a fraction of the price. AST Research, for example, recently launched the AST Manhattan SMP, a multiprocessor system with four Intel microprocessors. To hear Graham Hopper, UK general manager of AST Europe, talk, you would think minicomputers were already extinct. 'The introduction of this class of machine, with performance and reliability levels on a par with minis, is like the minicomputer revolution of the 1970s with a difference. Whereas minis replaced mainframes, multiprocessors will replace the minicomputer,' he boasts. IBM PC is also offering high-powered multiprocessor PCs which analysts say will compete head to head with the parent company's mid-range AS/400 minicomputers. Compaq Computer, meanwhile, which pioneered the multiprocessor PC with its early SystemPro models, has this week launched a higher-performance version, designated the XL model, that can process up to 185 transactions (or information exchanges) per second, giving it higher data processing capabilities than most minis. The XL is also upgradable so that users can plug in new generations of Intel microprocessors as they become available, or add extra microprocessors to boost performance further. The appearance of these high-powered, low-cost machines represents the latest salvo in the long-fought battle between PCs and minicomputers in the office computer market. Minicomputer manufacturers have long argued that PCs - no matter how fast and powerful they became - could never replace minicomputers because they were not designed to run large-scale applications and high volumes of information processing. Old-guard supporters of minicomputers say that comparing PCs to minicomputers is like comparing the family car with a double-decker bus. You might be able to shoehorn the power of a double-decker bus engine into the engine compartment of a large car, but it would in no way be equipped to handle the job of a bus. It would not have the gearbox to properly control the engine, nor the physical capacity to take advantage of its power. Indeed, PCs that act as central data storage systems for other desktop PCs on a network - generally known as 'file servers' - have a reputation for slowing to a crawl when too many users require their services at once. PC makers now claim that the multiprocessor PC will eliminate the information bottleneck by carrying out several tasks simultaneously in its multiple brains. However, there is a catch. Whereas a wealth of software has been developed for minicomputers, there are relatively few programs designed to take full advantage of the power of multiprocessor PCs. This is because the most popular PC operating systems, MS-Dos and the Apple Macintosh operating system, were designed for use on single-processor computers. Currently Unix, and specifically a version of Unix developed by the Santa Cruz Operation, a California software developer, represents the most popular choice of operating system for multiprocessor PCs. New operating systems, such as Microsoft's planned Windows NT and IBM's new OS/2 2.0, as well as the operating system code named 'Pink' that IBM and Apple are developing jointly, will also be able to handle multiprocessing. But the real benefits of multiprocessing will not start to be felt until users have access to applications optimised for use with multiprocessor operating systems. The lack of software standards has persuaded at least one player in the PC market to steer away from multiprocessor PCs. Texas-based Dell Computer has said it will wait until there are clearer hardware, operating system and software standards before entering the field. Multiprocessor PCs are still an 'almost' technology, says Patrick Murphy, Dell vice president. 'We do not intend to introduce this kind of computer until we think there are some good standards in the market - there is no software to really run on them at the moment,' he says. WorkGroup Technologies, a market research firm based in New Hampshire, bears out Dell's view that multiprocessor PCs will find limited acceptance in the short term. The market analysts estimated that only about 65,000 multiprocessor PCs will be sold this year. The multiprocessor PC is none the less setting an important trend because it promises to enable today's PC buyers to leverage their investment by boosting the performance of PC networks in the future. For PC manufacturers, the multiprocessor PC represents an opportunity to move beyond the desktop price wars and find more profitable ground in segments of the computer market that have traditionally been beyond their reach.</p>

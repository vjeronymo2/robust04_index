			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa held talks with  new leaders of the Japan New Party [JNP], including newly  elected Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka, at a Tokyo restaurant  on the evening of 8 March. According to those present, the  prime minister stressed that he intended to proceed with his  idea of forming a unified parliamentary group among the ruling  coalition parties. He said: "Unless the ruling coalition  parties become unified, we cannot compete with the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP]."    The prime minister instructed JNP leaders to form a new  organization such as a policy study group, which would include  LDP members who were willing to act in concert with the ruling  coalition on such issues as tax system reform and deregulation.    Touching on "conditions for partnership," the prime minister  mentioned the following four points: 1) promotion of tax system  reform to prepare for an aging society; 2) maintenance of the  Uruguay Round structure; 3) implementation of deregulation and  administrative reform that produces practical results; and 4)  cooperation in coming elections. The prime minister stressed:  "We need to get together under a united aim and increase group  members."    On the current state of the ruling coalition, the prime  minister said: "Although I intend to accept the views (of  various parties), harmony within the overall coalition is  important. It would be inappropriate for one of the coalition  parties to expand."    He added: "Some LDP members have not yet made up their minds  to join Sakigake [Harbinger], Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] or  JNP. As dozens of LDP members share with the JNP a similar  sense of values, it would be best for them to join our study  group."    With the upper house election set for summer next year, and  the next general election also in mind, the prime minister said:  "Our aim is to sweep out political corruption. I intend to  achieve it." His comments restated his intention to place  emphasis on the task of dealing with political corruption  involving the general contractor scandal.    Secretary General Matsuoka, who was elected on 8 March, held  a news conference prior to the talks with Prime Minister  Hosokawa, and touched on relations with Sakigake, with which the  JNP has promised to merge. Matsuoka clarified an intention to  strengthen the cooperative relationship with the party in the  future, saying: "We would like to cooperate with Sakigake as  the core of the coalition administration."    On the prime minister's idea of forming a unified  parliamentary group, Matsuoka said: "If we are to win  elections, this is a natural idea. At present, though, is it  appropriate to discuss the possibility the coalition will be  divided into two or three groups?"    His remarks raised a question about the policies of Sakigake  and other parties, and indicated a cautious stance toward an  early merger with Sakigake.    It is also reported the prime minister did not issue any  concrete instructions on the issue of merging with Sakigake at a  general meeting of JNP lower and upper house members on the same  day. The reality is that differences between the two parties  have not been narrowed.</p>

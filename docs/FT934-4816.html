			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Training moves up political agenda The government's sudden interest in the idea of apprenticeships is not just a new vocational training wheeze. When the prime minister recently speculated about reinventing apprenticeships, after a decade in which they have almost become extinct, the response from some employers was loud and enthusiastic. This is why, despite the strict public spending climate, the money available for the training of school-leavers is expected to rise substantially over the next three years. This increase is only partly the result of falling numbers. Currently the department spends about Pounds 700m a year on Youth Training (YT), mainly in the form of subsidies to employers to take on 16-to-18-year-olds, all of whom are guaranteed a YT place. But the training offered by employers to the 210,000 YT trainees is highly variable and YT is still regarded by many employers and trainees as a way of keeping unemployment down. The apprenticeship scheme would, in effect, be a higher grade YT, subsidised with a training credit carried by the trainee. But such is the opprobrium in which YT is held that one training expert said yesterday: 'If the apprentice idea is seen as YT Mark 2 it will kill it.' The idea is that the employer and the trainee would sign an 'apprenticeship compact' setting out what each expected from the other. The compact would include targets for achieving National Vocational Qualifications level three  -the vocational equivalent of A levels - as opposed to the lower NVQ level two which YT trainees are supposed to attain. The Department of Employment is coy about saying exactly how much money will be made available for apprenticeships when it is offered to school-leavers in 1995, although it does say that the money per trainee is likely to be at least double the YT level. 'There will be a substantial increase on what YT trainees are currently getting but it also depends on how many employers are interested and how much they are ready to put up,' said one official. 'Employers are saying they want this, so we are saying: 'We'll put up if you'll put up',' the official added. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, and his officials see the apprenticeship scheme as an economic rather than an unemployment measure, designed to fill the big gap between basic YT training and academic qualifications. 'This is about increasing the number of technicians and first line supervisors with a modern apprenticeship system - not like the old time-restricted, male only, trade-union dominated apprenticeships,' says Mr Hunt. There are two main doubts about the plan. First, whether the training credit scheme, open to all school-leavers in 1995, will be a sensible way to fund it, and second, whether the government and employers can convince young people and their parents that it is a better option than staying on at school or aiming for university. The government believes it has hit on something which will attract broad political and industrial support. Since the war Britain has lagged behind countries such as Germany in high-skill vocational qualifications. But in the 1980s the number of apprenticeships slumped as the government abolished most of the industry training boards. Britain currently has about 250,000 people who classify themselves as undergoing an apprenticeship, compared with about 2m in Germany.</p>

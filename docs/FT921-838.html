			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / The Property Market: Little cause for cheer Total returns for all properties in February fell to zero, according to the Investment Property Databank, an independent research company. 'Yields were held at their January levels, but the downward pressure on rents is percolating directly through to capital values,' it said. Rents dropped by a full percentage point during the month and capital values fell by 0.7 per cent. The total return and capital growth rates for the year moved up, but at a slowing rate, while rental values continued to fall. The year-on-year total return is 0.9 per cent, while capital growth improved marginally from -6.9 per cent for the year to January to -6.6 per cent for the year to February. In February, retail property outperformed the industrial sector with a total return of 0.5 per cent compared to 0.1 per cent. However the year-on-year results confirmed industrial property as the highest performing sector, with a total return of 8.3 per cent for the year to February. The office sector is experiencing short-term volatility. Last month's optimistic signs gave way to a 2.1 per cent fall in rental values, the greatest monthly drop for more than a year, and a 1.3 per cent fall in capital growth. Capital growth for the year remained relatively stable at  13.8 per cent, while total returns showed some improvement. and yields were unchanged at 9.9 per cent.  ------------------------------------------------------------------                      IPD MONTHLY INDEX  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Monthly change (index based at Dec 1986=100)                      Feb 1992   Jan 1992   Change IPD                    167.15    167.13    0.02 Retail                 151.18    150.44    0.74 Office                 163.53    164.49   -0.96 Industrial             232.14    231.87    0.27  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

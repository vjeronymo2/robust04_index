Many of the revisions are simply intended to clarify current Corporation policy or to interrelate this part to other LSC regulations. However, a number of the revisions represent changes in Corporation policy or interpretations with respect to issues that arise under the regulation. The final rule also includes a number of technical revisions to make the rule easier to understand and apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  January 18, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Victor M.

At the meeting in Atlanta, the Committee approved a draft, which was published as a proposed rule for public comment at 59 FR 30885 (June 16, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Twenty-two written comments were received and reviewed by the Corporation. The comments generally applauded the proposed revisions, but there were some areas of disagreement and several suggestions for changes. On September 16 and 30, 1994, the Committee held public meetings to consider the written and oral comments on the proposed rule. Based on those comments, the Committee made several revisions. The Committee met again on October 27, 1994, and voted to recommend a final rule for adoption by the full Board. On November 5, 1994, the Board voted to adopt the rule as recommended by the Committee for publication as a final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation recognizes that legislation to amend the Legal Services Corporation Act and reauthorize appropriations for the Corporation may be considered by Congress. If such legislation does become law, the Corporation's regulations will be revisited and revised accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to amending 45 CFR part 1607, this rule is also intended to supersede part 1607's interpretive guideline published at 48 FR 36820 (August 15, 1983).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The entire rule, as revised, is published for clarity and ease of use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1607.2&blank;Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most of the changes in this section are technical and clarifying in nature. The section has been reordered to put the definitions in alphabetical order. Also, definitions found in other parts of the regulations but applicable to this part are included here for easier reference. In addition, language found in other sections of this part that, in fact, constitute definitions of terms are included here both for easier reference and to treat similar terms similarly. A new definition was added and some of the language has been clarified to make it consistent with past and current LSC interpretations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1607.2(a) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the definition of ``attorney member'' applies to attorneys who serve on any recipient board subject to this part, it was added primarily to make it clear that board members of a national support center do not have to be admitted to practice in a state where the center actually provides legal assistance. Because the ``service area'' of national support centers is the entire nation, an attorney board member need be admitted to practice in only one of the 50 states.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment suggested that law professors who teach within a recipient's service area, but who are not members of the bar in the recipient's service area, should be allowed to serve as an ``attorney member'' on the recipient's board. Statutory requirements for recipient boards do not allow this option. However, such law professors may serve pursuant to &sect;1607.3(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1607.2(c) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of ``eligible client member'' has been revised from the current definition. First, the language has been changed to make it clear that client board members must be eligible at the time of their appointment to each term of office. Thus, a client member who is financially eligible for services when first appointed to a recipient's board may not be reappointed to a second or subsequent term if, at the time of reappointment, the client board member is no longer financially eligible for LSC-funded services. However, nothing in the rule would require a client board member to resign during the course of a term if the client became ineligible subsequent to appointment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some comments suggested a further change to the definition to clarify that eligibility is based on financial eligibility, so that individuals who would be financially eligible to receive legal assistance, but who could not be served by the recipient because of some other restriction on types of legal assistance or program priorities, could serve on recipient boards. The Board agreed and revised the language to clarify that a member need only be financially eligible pursuant to the requirements of LSC's financial eligibility guidelines, set out in 45 CFR part 1611, to qualify for board membership.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Language has also been adopted for this definition to clarify, in response to concerns raised in comments, that it is the national rather than the local financial eligibility standard that is applicable. As long as a person would qualify for services under Part 1611, the person would qualify for board membership, regardless of whether the recipient has a lower financial eligibility threshold or regardless of whether the person would also qualify for other services provided by the recipient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some comments suggested that the definition should be expanded to include individuals who are eligible for non-LSC-funded but not LSC-funded services provided by the recipient. One such comment suggested the adoption of a proportionality requirement, so that clients who are eligible for non-LSC-funded services, but not LSC-funded services, could serve in proportion to the amount of overall funding from the non-LSC source. Several comments argued that it is more important that client representatives be effective advocates for clients than that they be financially eligible for LSC-funded services. Two comments suggested substantially different and more expansive definitions of eligibility for client board membership. After consideration of these proposals, the Board decided not to expand the definition because it wished to insure that the focus of the legal services program remains on the indigent population. The Board believes that eligible client members are supposed to bring to the recipient a perspective of the community's needs, and that can best be done by someone who is financially eligible for the recipient's LSC-funded services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The last major change to the definition is intended to clarify that it is the recipient that should decide how client board member eligibility is determined, i.e., the recipient should decide whether it or a particular group should make the determination. Thus, the recipient could decide that, for some groups, the recipient will make the determination and for others it will leave the determination up to the appointing group. Two comments opposed the language that permits client eligibility determinations to be made by the appointing groups, rather than the recipient, arguing that the determination should not be delegated. No changes were made to the proposal, however, because it does not require that the recipient delegate the decision; it merely gives the recipient the choice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1607.2(d) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule defined ``governing body'' so that it would have applied both to the governing bodies of recipients who have as a primary purpose the provision of legal assistance to eligible clients and to the policy boards or bodies established pursuant to the waiver provision in &sect;1607.6(d). However, in response to comments on the proposed definition, the Board narrowed the definition so that it does not apply to the policy boards or bodies referred to in &sect;1607.6(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There was a concern expressed in a comment as to whether a body that does not have full authority to make all ``governing'' policy and administrative decisions for the LSC-funded project would fall within the rule's definition of ``governing body.'' For example, one LSC recipient that receives very little of its funding from LSC has set up a ``policy board'' to oversee the LSC grant separate from its Board of Directors, which oversees all of its other activities. However, the policy board does not have all the authority envisioned by this rule in the definition of ``governing body'' and in &sect;1607.4, which deals with the functions of governing bodies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response, the Board decided to define ``governing body'' so that it does not apply to the policy boards or bodies referred to in &sect;1607.6(d) and to make it clear that a governing body should have full authority over LSC grants as envisioned in this rule. However, in certain special circumstances that are discussed at length in this commentary on &sect;1607.6 on waivers, the President has the authority to grant waivers on board composition requirements. As a condition of granting such a waiver, a recipient would be required to establish a special policy board or body, rather than a governing board or body, to oversee the grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1607.2(e) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A definition of ``policy body'' is added to this section to distinguish such a body from a governing body. As discussed above under the definition of ``governing body,'' a policy body would be established pursuant to the waiver provision in &sect;1607.6(d) for grantees seeking a waiver of any of the requirements imposed upon governing bodies by &sect;1607.3. However, a policy body would be required to conform to the membership and appointment requirements of &sect;1607.3, as well as the meeting requirements and compensation restriction in &sect;&sect;1607.4 and 1607.5, respectively, and would be required to have full authority to set policy for the services and activities funded under the LSC grant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1607.2(f) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This definition of ``recipient'' appears in 45 CFR part 1600, but is repeated here as an aid in interpreting this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1607.3&blank;Composition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1607.3(a) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section is revised to require in paragraph (a) that all board members must be supportive of the purposes of the LSC Act, and must be interested in and knowledgeable about the delivery of quality legal services to the poor. The current regulation does not include any similar requirement for client board members, but does include similar, although not identical, requirements for attorney and other board members. The rule removes the reference to the board's reflecting ``the characteristics'' of the client community, in part because it is not clear what that language means and in part because it could be construed to be inconsistent with diversity requirements that are included in this section for each category of board membership.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>
